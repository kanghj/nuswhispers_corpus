To  how in the world is being asexual attractive? You also don't have to give in to sexual gratification if you feel so much like shit afterwards. Have more self-discipline, duh. I say this in the capacity of a virgin, single and waiting for someone worth my experience. 

There is so much experience to be had with regard to courtship/ marriage/ sexual experiences/ emotional episodes and these add colour to life. Where possible, people marry for love and raise kids together consequently. I don't plan to have kids but marriage still remains a worthwhile cause. 

As a realist, I don't live my life for society at large; I seek personal meaning and if this coincidentally brings value to society then all the better. Betterment of society is too vague a term and is culturally sensitive, making it an almost pointless altruistic aim. Many of the things people genuinely thrive on/ seek/ treasure are intangible and are not tagged with an economic value anyway. There's no need for society to have 'asexual, productive human beings who work tirelessly'.

I came across your post and can't help but share the following article
http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1598-6-lessons-i-learned-losing-my-virginity-to-prostitute.html

Basically the gist of it is: lots of famous people did the same thing. It's a ... kind of tradition that has been passed down for generations. Napoleon (the conqueror of Europe and let's invade Russia) lost his to a pros he found near the Lourve. Tolstoy (War and Peace author) stood by the bed and wept after it's done. Mussolini (Italy fascist dictator and Hitler's friend) lost his by hiring "an elderly woman who spilled out lard from all parts of her body." Oliver Stone's dad booked his son's first woman, leading him to say, "My father was a generous man, and I love him to this day for it." Bryan "Walter what's-my-name White" Cranston lost his at 16 while on a trip to the Netherlands.

Just because it's a tradition does not mean that it's good (or bad). But ler's say that if the experience was so dark for Tolstoy to cry afterwards, it's just too fucking dark for a 15 years old. 

But the bigger question is: how famous you need to be to write it in your memoirs and not get ridiculed for it.

@ Nice Guy (also known as Nice Guy™ or the Nice Guy Syndrome) is a pejorative term referring to a social stereotype commonly associated with young adult males who view themselves as caring and emphatic gentlemen in courtship to increase their potential towards women. Not to be confused with males who are nice in general, Nice Guys have been criticized on the internet by both males and females alike for being hypocrites or even misogynists potentially being driven by an ulterior motive, mainly in anticipation of a relationship or sexual favors in return, and are often mocked as the first citizens of the friend zone.

While on my way to school, I suddenly had this thought: "will you..or anyone, miss me if I die?"..

I felt like people in today's society usually seldom express their love and gratitude towards others. For some, it's to protect themselves from being used/getting hurt, for some, they dare not speak for not wanting to look fragile, or because of face-value and such. 

I think, that, no matter what, we should learn how to show someone our love, and actually put in the effort to do it. I think people would really appreciate it.

I am a female NUS student. My boyfriend was from a polytechnic, and is currently serving NS. We're in a serious relationship, and I do have strong hopes that this relationship will continue onto engagement and marriage. Of course, every relationship has their problems. At first I didn't think too much about the educational difference (his GPA isn't good enough to get into the 3 local unis); I genuinely have strong feelings for him and to me, that's enough to start a relationship, however as our relationship progresses the topic about education does come up quite often. He isn't a very driven person, and never had much interest in studies. Although he knows that having a degree is extremely important in the current local society, he also knows that he probably will not have the motivation to last 4 years in a tertiary institution that entails having to compete with way more driven and intellectually inclined people, and hence doesn't want to waste time, money and effort.

Recently I confided in him about what I felt about this whole thing. I'm not a person who insists on my ideas and forces them on others, so I tend to always be easy-going and understanding with regards to various situations. That's why I won't force him to go to uni, it's entirely his decision. However, what I felt was that I don't get a sense of security from him. I'm not a materialistic person but I want to at least live comfortably in future, without having to worry too much about finances. I'm not saying that a poly diploma won't be able to get you far in life nor am I looking down on or demeaning poly students but I'm just saying that I want both my future husband and me to be able to contribute to the finances equally and comfortably.

Another problem which related to the above has to do with communication. He grew up in a dialect-speaking family and was in the NA stream. As a result, he does not speak english as fluently as I do, and because of that, I often have to rephrase my sentences into simpler forms for him to fully grasp what I'm trying to bring across, and this may seem like a minute issue, but sometimes it is these fundamental differences that end up being a time bomb kept in a corner, and I don't want these issues to end up being the brunt of future arguments. Sometimes when he comes to NUS to find me, it comes as a shock to him that everyone is deep in their notes, mugging their time away. It does not come as a given to him that it is a must to mug. And that shocked me, for I have grown up all my life knowing that no matter how much I hated studying, when it is time to study, I will.

We are able to communicate our 3am thoughts fluently. What bothers me is that the fundamental differences between us - the way we were educated, the environment we grew up in, and our priorities - which temporarily doesn't seem that big of a problem, but these might end up being the reason why we aren't able to hold this together. I don't want to give up on this because he's one person whom I feel really strongly towards, and I'm convinced I won't find someone whom I can have such strong mutual feelings and mutual importance in our lives. Help?

To  Insulting the original post as 'stupid' does not make yours any cleverer or helpful for that matter ;) Judging people usually entails some condescension no matter how you try to be nice or sugarcoat it; the least I have done is not to go round correcting people in real life, making them feel uncomfortable around me. The original post is meant to highlight common errors and air my grievances, and it's up to your interpretation and tolerance not to be offended by it.  

The ridiculous comments on the original post do nothing to 'calm [my] tits'. In fact, they flounced a bit more, much to some people's sick pleasure. (Thank you everyone else who concurs with me xo) Saying how bigger problems lie with other languages is irrelevant because it's a skewed comparison to begin with. Most Singaporeans I know have half-baked language skills. If you spend at least 10 years learning languages but achieve no real mastery in at least either one, you have done yourself a great injustice. 

While language is the basis for communication as many have pointed out, the standards set for Singapore or yourself should have long begun to supersede merely being able to bring your point across. If people continually pitch (and pride) themselves at the level where they're happy that there is no breakdown in communication, there will be no continual progression or sophistication of thought. That's fine if you are satisfied where you are, but I am also sure that people lose credibility when trying to convey great ideas but negate their brilliance by lacking the appropriate language capacity to express themselves.

I am not talking about the occasional lapses but rather, the consistent jarring errors I witness. Good standard English is a narrow continuum on the scale of language mastery. You don't have to have a ridiculous accent nor swing to the other end of the spectrum to have 'prim and proper' Queen's English. In informal situations, you're also free to use 'And' to begin your sentences if you so wish. I do that myself and I don't cringe ;) 

Point is, capable people don't make excuses for themselves when it comes to poor language skills. Step up to the challenge. Make good English the norm not the exception.

 I am sick and tired of people using abstract words to describe the value of education. It's all bullshit. "Developing your mind", "Broad education", "It's about how to apply the thinking". This is what I learned after 4 years. There are no concrete substance behind what they say. They are just repeating the cliches.

Just wondering, does having 2 years of military experience mean anything, be it job interview or what? Is it worth mentioning, maybe not locally, but in other countries, telling ppl you have 2 yrs of military experiences?

I would like to revive the debate on compulsory female conscription for National Service (NS) in Singapore. There have been many arguments for and against this. Two popular argument opponents put forth is the alleged economic disruption (although there is no thorough research on the extent of the disruption) Singapore would incur, and the physiological differences between males and females that make it "unsuitable" for females to serve in physical roles (but which can be solved by implementing something similar to the PES system and by opening up more vocations that are not so physically demanding). Also, the 'women are serving the nation by giving birth' is such a horrendously sexist non-starter, and shan't be dwelt upon. On the other hand, proponents argue that conscripting females will be a necessity (to maintain a strong military to protect vulnerable Singapore’s security interests in a volatile region, as per the government’s narrative) in the near future given the very low birth rates.

Many of these arguments are meritorious, but debatable. In deciding whether to implement female conscription, the discussion should not just be focused on pragmatic concerns. What I am about to say is not new, but drives at the heart of how NS is framed and conceptualised. 

National Service is a fundamental institution of nation building. It is a cornerstone of the Singaporean identity, by providing a common experience that bridges diversity and forges camaraderie. Strong bonds are forged through sweat and blood - it’s not surprising to see many sons of Singapore calling their fellow brethren-in-arms their best buddies even after shedding the uniform.  

Such is the significance of National Service in the construction of our society’s fabric. In fact, by including females in National Service, there will be more opportunities for interaction between both sexes. Gone will be the days when groups of male friends meet and reminisce about their NS days while their girlfriends-in-tow zone out completely and drool over pixels of Song Joong Ki in his military fatigues. 

At the end of the day, we need to ask ourselves this very fundamental question: How can National Service be an institution of nation-building when only half the population is involved? And, should female conscription be implemented, why should it “not (also be) for reasons of equity” as per Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s response in a dialogue session in early 2015? Singaporeans, regardless of gender, have an equal stake in this home and there is no reason that one gender gets to enjoy the advantages of a safe and secure home without having to play their part.

This is written in 18th century. Still relevant to today's education.

Professors like to throw concepts into students' heads. This is not the way to teach.

"To acquire a knowledge of the world might be defined as the aim of all education; and it follows from what I have said that special stress should be laid upon beginning to acquire this knowledge at the right end . As I have shown, this means, in the main, that the particular observation of a thing shall precede the general idea of it; further, that narrow and circumscribed ideas shall come before ideas of a wide range. It means, therefore, that the whole system of education shall follow in the steps that must have been taken by the ideas themselves in the course of their formation. 

But whenever any of these steps are skipped or left out, the instruction is defective, and the ideas obtained are false; and finally, a distorted view of the world arises, peculiar to the individual himself — a view such as almost everyone entertains for some time, and most men for as long as they live. No one can look into his own mind without seeing that it was only after reaching a very mature age, and in some cases when he least expected it, that he came to a right understanding or a clear view of many matters in his life, that, after all, were not very difficult or complicated. 

Up till then, they were points in his knowledge of the world which were still obscure, due to his having skipped some particular lesson in those early days of his education, whatever it may have been like — whether artificial and conventional, or of that natural kind which is based upon individual experience. It follows that an attempt should be made to find out the strictly natural course of knowledge, so that education may proceed methodically by keeping to it; and that children may become acquainted with the ways of the world, without getting wrong ideas into their heads, which very often cannot be got out again. 

If this plan were adopted, special care would have to be taken to prevent children from using words without clearly understanding their meaning and application. The fatal tendency to be satisfied with words instead of trying to understand things — to learn phrases by heart, so that they may prove a refuge in time of need, exists, as a rule, even in children; and the tendency lasts on into manhood, making the knowledge of many learned persons to consist in mere verbiage."

Dun understand why some people would bitch or scold characters that aren't real. like in a tv show, story or movie. Some even go ask far as hurling vulgarities at these non-existents. Here I am just thinking about how the character is crafted or how it is nice that they act as a foil (lit term, google it) to other characters such that both of them shine in the story. 
Am I the abnormal one? Matter of perception? Or I am simply not TOO into the fictional world

If I were to have a superpower, I want to be invisible and be able to pass through walls. So I can eavesdrop on everything that anyone says, catalogue it all into my brain and keep it for future usage for/against them. I guess I've always liked the feeling of being the fly on the wall. Taking in everything, silently remembering them, feeling the icy flow of power surge through my veins as I gain knowledge of things that aren't supposed to be privy to me. 

To know your enemy is to win the battle before it is fought. To be able to keep tabs on everybody means you won't get surprised or blindsided. I guess this is my control freak side talking. Even if I can't control everybody to like me, at least I have the absolute knowledge of who likes me and who hates me, and act on those information accordingly. 

I guess I like the idea of spying too damn much. Knowledge is power, and such power lends life to a man's being in ways nothing else can compare.

 Honestly, the way you write is a little presumptuous. Addressing number 1, you speak as though women were objectified and position yourself as superior. So you're implying that as YOU age, you become more desirable and in your terms, 'richer', while in very practical terms these women depreciate in value. If this attitude is ever apparent in reality, trust me to say any woman will be very put off at your level of disrespect and the way you somehow think of yourself as superior to them. Addressing number 3, in your words 'Just look pleasant and take care of your appearances. If you're overweight, lose weight.' I don't think what you've said actually made a point in response to 17947. Your words already reflect the superficiality in your judging of females and I'm pretty sure that was the point most people try to get across. People are not saying males go for supermodel looks, they're saying that males are superficial to some extent. Whatever you said really just proves that you can't go beyond skin deep. And guys here say that females are the one being superficial and materialistic. Have you reflected upon yourself what you are looking for? Some OPs lament that girls only look for "buff" guys, think again, is it simply because you have only been looking at a certain type of girls? Such double standards in the way guys think, on one hand saying Singaporean girls are superficial but on the other hand being so god damn superficial themselves.
-
 
 So it's ok to have preference with regards to skin tone but not with regards to facial features etc...?

What's 'discriminatory' (but not racist) w.r.t. race is not dating someone whom you find attractive after you find out their race.

IMHO, preferences for dating cannot be racist, as dating is private choice regarding one's personal life.

To the guy who has been replying long comments to the confessions to prove his point: Just sit back, relax. There's no point in trying to reinstate your points when your opponents are simply hiding behind the anonymous screen and not responding to your views at all. Yes, the irony is that I'm hiding behind NUSWhispers as well, but I am damn sure that I am not mocking an individual for his typing habits and his seriousness in replying to confessions. From a debate about the need to defame a professor based on his accent to flaming someone for his replies - I feel like I'm watching a 100 episode Korean soap drama. 

Anyway, my view on the topic: OP, you should try to refer to textbooks and your lecture notes instead. I have had lecturers with thick accents (China, Taiwan, India, and European countries). My lecture group complains about it during our year 1 & 2, pretty normal, but we have never blamed the lecturer for not adapting to our local accent. We either ask the lecturer again after class, via email, or just discuss with friends. Whining online and demanding that your school fees are gone to waste won't change anything. If you were to work with your boss, who has a thick accent, are you going to demand to the HR to change your boss because you cannot understand his instructions? If you pay TV tax for TV channels with languages you cannot understand, are you going to blame the government for wasting your money? 

PS: Can the admins of NUSWhispers please learn to differentiate between troll posts that are out to spark hatred and those that are meant to be hilarious? Also, it would be good to immediately filter out posts that singles out an individual and flames her/ him. This is already not the first incident. There were previous incidences where frequent commenters, or even those can be identified easily in their own faculty, had rumours spread about them on this very platform. Thank you.

to 

I'm a Singaporean Chinese guy and personally am attracted to girls of many other races, so here are my thoughts on differentiating between racism and physical preferences. I believe there is a thin but clear line between the two. There are people who think they simply have physical preferences but are in fact racist, and there are people accused of being racist by the PC brigade when they simply have physical preferences.

To use the OP of 's example: you say you don't appreciate darker skin tones, that's fine. But when presented with a Chinese person of a darker skin tone than a particularly fair-skinned Malay or Indian person, it would be hypocritical to still find the Chinese person more attractive. That would be a racial preference, when you lump every individual of a certain "race" (an arbitrary social construct) into a basket that you won't touch, no matter how similar they are with other people within your "acceptable" race preferences. So  OP, if you would find a fair-skinned Malay or Indian person more attractive than a super tanned Chinese person, then you are not being racist in saying you don't appreciate darker skin tones in a partner.

Having physical preferences for dating that happen to overlap across race is fine. (e.g. I like Ang Moh guys they're so tall, but a tall Chinese/Malay/Indian guy is equally attractive) It is only when those preferences are masking racial preferences and racist ideas of people's appearance and inner personality (e.g. "I hate Chinese guys they're all slit-eyed and unromantic") that the person can be said to be racist. This video below was the most reasonable one I've found on the matter.

IE2150 for Dummies

Human Factors Engineering – the art and science encapsulating ever so mystically the very soul of design. Mastering the craft, however, can at times feel like an insurmountable feat, especially when one is endlessly exasperated by the indecipherably sparse notes that seem to convey more anguish than knowledge in the face of upcoming examinations. Such brevity, only surpassed by the sheer ambiguity of questions in the midterms and finals, can certainly instill paralyzing terror into the many brave souls who have attempted to ace the module. But all hope is not lost. Worship this guide as you would an unshakable faith; internalize its teachings as you proceed this arduous journey; and perhaps someday you will live to tell the tale of HFE as a conqueror and not a victim.

Draw from the void to fill your mind. As common sense organized into structured knowledge, HFE can be thought of as an extension of the human imagination as far as it goes into the void of nothingness. Here, common sense dictates, allowing you to derive that which you cannot remember. What makes a good display? One might ask. And the lord of common sense would easily summon to mind the intuitive concepts of good lighting, good positioning, good readability, good arrangement, and a dozen other characteristics – all of which constitute perfectly accurate HFE responses to the question posed. Knowledge resides in the lecture. It resides in the tutorials, the labs, the notes, and the textbooks. But all of it began in the emptiness of the human mind. So exercise your common sense and draw from the void. It is the route to success.

Write, as it your life depends on it. Write once you get the paper; write once you set eyes on the question, and keep writing until time is up. Write before you think; think as you write; and write yet even more after thinking. Write between the lines, write beyond the lines, and be constrained not by space, but by time. Half the battle is lost should you ever have to pause, as time ticks by incessantly, and one second of not writing is one point less from your script. Yet writing is just as much an attitude as it is a skill requiring assiduous preparation. Practice speed-writing so you can churn out at least thirty words a minute. Improve your stamina so you can last two hours without wrist aches. And memorize enough content on the topics to be writing forever. He who gets the A is he who can write straight for two hours.

Pray to the Bell Curve God. All modules are enigmatic. But some are more enigmatic than others. It is in HFE, where every aspect ranging from the scope of the syllabus to the grading of the script is enigmatic, that this omnipotent being governing all existences in NUS exerts its greatest influence, for better or for worse. Do what you must – understand well, study hard, and revise early, but know that it is ultimately serendipity that determines your final grade – whether you misunderstood a concept, whether you overlooked a page, or whether the professor deems your response worthy. So pray for luck, pray for mercy, and pray, if for nothing else, for the peace of mind. Ask and it will be given; seek and you shall find. 

Finally, learn the Tao. It comes in many forms, as the Tao of Programming, the Tao of Physics, and naturally, also the Tao of Ergonomics. All who have excelled in ergonomics and risen by grit and inspiration to professorship would have mastered the Tao. You too, can do the same. Remember, young one, that the Tao that can be completely explained or expressed in words is not the constant, eternally unchanging and true Tao. You have been guided, but you cannot be taught. Close your eyes; feel it coursing through your veins as you inhale gently; and visualize it condensing in the palm of your hand as you lift your pen in the examination hall.

May the Tao be with you.

It's not just 
1) wah si liao gina si liao
2) si liao you break rules throw so many zhadan see la smoke until die

there's also
3) eh you got throw so many before quite a few times nothing happen ah
4) but still got people die and break rule leh
5) ok ok punish you but give you a bit chance, see la rules not meant to play play with leh

Also, courts are not black-white in the sense that - oh this rule was broken therefore you are wrong. Real life isnt economics where you can ceteris paribus. Women's charter says that divorce must pay maintenance fees? but wife is damn rich and husband damn poor, some more she cheated on him. OK lets not follow rules and dont award maintenance fees.

What some of us are trying to say is, how are you so damned sure what is right and wrong? morality isn't  absolute, despite you feeling that it is. Unfortunately, for us to go against your view, it may seem like we're going for "absolve the officers of all blame" kind of stand. Realistically, most of us are sitting around the middle to some degree, because we know that its a complex issue and there's no "absolute justice" penalty to mete out , and regardless, you will have people deeming it too lenient / too serious. 

And dont think everyone agrees with you just because social media is aplomb with OMG SO SAD FAK PAPPIE FAK GOVT I EDMW WE STRONG. The only reason is because it's a shitty echo chamber of people who (this is personal experience, qualified opinion) mostly happen to be the kind that spew politically charged statuses and comments. Remember 30-70 despite the whole storm of people who are so against the govt?

just saying that you dont seem to consider the context, and sticking rigorously to TSR VIOLATE LETS KAN THE GUYS THAT DID THIS. 

also, not saying that it's right to break rules. I'm saying it's sometimes normal for people to lapse into rule breaking, esp when there is no apparent consequence for doing so, simply for convenience. Jaywalking would be a very common example

Yours Sincerely,
#lelkekwew

Replying to the person who wrote 

Well said. I think you deserved to crowned for making so many 'wonderful' statements.

You spoke as though breaking TSR is not a big deal just because the handful of people you mentioned are breaking it. 

Do you have evidence to substantiate that everyone in SAF violates the TSR? If no, please retract whatever you have just said. 

You provided examples of TSR being broken and those are petty offences. Have you seen other more serious offences? I don't think so isn't it? This is because none of them will risk their lives nor to risk their future over those serious breaches. 

Where is your moral courage? Just because someone breaks the rules and therefore you think that the same set of rules could be broken by the rest as well, then I am disappointed to hear that. 

I am in no position to question the judgement handled down from the courts. I do not wish to comment about it. However, your moral values and your integrity has no relation to the TSR, or the ruling. You are supposed to behave morally right, regardless of whether there is a TSR or not in the first place. 

We have no choice when it comes to serving NS, but we have a choice if we want to be individuals with the right values. 

You can bash me for what I have just said, but you can never bash away the fact that the obligation to be morally right has nothing got to do with whether there are rules or not. Period.

Maybe I should have made it clearer that I'm speaking from *experience* i.e. I used to be like you, maybe still am. For the sharing part, I meant that you automatically include that person in your daily activities (if possible), your thoughts, your feelings etc, not a verbal account of what you consciously choose to let that person know. Or am I getting this wrong again?

Actually now I think about it can you maybe try to qualify what do you think is 'natural' vs 'over reliant'? What I was saying that your dependency will eventually reach 'natural' levels after you experience this kind of thing over and over again.

[I spent my life learning to feel less. Every day I felt less. Is that growing old? Or is it something worse? You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.”] -Jonathan Safran Foer

Have no clue why you're so outraged regarding my attitude (which isn't dismissal BTW) towards introversion. Basically I dislike other labels too (e.g. Nerds, Gays, etc) cause I think they very much limit one's/others' understanding about an individual. Why let a stereotype define yourself? Of course you won't let yourself be entirely contained by that, but it sets a limiter somehow, or at least that's how I feel, ok?
-
 
*Just my personal opinion & experience*
If my assumptions are right, since you say that you're introverted (whatever the hell that means;pet peeve) and get attached easily, chances are you're treating each and every relationship very seriously, and so you open up yourself (and therefore the quick emotional attachment) and bring that person into your life. It's basically very similar to a kid making his/her first friends. So the dependency is natural. 
There isn't anything good or bad about this; just happens to be that way. There will come a point at which there are enough people to 'hurt' you so that you stop being so quick to share your world with another. Of course if there isn't it's a blessing.
P.S. I don't think calling guys creepy and gross is any good way to ask for help

 Ask yourself..
Can a man/woman from a lower-class family be friends with a man/woman from a upper-class family?
Can a man/woman from a lower-class family be in a romantic relationship with a man/woman from a upper-class family?

From a third-party standpoint or objectively speaking, there isn't anything wrong. Both parties are willing. So what's wrong? What's wrong is you feeling the way you do when you ought not to, at least when speaking of whether or not the relationship is in some sense problematic. Fix that along with any other insecurities you have if any. If feelings are not one-sided, fixing that together will always produce better results. You just need to be COOPERATIVE.

In relation to whether you know or do not know whether or not the guy or girl at the other end really knows what he or she wants, the answer may/can be already very clear but you just don't see it because of the previous issue or issues mentioned above. If those are not solved, the other party can do the craziest things in the world but you'll never be convinced.

Girls, learn to be patient if you don't want to age fast.  "NUS researchers have found that young impatient Chinese women exhibit signs of more rapid ageing at the cellular level, the first study to link a determinant of decision-making to shortening of telomere length — a predictor of mortality and ageing-related diseases. The findings were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) on 22 February."

For school projects and other academic work, I don't see how sexual orientation is going to affect your ability to contribute. How are they going to know you're gay if you don't tell them anyways? You don't know them well enough to need to tell them anything personal.

Then came the the equality movement. Meritocracy's broken, they said. We don't start off from the same line. The government backpedaled after 2007, trying to convince us that every school is a good school.

But now the winds have reversed again. We now celebrate inequality unreservedly. The world's inherently broken, what can we do but laugh? If you still can't make it today, you are likely not good enough to warrant the effort to further level the playing field.

 Hi OP. I must say, I'm very similar to you in many respects, except I think I'm a nice guy :p I was totally like you a few years back. I think we have a very strong sense of self-identity, of character, of confidence in who were are as persons. In some respect, more mature as well. We value close and deep bonds a lot more than otherwise. This makes us kind of different in comparison to the majority of our peers. Here's my take on your issue as someone who has been through orientations and more in my freshmen year.

What do you think of a person like me? Am I abnormal?
- Depends on what you take to be the norm.

I want to change, but how?
- A: Do you really want to? I would think there are some parts of you that you really like about yourself and hence, you have such a strong sense of self-identity today. And you might also think being yourself is highly important. I might be mistaken though. Back then, I did want to TRY to fit in. But not at the expense of losing myself.
- B: If I'm mistaken and you really want to change yourself, constant conscious effort will work. Think about "correcting" habits. They all take constant conscious effort. Depending on the thing that you wish to alter, it might take a very strong will. And the latter can be strengthened bit by bit over time if you're interested although others might perceive it as self-abuse. 

Should I really join such introduction/orientation camps? Would it really change me?
- A: I'm guessing joining would be worthwhile to you given the low opportunity costs. For me, it's was more of an experience. Given what I've said above, I don't think it will change you. I thought it was worthwhile and it didn't change me.
- B: If you really want to change yourself, constant conscious effort also includes putting yourself in the "correct" environment. It will definitely change you but the extent of which is controversial. You can't think of the individual as a sponge that just absorbs whatever is in the environment. It's a two-way process between the individual and his or her environment. How much you change in the environment also depends on how much you are willing to be changed.

And if it doesn't, I would have wasted money, time and effort, all over again.
- Think about what I've said, what you value and so on and do a cost-benefit analysis.

Good luck. :)

to  from 

first, don't invalidate your own problems! people seem to like to pick on those who actually have the guts to talk about their own issues, and regardless of how seriously some (mis)interpret the saying, "every family has their own set of problems", you're doing your best at the moment dealing with yours. for a private issue like this you're also doing your best to get advice and not simply dish out dirt and complain about it; don't sweat things alright? 

secondly, on the abuse part. haha, that was really something. well, BPD is apparently a predisposed trait, and it surfaces when certain circumstances in one's life is present. that being said, the word "abuse" should be taken lightly. i would think psychologists use the term with an umbrella effect intended, in order to encapsulate cases including rape, family violence, trauma in general (pardon me for i may be wrong). perhaps they're trying to avoid lessening the significance of any event in the history of a person with BPD, rather than accrediting to their history less significance than it might deserve. but think of it this way: for a person with a bad ankle, a easy 2.4km jog can have devastating effects on them. the bad ankle is their predisposition, and the 2.4km easy jog is the family/friends environment is the certain disposition that works against the person with the bad ankle. hope this analogy helps. but unfortunately for you, or anyone for that matter, spotting someone with the symptoms of BPD isn't at all the same as identifying someone prone to a sport injury. BPD is a real secluded trait! no one expects or should be held against not being able to identify it. it's not realistic, unless you're a trained professional. 

lastly, all this being said and taking into account how BPD is affected both by genetics and one's environment, you can do something to help. don't beat yourself up about being in the sidelines, cause any other person's point of view (a.k.a. like me) you're already being extra observant and concerned over your family members. if anything, it was (note the past tense) being in the sidelines that enabled you to detect all these details. and yeah, you're right about it being a long process and perhaps even then, things may never get better. but hey, that's you worrying about a future that you have no control over! you still have control to change things and decide what it is you want. things are probably going to be scary and uncertain, but rather than fearing a process that you haven't begun on, use your energy to be in the process that eventually will pay off. the word eventually is good, you do realize that right? it kinda implies that the thing you hope for/working towards, will happen. like what  said, understanding would play a big role, along with freedom and also control. sounds like a balancing game doesn't it! it is. maybe you could try this out: understand their needs and come up with a few solutions that you think both of you can work with; this sets reasonable boundaries for the person with BPD to act within. to a certain extent, you have to lay out for them what you will and will not tolerate. yeah, they may act out, but they really need this sort of expectation imposed on them. allow them the freedom to choose/negotiate on these boundaries, and the freedom to act within them. all in all, it'll help them, to a certain extent, in restructuring their lives in a more constructive manner where they'll still have control over their own actions. 

i sincerely hope what i have to say helps. i'm just a kid too but because no one really talks about BPD and i have some knowledge on it, i thought i'd speak up and offer reasonable advice on my part. 

p/s: you're not a terrible person. you're simply being a person.

Just some tidbits about inter-service rivalry. Anyways, the land forces, the Army is usually the most incompetent in peace time. The reason is: first, the Navy and Airforce usually get higher priority for funding and recruitment. It's because they have more complex and more expensive equipment. Can't let the dunces fuck up a 150 million dollars aircraft, can we. Second, airmen and sailors are buried for their mistakes. Mistakes in the air or at sea are painfully obvious and the incompetents wash out very readily. In the land forces, partially due to it large size, people don't want to shake it up, or stir it up. As a result, greater level of incompetency is in the Army compared to the rest.

Ways to mitigate it include: having a good military tradition, or be in an active war. Incompetency in war get you wounded, killed, or capture. Survival of the fittest.

This is gonna sound really horrible ( I obviously don't mean for it to happen) but SOMETIMES I feel that some major terrorist attack or war threat to Singapore should happen
so that all the people that we meet in NS who choose to be selfish, cowardly and simply refused to contribute to the protection of our nation (the chao keng assholes) can just stfu with all their anti-NS rhetoric and man up like the rest of Singapore male populace. 
-
 
 Some who commented on your post sound condescending, and these are some of the worst types of people I've met in NS - can't empathize at all.

I've met people in NS who chaokeng, lied their way through, can't be bothered with stuff -- but they became perfectly "fine" when they entered uni. Do I dislike them in NS? Sure, of course. People gossiped and cursed them. 

But do I judge them in their post-NS lives, esp those who thrived, and call them hypocrite or traitor? I don't think I'm entitled to do so. Some of us were hardy enough, and we can take any sort of shit. But some of us can't. Military life, discipline and regimentation are not for everyone. Even commanders may not take the stress. I'd a sergeant who confessed to me that he nearly turned on his encik during 'live' firing. Thankfully he found support and ORD-ed in peace.

There are those people who had a great experience in NS, feel damn patriotic, and wanna volunteer do reservist etc. Good for you.

But don't you dare judge and criticize those who barely survived the experience and possessed negative memories towards NS. 

You don't have that right.

Why are so many people upset that the Cross Island Line may cut through the central catchment area? Various forum letters say that the biodiversity would be affected but consistent with engineering theories as well as on the LTA website, tunneling works would begin outside the catchment area and drill right through without disturbing the surface.  So what is there to worry about? 
-
 
O Bell Curve God,
hallowed be thy name.
Your central limit come,
your distribution be done,
at NUS, as it is in the sample space.
Give us this semester our A+,
and forgive us our procrastination,
as we also have forgiven our group mates.
Lead us not into 25th percentile,
but deliver us from S/U.
Amen.

Phantom: The very word has a negative connotation in college culture, and a social stigma that goes along with it. Loner, anti-social, party pooper, all these assumptions are associated with this word.

Does anyone ever spare a thought for the people who don't enjoy the neverending barrage of people, and the constant socializing and partying? I don't care what your MBTI is: ENTP, ENFJ, INFP, INTJ, introvert, extrovert, introverted-extrovert. Nobody actually cares what label you want to slap on to yourself. People love to have convenient, uncomplicated explanations for human behaviour which is hardly ever so. 

Instead, why not try something called empathy? Instead of immediately reducing people into shallow versions you have created in your mind, attempt to understand them deeper. Because somewhere buried deep beneath the amplified collective noise, are individuals. Individuals who would surprise you with their special talent. Individuals who would make you laugh with their brand of sarcasm. Individuals who are worth the time and effort to get to know. Respect their privacy and space, and be patient with them, even if they are a little bit awkward. Maybe that's what makes them special.
College is stressful enough as it is. We shouldn't add to that stress with our social pressures. After all, aren't we all just people, trying to get by in this insane life? 

Sincerely - A Person

TLDR below.

Once upon a time, there was this kid, a quirky one. Quite a lonely one to boot. It was largely in part due to his experiences in his early childhood and before he knew it, he had already deviated much from the norm. One day, a psychologist then spotted him on the sidewalk looking rather down and hence, she decided invite him to her clinic for regular therapy sessions at a discounted rate. Once a week was the frequency of appointments. Initially, the kid was extremely elated. He was just thinking along the lines of "someone actually cares enough about me to reach out to me and whom is really passionate about her job." And so he trusted the psychologist and went on week after week for the therapy sessions.

But soon, he realised that the psychologist wasn't really listening to him. In each session, the psychologist would just observe his behaviour and no doubt, she did prompt him questions as most psychologists are supposed to do, she interpreted the kid as she saw fit without having bothered with the response of the child. Needless to say, the kid was rather upset because his expectations blew and he felt indignant because of some of the labels that were attributed to him. Even when he tried to speak out, expressed his dislike for the methods of the psychologist and wanted a truly open conversation, the latter never bothered. There was no question about the psychologist's well intentions and so the kid despite not having been very happy, continued to patronise the clinic and the psychologist whom he had somehow come to adore.

But things didn't get any better. The psychologist seeing that there was no actual progress decided one day to make a visit to his school and talked to his teachers and principle, sincerely hoping to help the child out. Occasionally then, the kids' teachers as well as his classmates did reach out to him. To be fair, at times they did really care for him but at times, they only wanted to elicit information. Hence, the psychological project then started growing bigger and bigger. Labels and meanings attributed to the kid and his actions then started to accumulate without an open conversation all this while.

At this point of time, things were extremely unpleasant and terrible. On one hand, the kid appreciates all that has been done for him and he too adores the psychologist. But on the other hand, he has grown wary of others, some he really trusted before. He too has been receiving all the unwanted comments from others and felt so much hurt, especially from the psychologist whom he adores. What if you were the kid? How would you feel and act?

TLDR: Please take no offence to what I have said or have to say because that's not what I intended. Here's just my take on the issue as someone who had been on the receiving end. You can just ignore me if you don't think they are applicable in your situation.
1. Did you establish trust?
2. Did you accurately identify the problem that he's facing?
3. When he responses, is there miscommunication? Are you jumping to conclusions on your own?
4. Did you ensure a two-way conversation? Have you given him a chance to explain himself?

"Yet, you are just too stubborn to face your own mistakes, reflect, and maybe try to be nicer to people around you? And not act like everyone owes you, or that no one understands you."
"We all have our own struggles, but in front of our loved ones, why share the negativity when time can be better spent on enjoying each other's company."
> I'll withhold by judgments here but aren't you imposing your perspectives and values here? Do you think he has the intention "I wish others around me would be negative as well so that I'm not the only one" or the like? I don't know. But I think most people in need are actually people who are afraid to burden others and wish to carry much of the burden themselves. Some do manage, others unfortunately don't.

To author of 

It's nice that you recognise that such behaviour is unkind. The world isn't perfect, but I'm sure it's not as ugly as it may seem. 
If it really affects you, let your family members know what you feel. Point out their flaws (as you've said so) and encourage them to change. They may not take kindly to your advice so try to phrase it in a subtle manner? Don't feel pressured by their actions and words to change the way you behave and think. At the same time, it's good to be realistic about your expectations as your family members may see it as you imposing your moral standards on them. Hope it helps(:

Ref: 
If someone wants to date someone of the same ethnicity, fine.
But then we have a bunch of bitter guys who start screaming about how a female is 'cheap' because they dated/are dating caucasians.
If this isn't the white man superiority complex, I don't know what is.
Maybe you guys should stop the whole segregation of 'us' versus 'them' and realised that dating someone of another ethnic group is just that - another ethnic group. Doesn't make one superior nor inferior.
Europe or America isn't some far flung fantasy land. There's the good, bad, and ugly. There are also people looking for flings, and people looking for long term relationship.
But seriously, I'd have thought university would have made some people a tad bit more intelligent but the bigoted, misogynistic views of some closet rednecks which persists are so troubling. May you not be one of our future leaders.

To  
I'm a first class honours from a minority race that does have an issue with Chinese privelege. Am I "capable" enough to contradict your assumption? 

 Thing is, racial privilege disproportionately affects already disadvantaged groups in society. So you may not find many who have been greatly disadvantaged in a place like NUS. I'll give you a personal example. My dad was a poor man, he was the oldest in his family of 9 siblings back then and couldn't afford a decent education. Back then, not being highly educated wasn't too bad. One could still find decent work easily. O-levels were considered impressive! But too bad for him, his dream was to be in the navy. If you were born of a certain race, you can't have certain dreams. His other choice was infantry but even then, his CO highly discouraged him from signing on by telling him that the army was a very racist place and he would face a lot of hurdles(which was true). He received best PT and best soldier awards while in his Guards unit. So he would have made a great career soldier with the SAF sponsoring his education. But in the end, he didn't sign on because of the systemic hurdles. 

Instead, he took a warehouse job and was promptly laid off when the Asian financial crisis hit and has been working odd jobs ever since. As a result we struggle to make ends meet. 

So do you see how, if things were just slightly different back then, his and my life would be thoroughly different? We wouldn't be rich, but we wouldn't be struggling to keep the lights on. It's nothing short of a miracle that I got to where I am now.

Sure, for a rich and well-connected racial minority, Chinese privilege might not mean anything. But for the worst off in society, it can be a matter of life and death.

I am a Chinese and my parents are selling CNY food so when I asked them how come they increase prices by 40% during CNY compared to the other days, and they told me because it's a once a year thing. I thought when our production level goes up during the seasonal period, we enjoy economies of scale and should pass the lower cost down to customers so that more people will buy from us? It's win-win situation for customers and sellers. I mean during Christmas, we get discounts for Christmas gifts. During Thanksgiving and Black Friday, we get discounts as well. But during Chinese New Year, the prices of things go up. Simply go to any wet market and you'll know how the hawkers increase their prices. I am not sure if it's a "Chinese" thing to take every opportunity to rip people off their money in the name of "Chinese New Year". And for that, I am quite ashamed ):

I am always peeved when people boast about their academic achievements on social media. This is because it has nothing to do with 'hard work and determination', only everything to do with in-born ability. As if nobody else works as hard nor had the discipline to do so.

With some posts on "you voted for this"

Democracy by voting is just messed up. People may not know what they want and who better matches their needs. There are biases against people for so many reasons and affiliations. They should make everyone fill in a "personality test" kind of questionnaire. 

Make all the candidates of each party fill up the same questionnaire and take the mean for each GRC. 

Vote goes to whichever has higher levels of similarity to whichever party.

Are you confessors really dense or do you just not understand implied meanings behind an action/inaction? If a person who had been frequently texting you and suddenly slowed down/stopped, there're only a few possible scenarios:

1) Fingers got chopped off - Is he/she still online every now and then? Ok, eliminated
2) He/she died - Do you see him/her around school? Yes? Eliminated.
3) Phone dropped into toilet bowl and flushed down the sewers - Do you see him/her using phone? Yes? Eliminated.

4) He/she isn't interested in continuing anymore. - IS HE/SHE REPLYING YOU WHEN ON THE PHONE, ALIVE AND ONLINE? NO? BINGO!!!

"Plans change with the seasons
Things happen for reason
I tell myself that every day
But the feeling of frustration doesn’t go away

I try to keep myself together
It's hard to bare the stormy weather
When I live my life in a fast lane
I don't wanna leave it all to fade?

Thought I had it all worked down
I was lost, but now I found

A life that is mine, not borrowed
The path that I wanna follow
The people that were always there for me
Reaching out, helping me to succeed
And I don’t know where it is I’m going
But I’m okay with never knowing
I finally found the missing puzzle piece
Now it’s time to open the door
Say hello to the new me

All that I’ve learned throughout this journey
What's not in your control ain't worth the worries
And if you think that you'll lose, then you'll never win
Always stay true to what defines you and not them
There is a purpose you are serving

Thought I had it all worked down
I was lost, but now I found

A life that is mine, not borrowed
The path that I wanna follow
The people that were always there for me
Reaching out, helping me to succeed
And I don’t know where it is I’m going
But I’m okay with never knowing
I finally found the missing puzzle piece
Now it’s time to open the door
Say hello to the new me

Life that’s in front of me
Your expectations I'll exceed
I may be on my own
But at least I am free 

In this life that is mine, not borrowed
The path that I wanna follow
The people that were always there for me
Reaching out, helping me to succeed
And I don’t know where it is I’m going
But I’m okay with never knowing
I finally found the missing puzzle piece
Now it’s time to open the door
Say hello...
Now it’s time to open the door
Say hello…
Now it’s time to open the door
Say hello

Minorities should just be quiet and accept the deal they've been given. It is an increasingly capitalist world and everybody scraps for any advantage they can get. What do you want? For Chinese people to penalize themselves? Or do you want to be compensated? Or do you want them to be introspective and sympathetic to your plight, whilst showing a suitable amount of bashfulness?  

You can comfort yourself reading the nice politically correct rants in your favour. But make no mistake people will only give a token amount of support, then go about their merry way. Maybe if you stop using your race as a crutch you'll do better for yourself. 

If you really find that life as a minority is so terrible here... then go. This is a valid statement, just look at the number of Malaysian Chinese who come to S'pore. Now they are fleeing real discrimination, not your first world woes.

Aiyah can we just stop with this Chinese Privilege thing already? Or whatever you want to call it? As a minority, I'm getting sick of it. I don't think this is a page where we should be discussing such things. I just don't see us gaining anything. All I see is people being more concerned over distinguishing Chinese privilege from discrimination then actually addressing the issue. Or more concerned over going through Sangeetha's list and finding out which fits privilege and which is discrimination. Some even have the nerve to call her examples 'lame'. It's lame cause everything is available for you? Goodness. Can't you already tell that discrimination exists because of privilege? Pretty much a no brainer... Just stop la. No point going on here.

I can sense the underlying sense of feeling being discriminated within the minority races. Occasionally when things does not go their way, they would say something like "you don't lend me money because im Indian right? You don't lend me notes cuz I'm Malay lah!". It is almost ingrained and psychologically rooted in their minds that they are getting discriminated irregardly of the situation.

OK hold up y'all....

This is the first time I've heard of "Chinese privilege" (pardon me for my ignorance), and to me this sounds totally absurd (context: I'm mixed race and my documents do not reflect the Chinese race). I think "White privilege" is still more relevant and widespread, even in this country.

Can you guys provide specific examples of how the Chinese are privileged over the rest? Like I really want to know. Please give specific, clear, and concise examples instead of overly-long convoluted essays that turn your point into abstractions hidden behind unnecessary handwaving. Thank you.

This is to 

Yes it is true that the majority will tend to dominate over the minority, but that is why we have institutionalized laws and systems put in place so that there is equality provided for all - of which, yes, Singapore has done quite an impressive job with. But Singapore isn't perfect and should not be used as a final yardstick for social equality, we should be working towards improving Singapore and pushing Singapore towards more equality and understanding among ethnic/religious groups. We may not have a very equal 'outcome' now, but that does not mean that we cannot work towards that goal.

And of course minorities will not simply "count their blessings" in face of social inequality. Remember that one time the Indonesia minister told Singaporeans to "count our blessings" because we receive eleven months of clean fresh air. Eleven months (like already existing forms of equality) does should never be a form of redemption with respect to not just this, but any kind of issue.

There is also no correlation between non-halal food and profitable businesses. There are many dominating halal food firms in Singapore like Old Chang Kee, and various halal stalls in hawker places like Newton and Changi Village. Non-Muslims don't really for whether food is halal or not - taste and affordability is much more of a contributing factor.

In response to  and other posts about discrimination. Saw this and thought it applies v well

Hmm since there has been some talk of 'Chinese privilege', I thought I could maybe give some thoughts on it. I don't identify as Chinese, Malay or Indian so maybe I can give personal view that may not be so emotionally charged.

Think of it this way, as Singaporeans (despite us not having the choice of being Singaporeans in the first place, just as the Chinese wouldn't have the choice of being born as the majority race in Singapore), we have a whole list of privileges given to us on a silver platter that others from poorer and less developed countries may not have. This list includes housing, running water, and a very good education system. I am Singaporean, and I would never say anything along the lines of "But I didn't choose to be Singaporean, it's not my fault you all were not born in a rich country". Instead, if I had more money or power I would try my best to improve the situations or livelihoods of people who are in much dire situations - and I feel this is reflected by a lot of Singaporeans with OCIPs, etc.

But the truth of the matter is that 'Chinese privilege' does exist, and it is not a direct attack on the Chinese populace, but there are issues that stand out where being Chinese benefits a person just because of the fact that you are Chinese. There are MANY strands of this privilege, whether it is has been internalized in the society or outright racism in the workplace.

Take this list for example (I will try and list these 'privileges' in order - with the more discriminatory strands towards the end')
 
It can be quite a struggle (myself included sometimes) when a group of friends who all happen to be Chinese decide to have lunch at Koufu or a hawker place that doesn't sell halal or non-Chinese food.

Having fairer skin is seen as being more attractive in Singapore. I have had Chinese women (although I acknowledge they do not speak for all Chinese women) tell me straight up that they would not date a Malay or Indian person purely because of the fact that there are of a different race. Take this list for example - http://www.aspirantsg.com/25-hot-guys-in-singapore-to-follow-on-instagram-nov-2015/

Mandarin is a requisite for students who want to study Japanese as a third language in government schools (MOELC) despite the fact that NUS's Japanese department proves that you need not have a background in writing Chinese characters to learn Kanji. LAJ1101 takes in all students and trains them in writing Kanji right from the beginning.

The establishment of SAP schools insulates a lot of Chinese students from interaction with minority students. It is also quite strange that there are no schools that provide Malay-centric or Indian-centric education in government schools. I have also realized that a lot of SAP students I have come across don't really know much about the other races - for example, the difference between Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji. I mean I am not Chinese, but I've been invited by my Chinese friends for Chinese New Year so many times and I love it and I know more or less what goes down during the time.

There are cases of outright discrimination against minorities in Singapore with respect to the work place. One of the most common one - of which I struggle with too - is the preference for only Chinese tutors in tutoring jobs. I have also heard anecdotes of companies not wanting to hire Malays or Indians.

The new policy by the MOM for hiring foreign workers also indirectly puts non-Chinese businesses at an disadvantage. You can read about it here - http://m.themalaymailonline.com/opinion/surekha-a-yadav/article/if-you-arent-chinese-you-cant-compete-in-singapore

And of course the very touchy issue of National Service. I don't think I have to elaborate on this. There are also many writings by politicians with disdain for minority views and minority religions.

I think Singaporeans (Chinese or not) must realize that there are certain privileges granted to a person being from a majority race. Instead of passing these issues off as blatant racism (which for certain strands of 'Chinese privilege', unfortunately actually are), we should be trying to be more sensitive to minority issues or be more understanding of the lifestyle that other people commit to so we can create a more cohesive and multi-cultural society. I know that most Chinese people are not racist, and when they do something that might seem a bit of that nature, it usually comes from a place of misunderstanding  rather than any malicious intent. But these 'privileges' still exist nonetheless and everyone in Singapore needs to shoulder the responsibility of dealing with them.

Looking forward to a more understanding and united Singapore, peace!

 Typical view of an ethnic Chinese who has never experienced both explicit and subtle discrimination in S'pore, and who sees his privilege as a "natural" outcome.

Let's just use one example - Chinese SAP schools. If you're a Chinese and do well for PSLE, not only can you choose from the elite schools, but you get to opt for SAP schools, where additional resources are provided for bilingual and bicultural education (like overseas exchange progs). There aren't any Malay/Indian SAP schools. If this isn't privilege, then what is?

I've learnt wushu before but I've never compete. I feel that wushu doesn't teach you how to fight another person. When practising wushu, you are basically punching or kicking the air unlike TKD whereby you get to kick a stationary target, be it a board or foam pads. This builds your kicking accuracy and let's you know how it's like to hit a target (e.g the impact on your leg and how to respond to the "recoil" from your kick). In wushu, little (or almost zero) emphasis is placed on how to attack or defend and more emphasis is placed on the swiftness of your moves and the beauty of the your poses (e.g whether your arm is straight) as this are the things that scores you points during competitions. Thus, I think that it's not entirely wrong if someone say that wushu is just for show. Wushu can be useful in a real fight but this aspect of wushu is not taught to learners.

I do think some of the posts here are posted by people seeking some sexual release by 'confessing' their sexual experiences or maybe they're just fantasies disguised as experiences. I'd like to add on to these confessions nonetheless.
One time I got it on with a guy from nus. Then I saw him around school and the only thought in my head was..."that guy sucked my tits"...

I had similar experiences with you as well, but the disillusionment towards the religion came because of painful personal experiences. How can something that was part of my life since young bring me so much despair?

I would say I’m a less devout follower of the religion now but weirdly I’m more at peace. For me, religion works and means differently for each individual, so I just ignore and don’t follow and practice those stuff that I don’t agree with in the scripture. I know some will say that I’m cherry-picking. I also feel that different people have different interpretations. Unlike some of the other commenters, I didn’t seek the help of religious teachers because I find that they all basically have the same conservative and strict views while I’m more liberal. Of course, some may say that this is an instance of self-justification and generalization on my part. Sure, the scripture is the word of God, but are we really certain of God’s intentions? Does God expect us to follow the scriptures word for word or are we supposed to read between the lines? Is that God’s test in itself, to see if we can differentiate the good from the bad? Let’s face it; not all that is mentioned in the scripture is totally good. The scriptures are also referring to a different period of time, which is why again I feel we have to constantly put things in perspective. As far as I know, the scripture never mentioned anything regarding the progress of technology. If we’re following the scripture strictly, that means that we should basically abstain from technology.

I don’t know if this helps to address your concern at all, but my advice is for you to ask yourself: What does religion mean to you? Religion, for me, is my own personal relationship with God. No one tells me what I should do. I don’t talk about it to anyone and it’s not something that you should impose on others. Find something that works for you and makes you feel comfortable. If religious people judge you, they are missing the key point where the only one that can judge you is God himself. Regardless of religion, I think we can all agree that the basic principle is for us humans to be kind to one another, treat everyone with respect and not do things that will cause harm and hurt to others.

I apologise if my response appear incoherent and contradictory. As a general rule, I hate talking about religion because it makes me angry, mostly because of how it makes some people intolerant of others.

@15441    I follow this page and I feel that you are tarring quite a lot of people with that brush! However I agree that there are 2 or 3 "regular" commentors who are really annoying. I was really put off by one such commentor who kept making every confession about himself/herself and his broken solitary life. If that person is indeed reading this (and for sure you would, you keeping posting everywhere), I hope you get over yourself.

Admins, please don't filter this out 

My father always ransacks my wallet every morning while I'm asleep just to see what kinds of stuff I keep inside which to him he considers as rubbish (rubbish is very subjective too, my friends) and in particular, to take out all the coins which he claims will spoil the wallet. It's my damn wallet and I can do anything I want with it but what frustrates me the most is his utter lack of respect for my privacy (I mean come on, I'm f**king 21 already) and when I raise it up to him, because I'm an educated individual who recognises his own rights and will not give in to every damn situation or argument just because he's my father, he loses his shit and calls me an immature child like he always does whenever I argue with him  and this is somehow his justification for his wallet ransacking (like what's the link?). I have since stopped keeping coins in my wallet and other stuff but the ransacking rages on and I'm supposed to entertain it and just be an obident filial son that never questions his authority and has no say? That would somehow be mature to him? F**k that shit

To ,

One thing i've learnt recently is that because males and females are so different, they bring different strengths to the relationship. If your goals are to reach your ambitions and provide well for your family, then your gf's goals may be to love and support you in doing so, and to make the house feel like a home. Of course, there are power couples where both the parents are high flyers, but from my dad's perspective (he is a teacher), their children have a higher tendency to be overly stressed, ignored at home, and only feel loved when they achieve.

CAP is not a determining factor of who you are, and different people have different expectations and definitions of success. Because she is more laid back, you both complement each other in the sense that you can try to guide her to work harder and smarter, while she can show you how to appreciate the finer things in lie, and take much needed rest. I am sure you would rather be with a girl in a not-so-outstanding job, but is happy and cheerful, than a girl who stresses herself out everyday working in a job that she does not enjoy. What you can do is help her to plan out her life, since you are better at it, and help her find a job with a reasonable salary and that she is passionate about.

The key issues now are whether you can accept her as she is, and whether your parents are able to do so. The answers to these lie with you - if you are unable to accept it, move on. If you love her and are determined, show your parents how much you love her, and if they are good parents they will accept that it is your choice, your life, and not theirs. I have had a friend who apparently broke up because he was not prepared to accept his girlfriend being a housewife, as he was not confident of making it work single income. But that said, it is not easy to find someone that you love, and who loves you in return. I encourage you to love and cherish her.

All the best :)

Cant help but feel that a significant amount of regular commenters here are misogynists who probably dont even realize they are. 

From the guy who always commented "men are not meant to be monogamous", to the guy who rather comment on the importance of sexual compatibilty than point out it is wrong to cheat (in the blowjob post). And the list goes on. And of course, let's not forget about the many xenophobic posts in here. 

Fortunately there are always words of wisdom and mature responses from the bulk of the other commenters, and i would like to thank them on behalf of everyone. Hopefully, more people will learn from them and comment graciously instead of hurling personal attacks and prejudice views. 

On a side note, thank you admins of NUS Whispers for updating this page so regularly (:

Your usage of the term 'AMDK accent' instead of simply 'Standard English' suggests that your post was an attempt to portray Singaporean women as superficially attracted to native English speakers, the sort of misogynist troll posts seen on EMDW. It's highly unlikely that someone would respond positively to a poorly imitated "angmoh accent" (unless your sample group is HIGHLY questionable)

Regardless, I think your premise is true for some Singaporean women, but it works both ways. I personally find women who can speak Standard English much more attractive, especially if they can code switch in the appropriate situation. (i.e. speaking Singlish /dialect to the hawker centre auntie and speaking Standard English in tutorials and on dates)

I've always has this vision of how prude our culture is, even with the most sexually open society. You see, there is no crimes that we demonize more than rape. You can write a fictional character that kill and kill and kill, steal and steal and steal, and generally be an asshole and you can still make him somehow be a rouge with a heart of gold. You can make a tyrannical genocidal maniac into a comedic character (google this character: General Butt Fucking Naked, in The Book of Mormon musical, by the creators of South Park). Yet the fastest way to make a character irredeemably horrible is to show they rape someone. That is despite rape is generally not punished as harsh as murder, unless that is you kill the rape victims, which is why it would be a bad idea to punish rapists with the death sentence; because you will ended up with a lot of raped, and murdered victims instead of just rape victims. Personally, I will prefer being raped instead of murdered, since rape stops after a while when being dead does not.

To me this just show how prude our culture is. Or unless you can provide a better explanation. Or it means that we put a lot of value on virginity, despite that virginity might have been taken forcefully; and a raped women is better off dead; but that's just my interpretation of this fucked up view.

To OP of  Sorry if this post gets too religious or technical. You posed a question, so please allow me to try and explain/share my own reasons with you as a Christian. Here’s the other side of the story you asked for (:

I understand where you’re coming from, but to many of us things are not as simple as that, and our spiritual beliefs do in fact have everything to do with a relationship. Religion is not simply something we like, like a hobby, or a favourite food. This firm stand on not dating non-Christians is not because they don’t like the same things we do - it’s much more than that. For me and many of my friends, being a Christian is a whole lifestyle on its own and having a close relationship with God. Simply put: God is the greatest thing to us, and we spend our whole lives seeking Him and following His teachings. 

1. Our Bible (to us, it’s God-breathed and the perfect truth) says “be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers” and discourages such relationships. One of the main reasons being the fact that a relationship with a non-Christian (with different beliefs/habits) will bring us further from instead of closer to God, which is wrong and goes against what we’ve been taught to do. Because we shouldn’t “sacrifice” our relationship with God (who, again, should be the most important thing to us) for an earthly one that is not God-centred. Because our focus should not be on each other, but on God. But it certainly does not mean that we think any less of non-Christians or look down on them or don’t want to be with them.

2. The walk of faith is a turbulent one for every Christian. We’re in no way perfect followers, and there are many ups and downs in this journey - times when we feel close to God, and times when we feel far. Put two Christians together and they could take turns encouraging each other whenever one of them drifts, and bring each other closer to God through many things like praying together, going to church together, etc. Simply put, it’s always good to have someone on the same path/journey as you so you’ll never stray too far from it. (:

3. The Bible also tells us that eventually, non-believers will be separated from believers for all eternity. Can you imagine how sad it is to be separated from the one you love forever? A few Christians I know are dating/married to non-Christians, and they’ve acknowledged that this is a tragic consequence that they will have to face eventually because of the choice they’ve made. I never want to put myself through that kind of pain. Of course, there are Christians out there who are comfortable with dating/marrying non-Christians. But at least for me, that's out of the question.

I hope you understand what I’m trying to say. Thank you for putting your question across politely. Again, I understand and respect that many like yourself may find our beliefs ridiculous and hard to understand. So it’s alright if you still disagree with everything - I’m merely trying to explain my own reasons to you and the others who may also be wondering. I, too, hope my post has not offended anyone. If other Christians here have beliefs or reasons different from mine, I’m sure they will share them. Hope this clears up some doubts about why some of us are so strict about who we date!

, he's not gonna convert, he's not gonna try. You will probably continue to have conflicts over something that you 2 will remain adamant about. It is recommended that you stick to your beliefs, and sadly, this relationship won't work out to the point of marriage (easily). 

It's up to you. I once discussed with a friend (I am Taoist, he's Christian or Catholic - can't remember exactly + we are both guys) about the different religions and dating stuff and our conclusions are, to make things easier (based on your beliefs), date someone whose religion does not make either of you compromise. Such conflicts can be painful because you can't quickly come to a solution, and you don't want to regret over making a decision like this.

Good luck, and to the start of the semester too.

To the OP of 
Why do you want to take the risk with unprotected sex? The safest is abstinence. The second in line is using contraception. If you had unprotected sex, I think the morning after pill is your only option. Unlike the US where one can buy it off the shelves of a pharmacy, you need to consult a GP in order to get the pill in Singapore. You need to consume the pill within 48 hours to be effective. See your GP for medical advice. Please also Google online or ask your GP about the various forms of contraception available should you decide to continue having sexual intercourse with your bf.

I am 27 this year. I have never taken an airplane before. I have never even left Singapore before. I have never ride in a car before other than a taxi, because my whole family is broken and shit poor and my social circle is small. The best restaurant I've eaten in is fast food restaurant. Why don't I have money? I work part-time but all of my money goes back to supporting my family and my useless father who hangs around all day without a job. And I am a slightly below average student as well. And my looks are below average too. I never have a girlfriend before, and was rejected many times when I tried to pursue the love I was deprived of. My future looks bleak. I really hate poor families who want to have children. These poor and insensible Parents cannot give their children the best yet still want to give birth and make the child suffer. The hungry stomach is just as worse as being looked down upon. I really pray that the Singapore government should impose law that it is illegal for couples below certain income level to have children. This is not to discriminate poor people but to force the couple make an effort to increase their income to a reasonable amount before giving birth. If not they shouldn't have kids. Some couples like my parents are just dirt lazy. I had to fend for myself throughout my childhood and I've watched my brother went to jail. It is the anger inside him that caused him to resort to violence. Everytime when I see my schoolmates go for New Year parties, hang outs, student exchanges or getaways, I feel very hurt and frustrated as I don't have the money to join to them. And after a while, they'll no longer ask me to join them. I am missing out so much during my youth. Very few people understand me, most were born better off. When I tried to confide in them, they shrugged it off as they are not interested to hear my problems. I tried turning to religion too, thinking that those evangelists will fulfill the promises given to me. But after all the formalities, they want me to believe that a good life equals blessed by God, and bad life equals not blessed by God because not faithful enough. They revere those who are successful (happy, good student, well off) as more holy, while guys like me are often labelled as flawed. I left them as they deepen my wound, not help me feel better. While I'm all smiles in public, but whenever I'm all alone, I feel like killing myself. Maybe 2016 will present a miracle. Please Please Please...

Many people say that I'm a selfish person who is unwilling to go out, unwilling to spend money on food, clothes, etc. However, who can understand my troubles with having to pay for school fees personally, contributing to family finances and paying for my own expenses at the same time? And saying "oh, why don't you just get scholarship?", I wish I could but I ain't that smart to get one yet. Just because you can get an allowance from your parents and not fret about money, doesn't mean that everyone else lives the same way. Please understand that there are people out there who are forced to spend peanuts daily just to get through university, and things such as expensive clothes, lavish food and getaways aren't something that we are able to afford...

Because our country is quite wealthy, consider it a luxury for students can study useless stuffs like Sociology, English Literature, Philosophy or Woman studies etc. It is proven that at least 70% of the Singaporeans are anti-intellectual. They vote based on habits. So no point talking about Freedom or Individual rights. 对牛弹琴. Lee Kuan Yew knew it. Majority has to be concerned with their own survival because there is no welfare in Singapore. 

Our government hires these FASS grads for civil services jobs. But this is a bubble. Sooner or later there will be less and less civil service jobs for them. Everyone want the iron rice bowl. Very few will leave. The bubble will burst for FASS students. It is already happening in education sector. It will spread across the public sectors when the government start to cut their fiscal budget for the tough years ahead when our ageing population brings down our productivity.

"Gender roles being social constructs?"

Oh well, since I have not taken a single gender studies modules, OK, OK, I had one lecture in a larger social studies mod, I might be a bit not as "qualified". But science is all about evidence, criticism, and people with massive egos, I feel that I might as well jump in. 

My favourite counter-point to the statement at the first line is the Kibbutz concept in Israel. The Kibbutz is an attempt to create absolute freedom of choice for gender roles. Children are reared and taken cared of in communal homes, freeing their mothers (and parents) from the duties, and according to the gender studies people, the social pressure of caring for children. Jews of both genders are encouraged to take up jobs and roles regardless of traditional gender roles (aka: do whatever you want); so no social pressure there either. They even went as far as avoid using the usual Hebrew word for "husband", "ba'al", since it has the connotation of being "master", implying a submissive role of the wife. The kibbutz was typically agriculture in nature. In a way, kibbutz the Plato's Politik manifested; and socialism as well. and from a standpoint of a biologist: a pretty nice experiment.

So what happened? It went swimmingly for the first generation of die-hard ideologues. But weird things started happening in the second generation:  despite growing up in an environment supposedly primed for total gender equality, the second and third generation has even sharper division and regression towards "traditional" roles. Most men work the fields, fewer women do, and most women prefer the domestic duties of taking care of children, cooking, cleaning, and even the communal duties of kibbutz children. The agreed that the communal experience among children was positive, and helped developing social skills, but they still prefer to be around their parents. However, one thing is true that children in the kibbutz tend not to marry children from the same kibbutz. By the third generation, wives call their husbands "ba'al", much to the chagrin of their grandmothers, who the granddaughters insist that the latter were too caught up with semantics. 

So, what's the conclusion. Well perhaps the ""Gender roles being social constructs" is a social construct while gender roles have some basis in biology. That's just my opinion. Still, my motto towards anyone's choice of roles is "do whatever you want". If a man wants in his partner a certain role in marriage, that's his choice. I just have an advice for women: make sure that your partner's goal and expectation for you match yours. Caveat emptor. You need to know what you are heading into and you have the freedom to decline. Just as he might find his choice of mates drastically reduced.

Let's not too caught up with the semantics , m'kay.

Just some tidbits of my personal experience. My mother out-earns my father by a large margins. A post-doc I worked with expressed his opinions about gender roles: he should be the breadwinner, and his wife should take care of the (3-4) kids. Well, that's his plan. The reality is: his wife is a more successful academic and he is. She's a Principal Investigator, with her own lab, right now. He's still a postdoc. I have zero qualms about people choosing their paths regardless or right down the traditional roles.

But one more criticism of the current status quo: the way people are counting GDP. Basically, every time money changes hands, it contribute towards GDP. A mother who stay at home, teaching her children (pre-school at least), cook the meals, clean the house, etc ... is a GDP wrecker. A working mother who send her kids to daycare center, hire maid, and eat outside is a GDP hero. From the standpoint of results: better educated children, no comments since I am no pre-school experts, nor I pretend to. But I do know that a nice home cooked meals beat all the eating out. Eating out is nice, at least personally, for dishes I can not cook.
More a more extreme example: a man who eat healthily and work out by jogging is a GDP wrecker while a man who stuff himself like a pig, then go to hospital for treatment of obesity, pay for expensive trainers, has a heart attack, undergo 3 coronary bypass is a GDP hero.

A favourite quote of my favourite author, Edward Luttwak: “I believe that one ought to have only as much market efficiency as one needs. Because everything that we value in human life is within the realm of inefficiency – love, family, attachment, community, culture, old habits, comfortable old shoes."

I hate how gender is a notion that is ascribed to each and every one of us since we were born. It's a boy; it's a girl - then girls are naturally given pinkish stuff, made to grow long hair, pierce their ears etc (do stuff that makes them more feminine per se) as opposed to boys who are taught to be tough and anything that enhances their masculinity. Gender is subjective and it is performative. Seriously I don't get how unfair it is when women are constantly body-shamed, has to put makeup, is not okay to have body hair etc when men can get away with "being natural" and how gender identities are still prevalent and fixed. People should be free to be whatever they want.

I know that NUSWhispers attracts lots of nasty people. If you look at the comments, it is filled with tons of messages attacking people. Some of them funny, which really shouldn't be an excuse for bullying. Most of them not. And that's terrible.

But  really takes the cake. It is nothing more than insult upon insult heaped on a person trying to tell his side of the story.

I mean, fellow NUS students, please, you are better than this. Isn't it in university where you learn that you can't insult your way to the president? Umm... I meant where you can't insult your way to a research paper? Sorry, was thinking of Donald Trump.

People's beliefs and claims can only be defeated by strong arguments. And if you haven't learnt how to make arguments after being in university, I have no idea why you are here.

I'm OP of . To those of you who say that atheist shouldn't evangelise and give shallow reasons like I'm being like evangelists. 

Why should atheism be unable to defend itself against these growing number of Christian missionary hordes? They assault our friends, our families, and our countrymen, and yet you would have me keep silent to achieve your version of peace with Christianity.

Additionally, you're not looking at the demographics. Well, maybe you had, and just don't bother about it. However, Christianity is growing in adherents in Singapore, and I'm not about to allow the demographic group which I belong to to shrink in comparison to them. The political clout of atheism must not be allowed to be further diminished. Of all demographic groups, atheists are the ones that hold the fort against the ever increasing pressures to tear down secularism.

With all the posts about how annoying attempt at religious proselytisation ca be, let me just briefly summary an amusing account from the history of Eastern Slavs. Prince Vladimir the Great was the Prince of Novgorod and Grand Prince of Kiev in late 10th and early 11th century. With the resurgence of paganism, Vladimir decided to shop around for a monotheistic religion from one of the surrounding people to adopt. As per the account of the Primary Chronicle, or Tale of Bygone Years, or Pověstĭ Vremęnĭnyhŭ Lětŭ, which is the earliest surviving written history by Eastern Slav about Eastern Slav, Vladimir sent emissaries abroad and meet with missionaries and emissaries. The details are probably part fact, part fiction, but 100% amusing, which says a lot about the colorful characters of the people wrote it. Anyways, disclaimer, this is not to disrespect any of the mentioned religion, or the Kievan-Rus people, or Prince Vladimir

Meeting the Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga, Vladimir's envoys reported "there is no gladness among them, only sorrow and a great stench". The deal breaker for Vladimir was probably the taboo against alcohol and pork: "Drinking is the joy of all Rus'. We cannot exist without that pleasure" (insert drunken Russian joke here".

Vladimir then met with Jewish envoys (possibly Khazars), and inquired about their religion. Vladimir ultimately rejected it because despite being God's chosen people, their loss of Jerusalem was evidence that they had been abandoned by God (ouch, that was a horrible burn; but fast-forward to 1948, who's the fool now?)

The Catholics of the Germanic people was alright, but his emissaries saw no beauty in their churches. Vladimir finally settled on Eastern Orthodox Christianity because his emissaries were greatly impressed by the beautiful churches and festivals ordered by the Emperor to impress them: "We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth, for surely there is no such splendor or beauty anywhere upon earth. We cannot describe it to you. Only we know that God dwells there among men, and that their service surpasses the worship of all other places. We cannot forget that beauty".

What seals the deal is another beauty, or in modern slang "a pair of great titties": Emperor (Basileus) Basil II's sister Anna Porphyrogenita (Porphyrogenita meaning "born in purple", aka: a true Roman royalty). But a born in purple Princess marrying a pagan barbarian? Preposterous! So of course Vladimir was baptized, taking the Christian name Basil out of respect for his brother-in-law, destroyed pagan monuments, built many churches, and was the reason by today Russians are mostly Orthodox Christians instead of Muslim.

So there: that's the secret to successfully converting people. Hold off the "burn in fire and brimstone" bit. Quit the "We will kill you" shtick. Put on your best behaviour, the best dress, having the best bling-bling, being the most benevolently powerful bunch, don't kill others simple joy, and possibly promising of "a pair of great titties".

Now Arab sources reported a more boring tale. Basil II was overthrown by Bardas Sclerus and Bardas Phokas. Basil II then ran to Kievan-Rus for help, despite being nominally enemies then. Vladimir agreed to help, in exchange for Basil II's sister hands in marriage and conversion to Christianity for him and his people. He sent 6000 troops to helped and Basil II was Basileus once more.

Another thing: girls, don't tell a history buff that you want to be "treated like a Princess", because you will be married off to some dude to foster the alliance. Not even treated "like a Queen", in the Royal Consort meaning, aka: the wife of a King. Be treated "like a reigning Queen" is the best.

To  There is a difference between denigrating a religion and denigrating the method use to propagate that religion. The commentators on this platform have been relating stories where evangelists denigrate their religion so as to propagate the evangelists' own religion. Surely, you cannot be in agreement with statements such as "you are damned to Hell because you subscribe to another religion" or "your religion is a form of devil worship"? 

More importantly, if respect for another's religion is paramount, shouldn't evangelists also respect the religion of the recipient by not denigrating the recipient's religion? In a number of religions, the words "devil", "Hell" or similar carry a negative connotation. So why use those words so pointedly when evangelising? Is there no other (positive) way to convince the other person?

All these recent posts about Christianity really struck a nerve within me. I'm a Buddhist but I used to be in a Christian school, and I believe it was during that period of time in that school that I formed a strong dislike for the religion. Over the years, I've had many experiences whereby Christians, in their zest and passion for preaching the good of God, will put down other religions like mine, and tell us we'd all go to hell because we aren't Christians. My ex girlfriend who was a Christian made me go to church with her, was too ashamed to tell her family she was dating a Buddhist (so throughout the 6 years we were together, I was kept in the dark from her family), and desperately tried to convert me so we could be together. She also openly shared her dislike for my religion. It really hurts how we're seen as inferior by these "holier than thou" Christians, the pity in their eyes as they believe we'd be heading straight for hell, how relationships with individuals of other religions are strictly forbidden because of excuses that "oh to prevent conflict between spouses, and prevent people from leaving God's side due to pressure from a non-Christian spouse" etc. Similar to the unfair prejudices against inter-racial relationships, it's also unfair and absolutely stupid how religion > love. 

That was a really long rant. Pent-up frustration.

In view of these anti-or-not Christian posts, I thought I would like to share a bit on what all these evangelism is about. Firstly, yes, I'm a Christian, not the born type, but I guess kindergarten is a pretty young age to start anyway, so yeah, it's been pretty much my whole life. 

And, I would like to apologise to those who have felt irritated, or awkward, or anything negative when Christians approach you and try to 'educate' you on Christianity, and pressure you to convert/go for church services/accept our belief etc. It is our aim to share with you about Jesus yeah, but no, we do not want you to feel uncomfortable when we share with you, and I hope our evangelists out there will not keep bugging you to listen to them when you have already indicated your disinterest. I don't know about Catholics, but I think Protestants (Christians), such as Presbyterians, Methodists, do believe in the Great Commission (you can google it if you wanna find out more), and we have a sort of 'duty' to fulfil through evangelism. That said, we are also not out to prove that my God is better than your God, or that our teachings are right and yours are not, because we can't prove it and it isn't our purpose to. We aren't miracle performers like the abracadabra you are healed in the name of God, we are simply people who have chosen to believe, and hope that you guys can join us because we have received a lot from our belief (: And if you guys don't want to, we will feel a bit disappointed of course, but as humans/Christians, we know what empathy is and we should not be bothering you guys by harping on the topic when you obviously have your own viewpoint. This kind of understanding isn't a Christian thing, it's just basic human stuff that many religions teach too, about being understanding.

Lastly, because I have been 'evanglised' to by certain groups of individuals claiming to be Christians, but these groups are known to be labelled more as 'cults' than the religion itself due to the vast difference in teachings even if superficially they seem the same. They are also technically not recognised by the Government as an official religion. I don't really wanna name any groups, and I know they have their own viewpoints and beliefs, but just a heads up! 

I typed all these based on whatever little I know about my religion in the decades I have been a believer. If I have erronously quoted anything, or have offended anyone other religion/groups in this post, I do seek your forgiveness and please do comment below so that I will learn and try to understand your points too!

Saw a friend share  post on Facebook and decided to address it on a more neutral platform. 

I am a devoted Buddhist previously from a Christian school. Although I am not a Christian, I enjoyed listening to the Christian worship songs during the services in school. 

Many times, at YIH, I've seen this "mother-daughter" (or I thought so) pair walking around spreading about Christianity. Well, I have nothing against that, it's after all their time and freedom to do whatever that please, for their religion. Once, they came up to me and I rejected politely, stating that I am a Buddhist, all my family members are. However, the pair have no intention to leave and continued telling me how we are all "sinners" and it is Jesus who saved us from our sins; etc. I explained that I've heard about that long ago but yet I choose to believe in my own religion. A stronger reason was because my parents are all devoted Buddhists and why would I want them to be unhappy?  I have nothing against any religion, and sometimes I wonder if religions can co-exist. How can one prove that my "God" is the only "God", then how about the many other religions we have in the world?

To be honest, I don't care if we were all sinners. By believing in God/Jesus Christ does not make one "sin" less. Religion does not matter, as long as the religion is teaching one to do the CORRECT things. 

That said, I wonder if the pair gets a personal sense of satisfaction by spreading god's words. Hmm...

Is it alright for a mother-in-law to live with the couple? Won't the other party feel put off? Especially if the mother-in-law is the nosy and controlling type. I'm wondering what is the norm on this.

I know this is probably going to touch a raw nerve with some people, but I just have to ask - why do Christians have to go around trying to evangelizing every time? I am honestly sick of people stopping me (happened to me some time back at YIH) and asking me if I would like to "know more about Jesus Christ". And trying to pull the random unsuspecting passerby into one of your cell meetings at Utown Green (I've seen this happen quite recently near the exam period). For the last time, no, I do not want to know more about your savior, although I know you revere him. Neither do I want to join your cell meetings despite you proclaiming that "it'd be fun" and "there's free food". Have you seen Buddhists or Hindus or Muslims or any other religion for that matter, zealously trying to convert people? So why can't these Christian groups do the same and give people some space? Is it that hard to keep your own beliefs to yourself? Please, for goodness sake, let the nus environment remain a secular one. Live and let live. Peace out.

Dear op of , I suggest you don't deal with it alone. Many people do not understand when they don't have to deal with loved ones having a mental illness and is non-compliant with treatment.
I was almost driven to depression myself and that is when I decided to seek help. Having a qualified professional counsellor speak to you will help - greatly.
Go google Caregiver Alliance Singapore. The service is free and they have support groups for caregivers of loved ones who are suffering from various kinds of mental illness.
Through sharing of various stories and methods, you will be able to handle the issue better and you will also know that you are not alone. Hope this helps.

This whole abortion saga has been getting so heated I just wanted to share my humble opinions on the issue, and hopefully be the voice of reason, as much as we are all imperfect creatures with our own biased views based on religion, family, or environmental factors. 

(long post ahead, you have been warned)

1. Keep your emotions to yourself. 

Majority of the posts are loaded with strong emotions, written in an antagonistic tone which makes it difficult for rational people to take you seriously. Reason and emotion are opposites, and your tone by itself makes it apparent which side you are on. You wouldn't bet a life changing decision on emotions, so why dispense life changing advice in this way?

2. Pre-marital sex is only a sin to people who believe it is. 

I.e. religious people, or others who hold the same values. Aside from that, it is pleasurable, and an integral part of married life. I don't see any fault in anyone wanting to "test-drive" their partner's performance in bed. Those who disapprove should not attempt to stop anyone from sampling sex life with their potential partners in future.

The only things that would truly be difficult to approve of with regard to sex is promiscuity, because of the health hazards of sexually transmitted diseases, and infidelity, which is self explanatory.

3. Abortion is not the same as murder, or anything to the same degree. 

Yes, it is a fact that life exists at the moment of conception, similar to the life that already existed before conception, in the form of a sperm (which is produced and resorbed in the millions daily) and an egg (which is lost in every menstrual cycle). Those are the same forms of life as the bacteria that give you an infection when you get a cut, or the bad sore throats that the GP gives you antibiotics for. Just a single cell/group of cells. But that doesn't stop you from washing your hands or rinsing your mouth with Listerine (kill the germs, feel the fresh!), and we all know you'll get your boyfriends and fathers to smash the next cockroach that crawls into your room, while you squash every ant in close proximity and rain insecticide down on innocent moths and spiders that venture into your room.

The key issue here is consciousness. Does the tiny ball of cells know it is alive? Does it know about its existence, or is it merely executing programmed commands within its genetic code? Is it able to feel pain? These are philosophical and medical questions that even experts cannot agree upon at times. And a young man/lady in his/her early 20s thinks he/she has it figured out. It is only natural that people like myself be skeptical about the strength of the source.

As for whether it can feel pain, it is generally accepted in the world of medicine and medical ethics that a foetus at 24 weeks should not, which is why abortion is only available to those less than 24 weeks pregnant. And this is the law in Singapore, with the only exception being cases of medically proven severe or lethal foetal abnormalities. 

4. Say as much as the stake you have in this. 

Many people seem to be confused about their role in all this. We are merely casual observers, with no part to play in the decision. The OP had already made up her mind, as seen from how she requested for people not to give pro-life comments. Why not just let her have it her way? After all, with all your high-and-mighty attitudes, WILL ANY OF YOU DISSING HER STAND OUT AND SUPPORT HER "physically, mentally and financially", where she mentioned she was ill-prepared? Otherwise, who are we really, to try forcing our uninvited intervention onto her? You would be merely leading her onto the tougher path void of numerous opportunities and then ABANDONING her to suffer by herself. (Note that the caps was just meant to highlight what I believe to be the main point of my argument, given the lack of bold or italics)

5. Only say what is constructive.

The OP quite obviously has strong opinions and has made up her mind. So why bother with all the preaching? You're not going to change her mind on this anonymous platform by insulting anyone and making derogatory comments about someone else's morality. Rather than propagating and intensifying the tension between pro-life and pro-choice, shouldn't we all try to support her through this traumatising experience in one way or another, and keeping to ourselves if we have nothing productive to contribute towards her cause?

To the least, you may graciously consider how you could write a thoughtful, intelligent comment with the necessary references on how to get help "physically, mentally and financially", e.g. NGO and government websites, then put forth the idea that she reconsiders her decision. If you can put forward a strong case on how her fears are unfounded, I'm sure she will be more than glad to read what you have to say.

Finally, to all those who supported the OP, I'm glad that a community of individuals who believe in getting things done exist. And to those who haven't been putting much thought into the tone of their comments, please do consider the impact of your actions and words in future. Because even if you won't, others will, and their opinions of you will be based on that (aka they will judge you the same way you passed judgement on the OP).

Take care, , I wish you all the best in your pursuits in uni and in life.

So many ongoing posts regarding abortion and some poster insisting that the girl should not shove her responsibility aside by choosing abortion just for the sake of her boyfriend or her future. I got to disagree with OP  's idea that the baby should be delivered and give it up for adoption as opting for abortion is selfish and the girl may regret for life. So you mean that giving the baby away for adoption not an act of selfishness? You can say that you do not have the ability and finances to raise the child now. However, wouldn't there be a time when you feel apologetic towards this child? Wouldn't you regret giving your child away or want this child back especially when you start having your own family in the near future? The moment you start considering adoption as a means, it was already a quick fix. So please, stop criticizing on others' decisions and make it seems like you did the right thing.

You want to talk about pies? And who needs logic? Urm, you? Cause you seem to be lacking it. Are living things of such low value to you now? LOL. How about we compare it to something of a little higher value shall we?  You're gifted this brand new home. You don't need this home right now and having it would just be a complete burden. There is someone whom you know that are homeless for a very long period of time and are so deserving of your home. But you don't think you should give it to them. I mean why should you right? It would take months to get this home ready for them. Plus you're gonna be way too exhausted. You burn your house down cause it's way more convenient than giving it to someone else. Still not a selfish act to you? Look here. Abortion is an act of self. All of you stating that it's not is just plain stupidity. I'm selfish for not raising my own child? Well sorry for not choosing the quick fix then. Sorry for not killing a living thing. Sorry for not bearing the consequences of my actions and sorry for giving her up to people that truly deserve to be parents. I hope I burn in hell for that then. 

I wasn't coming from a place of hate or judgement. I did give her advice on letting her partner know and that she shouldn't be in this alone. Abortions can scar you terribly. All of you commenting have not been in our shoes. It's easy for you to say things. But can you really walk the talk if this were you right now? Don't be so quick to judge my opinion. You are going to feel guilty regardless of having this baby or not. But giving this child away just made me feel better than having that abortion. That's all I was trying to tell her. The decision is still obviously up to her.Geez.

I just saw on channel 8 6.30 news that they are building some school just to nurture talents for the mrt domain. I'm here to offer my 1 cent worth of opinion.

First, most mrt breakdowns are caused by pipe leakage. Have the engineers considered that weight may be the problem? The mrt at its max capacity may be too much for the pipes. Looking at how they test drive the new mrt, I would like to suggest them getting people or at least actual accountable weights on the mrt during the test drive. Or at least make sure the pipes are more durable than the usual ones.

I think this theory can be supported by the fact that most faults happened during peak hours with a lot of people. It's either the system is too old, which they should have seen it coming and start to change the tracks before anything happened, or the weight issue. Still, if the parts are indeed outdated, then regardless of the capacity, they should wear off and cause fault right?

I am a frequent commentator on NUSWhisper's statuses. And I must say, I feel slightly flattered that my presence on any one of the posts is seen as a "status symbol of legitimacy". But seriously, I'm just like any one of you here. Thanks for the approval though!

 I can probably identify with this. It just seems all my love interests in the past and present were such that I couldn’t really pinpoint exactly what it was about them that made me feel the way I did, though I could probably pinpoint what qualities they had which I liked. Perhaps that’s why they call it “falling” in love? Then again, it seems that many people would disagree. For me, it definitely isn’t naivety or just a fleeting phase as like you, I don’t get this from everyone of the opposite gender regardless of their good (or bad) qualities. When it hits, it lasts. I see it as something special and even more so if they are reciprocated, that is, the opposite party too feels the exact same way. To me, this is right. Maybe at the end of the day, it’s all crap and I’m just a hopeless dreamer, but I dream I must and dream I shall…

Reply to 
Hey. I'm "VH". Here's my take on the situation, someone is clearly offended by my remarks about the difficulty of some of the modules. Two possibilities present themselves. One, he/she is truly infatuated and lost faith in me. Two, he/she is just indignant. In either case, I'd just like to explain the possibly "arrogant" comments you overheard. 

The joke is lost if it has to be explained, it seems I would have to. It is self-deprecating humor, I only crack these jokes to friends who understand the context. Perhaps it just appeals to my sense of humor to mock whatever arrogance we have concealed. You were not the intended audience and I'm sorry you had to hear these comments. That's not to say that these jokes bear no truth to them, in fact, it would be fair to say that the CM2101 and CM2142 syllabi have been watered down considerably over the past 3-4 years. 

I digress. You have probably overheard one of these comments I made to the people I know. But think again, I had never confronted anyone with insults along the lines of "you suck, try harder". I am sorry that you were eavesdropping and misinterpreted my words. I suggest you speak to me instead. Thanks,
Shawn

I don't like the direction NUSWhisper is heading to. It is becoming like NTU confession with all the sex talks and discussions.

Reading all the posts on relationships (the issues on pre-marital sex and what not) reminded me of an article I read a while back titled, "The All-or-Nothing Marriage". 

In the article it expresses that the marriage of old was a practical decision, made in order to have a home and have security. Nowadays, people are striving for self-actualization, self-discovery, and growth. Marriages for that purpose was dubbed as "self-expressive marriage".

I found it extremely intriguing. It made me wonder, if people now look for relationships to find personal fulfilment, wasn't it necessary to first understand ourselves? All the questions on what happens when religions or opinions on pre-marital sex defer, isn't the more important answer why and where did these opinions stem from?

What is my stance on religion and why will my stance not change? Why is not having pre-marital sex so important to me; is it just to be socially accepted? If I see it as an act of indecency, why do I think that way? Does someone who has had pre-marital sex less moral or undeserving (to me it depends of cos)?

And I think these questions are important because the issues that surface are usually a contradiction between what one truly feels and what they hope their significant other will feel. The OP does not truly feel that he/she is wrong, but think their partner will think they are.

Sadly, after such heavy pondering, the next important question would naturally be, in light of this contradiction, would you still be able to have a "self-expressive marriage"?

Will religion affect a relationship? 

I've been thinking about this question lately because there's this girl that I wouldn't mind starting a relationship with. She's Christian and I'm a theist (someone who believes in the existence of a God but doesn't follow a religion). 

One of my friend told me that it's better not to get involved in such relationships because the difference in beliefs will, sooner or later, lead to frictions. My family members are all freethinkers and I don't think they will strongly object against this, but I don't know whether her family members will think otherwise. I've had a few Christian friends whom I've heard from personally that they will only want Christian partners. 

What should I do? I don't want to convert to a religion in order to sustain a relationship,  because doing so means that I'm not true to that religion (not being religious, just my opinion).

Where do I put my faith? Relationship or religion (beliefs, for this matter)?

making silly grammatical mistakes simply to obfuscate my identity; changing a number or a fact to confound those who might be acquainted with me, every single time i make a whisper, to remain incognito; only to realise i am not alone.

So what? I like funny shit on facebook. Why do you have to judge? Just cause I like such videos, I'm stupid? Goodness, its purely for entertainment. Sorry I can't be like you.

Been through 20+ years of education in Singapore and I don't understand the education system. Education is supposed to equip us with knowledge and skills to build a better world together. However, why are we paying to learn to pay to live? Our focus has been shifted to work for our own survival instead of creating better place to live in.

During my younger years, I was told to study hard to get good grades just because I have to. After national service, I applied to university just because everyone was doing so. I do not know what I really wanted. 

Now, I realized that i will be in a big debt right after I graduate. I must find a job fast while competing with everyone else. We were trained to be defensive of our livehood even if it means someone else has to suffer. This is definitely not what I wanted. I believe this is not wanted by anyone else either.
 
Imagine a world where everyone receive the happiness from their heart simply by sharing. The sufferings in this world will be minimized. There will be less-to-no poverty and less-to-no racism. Everyone gives and takes in harmony. We will receive lots and lots of happiness, more than we can ever imagine; which, I believe, is what we truely want. It may seem unattainable at first, but aren't we always dreaming of the ideal and desperately searching for it? 
If we seek, we will find. If we ask, we will be given. If we keep knocking, the door will be opened. 

Just a few cents of my thoughts.

The past is not perfect, life was harsh and the law was very strict.

But I feel that there has been a systematic effort to portray old SG as a utterly miserable place - fishing village/slum/longkangs filled with shiat and vomit etc. - in order to instill a false sense of progress.

In reality, there are many things that regressed in today's SG - loss of pension schemes, loss of professional job security, loss of purchasing power, loss of empathy and group cohesion, education inflation, unaffordable housing, cars and healthcare etc.

That's why young people are distracted with new shiny tech toys and branded products so that they won't think about the past.

I knew I am doomed for my exams. So I started praying for the bell curve god. Then I heard a deep and commanding voice in my head saying in English, "I AM HERE!" I pleaded for him to help me. He told me I had not worship him enough, and I did not give him my full devotion. Then I wept.

"What do you want me to then? I've always been praying to you."

Then he replied. 

"Yes I know you are devoted and faithful, but you have been worshiping me the wrong way you damn fool."

And I asked him how can I worship him in the right and authentic way.

He told me, "Great things in life are achieved not by hoping for a big miracle to happen, but instead it's achieved by doing the small and ordinary things well everyday. And these are the things many people often overlook and take for granted. Do these and you'll be blessed for your exams."

As the voice fade, I pick up my notes and start studying.

I just want to gather some opinion on this issue. Lets say if your partner has this genetic deformity which leads to an increased risk in having early death/health problems like sclerosis, organ failure etc. Will you still go long term and marry the person?
If the latter happens, will you then want to bear the risk of having your child being exposed to these kinds hereditary risks?
Will it be better off removing these genes from our gene pool instead of perpetuating this cycle?
How comprehensive is the current foetus genetic screening?
Should we adopt in the future instead of giving birth to our own kids?

In life, people come and go at different phases. Surely, they will leave an impression or memories after you meet them.

However, when they leave you, miss them but never hate them; keep them in my memories for you never know when you might meet them again in life and realised how much importance they carry in the process of helping you grow.

I would like to thank the people, who have helped me to become who I am today, be it in a good or bad way, every single one of you made an impact and taught me things in my life. 

You have my eternal gratitude.

 Just want to point out: Based on statistics published by ICA, the majority of SPRs and new citizens are Chinese from Malaysia. I don't know what's your true attention of writing such post. I hope you are not purposely creating social conflicts. Especially the part "They said they that the rectangular piece of plastic is only for the privileges they can get, and they only regard their 'motherland' to be their own country" - I don't believe people will tell you in such a straight way even if it's their true thought.

I have been watching this person I know destroy himself slowly over his love for a married woman. I think he is blinded by the perceived slight to his ego that she has rejected him, and he has developed some unhealthy obsessions. I mean this well: It is time to lick your wounds, acknowledge your failure, pivot and move on.

Hi admins, I hope you’ll post this. It’s fine if you don’t but I just wanted to give a proper tribute to the tutorial which started out as my most feared but became one of the funniest I’ve had. Being a fan of meticulous preparation, I was never good at impromptus. It’s ironic that this only came to mind right after I finished, so I figured, why not? Always good to have closure. So here’s a shoutout to a bunch that made tutorial evenings funny.

Mobile phones. We hardly go a day without them, so it’s hard to imagine a time without. It’s a digital age and thanks to our phones, information is right at our fingertips, literally.

Say you want to give an impromptu on Paris, whip it out and start scrolling through wiki as you speak. On that note, say you want to travel, access to travel websites lie right in your palm. Say you want humour, download a 9gag app. Say childhood nostalgia hits you, better hurry and log on to see if your neopets are still alive or if chatboards still reminisce about winx club. Feeling down in the dumps? Call someone you love. Philosophical ponderings about free will? Unlimited lifelines to call a friend, who probably won’t know the answer anyway. Can’t speak Japanese? Google translate it right then and there. Horny? Not recommended but heck, indulge in your fetishes on the go if you want. Although screenwise, bigger is always better (inb4 that’s what she said). Some even say mobile phones can communicate with aliens. I think it’s utter bull, but just so nobody thinks you’re one, all it takes is a quick search to find that NUS student population isn’t really 2 million. 

The uses seem unlimited, yet none of it is native to the phone. It is what it is because of the people and content around it. Likewise, these tutorials have been valuable because of you people and your ideas. Mobile phones may have unlimited potential, but hey, we’re the ones who made the darn thing in the first place. We have so much more potential in us. So don’t give up on your hopes, dreams and well, CAP I guess. It’s been great knowing you guys, all the best for finals!

We want our kids to be healthy and good-looking so we look for partners that exhibit those traits. We want our family to be able to sustain higher standards of living so we look for partners that are financially stable/promising. We only settle for less attractive deals when we know that we can't demand for more. Love is just a contract. 

At least now I can be sure that my kids will not suffer, because they will not exist.

This is a response to confession ,

From your contemplations, I’m guessing you are comfortable with who you are and are accepting of it. There is nothing wrong with being gay.

To quote “Sometimes I want to come out and tell my friends the truth”. Never give yourself the pressure thinking that you have to tell them. Take as much time as you need to be comfortable and prepared to tell them. It is definitely a big thing and be realistic in how much time you give yourself and how you plan to do it. Are you someone who plans and do things according to a daily planner strictly or do things more free style and spontaneously?

Choose who you confide in by testing the ground first. When the opportunity arises, ask your closer friends about homosexuality. See how they react or how they respond to remarks made by others about this topic. The principles that undergird their stand of this issue should give you a pretty good idea if you should come out to them. It is always a calculated risk coming out but it is good to first consider the odds to be in your favour.

Coming out to friends is usually easier than family and having a group of friend who know about your sexual orientation will support you in coming out to your family. Once you have decided who to tell, ease the person into the topic by discussing something general before telling him/her about you. Usually small groups are ideal and are more manageable, especially for the first few times. 
I came out to a couple of friends (Yes, I was a similar situation as you and was closeted all along) and our conversations helped me to reflect on the motivations for me to come out to my parents. Listening to discussions between my parents issues concerning homosexuality also shaped my decision to eventually tell them. I personally made a decision in the first-half of the year to tell them before my birthday in Oct this year. My belief is that if your parents’ act of love brought you into this world, they will accept you for who you are. I hope this will spur you on when making your decisions of coming out.

Approaching support groups and organisations (e.g. Oogachaga Singapore) which support LGBT in their efforts to come out to other is another avenue you can consider. There are professionals who are very keen to help, working closely with you and your parents.

TLDR: Decide who to tell, based on their opinions of homosexuality. It is not easy so take as much time you need to be ready and comfortable in coming out. Slowly form a support structure from your friends, family, external support groups / organisations to help you in your efforts.

Wishing you all the best in your efforts in coming out ;)

 The same reason why companies in Singapore shunned local workers. Employers keep on complaining how bad the local graduates are and keep praising foreign talents.

Just want to point out some stuff as I noticed some have an overly-simplified view of the "china-taiwan issue". Anyway, this issue is referenced as "2 lands " and PRC is referenced as "mainland" in mandarin, which can give a subtle difference on how people interpret the issue.

Taiwan as an island has been part of the historical China ( especially occupied legally by Ming dynasty-loyalists (eg Zheng Cheng Gong, regarded culturally a Han Hero)  and subsequently Qing dynasty) and also saw many migrations from the mainland throughout history. Most people from both sides (except maybe the aboriginal taiwanese) share the same history. Therefore, there is undeniably a strong cultural and emotional connection.

In recent history, KMT, which overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the first ROC, lost the civil with the CCP, and fled to Taiwan and established it as their new stronghold. Even so, as they rule Taiwan, they never gave up claim on their legitimate claim on the Mainland (now known as PRC ), a difference from the history of USA and Britain.

Now, there are 2 main political parties and ideologies in Taiwan; KMT and DPP (somewhat like democrats and republicans in USA). One is inclined towards eventual reunification and another is inclined towards independence. There is a group of people who seek to restore the the concept of a unified "China"  and another group who seek a Republic of Taiwan.

So it is not a simple issue of "big bad bully who want to claim more land for itself" as many may understand it. Many cultural, emotional and practical considerations.

I was taking the bus home from school yesterday during peak hour. As i proceeded to tap my card on the ezlink machine, I found a large man resting on it. Initially, I was appalled at his inconsiderate behaviour. Like the others who had boarded the bus before me, I leaned over to the other machine to tap my card. Thoughts ran through my mind as I formed my impression of the man. He was clearly old (grey hair), poor (simply dressed, and smelled of urine), and had a lack of self control in his diet (fat). I found myself inching as far away as possible from him, but it was of no avail as the bus was packed. I was trapped directly behind him. If the bus turned and he fell over (which was highly probable because he seemed to be incapable of balancing himself), I would be squashed. The old man went into a violent coughing fit, and the passengers around me subtly inched away as well, for fear of catching his germs.

However, thoughts of Sociology class (SC1101E, of all things!) crossed my mind. This man was the epitome of a deviant, and we were seeing him as something different. something disgusting. something harmful. However, he was merely a victim of societal forces, fallen through the cracks of the safety net that is society. Our judgmental views of him were merely based on the sole fact that he was different. That was all. I stole a glance at him once more. This time, I saw his eyes. His eyes were full of sorrow and fatigue. 

Yesterday, I saw the value in a human. Yesterday, I saw the value in my Arts education, to understand society, and to suspend judgment. As cheesy as it may sound, with power comes great responsibility. Knowing is useless, if we do not use it to change the world. I challenge thee to make a difference.

It is shocking to see the number of non-NUS people commenting on this page. Who knows how many of the confessions are really from NUS? Should there be some quality control or this page would eventually lose its meaning?

To the commenter who said I was ruining the reputation of my school just because I said there were some inconsiderate people who were talking loudly. Firstly, you made judgements simply based on assumptions and generalizations. Do you know that it is dangerous especially if you lack knowledge on a particular subject?Perhaps I shall recommend you to take some communications module which teaches you about judgements as well as ethics, be it on social media platform or any real life situations as well? I am sure your school offers such modules as well.

Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves; it results from some ecological or naturalistic wisdom, and is not always bad -- at an existential level, it is my body rebelling against its entrapment. It is my soul fighting the Procrustean bed of modernity.

Sighhh....why is love so hard. Loving someone of a different race is a very difficult process. My parents do not agree to it as they find that religion plays a huge difference. Dating someone doesn't always mean he's the one that we should marry but my parents think otherwise they think of the long term consequences. I understand where their coming from but can't they just give us a chance. Has anyone out there married the ones they loved but did not change their religion for the marriage to work here?

 You learn the most by thinking and playing outside the classroom. When you rely on your professors for too long, your brain starts to entropy. That's why many university students have lost their own capacity to learn on their own after they graduated.

"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. In learning to write, the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil: so in reading; the greater part of the work of thought is already done for us.

This is why it relieves us to take up a book after being occupied with our own thoughts. And in reading, the mind is, in fact, only the playground of another’s thoughts. 

So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last forgets how to walk. This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid."

I'm a 1st generation Singaporean. I am proud to say that I have never felt discriminated against. However, what I overheard today outside of the LT at AS6 has made me question whether it is just because it was never said to me directly.  

There was a group of students in a heated discussion. The guy suddenly said "BUT HE IS INDIAN. I don't know if he understands what we are trying to say." They continued their discussion in Chinese but when one of them replied with "so what if he's Indian", he brushed away her comment in English and continued speaking in Chinese. That girl didn't look like a chinese to me but she seem to understand their conversation. 

I learnt that I shouldn't assume that just because I have not been a direct target that discrimination and racism does not exist. Neither will a university level education eradicate such mindsets.

Some advice for that guy, maybe you should look around before you make such comments. You never know who is listening. Thanks, but no thanks, for the lesson.

@10919 Exactly! I dont understand why so many Christians prioritise their partner's religion over their partner. Like yes i do understand you are very devout in your religion, but i dont see what my religion has got to do with you and why MUST i convert to your religion. Its not like I go around denouncing your religion like what many black sheep of your religion does.

After a bad experience with my exgf who was a first-gen christian and so adamant about me converting, i guess im actually quite afraid/turned off when the girl im interested in/is interested in me is a christian... (and adopting a religion for the sake of a relationship is so shallow, I'd rather give up on the relationship than adopt Christianity 'because my partner wants me to')

im not saying all Christians are like that, but most are. How sad.

Why can't Christian girls accept guys who are non-believers of the same faith? We still respect your religion alright :(

Stop with the "men are not meant to be monogamous" bullshit. Whether or not a person chooses to remain faithful to his/her partner is exactly that, A CHOICE. Don't use "monogamous is unnatural" as an excuse for your infidelity. If you think that being polyamorous works for you, then so be it. Enter the relationship with both parties' expectations laid out. You don't need to keep telling people that your preference is the only one that is right.

Dear guys, and even experienced girls. I have a problem and would like to seek advice cos frankly this affects my confidence quite abit.

I have sex with my girlfriend, and have no problem getting hard. The problem comes when I wear a condom. I cannot sustain my hard on with a condom and fail to perform. I have no issues finishing off raw without protection but an unplanned pregnancy is something I dont want to think about.

Anyone able to recommend a solution or advice why this is the case, or is there any recommeded brands of rubber that will be better.

I want to please her, but in a safe way. Much appreciated.

To  
It is well established by studies that women with higher education have higher expectations. This is one of the reasons why the more highly educated a woman is, the less likely she will eventually be married. Furthermore, it is estimated that educating women reduces marriage rate by about 25%.

It's mainly the expectations of women. You know why? Because men who gain wealth and status, are highly educated etc, are still willing to marry women of lower social status.

A man, regardless of whether he earns 3k or 9k more or less still wants the same thing from his woman; things such as beauty, faithfulness and obedience, and these are available to women regardless of their social status, and have not changed through the ages.

For women on the other hand, it is a completely different story. Women who earn 3k want a man who earns at least 3k. A woman who earns 9k wants a man who at least earns 9k. This is known as hypergamy.

Women are biologically not to blame. Men are not choosy about women because in the past, (to some extent still true today) men could have many women. Think of them like lions in a pride. The status of each individual woman doesn't matter that much because you don't need to pick one. If you have the wealth and power, you could have them all.

For women on the other hand, childbearing is a difficult, and sometimes life-threatening process. Thus if they had to choose, they will always go for the best male on instinct. The stronger the male, the better he can protect his woman. The richer he is, the better he can provide for her etc. Thus you can see why women developed to be hypergamous.

How the hell do we prevent rapes? The fact that it's a crime tells us that it is strictly discouraged to do so but yet there are still rapists. Humans are impulsive creatures, trying to stop all crimes from happening through education is just like a fairy tale. So instead of wanting rapists to stop raping since that is already in place by law, why not try to prevent it yourself. In my opinion, girls wearing mini jeans that expose half of their butts are seriously asking for it. But sure, you can wear whatever you want.

From talking to my friends, Sg girls are really materialistic and demanding especially when choosing bfs. They truly think that it's all about the money and look for wealthy guys, regardless of whether the guy is really suited for her in terms of personality and chemistry

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=newtEqvWaBA

Why not go for the typical guy next door? They're simple minded, appreciate the simplicity of life, mostly frugal and at the same time working hard and trying to find ways to make their mark in their life or career. After 20+ years of existence, one should have realized that worldly artifacts can hardly, or never replace true affection and love received from someone who you truly love. 

Some girls get wealthy guys to solve problems or to achieve some goals, for instance to resolve financial difficulties for her own family or to have a free ticket to travel the world. But if you're not, please think it thoroughly either way, there will definitely be regret.

To  i am the OP to the replies to your confession. I suggest you read my previous confession.

 Hey Tristan. OP here.
Yes you are right. We should address the rapist.
I did some research. I must say every case is different. There are different motivations to commit the same crime. (opportunistic rapist, anger rapist, sadistic rapists, sexual rapists etc)
Some possible causes:
Neurobiological impairment
Psychiatric disorders
Paraphilia
Dysfunctional famiy relations, physical and sexual abuse
Sociopathic behavior (possible warning flag)
Cognitive distortion of schema.
Its not that simple. There is sadly no panacea to the problem. Every cause has to be addressed separately because rapists cannot be addressed as a group. There are different sicknesses, state of minds and motivations.
Education is important. (knowledge of the crime, teaching consent in a non sexually biased manner) A more pragmatic approach towards mental health and social behavior from a young age is even more important.
Rapists can strike anywhere anytime. People you know or you dont know. Just like any other crimes.
Victims should never blame themselves or be attributed to the cause of such crimes because this gives the perpetrators the power over the victims.
Do watch if you have the time!

A comment on the "rapist"confession stated that he would have done it anyway regardless of what she wore. 

Sexual urges more often than not come from stimulation, most likely visual stimulation in this case and OBVIOUSLY  a girl showing more skin or curves on her body would be more susceptible. 

Put your feet in a rapist shoes. You have a guy wearing a tight singlet nice pecs or a guy wearing a baggy jacket and you had the strength to overpower them. Of course id rape the guy who I know would have a nice body.

Thats said we can never generalise the trigger for sexual urgers for rapists. It would differ from person to person. But the GENERAL male triggers are pretty obvious. (Not sure about girls)

I once read a girl wearing short shorts in indochina noticed she was being stared by men at everywhere she went. It would probably be the same in seemingly more conservative societies where women cover up. 

Men are programmed to be stimulated either way. But its a matter of how they control their urges.

Im not saying you dont have a freedom to flaunt it. And I am not victim blaming here. But of course criminals make some from of decision to get the best possible prey within their means. 

Just saying it more often than not affects the decisionmaking of a rapist.

I don't get why the guys here comment so much on how girls mostly just adore guys who are rich. Assuming that the bulk of us will marry other NUS undergrads who will have a starting pay of 3k+ on average I honestly don't really look at earning power that much. 3k is not bad already although not rich and I (hopefully) will also be earning so I will really look at the guy's character more. Or am I missing out on something?? Please stop saying ALL girls like rich guys.

Prof Giorgos was hilarious in the EC1301 lecture this morning. His continuous jokes about the current financial crisis in Greece made me keep laughing throughout the lecture. The fact that he also comes from  Greece was also amusing and fascinating. He pointed out how fortunate we were to be able to live in a strong economy like that of Singapore and we should be proud to live in a country like that. I think this was my most entertaining lecture so far and hope to enjoy more in the coming weeks. Thanks Prof for making my day.

My good friend (who is also my teacher) said I accused him/her for teaching things that he/her did not taught me. Now he/she is very mad at me. All friends know that he/she is angry and stand on his/her side.

How ? What should I do?

To the OP of  Do you know what 'playing the race card' means? It refers to someone exploiting prejudice against another race to gain some sort of advantage. What 'advantage' was I was apparently supposed to have gained from this anonymous platform? To be the only Indian in that class, and to have a person stare at you with absolute disgust on their face while they spoke about an unfortunate event, that you are racially linked to, is just not okay. It's demeaning and unacceptable. And if you still can't fathom that, I'm honestly speechless. That post was about the presenter, but you made it about me. Quit coming up with excuses for people like him and telling people like me to 'chill'. Why should I tolerate such behaviour? No reason to.

Seriously, stop blaming everything on racism. Racism is the belief that there are biological differences between races that make one superior (or inferior) to another. Singaporean society (generally speaking) and NUS ain't racist, most people are just immature, insensitive and don't know when to draw the line. Remember, offense is taken, not given, so stop labeling everything as 'racist' to justify your flaws and play the victim when perhaps it has nothing to do with race. 

I'm from a minority race, not the best looking guy either, and for the longest time I thought I was a victim of racism (bullying, name-calling, Chinese girls not going out with me etc.), but one day I realized that the problem isn't this perceived 'racism' but I realized I was an asshole. And that if I were Chinese, I'd be the same. Looking back, I realized people treated me the way they did not because of my race, but because of who I was as an individual (personality, character, behavior etc.) 

Keep playing the race and minority card and of course EVERYTHING will be racist to you LAH, even a bloody tutorial presentation. Have you ever considered everything else in between before you concluded: "Yep, he's/she's racist."?

Look inwards la, maybe ya'll just assholes (like I was) that's why people don't like you: Nothing to do with your race. 

So many people here so quick to jump onto the 'racism' bandwagon and trying to call out racism and name and shame people. Ironically, it's always the people who claim to be all-loving and equal who demonstrate and practice the most hate and negativity in their words and actions.

And seriously, if the source of 'racism' is from your friends, then ya'll need to tell your friends to shut the fuck up, grow up, or find new friends. Your shitty 'racist' group of friends ain't a reflection of society you know.

With reference to  and , 
Back in BMT I had a sergeant who told us that because his own sergeants treated him like shit during his time in BMT, he was gonna make us suffer the same way he suffered. Throughout the entire BMT he was incredibly unreasonable and made us suffer and suffer everyday and I began to realize that it really wasn't because he wanted us to go through the same thing so that we can become better people; rather, he enjoyed watching us suffer. Some people are just like that, to quote The Dark Knight "Some people just want to watch the world burn.". Whether it was previous psychological trauma that caused them to behave that way, doesn't give them the luxury of being sympathized with. Torturing others for the sake of your own amusement is not something that you can simply give an excuse for, or apologize for. Such a matter cannot be forgiven by means of a simple apology; it doesn't and shouldn't work that way. 
As much as vicious cycles go,  there really isn't one. Bullied people like me knows what it's like to be bullied, so we tend to be a lot nicer to people around us. I feel that it has made me a better person in general,  but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't jump at the chance to make any of my bullies suffer for what they did. Some people do deserve punishment after all. Not saying that'm advocating violence though, just to be clear, we're not that uncivilized, unlike some of the bullies I've met. But there are ways to make them pay without ever using violence if you know how. ;)

After seeing so many cheating posts of girls cheating on guys and guys cheating on girls on NUSWhispers, it really makes me rethink the concept of sex. Is it merely a social construct that one should only do it with one partner? Or is this whole concept of having a girlfriend/boyfriend(singular) flawed? What if humans, like animals, just have that innate need (not desire) to copulate? I am looking forward to a heated discussion of human morality on this. Cheers! :)

 OP, here are some advices on marriage from the mad German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: 

"It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."

"When marrying, ask yourself this question: Do you believe that you will be able to converse well with this person into your old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory."

To the OP of 

I'm sincerely hoping you're not serious and that post was a troll, but assuming it is true, I would sincerely like you to rethink this. 

For context, I have been sexually harassed for a period of time and so have many other girls been. And that includes having our underwear stolen. This is why I feel so strongly about your post. 

I understand your point that it is quick and easy money, but what you're also doing is letting these guys see you as some kind of tool to satisfy their fetishes and fantasies. They do not respect you. Furthermore, what you're doing is fueling a market for it, and by willingly participating in this, it signals to these guys that such things are actually okay - but it is not. It is true that this market already exists, and if you were to stop, other girls will be making the money that you could be making. But I implore you to pause and think, because this is not just about a 'business' or money, this actually goes some way towards normalising such behaviour and perception. This will always exist, somehow, somewhere, but I think this should not be perpetuated, especially if you don't like it yourself. 

One could say that your case is different from mine, because when you sell your underwear it is a contract between two willing parties, very unlike one having her panties unwillingly stolen. But my point still remains that it is the behaviour of coveting used panties and using them in such a way that should not be in any way encouraged. 

You mentioned in your post that these are creepy and perverse men. You yourself are disgusted and don't really want to believe in guys anymore. You yourself realise you're being a hypocrite by continuing with this. You need to save yourself and walk away because you're worth so much more than this. 

That being said, if you do think about it and come to a conclusion that you really don't mind this at all, then this really is your decision and I am really in no position to do or say anything. Just stay safe, please.

 You could have compassion (not pity) for him for having a "massive-ass ego" instead of this. I am not sure if it's an ego thing, or does it have more to do with a low EQ (not taking a potshot, just a possibly-flawed perception).

"particular fellow": you may want to step back and do some introspection. How would you feel if your platform is successful and someone keeps trying advertise their less popular competing platform on your platform? Hold it... Hold it before answering "Well, it's fair game. As long as it's within the terms and conditions of the platform". If you answer this way, I'll say it is indeed fair game, but it's not nice. Do consider that the admin here have not kind enough not to censor your (a potential competitor) comments. Reciprocating a little bit will go a long way.

Also, what you're building is a social platform, where the social aspect of users are very important. Do you think that you can increase your user base by irritating them? It's not just the vocal ones, but the many who are silent on this topic.

Lest you all find this post presumptuous and holier-than-thou, I apologise, albeit anonymously. I'm the worst! I'm the worst! I have all the flaws I perceived you people to have and even more. Why not just give them (flaws) all to me?

Hi  I do agree with you. I thought about replying on the post directly but thought better of it. I think those who have been insinuating you are Herbert and who have been criticising Herbert are really quite judgemental. I was friends with some of them and have distanced myself after discovering how bitchy they can be. :( Even Ben Leong doesn't know who Herbert is and he comments on NUSWhispers a lot more than I do. So I think this saga is a bit distorted. Only a few are reacting so much to Herbert and just because they can't tolerate him. That's sad.

P.S. I don't think you are Herbert. I am also not Herbert (for those who think I am).

Reply to  

Are you sure you're from a strict religious family? If so, how do you find the time and place to do your thing? My parents are STRICT. They don't let me live in hall, they ask me who I'm going out with and what time I'll be back, they know all of my friends. I don't resent them. I know they do it to protect me. 

Maybe it's different for you, but I've heard the stories of heartbreaks of my friends who had FWBs. Some of them are guys even. One of them got a girl pregnant, but the girl wasn't even sure if he was the father. It caused him a lot of grief. 

There is good reason why religion restricts sex to married couples only, that is to prevent all these problems of unwanted pregnancies and both parties being too immature to be parents (note: Sherry Goh and Jeremy Toh), or sharing your soul with someone and getting dumped and going through heartbreak. But maybe, for you it's just a physical release and you use good protection. I wouldn't do that if I were you, but it's your v so you can do whatever you want with it. Just remember that there are consequences to every decision you make in life. 

Life isn't all about sex. Marriage isn't all about sex. I would have just said that if I were your uncle/aunt when you questioned about your aunt trying other dicks. 

That's my 2 cents worth. Wishing you a good CAP when you grad.

I have never submitted a confession, but I saw two pieces of news which struck me with a feel of unjustness that cries out to be said...

Anyone saw the article about the woman sentenced to 5 days detention for making a false rape claim, while it is justified that one should not make such fallacious claims especially when the other party is looking at 8 years or more jail time? (CNA, 2015) Where a man was sentenced for (just) molesting on public transport. 

After looking at both articles within one swipe of a facebook news feed,  wouldn't you feel that 5 days is letting her off a little too lightly? While the police makes serious on all claims involving outrages of modesty to rape, shouldn't they also take seriously a woman's crime should she make a false claim, especially if its made out of malice or worse...indecision/not knowing what to do when caught in the situation.... and to incriminate another person's life just on being caught in the situation of not being called on contempt of the law? I find it really ludicrous that she just got 5 days, but still it is a laudable step in the right direction. Who else thinks that she got off too lightly?

Are there any atheists out there in NUS? There are currently no atheist/humanist groups or CCAs in NUS. It gets a little lonely when you have no one to talk to on issues relating to Humanism, Atheism or Religion.

To 

Others also have to tolerate all the loud and bad getai performances (which sometimes takes up parking spaces btw) that lasts till past 11pm (i think thats not allowed, even?). 

Also, most of us (not just malays, mind you. Practicially every one who doesnt practice these rituals may feel the same way) can tolerate burning of papers and sticks but when you dont use the proper facilities or areas, thats when it gets annoying. If got fire then how? Also, tossing of those papers is littering. Its illegal and punishable. And a serious pain in the eye! No we dont clean it up? Old uncles and aunties do, or maybe the banglas. After your mess. 

Point is, we do complain, its in our nature! But we do tolerate too. Because we understand that its ur religion etc. If we dont we wouldve hosed down those fires ourselves. 

 Just as you hate our loud karaoke sessions, complain on fb but not take any serious actions, we do the same about your burnings and loud getai shows. 

Maybe by SG100 then we all can accept (instead of just tolerating) racial/religious differences.

It annoys me that some people are saying "You better don't complaint over the next 5 years" How does this even make any sense? Let me put this rationally and I hope this actually make sense to everyone. 

I acknowledge that the Singapore government is not perfect and I dare say that there is no perfect government in the world. It is all about give and take, choosing what is the best for our future. I voted for the PAP but I am sure as hell going to complaint about the things that are not right and needs improvement. If no one complaint, who will notice the things that needs to be changed? 

Things are constantly changing, even if tomorrow the MRT arrives at a frequency 1min faster, you are still going to complaint. I am just grateful that the trains are working most of the time and when it is down, at least they provide free transport. I went to UK over the summer and it was nightmare during the tube strike. I had to walk 1hour to get to a less crowded bus stop nearing mid night to get home. I am not saying transport in Singapore is definitely better but there are some things done right here. 

There are many things that need to be addressed over the next 5,10,20 even 50 years but I am not going to put my future, my kids' future into some guy knocking on my door selling me ideals without any plans. I am not a die-hard PAP loyal supporter. I voted for what I think is the best. I am yet to be convinced by the opposition at this point of time. They seem to be giving up and telling us to stop calling for them to contest if we are not supporting them. Come on,  if this is the best you have got, I am glad that PAP is ruling the country. Get your shit together and convince all the fellow Singaporean in the next GE.

After GE2015, I noticed that there are just too many complaints and rants made about the Singaporean government and the results of the general election. One particular rant was about how democracy is dead and how Singapore should just remove the word democracy in her National Pledge.

What was going through my mind was the thought of how these people could have stepped up and make Singapore a better way. 

I believe that when people have their own opinions about electoral problems and governmental feedback, they must have their own vision for their own country, for Singapore. What I want to point out is that, why not change the country from the inside, by actually trying to run the government? You have your own opinions about the government, sure, but I really want to point out that you may not fully understand how the government works, even if you had an extensive study about it, until you ACTUALLY take part in it. I believe there are just a lot of other factors involved, because the people running the government are just humans. They are not robots, surely they have their emotional side affecting their line of work as well. In a perfect world, this shouldn't affect their work at all but nothing is perfect in this world right?

To those people commenting and ranting about how stupidly the people voted for the ruling party (again), how badly this country is being run, et cetera, et cetera, my suggestion is: try running for the government. You can rant all you want but in the end, if you do nothing about it, you are just people we call NATO (no action, talk only). You say that Singapore, this lovely country, is hopeless and therefore you want to just don't want to be associated to your home country, your country by birth. You are just trying to escape reality. You don't want to be associated to what you see as a failure in your eyes. What does this say about you? I think you just do not dare to take the most important step in your life: to actually realize your vision you are holding for your home country. So I challenge you, to take this step to ACTUALLY do something to Singapore, not to just rant about how this system is. 

TL;DR: Stop ranting, do something, don't talk too much, don't be a coward, BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE.

Seeing ytd's results, frankly, I'm quite disappointed that opposition, in particular WP, didn't win more seats (like at least one more GRC). The fact that they won Aljunied by a very slim margin is worrying. It's like ppl think that PAP is doing such a good job and we don't need to create competition for them. I'm definitely not saying that the opposition is decent (look at RP, SingFirst and some other candidates like the Boo PAP guy), but I feel we should follow PAP policy of introducing competition to improve the standard. Other than that, I still got some questions in mind

1) Regarding the sensitive issue of population, why is the govt not doing more to encourage ppl to have more babies? It's after all the root problem. Falling birth rate > shrinking/ageing pop. > get more foreigners > social discontent. Yes there are some policies in place, but they seem to be like the wayang kind w/o tackling the problem seriously.
2) Transportation. So they claimed Mr Lui is a capable man who done his best to improve transportation. If he's really that good, are we doomed to accept this quality of transport? I hate packing myself into MRT like a sardine and I don't agree with #BagsDownBenny , it is simply a move to allow them to pack us more efficiently($$$). I wonder if any of the MPs tried taking the MRT from Bishan to Jurong at around 6.30pm. They should do that every week. And the waiting time is alrdy 1min, what are we gonna do when the pop. is at 6.9m?! Yet no one talk about this issue during this GE (correct me if I'm wrong)

Ok so it sucks being the minority as indicated by the results. Maybe I'm just pro-opposition (again not RP,SingFirst and the other jokers). Maybe someone can convince me that PAP is still the best. Or perhaps if you can't beat them, join them. Sigh
[End of rant]

I am just interested in politics so I read I watch I listen. The moment when I see how some of the candidates attack each other by showing how bad their opponents' parties are instead of addressing the key issues, I suddenly miss Mr LKY a lot...just how he delivered his speeches in the past...with so much strength, logic and persuasion..."Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him. Or give it up"

Politics related rant here. So I watched the rally video yesterday of Mr Chiam (https://www.facebook.com/todayonline/videos/10153248278982572/) and I cannot help but feel that if you really love/respect Mr Chiam, please let him get some long overdue rest. Seeing him up there on stage, struggling to speak, it feels as if everyone is politicizing him for their own gain. Perhaps Mr Chiam wants to support his wife but tbh, if I am Lina Loh, I would rather my husband rest and fight my own battles. Why must your campaign constantly be, "Oh support me because I have my husband's support?"

I agree with . There are parents who don't love their child and do a shit job at parenting. And then there are those who love their child but still do a shit job at parenting. I'm not being unappreciative or anything, because I have loving parents who raised me pretty well. I just wanted to point out that it's not the case for everyone and that's all the more reason to be more appreciative of our parents.

With regards to all the 7th month and the burning going on, where do we draw the line between acceptable cultural/religious practices and simple superstition? Why is it ok to ask others to refrain from certain things in fear of angering the ghosts, but not ok to, say, hang a few bulbs of garlic outside my door to ward off vampires?

I come from a low income family, with parents that knew little about bringing up kids (on hindsight). They never believed in tuition. They do not believe in learning. They think me spending my NS allowance on books is a waste of money even though I actually look to libraries/e-books before I turn to Kinokuniya. When I was young I got caned for coming home late because I stayed too long in the library. Thinking of it really irks me. When I got several prizes and mini-accolades in primary school on a national level, my only worth to my parents are bragging rights during conversations between my parents and relatives (I have an uncle whose 3 kids have PSLE scores of 26X/27X, and all are studying in universities better than NUS in US/UK today so my mum always make it a point to brag). In secondary school days I was shortlisted for a program that aims to shortlist people to represent the country for an international competition. So I was supposed to travel to somewhere near/in NUS for the program and my father decided to fetch me due to my unfamiliarity of the place but was shocked to hear it was a weekly thing and went about how it was very mafan to do it weekly.

There was a time I wanted to learn to sing, and to play the piano. And of course being poor and all, the idea got shot down quickly. Fine. But even where singing is concerned, my mum would go on and on about how modern music like Jay Chou (which was hip back then) was trash, and that there is no point learning to sing because it is useless. OKAYYYY. 

It didn't help that my circle of friends all have seemingly supportive families, financially and emotionally, with a sense of proper upbringing. My circumstances certainly felt ridiculous.

I soon learned that whatever greatness and interests I want to pursue, I have to do it, DESPITE my family. Yes DESPITE. I would bold underline font-size 100 it if I could. I acknowledge that I am surviving on my family's funds because they are the reason for my bare basic sustenance. But it doesn't make sense comparing myself to starving africans either.

In fact even till today, I shut myself in my own room to do my work or even to laze around, because outside my room someone is arguing and fighting over trivialities. 

To the people who's had supportive parents and parents who actually know how to bring kids up, be thankful. I am someone who is very lucky, that despite my seemingly bad choice in secondary school even though my PSLE grades allows me to go for better schools, I met good teachers who were supportive of me despite my immaturity at times back then. Likewise I am thankful to the people throughout my life who has in one way or another made me a happier kid than I should be. And it is because of these people that I actually made it so far, and capable of being a decent human being and capable of good for society. At our age, probably most of us has forgot about Teacher's day....

This post is inspired by an interview of a local political figure, who in my view is a good parent and strives to be one despite circumstances.

I used to read a lot of books and academic articles that talked on issues relating to discrimination - be it gender, sexuality or even race. Reading about them made me more aware of who I was and my relation to others. But the more I read, the more aware I become of inequalities in our societies, and the more angry and bitter I feel. I'd get so depressed each time I see photos of casualties in war-torn countries that I wouldn't be able to function. I would think to myself, "What an awful world we live in."

I stopped reading too much on these issues, choosing to be apathetic instead, because it got to a point where I felt deeply conflicted. I didn't know how to find a right balance. It was too much for me to process and I greatly feared for my own mental wellness. I guess I'm not as courageous as I think myself to be.

Some comments on NUSWhispers really adds no value. When someone complains about something, someone'll just jump out and say "why don't you go tell xxx". When someone posts about their crush someone'll just comment "go make a move". 

Only if the world is so simple... NUSWhispers will have nothing left but only debates on NUSSU election and government policy

I absolutely LOVE yaoi and BL, because the love stories in the mangas, anime and books are so much better than the heterosexual ones.

All these people who post these NUSSU election-related "confessions" slamming one side, please be less obvious. Election is over. You had your vote. Others had theirs. No need to keep slamming one side. It only makes the side you are supporting look really bad.

To the OP of , I would like to refute your statements politely. To assume that the 2 people who were attacked are at fault, based on just a post is unreasonable. The person/persons who wrote the post did not offer any evidence and made a set of claims. When the public replied and asked for justification, they did not reply. Even after the post was taken down, they did not explain their reasons for writing and even taking down such a post. You may presume that the persons who wrote the post are courageous because they did not post anonymously.  But I would like to remind you that the person/persons who wrote the post, posted it under the cover of an organization and did not write it in their personal capacity. They failed to justify their claims and made some baseless claims. Furthermore, they took down their post after public backlash and still did not justify why they made such claims. Is that courageous? 
Additionally, I would like to vouch for the integrity of the 2 people who were attacked. They are very hardworking and passionate about their beliefs. I have worked with them before and they are so dedicated to their work and have taken me to task when I failed to be so. You may be wondering whether I posted this reply because I have worked with them before. No, I posted this because I could not stand such dishonest attacks being made against them, knowing their work ethics. That being said, the people who are at wrong will eventually receive their just desserts. 
Finally, I would like to request any further people commenting on this, to please put themselves in the shoes of the 2 people who were publicly shamed. Please don't assume that the 2 people were at fault just after hearing about it from 1 perspective (which was not proven till the end). Please don't speculate further if it was their fault, especially on public forums as it is truly hurtful and humiliating to those involved (especially since they have not been able to present their side of the story). Please let this matter rest till you have heard both sides of the story and this matter is resolved by the parties involved. Thanks and I hope that people take this in a positive manner; this post was not meant to offend anyone.

Really dumb question, but does anyone know where the gong cha in NUS is? Their fb says they opened one in NUS but I have no idea which part it is at so I can't satisfy my cravings ;-;

So what's the take on casting a spoilt vote? Honestly, I'm too lazy to read up on the people who are contesting in my area and listen to the speeches. So I'm ill informed but don't want to be informed as well coz not too many policies will affect me for the next 5 years at least. Thus my intention to cast a spoilt vote as I think I'm not in the best position to decide. What do you guys think?

@ 

Hey that is a lot of angst there. 

First of all, you are making one of the most fundamental mistake that physicians should never make - to judge someone else's lifestyles and actions with your own ideas of what is moral/just/fair. Do not let your emotions cloud your ability to reason things out. Always stay objective, even more so when you're trying to put a point across. That applies to everyone, not just medical personnel.

Now, to your points. 

What exactly makes a candidate a deserving one? To even try to distinguish who isn't a "deserving" candidate, you are making the first mistake I have stated above. But truly, there isn't one totally objective criteria, and the process of interviewing candidates isn't foolproof. It's all based on the experience of the interviewer. Sometimes it's a miss, and I do hope for the sake of my loved ones and myself that most of the time it's a hit. In the end, you could say that interviews are the worst method of picking candidates, except all others (adapted and modified from Winston Churchill's quote on democracy). How else will you want your future medical personnel to be picked? Through selection camps? Imagine the furore when people spend days in a camp just to be rejected. "Track record"? Which children of resourceful families can easily game?

How is it fair to other sincere candidates? It never was, just like any system would tend to favour individuals more adept to navigating it. But know that getting through the interviews isn't the end goal. It's just the beginning of a long and arduous journey that has even made some once-sincere candidates broken, burnt out and hating their lives. The ones you described who never really were passionate about medicine will feel it the strongest as they lack a good reason to put up with the rigours of night calls, shift work, reporting for duty on weekends and holidays, and being paid less than their friends . After all, they can fool a panel of interviewers for a few hours, but they most definitely cannot fool themselves for life.

Finally, let's go into what I believe (I may be wrong, and I'll apologise upfront here if I am) you're really trying to say here:

"Some medical students are just so full of themselves" - did you have an extremely unpleasant encounter with a (few) medical student? If so, I do hope those individuals haven't destroyed your impression of "the future of medicine". I have met many humble medical students who are extremely passionate about the career, and show it in their interactions with others even in situations they have no reason to be invested in. But what either of us is seeing is just one facet of this diverse group. Let's not jump on what we see  and immediately conclude that the system is totally broken.

"I am not being bitter, but" - someone once said that "nothing someone says before the word 'but' really counts". Combined with the extremely emotional tone of your post, I can only guess that some part of OP is really being bitter. You might argue that you are not bitter because you are jealous, but (heh, well I used it) you are bitter because you did not get what you believe should rightly be yours, which has fallen into the hands of someone you deemed to be less fitting. The irony, that you are judging people from your moral high horse while expounding your view on how people are morally more flawed than yourself and your "sincerity" (and I truly believe you were in the interviews, in all honesty).

"sometimes life just seems so unfair and not worth fighting for..." - you sound really dejected by your rejection by the medical school. However, I do hope you don't really mean it when you say life is not worth fighting for! Sure, life is always unfair, but you need to realise that no one will help you pick yourself up if you're just going to remain dejected. No one owes anyone anything. Most definitely not the strangers who outcompeted you for entry into medical school. You sound like you got a chance to go for the interviews, which should mean that your academics is in good shape to say the least. Enough to wow your relatives and friends. If you continue to work hard, you still have a bright future ahead of you, in whichever industry you head to. Also, think of your friends and family who have such hopes for you. Would you want to disappoint them just because of this 1 incident that made you feel unfairly treated?

And maybe, some day when you're successful, you'll find the medical students you so hated, this time burnt out, depressed and dejected just as you are now, and the world shall see another angsty post about missed opportunities and "less deserving people getting ahead in life".

With GE2015 coming up I thought this would be highly interesting to those of you who are interested in politics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aZGutMJir4  Funny how this debate with representatives from ALL parties competing in the upcoming election was not even mentioned in the mainstream media. Worth watching in my opinion.

Helping others used to be a must, because altruism is what keeps a society cohesive, happy and strong against any external threats. Unfortunately now helping others have become a form of debt; the giver is often expecting a payment with interest. The giver becomes a shark. The receiver becomes the victim. And the middleman becomes a business.

When I was in primary and secondary school, I love doing charity and community work. Some of our schools made it compulsory to do these. While all the other kids are reluctantly doing it, I was the most excited because I find meaning in giving back to society and to help the needy. I gave around a total sum of an upper four digit figure to charity organizations during my school years. It was really a lot of money considering the fact I am just a student and I come from a working class family. However, as I got older, the harsher truth began to dawn upon me, and there are times when my optimism is broken.

From my works with some charitable organizations (I will not point them out), I realized a big cut of the fund from sponsors and donors, are used to cover the unnecessary cost of their campaigns, events and pay salaries, and only a little amount of money is given to the beneficiaries. To put it bluntly, I feel the needy people are being made used of as a advertising tool to get donations. This upsets me greatly. Although the beneficiaries indeed get some funds to alleviate their unfortunate plight, however the total they received is a large difference from what the organization has received and promised. The remaining trinkets are often enough to cushion the needy people from hitting rock bottom, and this keeps them blind from what they were supposed to be given. However what they actually received is still insufficient to act as springboard for them. Yet most of them only think of surviving for the day, and never considered tomorrow. That's how they are —to put it bluntly again —exploited.

Sometimes I will rather give my money to a poor old lady pushing card boards on the road, rather than donate it to a large charitable organization which offers me a cute key chain, unless I fully understand how this organization is structured and whether my money is used for what I wanted it to be.

I am also offended by people who donates their money and they want the whole world to recognize them. They are doing an ego-inflating PR gimmick rather than a donation. Because when we do not offer to put their names somewhere prominent where others can see it, they are less willing to commit their money. It's very saddening. Everyone seems to want to take some extra credit for everything they give, even in the name of charity. They won't give for the sake of giving, unless there are benefits attached to it. They're like a shark!

I met several volunteers while helping out. Some of them are really awesome and sincere people who loves lending others a hand. Thanks all for that! However on the other hand, we have those who do it because they think it makes them feel holier and they believe they will have good karma if they do good. Oh boy they're in for a disappointment. Because that's not how it works. We cannot be expecting a happy ending just because we are a self-proclaimed "good person". Fairy tales work that way, but reality doesn't. There are good honest people who suffers an ill-fate, while thieves and crooks live a luxurious life without guilt. We must accept that.

We should always and only do what we think is suitable and comfortable for us, and most importantly, we must find joy in doing so regardless of the outcome.  I urge you to firmly believe in this principle and you won't be disappointed whenever you help others in the future.

I can't help but think that friends we make in uni are ones whom we make for mutual benefits which can comes in many forms. such as academic aid/networking to get certain help from etc. not saying that this is bad coz this is basically how each society work.  this is where Darwin's survival of the fittest comes in. sadly, i have neither to offer.

People say love is blind. Well the thing is if it's blind it'll only work out if it happens to. It is ideal that couples with differences manage to work through them together but some differences are just too much. 'True love' rarely exists. We're humans. We neither look only in the internal or only the external. It is always a combination of both and whatever we accept falls in a range that we would. Family background is one of this. I'm below average in terms of this. Not that I ain't smart or capable, it's just that at this stage in life I do not have the means to be in a relationship like most other people. I have been in one relationship where this difference can be felt, but it didn't affect us much. That was when I was much younger, when expectations (from society and myself) were lower. I cannot bring myself to be in relationship now there are more important things to do. Just ranting...

I noticed something about the two computing profs who often comment on NUSWhispers posts. They always chime in when they are addressed or if they have a good comment to make. But they obviously only comment on "relevant posts" and steer clear of sensitive/sexual posts. That must mean that they do read all the other nonsense on this website. Just let that sink in. 
Fellow whisperers - for the sake of those contributing towards educating us, please don't post gross/half-brained/bigoted/angstyteen things.
Profs - how does it feel everyday looking out at a hall full of young minds, anyone of which could be poisoned by something that you've actually seen (put in writing) for yourself? Is it a bit disillusioning? 
-
 
@  I agree with you. It's strange that we have all these people preaching acceptance but then they condemn people who prize monogamy. I am in no way hating people who sleep around, I just do not want a person who has slept around as my life partner. At the very least it's something that people have some modicum of control over, unlike height/looks/family background so all you haters get off your high horse. Just agree to disagree and carry on finding your fwbs or whatever already.

 Isn't this story from https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3ha7vx/difference_between_local_men_and_westerners_am_i/?

Unless these two people are the same person, else I think it is better to put the source page for referencing? Doesn't NUS teach you boys and girls about plagarism and integrity?

Astonished to see such posting on whisper whereby the story is from another source.

Dear OP of , after reading your emotional rant on "pro-life hypocritical groups" and "hypocritical fanatics", I was deeply troubled by your claims and did some research. Here are some organisations that provide assistance and in some cases, shelter, to unwed mothers:

Sanctuary House http://sanctuaryhouse.com.sg

What they do:

•Guide and assist you during your pregnancy and birth
• Help you get your life together again, now and in the future, with or without baby
• Give your baby a loving temporary home if you want to put it up for adoption
• Assist in the adoption process of your baby

Prenancy Crisis Hotline  http://pregnancycrisis.sg/we-are-here-for-you/

What they do:

They provide counselling services, collaborate with schools, shelters and adoption agencies. They also assist with financial planning.

Babes
http://babes.org.sg

What they do:

Babes is a teenage pregnancy crisis service that reaches out to teenage pregnant girls in need of help and support. They aim to guide teenagers who are experiencing an unplanned pregnancy crisis by proactively providing information, support, community resources that nurture responsible decision making and behaviors with the involvement of their family group and their community.

They run a 24-hour helpline so that anyone in need of help can call or message their helpline at 8111 3535.

Good Shepherd Centre (Rose Villa)
Tel: 62564440
Website: http://www.marymountctr.org.sg/good_shepherd_centre.html

Their website seems to indicate that they not only provide assistance and shelter to unwed mothers but women who are abused or facing a crisis. It is run by the Good Shepherd Sisters, a Catholic order of nuns. Catholicism is pro-life.

Pertapis Centre for Women and Girls
http://www.pertapis.sg/welfare-services/22-pertapis-centre-for-women-and-girls

Pertapis also runs a shelter for unwed mothers according to this article from the Straits Times.
 http://women.asiaone.com/women/parenting/refuge-young-women-facing-pregnancy-crisis?page=0%2C0

Dayspring New Life Centre
http://www.dayspring.org.sg/index.php

The article from Straits Times also indicates that they run a shelter for unwed mothers.

I hope that this list helps all unwed mothers out there. Admittably, much more must be done to support unwed mothers and their children. Fortunately the government is currently reviewing its policies towards unwed mothers.

Dear OP, I hope that this information can help your close friend.

To all unwed mothers out there, thank you for your sacrifice and for your love for your child, born or unborn. For you have chosen to protect the right to life of your child in spite of all the stigma and difficulties that you face daily. Here's a song dedicated to you: Because of Love by Corrine May.

Lyrics:

They tell her she’s too young 
To be a mother to a child 
That she’s only just begun 
To see what life’s about 
They tell her don’t be crazy 
He won’t get married 
You get yourself a college degree 
But she can’t deny it 
The babe inside her 
Is truly alive 
She says 

Because of Love 
I am willing to give it all up 
I am willing to take the plunge 
Because of Love 

The world will never understand 
That love is sacrifice 
It’s more than just romance 
It’s the reason for our lives 
So if they call me crazy 
And try to cage me 
To get me to betray the Truth 
Well I hope I’m ready 
To stand and carry 
My cross up and say 

Because of Love 
I am willing to give it all up 
I am willing to take the plunge 
Because of Love 
I am willing to humbly become 
Give my life to lift you up 
Because of Love 

I’m standing here with my heart held out 
I’m standing here to declare to the crowd 
That I love you, and I always will 
This promise that I make today 
I make forever more 

Because of Love 
I am willing to give it all up 
I am willing to take the plunge 
Because of Love 
I am willing to humbly become 
Give my life to lift you up 

Because of Love 
Because of Love 
Because of Love

If we compared faculties in NUS to JCs in Singapore, which faculty would match up with which JC and why? I think Biz would be ACS/ACJC because they remind me of money.

Hi friends, it's the time of the year again. This period every year, you'll get to smell ashes in the air and listen to loud getai music up till 11pm.

If you follow the news, you will see that SCDF just released an 'advisory' on the proper incense burning techniques. For example, it is advisable to burn in the metal containers provided.

I don't get why it is not made mandatory for people to practise their religion in a designated place. I CAN accept some degree of inconvenience or discomfort arising from religious practices, but what I cannot accept is the fact that some of the older uncles and aunties are using "religion" as a licence to do whatever they want, i.e. not clean up after themselves, burning at non-designated places, etc. The logic is this- because it is religion, we cannot criticise it.

I disagree. The test should be this: 1) does your religion say that you should do X? 2) Is there any way for you to do X in a more considerate way, at little cost to yourself?

If the second question can be answered with "yes", then people practising their religions should be expected to minimise the impact of their religious rituals. If it is "no", then I will respect their religious practice and I will tolerate it.

We need a frank discussion about such topics. We need legislation to protect residents most affected by certain religious practices. We cannot just shut up "because it is religion".

"Is Singapore ready for an Opposition?" A question asked many times by the Opposition.

The real question is, "Is the Opposition ready for Singapore?"

I wish everyone here would just shut up with all the debates here. Evolution, immigration, meritocracy, politics, NS, GE, philosophy... This is so annoying. 

I came here to read whispers about other OPs' deep dark secrets or embarrassing things they cannot share anywhere else. Not for you to shove your opinions about evolution or NS or foreigners down my throat. If you really feel so strongly about something someone posted, do it in the comments section. If you dont have the balls to use your facebook account to argue and debate, then keep quiet.

Stop clogging up NUS Whispers and making this a boring place.

I get really pissed off after reading politically related postings from both  sides of the fence, be it pro-PAP, pro-(PAP policies) and even pro-Opposition. I think they can come up with better articles.

I can understand, PAP did roll out good stuff, even in recent years too, even if it's for damage control or to change the course of certain stuff. They are giving more due recognition to NSmen, and they're stemming foreign talent influx, etc. Okay, they are humans and they learn from what happened. Granted. However, we also acknowledge that certain things bring about changes that may be detrimental or does not sit in well with people, or both. This is at the national level, and the people will take these into consideration at the polling station, along with what they see in their constituencies throughout the last 4 years.

I haven't looked in depth into proposals that the opposition come up with, some may question the WP's silence on certain policies. But really, must opposition oppose everything? There are some common grounds that everyone can stand on, they don't have to fight over everything you know. All politicians have a fair understanding that while rapport with the people is important, there are things they do that will come across as hard truths, but it should all be for the ultimate good of the nation. There has to be a balance between what makes people happy and what the people needs at a particular point of time, to move the nation forward etc.

Some may raise comparison over qualifications of candidates and politicians. And some may even go further to "worship" or immortalize those with high-flying credentials. I feel like slapping you for that because I find that damn elitist. Hey, it's great to have capable people leading the nation, but I don't agree with simply putting those with abilities and credentials on a pedestal and mitigate potential corruption problems with a big paycheck. It has worked, yes, for the past X years, but times are changing. We're not in Imperial China for goodness' sake, we're not conducting Imperial Exams to elevate high-flyers for Cabinet positions. I am perfectly fine with having an MP or even Minister with an ordinary NUS/NTU/SMU/etc degree running my constituency or the Ministry of Transport, as long as they're willing to come up with policies that benefit the people, and even better if they have been on the ground with a good X years of experience and some good leadership abilities to help them. That said, I disagree with parachuting elites and scholars for civil service and government jobs. They're better off being admin staff all the way. They should prove their mettle on the ground equally with everyone else first and fight for their own CEPs.

The opposition needs to get their act together too. They should just start with solid groundwork at the grassroots level, do something meaningful for the people. WP and SDP have been at it, it seems. Not forgetting Mr Chiam See Tong. And that's laudable. Anyone who wants to be a good politician serving Singapore should take a leaf out of the books of Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam and be faithful to the basics --- The people of Singapore. Policies and proposals made should always start from the basis of the people and their needs as well. Never ride on the people's unhappiness towards incumbents and current policies, it's just being populist.

In short, politics is meant for the people, by the people. That's why we vote, that's why we have different people representing us as lawmakers. So why are we voting with a mindset that's as backward as the governance of the Qing Dynasty? Yes, we want capable people, but more than that, we want people who want to serve the nation. More often than not, government can be a thankless job, see Mr Lui Tuck Yew. As much as people want him out, he actually has been on a tough job; public transport system is something that's build over X years, it ain't simple maintenance for infrastructure so enormously scaled, let alone expanding and fine-tuning for a growing population.

People, you gotta grow some brains if you're blindly worshipping the elites or blindly bashing policies and incumbents. Weigh your opinions on some timeless principles such as the values of our country and the needs of our people before making a judgement call. And please, don't be a stupid elitist.

I'm female and the idea of having a baby repulses me. I feel like when you have a baby, there are higher expectations for the female to take care of it, and it seems so draining and boring to just be repetitively trying to feed the baby, make it go to sleep, make it stop crying, clean up after it... Life becomes so insular if it's all about your baby. If you become a stay-at-home mum you lose touch with what's happening out there and your financial independence. People talk about the intangible rewards that come with child-rearing, but at this point in time I'd rather work on my coding projects, play my games, jio my friends out whenever, and have an income that I can budget my own way instead of asking for money from my husband.

I am getting quite sick of the posts here on NUS Whispers. 
Seems like everytime someone confess their opinions on something, there will always be someone pouncing on them denouncing them for being politically incorrect. 

Just because a post talks about foreigners it does not mean the OP is xenophobic. Stop trying to prove your worth by scolding the 'xenophobic' people. Many disgruntle raised here about foreigners are valid. It is natural to feel annoyed by a huge influx of foreigners. No country in the world is spared of this problem. You just dont hear about it living in your little well.  Being disgruntled does not equal to hating foreigners or fearing them, which is what the word xenophobic means. 

Stop pretending to be such a righteous man. If you really want to be so politically correct, start by helping foreigners and singaporeans to bond. Not by scolding singaporeans for voicing their unhappiness. 
This is like scolding your teammate for doing a lousy job for the project, when you are not even helping. (In case you still dont know, leaving FB comments scolding xenophobes will not change their attitude or improve the situation).

Like it or not, unhappiness about foreigners is here to stay. Unhappiness does not equal xenophobia. You either help or you keep your 'righteousness' to yourself.

To Singaporeans voting in the upcoming GE2015, I urge you not to vote
- because of what your parents think, of what your friends think;
- because you are afraid of being blacklisted (I think it has been said numerous times that your vote really is secret, let's all be mature about this);
- for change just for the sake of change (i.e. if a goat ran under a party as an alternative voice in parliament would you seriously vote for it just to seek "change"?)

Vote for a party that you think will do a good job, whether ruling party or opposition. Not all politicians from the same party are equally good/bad, so be discerning before deciding who to vote for. Do your research by reading up before casting your vote, and if you don't feel comfortable, don't share with others who you are voting for. The right to vote is your own, so don't be swayed by others' opinions, because yours is equally valid. 

Vote for a party that works in the interest of Singapore and Singaporeans. To strong supporters of certain political parties, if you want to share your opinions, please at least make sure any information used to back up your opinions are indeed accurate, otherwise, you are being extremely irresponsible in perpetuating false information that may affect the future of Singapore during this GE2015.

For first-time voters, good luck!

Is it that bad of an idea to drop my religious faith in order to get a girlfriend more easily? (never had even one in my life, which makes me feel frustratingly lonely)

On the one hand, I felt that its moral code has dictated me to feel guilty when I have crush in mind, and even discourages dating someone of different faith (although not expressly forbidding it).

On the other hand, it is extremely hard to break free from a faith which has shaped me for 25 years of my life, as if I will feel a severe emptiness inside.

Is it a bad idea to go to university only for learning sake and not for career purpose?

After reading quite a number of nice guy debates/experience on NUSWhispers, I thought I should contribute my thoughts as an "evergreen nice guy" - whatever that term means. Some background - I'm not actively looking for any partner; I don't pay anyone of any gender enough attention to place them on some arbitrary continuum of beauty level. I do realize that my disinterested approach in any current relationships may result in widely differing (relative to the norm) opinions about this issue.

On the debates on whether a "nice guy" needs to become a douchebag to attract girls - I think this is an absolutely ridiculous idea. You cannot possibly be *so desperate* that you would cheapen your requirements in a long-term partner; that you would settle for someone who lacks the maturity and acuity, in appraising and selecting decent humans that are, otherwise, not douchebags.

I cannot imagine how one would plan to persist with their douchebaggery plans after some particular lifelong commitment to each other. A partner who cannot escape their biological need for a sinusoidal-shaped affection, would seem likely to quickly bore of your existence, should you drop your douchebaggery act after aforementioned commitment. Unfortunately, it would be inconsistent (and improbable) to drop one's douchebag act, in front of one's in-laws and one's partner's friends - which I assume, would merely lead one to be chained to an unpleasant relationship with one's partner's friends and families.

In fact, there exists a question, far more fundamental, that we need to inspect first. In my opinion, there does not exist much circumstances where the mistreatment of a fellow human can be justified. The acquisition of lifelong partners, fortunately, does not exempt itself from this. Indeed, it is not a question of whether one can, or is a douchebag, but a question of whether one should (ever) be a douchebag. It seems almost ludicrous, that one would consider erecting a false front and violating his own morals or principles, not for any particular lofty goals that could better humanity in the long-run, but for something as trivial as capturing the attentions of potential partners that are unable to extricate themselves from their addiction to a bad relationship.

Again, I would be quick to admit that my disinterested position (due to my belief, that Education should be the primary objective as a student; all else are merely secondary bonuses) in relationships may be the main cause for my inability to perceive the intensity of my peers' desperation. Perhaps I may grow to be more empathetic to their desperation in the future, but even so, I cannot foresee, within myself, the ability to seriously consider someone who is a poor judge of character as a worthy partner.

In summary, I would assert that one should persist in being a "nice guy", should that be a clear representation of one's personality. Not only would one remain true to one's own principles and morals, it would also have the added advantage of having unworthy partners self-select themselves out. Does nobody else feel the same way?
-
 
@. A better example of stupidity would be someone who judges the intelligence of a specific population (uni students) based on the grammer of posts written by anonymous posters. 

I would be more alarmed but the crappy arguments posted by *some NUS students in the comments. The best are those who contradict themselves when commenting across different confessions.

I won't deny it; I've done it before - when confronted with a project group that are comprised of lackadaisical or sub-standard students; I pretty much tell them to lay off whatever pretense and take on the entire project myself. One should not let the inferior standards of others pull down your own.

But of course, there is nothing sweeter than to e-mail the professor upon completion of the projection with all the evidence that you are pretty much the only brain behind the job and file reports against all these "teammates". The looks of disbelief on their faces when you nail your A and they receive their B- or C+ is simply priceless :)

There are some annoying people that make ALL anti-NS people out to be selfish people who can only complain and whine. Let me just point out a few things:

1) Just because one resents army doesn't mean they can't fulfill their army satisfactorily. I managed to get a Sword of Merit during my NS, and got a good testimonial upon ORD. Which is better than most of you can do.

2) Just because one resents army doesn't mean that they actively complain about it all the time. Just like how some of you who are upset about being evergreen don't spend all day dwelling on your lack of a romantic partner. 

3) You are not as selfless as you think you are. You obviously support sacrifice for society's benefit, and you feel that people who do not do the same are selfish. I wonder what arbitrary line you drew to elevate NS above other sacrifices. Unless you sacrifice your personal time and life-goals to benefit society outside of NS shut you hypocritical mouth (keyword is sacrifice, doing intermittent community service to bolster your resume obviously doesn't count. So keep that trap shut)

No one is judged harshly for their job preferences. But somehow people who don't like army life are condemned, whether they do a GOOD JOB OR NOT (bolded for those with bad reading comprehension). I have excelled and am living a very good life now, and I hate NS. Bet this "contradiction" scrambles your brains.

 "The issue at hand is how we see NS as a burden instead of a duty." <- now there you have the problem, no? it is a burden if NS wasnt needed but was implemented. It is a duty because we have no other way to maintain our sovereignty. Dont be naive to think everything is peaceful eh, remember Kuwait and Iraq? How did you get nsf of the year if you dont understand why NS is needed? even everyone in my unit was shown/realise the importance of what we do.

Now back on point: i actually mentioned NS because in some of the few previous posts, people brought up NS as a basis of payment of sorts that makes singaporeans more eligible for scholarships (? wtf is the link, I have a duty to clear my bowels often, doesnt mean im entitled to toilet paper)

Instead people should be discussing academic ability, contributions to their bonded corporations etc.  Yes i agree with , some foreigners are super hardworking and actually deserve their scholarships. some on the other hand.. scoot off when they get their degree. NUS & SG is but a stepping stone to them; they view us as money trees and as stupid people that freely offer scholarships to foreigners. 

perhaps we could think of better judging criteria for scholarship applicants to prevent wastage of our taxes on certain types of foreigners. god i sound xenophobic
-
 
To the author of , I'm one of the poorer ones blessed with a scholarship and I disagree with the vitriolic responses to your post. They don't really realize the simple fact that we need to do much more to match what they achieved and some would even happily trumpet that all poor are lazy.

We aren't asking for handouts, policies to level the field or even your sympathy. Please just moderate your condescending attitude towards those playing in hard mode.

The relative high cost of living in Singapore is probably one of the major reasons why many Singaporeans have become anti-foreigners. I work in an IT department at a hospital and there are tons of foreign friends working with me. We have colleagues mostly from Malaysia, India, Philippines and Vietnam.

Because unlike local people who has family in Singapore, more demand for recreation/work-life balance and many other societal commitments to oblige to, foreign employees come here with the main purpose of earning as much as possible, thus they may be able to sacrifice more time (in my IT department, all the night shift guys are foreigners) and commit more effort to their work compared to Singaporeans. Then, they can return home to their family and live a better life, since their wages here are relatively higher than what they might receive in their homeland. 

Due to the difference in cost of living, it is clear that their salary will worth a lot more to them than the local people, especially when they have saved enough to go back to their country. For example, when I went to Malaysia, the price of a restaurant meal is the same as the price of a meal from a food court in Singapore. And my Filipino colleague who is paid about S$3K plus per month, lives in a luxurious bungalow in the Philippines, although he simply rents a small flat in Singapore. The prize for him is at home, not here in Singapore.

Therefore, many Singaporeans feel that they are trapped in a rat race because most of us need to stay here our entire lives and manage the high cost of living. Of course some of us can choose to migrate, however it is not as easy as said, due to family reasons, educational level, strict immigration rules etc. And some may want to find work in another developed country which offers higher pay, but it is not easy to get a position either, considering the fact that those developed countries have a larger population and hence they have already a larger pool to seek the suitable people, unless you stand out from the crowd.

Therefore, I feel it is not right to always put the blame on our foreign friends, because just like us, they also want to have a better life and are willing to do what it takes. Perhaps blame it on the bad policy makers? I don't know because I'm not in their position to understand the problems they may face too. However, as my biz prof once told me, it is essential to be cosmopolitan. We need to be able to network with a lot of foreign friends, as who knows, one day one of them may bring home the expertise which they had learnt in Singapore and set up his own venture back home, and might offer you the opportunity and bring you to greater heights, on the account of your kind hospitality towards him during his stay in Singapore. Yet this assumption needs to be taken with a grain of salt.

To ,

I am here not to debate about the xenophobia issue in Singapore. Also, I want to make this clear: I do not wish to be involved in that discussion.

I am writing this because I take issue with the way you talk about NS. Conscription in Singapore can be seen as a denial of freedom of individual solely based on his nationality and gender. Neither of which is a choice at the moment of birth. 

For myself, I am fortunate enough to enjoy my NS experience. Probably because I try to make the best out of every situation. However, I cannot say the same for others. Living in regimentation for 2 full years and 10 ICT cycle is not a small nor easy commitment. 

Servicemen put their life on the line during training everyday. As you already know, there are deaths in training almost every year. 

Also, you MUST recognise that everyone has different personalities, not everyone is suited for this kind of life! As you know, there are attempted suicides and people going into depression every now and then in the army.

Let me ask you this question: How are these people going to make the fullest out of the 2 years? The guy haunted by depression could have led a normal life if not of NS. The guy could be alive if not of NS. 

To top it of: ALL THESE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED FROM MEN WHO DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THESE WILLING!

You and I may have survived NS as a healthy and happy man, but never forget about those who were left behind. 

So if you think that those people who think NS is tough and they feel shortchanged, they rightfully deserve to feel that way. 

Because everyone is different: A 30kg load is okay for a person who is 80kg but is heavy to a 40kg. How can you claim that the skinny guy is lying?

To end off, I salute all National Servicemen for their sacrifices towards the defence of Singapore.

To end off this foreigners vs singaporean argument.

It is impossible to demand local to treat you equally, not even suing. And don't you agree that what you are demanding is entitlement? I am pretty sure most will be ok living in a different country feeling unwelcome compared to compulsory conscription and various unjust treatment.

You want respect, put on helmet, put up rifle, crawl in the mud with us. I am pretty sure no one will treat you differently. After all, we literally being through the same shit together.

Another aspect about the xenophobic sentiments that may not have been mentioned. Skip if you are tired of reading such views.

Not all foreign students are equal and they behave differently based on the region they come from. And I think it is important to make this distinction before going on a "all foreigners are bad!" rampage. Students from SEA countries, whether on scholarship or not, tend to mix well with local students regardless of language barriers. They also tend not to attract negative attention or xenophobic sentiments. They come to Singapore, try to integrate, are appreciative of the opportunities Singapore has provided and eat typically 'Singaporean' food. You always get some bad eggs now and then, but they are generally not disruptive. (see where this is going? I'll stop beating about the bush now)

I have participated in a focus group discussion conducted by a particular ministry that goes to other countries to 'talent scout' and 'invite' them to Singapore. Essentially, if the focus group was of any representation, most sensible Singaporeans take issue with just one particular group of foreigners. You might have guessed it - China. Even the facilitator at the time mentioned that they were most concerned about this group. The biggest problem here is that they come in such large droves, invited or otherwise, that they just form their own community and never have to integrate. On top of that many maintain their nationalistic pride (which in itself is not wrong) and go around behaving that they are superior in every way (this I take issue with), despite the fact that their home country was not able to provide them with better opportunities. 

(This paragraph is subjective and not applicable to everyone from China) They tend to exhibit selfish, unethical behaviour and have a terrible sense of social etiquette. They do not bother integrating or learning about local culture like eating local food since they never reasonably have to. They come in such large numbers it is actually economically viable for many food courts to have a "Sze chuan cuisine" or similar just to cater to this group. (end subjective rant)

I am going to do a 180 and say that I have personally interacted with individuals from China when they are forced into isolation from country mates here in Singapore based on circumstance (NS, school projects, certain jobs. and yes, some do serve NS! respect to those that do!). I realized they are just as normal as another other person individual, just trying to eek out a living like the rest of us. It seems like the bad habits they are notriously known for only surface when in large groups. It is also easier to form "us against them" sentiments when they form such large, distinctive communities of their own. Should they be blamed to want to find a sense of familiarity so far from home? Not really. Singaporeans do it too when we go overseas. But most of the time we do not have enough numbers to form a bubble community so we are forced to integrate. Singapore is small and young. We do not have the critical mass and stable culture yet to 'induct' new members into our society when they come in large numbers. 

So the big question is, why do we take in so many foreign students from China? One aspect of university rankings is the diversity of students. Basically the more students you have from a wider range of countries, the better the score in that category. Taking many students from one country does not help this score. If the rationale is that intake is based on global population proportions, there are simply more students from China due to their large population size, then we should see a similar number of students from India too, which does not seem to be the case. Or they integrate so well that they do not attract attention. (I cannot find a breakdown of international students in NUS by country. Is this publically available?) If the idea of foreign students is for cultural exchange, I have personally interacted more with SEA students than students from China despite the fact that the former are much smaller in number. Quite simply because of the mentioned 'bubble community' effect. And also, Singapore is already majority Chinese and have certain chinese practices integrated into our culture. On the other hand, some people from China I have spoken to claim their family back home does not celebrate CNY. So what cultural exchange are we talking about here?

One contentious reason for taking so many students from China is that they are supposedly more effective as a whole. Personally, I do not think they are all that brilliant. Hard working, perhaps. You do get a handful that are extremely bright, as you would with local students or foreign students from other countries who possibly have less issue integrating socially. If there was a reason for the effectiveness of students from China as a whole, it might be due to the fact that many of them (not all) do not do anything other than study (or work when they have graduated). Essentially, this is an issue of Singapore's economy being addicted to imported "work horses" at certain social costs. So the question is, are they worth the strain on Singapore's social fabric? 

What I would like to emphasize is not all foreign students deserve the flak that they are receiving. Unfortunately when one particular sub-group of foreign students become the significant majority, they easily embody the entire foreign student population and give everyone a bad rep. Furthermore, not everyone in this sub-group is guilty of bad behaviour. I apologize if you are one of the exceptions that try your best to integrate but perhaps you can help by telling your comrades to reconsider their behaviour. 

Lastly, while this post was written based on personal observation, a large part of it is based on what was shared during the focus group discussion. And also the fact that the government, contrary to popular belief, is actually trying to get feedback and solutions from regular folk on the ground. 

No TLDR. Read the post in full if you are interested.

Chipping in on the whole xenophobia issue . I am wondering if we're against all foreigners alike (including your white expats), or just PRS/Indians? Because if it's the latter, hypocrisy much, no?

 From do you heard it from? Straits Times?

I think there is a propaganda out there to make everyone perceive Singaporeans to be xenophobic or one-eye dragon. Also the media likes to use every opportunity possible to condemn Singaporeans. It is always the same narrative that Singaporeans are not good enough and we need foreigners blah blah....

"Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us!"

Honestly, your suffering is nothing compared to 2 years of slavery. As you also mention, the only bad deal is being in a country that you are not welcome. To even out the unjust, your suffering is part of the deal.

As for directing the hate to the right person. You can be rest assured that they will suffer, after all the elections are coming.

I got into a "gangster school" when I was in secondary school, so my mom kept blaming me, and kept comparing me with my sister who did well academically (Why aren't you like her? Why other people can do this, but you cannot? etc., etc., been doing that since I was a kid). When reports came in of me having attitude problems (banging my head repeatedly on the desk, etc.), she would only come by, and drop a remark such as, "Just why am I born with this son..." (and you'ld ask me if you see me, why am I always having my head in the clouds?)

Well, things got better only when I got into a "slacker" JC. 

I'm still rather unstable nowadays. Never got used to feeling secure, loved, or having close friends, because it feels extremely alien to me. Really. I'll just push you away. I can't really laugh either, for some reason.

I will never raise my kid like that next time. And no, I really don't think the parental logic of "this one is exceptional case" can and should be applied.

Looking at that girl who committed suicide over 2 Bs, it just makes me feel lucky that I simply got away with becoming relatively unstable.

   You are the same person. I know who you are. Talking to yourself on Internet must be a new low. 

1. Associating yourself with a bunch of skeptics outside of campus whether online or irl in cafes does NOT make you a philosophy major. 

2. YES! The commenters on the first 2 posts called you out on the fallacy of your thinking/bullshit. 

Collecting new lines on your resume to create clout so that one day you will be an investment banker with a hedge fund? Go ahead. 

But cut the bullshit about wanting to be a social advocate and fight injustices when you go around hurting people in your personal life and trying to get them to submit to your inclination. 

But you are right on one point- not everyone should do volunteer work. I shudder knowing that people let you volunteer with disadvantaged children.

How you have fooled the organisation with your 'track record' & academic background... How you have perfectly masked your personal dysfunction/fetish/deviance under this facade of an altruistic do gooder disgusts me... If you can do this now at 22, I don't know what kind of person you'll become in the future.  

Altruism, effective or not, is something no one will/should associate with you. 

Be careful of the skeletons in your closet. Do not use a character from mummy porn as a role model. Please differentiate between fact and fiction.

P.S. one of the commenter hit the nail right on its head- wolf of cbd. Yeah just that... inclusive of the sexual exploits and debauchery (on a NUS undergrad's budget!). Girls don't fall prey to the wolf in effective logical sheep's clothing.

I resist calling you out by name. But hope this post lets you know people know of your misdeeds. Please change for the better, for good.

Hello peeps, especially those who have taken their Singapore Studies Module before, especially those that are dealing with SG history/politics/society. 

Have y'all noticed a well-dressed guy sitting alone during your lectures? They often say that he's not a student, but an observer to ensure that lecturers behave and not bad-mouth the current regime. 

Originally I thought the purpose of SS was to re-indoctrinate the young minds in our local unis, (but of course we can't be that daft to believe that LKY single handedly built Singapore from nothing and that we were just a petty fishing village in 1965 which some ppl believe so) like hello, we were the crown colony of the British Empire.

It turned out that my mod SSA2211 Evolution of a Global City State is kinda of a fresh perspectives and it deviates from Primary sch / Sec Sch NE brainwashing. In fact very little material was covered on LKY's & PAP's contributions cos we had to cover everything since the Temasek era. Plus we focused on trends / cycles and themes like migration / development / security etc.

(although our textbook Singapore, a 700-year history : from early emporium to world city / Kwa Chong Guan (is LKY's nephew BTW, Derek Heng, Tan Tai Yong.)

My last point is directed to FASS students: Is there even such thing as academic freedom in NUS, will you get marked down for writing something politically incorrect or whatever especially since the Yale profs highlighted this as an issue b4 they wanted to collaborate with NUS. 

OKAY TL;DR Happy SG50

Since elections are coming, I am going to ask for opinions.
From what I observed, I don't see any significant things done by the ruling party since GE2011.
Things that I am sure of, I don't want 6.9M.
Call me bias, but after serving 1y10mths in army, not only you lost your precious time, you also get "derisory allowance". If Singapore is every bit of the "1st world country" they claim to be, then why not at least give us minimum wages? Ah, yes, there is no minimum wages to ensure Singapore can get the "best talents" at a "affordable price".
I see it extremely hard to get a good starting job and very steep competition. What has the MINDEF done to ensure that we are compensated well for our time? Competing with younger female and work under female your age? Still can tolerate. Foreigners your age are your supervisor because they have headstart? Fuck no.
In this fast-paced society, you still need to go back for reservist and get less than $2/hr (average 15hr per day for reservist). It seems much better to be foreigners than citizen right?
So is opposition parties better? No. But it seems justified not to vote for PAP.
I welcome all opinions. Do highlight what PAP have done worth noticing since GE2011.
And please don't flame my terrible English. All the best for bidding :)

RE: 

I'm a law alumni. I worked for a decade in a corporate setting as a patent attorney. Day in, day out, I argue with people. It was mentally draining and I went through long periods of time when I had zero life. You often hear people talk about "work-life balance/harmony", I had only part of the equation: work. I stayed as late as 2am and went back in office at 7am every day of the week. I had no contact time with my family and friends. I missed many important moments in my life e.g. attending my best friend's wedding, watching my baby niece grow to be a toddler, going for my younger brother's commissioning parade, etc. Last year, I left my practise and now I work in a role typical of a business major (contract negotiations); occasionally, I give legal advice (paid and pro bono) in my capacity as a non-practising consultant to the company I work for and to two other non-profit organisations I volunteer at.

I can tell you honestly I'm much happier now. My parents were glad for me when I told them I wasn't going to actively practise law; I think they saw how miserable I was. I still get derisory comments from classmates who seem to assume that I succumbed to the intense pressure; just for the record, I didn't. I did brilliantly at work and was progressing rapidly up the corporate ladder. I could have stayed if I wanted to, but I valued my personal life more. I stopped giving a rat's ass about what people think when I started working in law. You should too. As long as you're happy in your major (social science), it doesn't matter what your parents or relatives say of you. Your achievements are equally valid and worthy, and never less.

My gal who I've been dating for a few months now made a confession to me. She said she had undergone plastic surgery before, in order to have a higher nose bridge and a slimmer face. Initially, I was a little taken aback yet at the same time, I was not very surprised. It's because her looks are exotically beautiful, which are not common features for a typical Singaporean Chinese girl. And both her parents are of Chinese descent so she does not carry a mixture of Western and Eastern blood. 

I told her it's okay as I appreciate her honesty. Then she sent me a Whatsapp photo of herself before the surgery, and she doesn't look that bad at all. Maybe not as pretty as the result of going under the knife, but still a very pleasant looking lady.  Okay, I admit that I started our relationship purely based on her good looks, but after spending time with her, I feel that our personalities are really compatible. She loves playing PS4 with me, talking a heap of random nonsense and enjoys going to the gym with me. These are activities which my ex-girlfriend detests.

Thus, I gave thought about the idea of plastic surgery. As I am a strong believer of Darwinism, I stand firmly with the idea of natural selection, that those with inferior genes will be eliminated from the gene pool. That means those who are not good-looking enough to attract a mate will not be able to pass their genes down to the next generation, hence the succeeding generation will become more beautiful as a result. Therefore, plastic surgery to make oneself look exceptionally beautiful destroys this law of nature and tricks the opposite gender into having offspring who are of inferior quality. I'll probably burn in hell for having such inhumane beliefs but I am a really narcissistic person, and I adore things and people which and who are pleasing to the eyes. 

I personally am not that great looking myself, but I hold such high expectations on the beauty of others. Do forgive me, I am changing to be better.

However, after my girlfriend's confession to me, I come to realize that plastic surgery isn't so bad at all. It's because of superficial people like myself who filter out individuals solely based on looks, many potential partners are not given a chance to even allow the other person to see who they really are. And because of my gf's "artificial looks" which attracted me in the first place, I got to know her a lot better and discovered that her awesome personality is what I really want in a spouse. Spending time with her distracted my appreciation for her physical appearance, and directed all my attention to the way she laughs and talks to me.

I am not implying that everyone needs to undergo an aesthetic surgery in order to break down the barrier to enter a relationship. What I mean is that it's important for those who erect the barrier to create a door for which people can enter so that you can get to know them better and then decide if he/she is suitable for you.

P.S. The comic below is for humor regarding the topic on plastic surgery.

I have a problem with social media.

I'm still using Facebook, because I think it's great when people share cool videos, funny stories, thought-provoking articles, juicy news. Just interesting/entertaining stuff in general. I also enjoy seeing pictures of my friends. But please read on.

What I am really starting to hate is all the selfies and wefies or OOTD or what not. I have tried using Instagram and SnapChat and frankly I hate it. The way that people use it borders on narcissism. Yeah, please look at how beautiful I am, how much fun I am having, how rich I am, how cool I am doing this, how talented I am having cooked this. Yeah look at everything I eat. And please Like and leave a comment while you are at it. Seriously, isn't all this to fuel your own freaking ego. Honestly I hate seeing such stuff because I look at my life and I ask myself why is my life not as picture perfect as yours??

And this narcissism is like the bedrock of social media. It used to be just the tabloid magazines featuring celebrities. But no, now every one can be a celebrity. You just have to look beautiful in a picture.

And there is no stopping it. Because people like what is beautiful. And internet traffic generates revenue from ads. So basically, the more entrenched this narcissistic culture is on social media, the better. Who would want to stop the money flowing? All these Influencers, their livelihood depends on it. For ordinary folks, their ego depends on it.

Yes you can say I am jealous when I see such stuff. And if it pisses me off, I can always delete Facebook as well right. Well, truth is I'm not strong enough. And it sickens me when social media is a platform to encourage and propagate narcissistic behavior.

Lol at the confessions talking about the troubles of cross-cultural relationships! At least you guys are of the same race. If a non-Chinese person (myself) were to see this they'd really wonder what the fuss is about.  Cultural differences are really small issues compared to racial differences. 
From what I can see, the biggest issue seems to be negative stereotyping about an unfamiliar community.
I suppose that would exist for every race/community given that one of the biggest problems that Singaporeans have is stereotyping. 
We like to put every one into little boxes we can understand. 
I'd just like to remind you of how minorities face this issue of negative stereotyping in even more ordinary daily situations than a relationship. 
Remember there was the confession from the Malay guy who was constantly bombarded by surprise at his academic success. 
In general, there are way too many negative stereotypes pegged onto minorities and foreigners - I once read that in Chinese folklore, villains/demons are depicted with dark skin and hence even all these centuries later, racially-Chinese people are unable to see darker-skinned people without some prejudice kicking in. It seems that there is actually mistrust when it comes to Chinese dealing with Indians and Malays. They would sooner trust a White foreigner over their own countrymen. 
So, to me the extent of local Chinese prejudice towards their own race (even if they are from a different country) makes me feel like proper racial integration with other races will be impossible. So much for racial harmony day.

Singaporeans are a horribly self entitled bunch of people. Sure every now and then you see people performing acts of kindness but that is rarely and hardly the case. The people in our society are horribly ugly and money driven to the point where compassion and kindness doesn't happen anymore.

you may argue and say that during the train breakdown /some/ acts of kindness were seen but it is largely aunties pushing their way to get on board and everyone else pushing back.

it has come to the point where giving up one's seat is oh so glamourised as a /wow kindness factor/ just look around and see the reality of Singaporeans as they are.

this is probably gonna get a lot of hate but screw it.

To the OP of , 

It takes time to build rapport and be comfortable around your colleagues. 4 days is really too soon to speak. Up to the 4th week of my internship I didn’t want to have lunch with my department because it was well, awkward. I hated stepping into office every morning and I couldn’t wait for lunch with my seniors and friends from school, and of course the end of the day. By the 8th week my colleagues and I were pretty well-acquainted (can have lunch and sustain 5-sentence conversation with each other kind – but there were 10 people at lunch so 5-sentence per person can last the whole session and it wasn’t that awkward la), and currently at the 11th week into internship, it’s possible to talk to almost anyone in the office (not bff but more than enough to make the workplace a fun one!). It’s a tad late considering that this is a 14-week internship but better late than never. It’s really not easy for me to make friends and for people to open up to me or start talking to me because my friends always say that i have the resting-bitch-face. Some times if it doesn’t work after taking initiative first, try again. You can try simple things like greeting one another with smiles or “good mornings” when you step into office or along the corridor, or offer snacks/coffee whenever you’re getting some for yourself. It’s difficult but it’ll get better. 

All the best!

 Dear Confessor, people are cruel with their ways of determining success and failure. Academia is mostly a zero-sum game. Nassim Taleb's remedy is to focus on your actions/learning and avoid fragility that comes from the dependence on external recognition. Stay robust to how people treat you. 

We live in a society where many parents/politicians/elders lack wisdom. The younger generation lack proper guidance from the previous generation. So read more books from the ancient authors like Seneca, Montaigne and Aurelius who have thought about these problems that you are facing far better than modern psychologists. 

Watch a video on Montaigne dealing with this problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOjDttEtfGI

I mentioned this several times before in the comment but I decided to say it again.

Men do care alot about a woman's look. 

This is because men are designed to find a fertile women to procreate and have alot of offspring and a man can tell alot about a woman's fertility through her look alone.

 hey, same here, a Man. Well, leaders are not really innate, that much I can tell you. 

Even if you are a Man, don't let that drag you down. It's not an excuse to reject opportunities to develop into a better person that come your way.

We don't have pride,honour or dignity, at least, that's what is expected for us. We have nothing in it for us, since we are quite low down in rank. We have no lack of selfish people amongst ourselves who can just throw their own work and responsibilities at us, and it's expected, simply because we are men - not expected to have dignity, not expected to have pride, and not expected to have honour.

However, if you are willing to still do your work with pride, and be a leader in spite of everything, there is nobility in that, greatness, which will carry on in your character. Take pride in it, don't let a simple label pull you down, but let it,instead be your motivation. 

The thing about Men, is that because we are not expected to do anything, we can do, and achieve everything - we simply don't have any pride, face, or anything else to lose.

In the traditional family structure, the man is the sole breadwinner while the woman is the housewife. The role of the breadwinner is to put food on the table while the role of the housewife is to look after the children and do the housework.

The rising cost of living necessitates a dual-income, meaning that both husband and wife must work in order to support the family. Now, there are two breadwinners and no housewife (or house-husband). The children are now either being taken cared of by their grandparents (who have retired) or being sent to childcare centres.

Times have changed, but it saddens me to know that our future generation(s) will be spending less time with their parents.

This country may be a multiracial environment, but that doesn't necessarily mean people perceive other races as being no different than they are. When it comes to meeting new people, race is a big factor. It very clearly registers with us that the new person is of a different race and we use whatever existing knowledge we have (racial stereotypes) to profile the person and slot them into our little mental boxes. Race defines background, privilege, education, attitude and well, whether we want to be friends or mere acquaintances with that person. And unless this person fits the glaring, gaudy stereotypes (especially of minorities) we feel a little uncomfortable in trying to understand them. 
Interaction occurs, but assimilation never does in the true sense. 
Now, I don't mean Singaporeans are racist, but they are certainly very race-conscious. 
If any incident in the news comes up, all of us are automatically very curious as to what race the person belonged to. Somehow, it's as though we'll find some backstory that will explain all misdeeds/ill-fate. 
I think we can only be a truly advanced society when this behavior disappears. Again, not racism. But race-consciousness. 
I don't think we are especially backward, given that even the USA, the  country with probably the most mixed population witnesses so many violent expressions of racism. 
So this is just a random thought that we will have true racial harmony the day we find Racial Harmony Day just a little bit silly and redundant.

Many people refer to love as a feeling. One that started from a spark that set two souls on a journey. That spark happens by chance and/or effort and with the right circumstance a fire will burn.

The problem with relationships today is that people refer to their feelings as the original fire. When they see it die down, they think ahh im having no more feelings what should i do. And naturally without this thing called love, we wouldnt be as tolerant or accepting as our partner their behavior habits ambitions etc. 

What love really is is the conscious effort to keep the fire burning through various challenges in life. And that has to come from both parties. 

A fire usually starts off brilliant and slowly wears to a steady burn. Many relationships end today just because they sense a fire decreasing in energy and ferocity. If thats the case many of our parents wouldnt have made it for so many years. 

Sustaining the fire is a choice which has to work from both sides. And for it to work from both sides, both sides need to acknowledge that. And for both sides to acknowledge that there needs to be communcation. And for communication there needs to be maturity. And for maturity there has to be immaturity because neither can exist without the other as they are relative comparisons. 

All the best in your endeavours.

therefore, instead of 1 man 1 vote, they should give more voting power to professors and people in esteemed positions, and on the other hand, anyone who doesn't have a bachelor degree should not be allowed to vote.

Jumping to conclusive questions is something to avoid.

We can do better than just making comments based on doxa or everything you are conditioned to. Open your mind to thinkers (past, present, fictional, non-fictional) who have said significant things about the issues that we are facing.

It bothers me when I see people, usually male, say that men and women can't be friends. This kind of sexist attitude is why you probably don't have female friends. I'm pretty sure not all men are like you, unable to control themselves just because a woman is nearby. Hello! We're not just animals with only a hindbrain!!! You should reconsider that attitude of yours. It's very off-putting.

I'm a financial aid case. I have to take up a loan and work part-time to afford my place in NUS. It's unfortunate how my family situation is like this. My parents are separated. My father is heavily in-debt and does not support us. My mother is the sole breadwinner of 3 children.

I have friends who do not know my real situation. They are sheltered and well-provided for. I say this without contempt, it is just fact and I do not blame them though I do get envious of them from time to time. At times it makes me really sad how, say $20, means so much more to me than to my friends. Sometimes I feel sorry for myself that I feel really angry that my friends have so much more than me. I get angry with them because they have what I cannot afford to have, and they have it so easily too, that sometimes they do not value it as much.

But I've thought about it a lot. And whenever I have the 'the world is so unfair!' feeling, I stop and think.
My friends' parents or grandparents or great-grandparents probably felt the same way as I am feeling now. And because they find the world so unfair, they worked hard and tried their best to make it a little fairer. Their parents worked hard, made good decisions with their lives (unlike my dad, but oh well) and are now rewarded with affluence that is being passed down generation to generation. That is the reward my friends' parents/grandparents/great-grandparents got for working their asses off and my friends get to enjoy it. What they make out of the good foundation provided is up to them, of course.

Maybe I will never have the lifestyle that my friends have now, but I would like to believe that my own children or grandchildren will. I want to be the one to give my future generation the stepping stone to more opportunities and a more comfortable life. I just have to get the ball rolling and hopefully not fuck up so much along the way.

Why is there so much hate for more affluent people nowadays? Nobody chooses which family that they were born in. Just because some won the genetic lottery doesn't mean that they should get hate for being lucky. 

Yes, it truly is inspirational for those who come from a underprivileged background to succeed but that shouldn't nullify the hard work that a person from a more privileged household puts in as well. Just my two cents, peace and love yo!

I'm a freshie and recently I've taken up financial aid. I came from a poor family with both my parents pay add up to approximately 2.5k/month. I have a sister. My dad is 65 this year, and still slogging to put meals on the table. I'm aware that there are students who are even poorer than me.
 
While I understand that I should not compare with my friends who are living a much more comfortable life, but its hard to not envy them. People say money cannot buy happiness, but without money, unhappiness is almost always the product. There are times when my parents get stress about financial issues and quarreled after a long day of work.

It's easy to say that its more challenging to play life in 
hard mode. But given a choice (I know we don't have a choice), would you rather play easy mode, going to your desired overseas trip every now and then/don't have to scrimp and save and worry about your debt and the damn interest rate after you graduate etc, or play the hard mode?

Tbh, I'm really glad that my dad, at the age of 65, is still relatively healthy. But its really hard to say in the next 10-20 years. That will be another source of expense on top of my debt. I'm not saying my dad is a potential burden. I'm just being realistic. People tend to fall ill as they grow older.

I'm a guy. From the traditional point of view, I think a guy gotta do what a guy gotta do when I'm in a relationship or in the future, provide a comfortable living for my partner. I just feel that I'm set back a few years of what others would probably have achieved because of my debt and other would-be unexpected expenses.

My rant is pointless because nothing is going to change. I'm going to do what I'm supposed to do to clear my debt. I'm writing this entry perhaps to make myself feel better, somehow. Thanks for reading.

Out of boredom I sometimes dredge the backwaters of the Internet. Stomp, TRS, etc,etc. And at times I laugh out loud at the misplaced xenophobia I see. There's folk who somehow resent / feel threatened by FW and FT from neighboring Asian countries. FW y'all anyhow need to sustain the construction/manufacturing industry. Domestic workers y'all need to be able to run household AND manage career. FT y'all need cause, well, Y'ALL NEED. Unfortunately workers with the right skills aren't all available locally. Age-old argument: don't let's get into it. 
It is incredibly silly to resent these fellow Asians who are in no way better off than you and can't really harm you if they are no better skilled than you. You want someone to resent? I'll give you someone.
Go take a nice walk around any Cold Storage and I'll tell you. 
WARNING: I'M ABOUT TO STIR SOME SHIT
I can't speak for every single one, but a majority of Westerners who live and work here simply don't deserve the lifestyle nor income they have. I am not saying white people are usurpers but many of their qualifications are valued simply because they are from white countries' institutions. These are bare facts. Go ask any of your family/friends who work in MNCs. In reality they are largely NOT better skilled than us (perhaps they have more of the so-called soft skills and ability to sell themselves). 
I am a second generation Singaporean, so at some points in my schooling I have attended international schools. The foreign teachers have shit qualifications (& when they first come to SG they literally have only a couple of outfits to wear and no cash to spare) and are appointed because the rich Asian students from countries like Korea like to see white faces. My fellow students who were from Western countries led lifestyles their families simply cannot sustain in their home countries (see: Expat package). 
I must tell you, that my father came to Singapore from India with his family 15 yrs ago. His qualifications and experience were in line with the expat package offered by his company. But guess what happened? Brown folk back then weren't expats. We led a shit life compared to our lifestyle in India for about 5 yrs after arriving.
My parents both work in Western MNCs with local managers. They've seen clearly less-effective people receive recognition due to their race. And they've been passed up for opportunities countless times for no good reason. And these people are the hardest working people I have ever seen in my life: perhaps JUST like all your parents. 
My mother is an Academic English lecturer in a private tertiary education institute. She is more qualified than a majority of her office and is technically to have an authoritative role. The local managers who appointed a half-white slacker (who used to report to her) as her superior. He dumps all the work on her, runs away and later comes back to find fault. This precedent ensures that no other staff actually respects her. Why is this possible? Because no-one here questions his actions AT ALL.
Just think, is it normal for a foreigner to be living better life than the locals in their own country? Living in the best parts of town, enjoying the best professional positions and lifestyle? If we went to their countries we'd first have to fight against discrimination and struggle to establish ourselves. 
Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends growing up have been white expats (one of who became PR and is serving NS now) and some of my most influential mentors have been white. BUT until we Asians liberate ourselves of this mindset that Western=better, we will never be truly successful.

To   Whats the point of going overseas with Singaporeans??? The point of exchange is to step out of your comfort zone and immerse yourself with the local culture, something that you wont be able to achieve if you stick around with Singaporeans. I have seen many of my friends who go overseas and just hang out with Singaporeans (and knowing how Singaporeans are so clique-ish) do not interact with locals at all !!! like seriously what's the point of SEP if you do not interact with locals? just go by yourself and if there's ever a time for you to step out of your comfort zone, SEP is the best time #peaceout

Many of my peers are not concerned with world’s affairs either. Not only world’s affairs, they are basically disinterested in any field of knowledge (within or out of their major discipline) except those that they have any use for (to get a degree or to help them navigate the labyrinth of life). They simply not like to think.

However, I don’t blame them. I see it as a ‘social conditioning’ imposed by the society on them. We are brought up, through our social interactions with our parent, relatives, friends, acquaintances and that with the television, as well as, influenced by the ideals propagated by the newspaper to come to the single definition of a ‘Singaporean life’.

I surveyed the majority of my peers unofficially, through the occasional questionings on their life goals. I observed that for many of them, they see themselves in the future, being desk bound to a job, meeting a partner whom they will share the rest of their lives with, saving up for that exorbitantly priced wedding dinner and HDB flat, watching their kids attend their first class, married and repeating the same cycle they went through. To me, I don’t see it as a bad thing afterall. In fact, it shows the success of our nation, being able to secure the lives of many individuals in this manner, granting many safe, generally healthy and adequately satisfied lives. And isn’t that an aim, a bare minimum aim that any society hopes to achieve? I came to accept that some people wish to come and go, they don’t question, they don’t make an impact and all they wish for is a happy and peaceful life. I respect that.

Yet, this world is not at all a peaceful and loving place. It is a place filled with problems. People, invisible to our eyes, everywhere face tribulations, sufferings and experience sadness. They have problems, the poor can’t put food in their mouths, the LGBTs being denied of their rights to be with their loved ones, the senseless killing of innocents for supposedly religious purposes and the countless sins (not the religious sins but merely wrongdoings) of everyone make this world, an ugly, ugly world. Yet, we have created this peaceful, living Utopia in the bigger chaotic world. My peers are never concerned with solving differential equations, because they have never been asked to solve a flow problem. They never cared about LGBTs’ rights, because they are not one, not related to one and never inclined to interact with one. They are concerned with their graduation trips, starving in order to save up, to bear witness of some of the world’s ugliest sights in Times Square, of the merciless capitalism it symbolizes but never about the person beside them, who is not saving up to put food in his mouth. Wait! Is there such person beside them? Yes, in our peaceful Utopia, there is, but they never appeared in their minds before.

If all in my life, I have wake up, to live through each day in the same cycle and yet, I lived through each day not encountering any major problems that challenge the foundation of my living at all, where would be my incentives to be concerned about the world affairs or any other things that in spite the knowledge of it, would still allow me to continue living my life in this same manner? For me, the answer is obvious. For many, the only wake up call comes when problem arises. When life shows its almightiness by slapping one’s face and say, “Hey! It isn’t that simple afterall, right?”. When injustices start knocking their doors, then they will start asking, what is the purpose of my life, forgetting that they forgot to ask what WAS the purpose of my life. Do I wish that to happen? Strictly speaking, no.

Sometimes I ask myself this. Why am I bothered with current and world affairs, philosophy and other branches of sciences and humanities unrelated to my major study? The short answer is: because of life’s vicissitudes. I would never know what life set out to challenge me, but I know I ought to be prepared for any challenges. My own purpose of living is not to live through each day the same as anyone else and at the same time, expect my kids to do the same. I want to contribute, because the more I read about other people’s challenges, I realize this world cannot afford to lose another person to the mendacity of our society. We cannot waste another person’s life by not dedicating his life to the resolution of problems, to the problems are that are far greater and require so much of our brains, bodies and souls.

We are creating a wasteful Utopia here, while it lasts.

I realise the way my friend structure is like is somewhat like how Singapore is structured. Few natural resources to offer, but extremely broad connections to many different segments of friends. In fact, when a friend has trouble, I can tap onto lots of other networks for help. In such a way, my friends can essentially do lots of transit traffic through me for help. From the perspective of a hub point, it's actually a great thing: I can get to pick up valuable skills from other people, and pick on transit traffic to learn more about what others do.

Of late, however, I realised many of the "friends" around me are purely transactional, just as like how Singapore's friends are. When Malaysia has issues with water, they can randomly ask to cut it. Or when the U.S. has a human rights issue, they just issue condemnations. Or just dao me lor, simple, just because my network doesn't seem to cover what they want, or because I made friends with people whom they have trouble with.

In reality I realised I may have plenty of friends and operate a hub network, but it may well be obliterated extremely quickly if someone else develops a better hub. Maybe it can take more connections, or perhaps it just can outspeed my hub capabilities.

I have a number of bilateral agreements with various friends, but I need to keep on upgrading to make sure people see the value in signing bilateral ties with me.

Friendship seems like the game of international relations. People make friends for network coverage or support. If not, why make a friend?

I mean, certainly one is in good stead with a psychologist, doctor, teacher contact, political contact, academic, technician, web server helper, e.t.c. Can't do everything by myself right?

Some people use the argument that legalizing homosexual marriages in Singapore will cause the already declining birth rate to decline even further.  

To these people, my suggestion is that they campaign for the legalization of rape.  As more girls get raped, there will be more chances of having babies in Singapore.

This is to all who have an opinion about LGBT issues.

There are different systems of politics and constitutions around the world. In Singapore a constitutional challenge was struck down and in US the plaintiff got what they want. Regardless of what your stance is on the issue, do not let your emotions distract you from what these are - legal challenges. I support LGBT rights but the legal and political framework is more important. That is to say, the last thing I want is to celebrate the US nationwide legalisation of same-sex marriage and find out that the US constitution does not guarantee this provision. This is one of the points that the dissenting judges have tried to is that the constitution neither prohibits nor guarantee same-sex marriage and that this should be left to individual states. This doesn't only apply to LGBT rights. Just because you get the results you want doesn't mean that it was legal. Generally unless all legal avenues have been exhausted, it would be morally wrong to use illegal means.

To  I have been in an inter-racial relationship for two years with my boyfriend now. He's Malay-Muslim and I'm Chinese-Agnostic. I fast occasionally during Ramadan with him and our relationship has really opened my eyes to a different culture as well as the crazy privileges that I have as a Chinese man in Singapore that I otherwise won't realize. 

When we first got together, I've had friends who weren't really sure if it was going to work because of our religious and cultural differences but honestly, I don't think they are problems to our relationship. Rather, I think it has helped me grow as a person in many different ways. 

On the issue of parents, I stupidly came out to my parents the same time I told them I had a boyfriend, and that he's Malay-Muslim. They practically went bat-shit crazy and had a conspiracy theory that he basically practices black magic and cast a love potion on me to turn me gay. (Yeah, cuz all Malays practice black magic according to Ch 5's Incredible Tales, y'know!) 

Well anyway, I think it's really up to individual parents and how open they are. My parents basically told me in my face that the last thing they wanted was for me to bring home a Malay or Indian girlfriend. (Too bad for them, it turned out to be a Malay boyfriend HAHA!) I know of many other couples, gay and straight, that are inter-racial and everything's just going as well as same-race couples so I don't think you should worry too much! When there are problems, it's really up to the couple to work it out together and sometimes, these hurdles help build your relationship too! 

All the best and just know that the world is becoming more open and I believe love will ultimately prevail against all odds so go for it!! ❤️❤️

 Girls whom are "prettier" are more likely to be able to have it all, as a result of which, most of them have "poorer" character. This stands in contrast with "uglier" girls, where most of them have "better" character. (Note "most of them." There are bound to be outliers, but is there a trend?)

So many evergreen and singlehood posts.

Eh, why so kan chiong? Chill lah...

Having a girlfriend/boyfriend isn't the most important thing in life. Not like you urgently need one.

Generally, at your age (presumably 21 - 25), the most sensible priority will be to chart your career and life direction. The underlying implication is that, you simply need to have a ready source of income on your own, because your parents are growing old as you're growing up. This is the time to ramp up your level of independence. Don't be a burden, but have broader shoulders to tank what's to come.

Think about cost of living. Without a decent income, wedding, housing, transport, food and all that will all be a big problem. I'm dead sure you don't wanna be worrying about this at the back of your head when you go on dates.

Think about timing. This is not secondary school stead or ship you know. It takes time to know a person who's gone through years in life. 感情是燜雞湯，不是煮快熟麵，是需要培養的。As you know it, instant noodles can be rather toxic, but herbal soup can be tonic.

We're talking about someone to spend the rest of your lives with. Not flings. Your relationship involves companionship, compromise, life direction, world views and all that deep stuff. You won't want a heartbreak, a cheating spouse or a divorce. Especially not when you already have kids because they're bearing the brunt of all the drama, which will be credited to mistakes of their previous generation(s). Hey, kids are better off not going through most of the things they go through nowadays, such as broken homes and all that nonsense.

In short, sort out your own life first. Take your time!

In response to  Not everybody wants to live a mediocre life like you do! Totally fine being average and working one job and taking one good shit a day (actually the latter already is above average, people with bowel issues in this room raise your hand) but why fault others for caring more about the different aspects of their lives? We are mostly in our early 20s and this is the best period in life to go after exactly what you want, be it finding the love of your life and making it a core purpose or getting a fulfilling career that's your raison d'être. I liked and started reading this page daily because of the possibility for empathy here, less the judgment and I hope it'll be kept that way. I myself am looking for my meaning in life, how to achieve it and figuring out how to balance being me from being a daughter, gf and friend and I wanted to say that although I don't like or comment I honestly feel for some of the relationship OPs - sometimes all you need to know is that you're not alone in feeling/thinking something :)

The dangerous mentality that 1) there exists an index that accurately profiles an individual's skill and 2) promotions are wholly or even significantly based on talent, academic or otherwise, has got to stop.

This goes especially to the growing horde of privileged undergraduates putting down their peers who are poorer, financially or otherwise, with flimsy arguments citing laziness or even 'your parents owe you nothing'. You aren't remaining there for long if you underestimate and underutilise what you are truly endowed with.

To , congratulations! 'Interracial relationships' are to me, special, although i would just call it a 'relationship'. I am Chinese and I was in a relationship with an Indian girl as well. I think the best thing that happened from it was that you grow up with all these assumptions and ideas of the other races, and when these things get broken down and it becomes apparent how much different races can coexist, it really brings a whole new perspective on all these people we've considered as 'others'.

During my relationship for about a year and a half we faced it all, from her friends who weren't happy seeing such developments to my friends who were unnerved at a Chinese guy choosing an Indian girl. Her parents were unhappy because I was "taking away" their daughter, and my parents were the sort to say she was after our "Chinese wealth" (sigh). During our outside dates which were rather infrequent and obviously done in secret, there would be stares and certainly some judgemental looks cast upon us. All of these things never fazed us however, we continued in what I still consider now as one of the happiest and healthiest relationships I've ever invested time and effort into. 

So my opinion is that regardless of whatever relationship you get yourself into, as long as you are both invested in it, nothing can bring you down. Nothing external can impose what they deem is "right" on your decision. (See how adults swoon over mixed-race children? Hypocrites.) Don't worry about external opinions. Focus on where you are both going, discuss openly regarding differences-religion, dietary requirements, customs, festivals, even habits (she eats dinner at 10pm and I at 6, she loves being late and I am always early) and embrace the unique choice of this relationship. All the best! :D

I notice there's this "anti-rich" sentiment that is quite widely held. I think it is misplaced resentment. Especially since in NUS there are no stupid people who can get in by their parents money. Nobody chooses who they are born to and so long as they do not misuse money to undermine others, why are they resented? We live in a meritocracy. So just continue to honestly and sincerely play to your strengths and you will confirm find success. Love, from a hardworking rich kid (who is btw doing a job now) whose parents weren't always rich and who worked hard to get where they are.

Ever since the day I was born into this world, I got a fantastic grandma that showered me with lots of unconditional love and care. I spent most of my happy childhood with her, she would bring me to the playground and cook delicious dishes for me.Whenever my dad is caning me, grandma would always throw her body in to protect me. Eventually her age caught up and grandma's health deteriorated, Since then.. she spent the  majority of her remaining lifespan, locked up at home on a wheelchair. That's is not the worse part yet.. my mum was constantly dishing out verbal abuses at her while my dad wouldn't give a damn. I could only watched helplessly at one side, as a powerless young boy. Finally she couldn't endure all these abuses and loneliness anymore, hence she attempted suicide by cutting her own wrist. Luckily she was rushed to the hospital in time.From that day onward, I'm always searching for an answer to life, so that I can save my grandma. 

5 years ago, I joined a cult (J.W) that preach " The inevitable destruction of the world". I was taught that salvation can only be attained if you devote your life to the cult and live accordingly to its teachings. Being severely brainwashed by their doctrine, I started to develop deep hatred for the world around me. Anything that don't share the same beliefs as me, Are my enemies and they will be destroyed by my god! I became so delusional to the point that, I believed myself to be an holy supreme being.

 After months of consideration, I attempted to convert my beloved grandma and bring salvation to her. However, when my parents found out that I'm involved in a cult, they proceed to control all aspects of my life. Imposing curfew and cutting my contacts from the cult, denying all my spiritual food that I required. In a short matter of time, they managed to kill my zeal and I fell into apathy. Do you know how it feels like, to wake up every single morning thinking that "We are all gonna be destroyed! We are doomed!"? Questioning the value of my existence if I couldn't live accordingly to my beliefs? I no longer saw myself as a free human, I'm a puppet that is locked inside a dark prison. Nevertheless, my grandma continued  to express her love and concern towards me, she will never ever fail to smile when i reached home safely. Instead of acknowledging her unconditional love, I would gave her the cold treatment because I felt that " You should hate me! I have failed to save you. Why smile? We are gonna perished together anyway."

My most dreadful day finally arrived. There I was.. standing beside my grandma's death bed. I stared without any emotion at every single moment until she breathed her very last breath. All the happy and sad memories flooded my mind but I told myself, "Everyone can cry, but you are the only one who don't deserved to cry. If you are not a coward she would have attained salvation". Later on, I went to a quiet staircase and burst into tears. The whole world around me descended into darkness, all I  could hear are echoes that are tormenting me. "Weak! Coward! You have failed! Disgrace!"
That is the darkest day of my life, I experienced true despair and sorrows. I have lost my precious grandma whom I love dearly.

So how do I carry on with my life afterwards? Sink into depression? Jump off a building? Drown myself in alcohol? Live a life full of regrets?
THE ANSWER IS NONE OF THE ABOVE! I continued to search for the meaning of life and true happiness. Thankfully I found it, because I refused to give up on living.

To all of you outside there who are doubting your worth, who are having suicidal thoughts. "I'm fat...unattractive.....nobody wants me..... forever alone", " I'm poor....my results are bad....I got serious family problems ....I wanna end my life"
. Listen up! Nobody says that being unattractive or having a tough life is a freaking crime. You are the one that implanted all these negativity into your brain and screwed your own self up! Just like how I implanted all the cults teachings and guilt into my brain and screwed myself up! I could have left behind more good memories with my grandma instead of creating more regrets. When you allow yourself to be blinded by all these negativity , you will unknowingly lose sight of things that are truly precious and irreplaceable! 

I have always admired the samurai spirit (Bushido). When faced with an overwhelming foe, a true samurai will stand firm and unsheathed his katana to fight honorably. Even though he knew that death is imminent, he would never reveal a single trace of fear. Fighting to the death is better then dying without honor. It's time to get out of your dark little fox holes, stop hiding and come out to battle under the light! I can't predict how many times you will get slashed. But I can assure you that the rain will come and wash off your blood stains, your wounds will heal up and become trophies.

Feels like everyone contributing to the LGBT debate is either a keyboard warrior, a repressed person in the closet, a staunch religious defender, a social activist or an anarchist. You wanna know what's common between all of these? They're all able to give their two cents worth because they're safe at home, with someone to rely on, or at the bare minimum, certain of their next meal and a warm bed. That includes myself, I know, but at least I know that during the day I'm doing my part for humanity, while I may not be able to say the same for all LGBT OPs.

Aren't there more worthwhile things to worry about than what's "natural"? Change is a constant in life, so norms will always change. The gays and lesbians now may or may not be straight in the future. Even if they did change (or not), they'd still insist it wasn't by choice. So why argue? Having said this, why not let's just call this the LG debate? The BT part of the debate hasn't been active here, and let's face it: I think they're more discriminated against than the LGs, so you LGs shouldn't get to complain about all the problems you're facing when there're people worse off. 

Moving on, world hunger is a perennial issue. I don't see movements on NUSWhispers to call for donations to help the poor and needy. Let's not even look beyond our borders. Focus on those students in NUS who require financial assistance, and are still struggling to survive. Why not fund laptops for them, so they can join in the ranting on NUSWhispers too?

Other issues like food shortage, war, human trafficking, abuse of women... Shouldn't all these take a front seat instead? Help those who can't help themselves, instead of arguing for the right to say: you don't belong in our society! Change or leave!

Hope this puts a stop to the LG debate. Getting real tired of your shit.

@ Don't worry, this is completely normal. The first few times tend to be underwhelming but it will get better with practice. You and your partner should also experiment with different positions because some feel better than others. You might also prefer clitorial stimulation. Also always remember to pee before and after sex to minimize UTIs etc + then you won't feel nervous about needing to pee

I'm so sorry to the silent majority but as a closeted Bi, I have enough of discrimination and cannot stay silent. To , so you say "we're talking about the cultures and ideas these groups has"? And the reception? Okay, so we have "cultures+ideas" and "reception". Straight people have been able to marry since the beginning of.. marriage. So there we have it: the idea of marriage. So why can't LGBTs practice their idea of marriage too? Why is it against the law? This is when "reception" comes in right? I tolerate and agree with straight marriage. Even if I "disagree, but just tolerate," I will still let them get married because it's none of my business. So why are a select group of people who disagree with LGBT marriage actively trying to prevent LGBT marriage from becoming legal? It's not even their business. If they're trying to uphold their values of traditional marriage, they are free to do so, but they simply cannot force others to accept their own idea of a traditional marriage. Just make LGBT marriage legal already. I have no idea why I'm the one who's forcing my idea of marriage onto the other camp, when it's clear the heteronormalists who say marriage must be strictly between a man and a woman, is imposing it on all of us by not supporting the legalisation of alternative forms of marriage.

On the other hand, your example of Chinese Buddhists' offerings burning has a negative effect on people who don't agree with it: the pollution. Now for the reception: people may disagree with it but still tolerate with this negative effect. Because it IS a choice to burn offerings near other people's houses, and it IS a choice to be Buddhist. Given the pollution generated, there is actually something to tolerate about. So yes, it is plausible to tolerate but still disagree. But you're using this example to support your argument that people can also tolerate but still disagree to LGBT marriage, which is invalid. Because what's there to tolerate about LGBT marriage? Since, as described above, LGBTs marrying is none of your business, what negative effect is there? Is it that the gay agenda will spread and distort your familial values? This is when the whole thing about LGBT not being a choice comes in! If you gay, you gay. If you straight, you straight. Your traditional familial values will not get eroded, unless your son dons an LGBT sexuality like an accessory, then it's right to tell him not to do that. You get to practice your traditional familial values. Now, give us the legal right to practice ours.

So there you go, politically we should legalise LGBT marriages. In fact so many developed countries have done it already, or are ready for it. As for the economic POV you mentioned, I'm not sure how sexuality affects the economy. So once again, Singapore is not ready for LGBT rights, notably the right to marry. But I hope we catch up soon.

This is my take on PinkDot and LGBT rights in general as well and my feelings towards the backlash faced by camps on both sides of an issue.

Such issues are usually emotional in nature, rather than logical. I believe that one's stand towards it can be defined simply by one question. Is homosexuality a sin?

There are three possible answers: a) a sin b) it's in our genes, c) it's normal. a and c are pretty direct, for b I would say it as "sitting on the fence". They won't choose to defend any stand.

People call for dialogue between camps on both sides; a very 'textbook' method. But this being a emotional issue, no amount of throwing arguments about gay people are at higher risk of AIDS or they can't have biological children will sway the other side. Neither would rubbishing the beliefs of religions will sway the side opposed to gay marriage. I don't think it's gonna work; looking at the 'dialogues' between countries.

I feel that some sections of the groups that are against PinkDot and gay marriage have chosen to do things rather provocatively. In 2014, a social welfare group with links to Lawrence Khong (I don't think I need to explain who he is) tried to organize a Pro-Family rally (RedDot) on the same day as PinkDot were held. To me, this is clearly an relatively direct act of provocation and protestation against PinkDot. On PinkDot day itself, there were people who "wore white" in protest and walked around the areas at Hong Lim Park. Lawrence Khong is considered to be rather influential here; his words have the ability to persuade a large number of people. Perhaps if he feels that he is uncomfortable with homosexuality, he wouldn't have faced such a big backlash himself. But he chose to equate it to drug addicts, which people aren't happy about it.

There is also the issue of the banning of the "penguin book". What was that for? The people behind the banning claimed that it was not representative of a traditional family, but it was nothing more than another act of provocation. It's ok to have a certain stand, but to deny people of finding out more about homosexuality in an academic way is wrong. Some people do really want to eradicate/ban homosexuality. Naturally, a backlash would have occurred. I don't agree with the claims of "bullying tactics" of the opposite camp, as they were provoked into that response. If supporters of gay rights crashed FCBC's services or holding a parade at where FCBC is located, we can call them out on that. I was looking for Lawrence Khong or perhaps members of FCBC to stand up and claim that they disagree with actions taken. Nope, if I didn't remember wrongly I believe Khong to have supported the banning of the "penguin book".

Furthermore, the uproar over including information about homosexuality on HPB's website has shown the agenda of a number of pro-family people (I repeat, A NUMBER NOT ALL). Why are these people lobbying to remove that? It provides useful information to people who really need it. Khong's disagreement of choosing Oogachaga as a source of help over other organizations that are probably pro-family has provoked people who support LGBT rights. Why would I want to listen to advice on how to 'cure' my homosexuality? I would choose Oogachaga.

So what do people do when they feel threatened/hurt? We often want to make ourselves feel better. Think about the times when we swore, whether at another person or alone. Did we feel better? Technically yes. This is what is going on. People from both sides feel threatened and we all resort to heavy criticism. 

We go on to sexuality education in school. Groups have chosen to remain silent about the homosexuality issue, and this isn't fair to people who are interested. They simply continue to preach abstinence before marriage, but simply that's outdated and there needs to be more relevant and current affairs, at the very least. There have been also cases of students who have homosexual relationships being bullied by their schoolmates and staff in the school. Yet, if the pro-family groups claim that they "love the sinner", why are they not speaking up?

To  : 

"We are not born with homosexuality in our genes, and that has been theologically and scientifically proven."

I am usually open minded listening to theological claims but when people use science willy-nilly I feel the urge to punch a duck. 

This is a bold and untrue scientific claim. Science has not proven that there is no homosexuality in our genes. As for you "theologically proven", bringing this term into the game leaves no room for rational reasoning.

And I once again profess my disgust towards the convenient insertion of scientific claims in such arguments. Virgin birth, holy miracles, creationism etc. are all scientifically untrue. What then? Do theological explanations trumps science? If so, do not bring science into the picture in the first place. It is embarrassing to wield science as a weapon only when it agrees with your subscription of the Daily Bread.

So after nullifying your "scientific evidence", your entire post basically boils down to:

"Homosexuality is purely a choice, I think. I think that because that is what scripture says.

I interpret the scripture that way because it make sense to me.

And based on that, choosing homosexuality is wrong because that is what scripture says.

I interpret the scripture that way because it make sense to me. "

So what is your basis? God? Or you?

To: 

I quote you.

<Your sexuality is not a choice, just like how your sex and gender is not a choice. Our founding father also thinks our sexuality is genetically predisposed, if you're keen on quoting him.>

I already agreed on this point on my very first post. I don't see why you pulling this back up brings us anything new across the table. And yes precisely why I quoted him.

When we're talking about tolerance, whether race(with reference to your case), we're are talking about the cultures and ideas these groups has. The reception of their actions to the rest of the community. Nothing on whether it is innate or a choice. It is the doings that matters. No one cares whether you are born blind/3 hands/wants to marries a dog, until their movements affects someone else.

"Choice" was never our focal point. *back to my very first point which you quoted again which I still do not understand why when I mentioned I'm with you on that*

Example, Chinese Buddhist burn offerings during 7 month? Probably annoys some people, tolerance and compromise again. 

This whole LGBT thing will go on for a long time. There is always going to be extremist on either sides. If you are not going to accept certain ideas from the opposing parties we will never be able to move forward.

If I may bring the focal back. We are talking about LGBT from a economic and political pov. 
If you are going to ignore these 2 driving factors than I see no merits in having an academic discussion.

Gay/Traditional parenting in regards to children?
Its effects are still debatable and subjective. 
Article was on actual views from people directly involved.
To add on, I didnt make a stand, why so defensive?(comment section)

I'm going to lay it as straight as possible. A huge number especially the 70s to 80s generation are largely misinformed or conservative on this topic. Until we choose to see whey they are coming from and then enlighten them, hate/non-acceptance is still going to continue. For example, an anti fb page with a significant number of followers which has active participation is on as we speak.

PS you using the word baffles when it isn't worries me.

Cheers show some love. Its always fruitful discussions that brings people forward.

And there are many people silently following this thread on this page btw.

As a Christian, I have no issues with people of different sexual orientations, yet I am worried about the rise of LGBT culture leading to the erosion of societal and familial values. From time to time, there is rising evidence revealing how traditional families produce less dysfunctional children in general compared to alternative family lifestyles.

Some of my friends, if they find out my true viewpoint on the LGBT movement, will not be hesitant to call me out as a backwards minded conservative, resorting to ad hominem arguments just for disagreeing with the politically correct view. Yet, I wish to discuss such issues openly without being labelled as a bigot for the rest of university life. 

Contrary to what most people think today, the hate has not gone away. The tables have turned, with discrimination now used against us. What homosexuals felt ten years ago strongly mirrors what quite a number of religious people feel presently. 

I hope for a future when such issues can be discussed openly, a future where people can freely state their personal opinions, knowing that any response towards the opinion will not be filled with vitriol and emotional outbursts, but a logical response that directly addresses the points raised.

I consider myself gender-neutral (biologically I'm a guy). But I have a strong dislike and try to dissociate as much as possible from a 'guy' stereotype. Although I struggle to fully identify myself as a female, but people say I have general 'stereotypical' traits of females (eg being more emphatic etc). 

I'm actually kinda interested in the idea of painting my nails as a form of expression. I personally think for now, expressing my real self is not really appropriate (at least in Singapore) and my dad would be very angry about it anyway, but I felt that painting nails was a more subtle way of going about it. 

Just wanted to know how people here think about a 'biological guy' painting their nails? I know that true friends wouldn't judge, I was wondering about how accepting/tolerant people are.

Referencing to:  and .

 I could sympathies with your views and where you were coming from, until: 

I feel that Singapore needs to rethink what it means to have a "traditional family structure". Since when was it traditional for a couple to comprise of a man and a woman? Maybe "dominant family structure" should have been the phrase we're using?>
 
Maybe a quick google would have shown some quick information and views about traditional/gay parenting. 

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/8/gay-couples-children-oppose-same-sex-marriage-tell/?page=all

I believe I speak for many others that most people are really fine and rather tolerant on the Homosexuality topic. Yes you are probably right about the inability to choose the gender you love etc.... 

But legalisation? Unfortunately, I believe our society at least in our case of Singapore isn't exactly ready to take that in just yet.

This whole situation is another game of chicken and egg just like Racism, Religion. To keep peace, its all about tolerance and accepting people for who they are. But agreeing with it is a whole different ball game.

From a political and economic pov. Legalisation would mean housing/grants rights, protective rights, women's charter(?). To put it simply, its going to a hell of a journey.

Most people would rather not talk about this subject because chances are if they're not playing on the "right court", its going to make them sound like a bunch of hypocrites anyway.

I took the liberty to google some stats in the USA.
http://www.statista.com/topics/1249/homosexuality/

But of course at the end of the day, we should all show some love.

Tolerance, acceptance and inclusive.

Okay this isnt a confession but something i want to get off my chest. But because i am too humji i shall post this anonymously HAHAH! Seeing so many posts regarding legalising  LGBT marriages in singapore have set me thinking about the society these days.  Before I start proper, allow me to give my two cents worth about LGBTs. Well, I am straight but I truly respect the LGBTs right to love. However, affairs of the heart is extremely complex and most of the time many of us do not fully understand how to love or even what is love. In my opinion, legalising LGBT marriages isnt just about democratism, equality and the freedom to love, it is also closely tied to the traditional family structure in singapore. If legalising LGBT marriages really does happen then should polygamy be allowed too? How many are opened to the idea of polygamy? FYI, Polygamy is prohibited in singapore except for muslim marriages. Under Syariah law, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives at one time. - See more at: http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/eight-questions-bigamy-singapore-answered-20141127#sthash.LOeDTtgs.dpuf (HEH! TALK ABOUT EQUALITY HAHAHA okay thats besides the point) Many kings in the past also practise polygamy and I am pretty sure humans are able to love (not to be confused with lust) more than one partner throughout our entire life. However, due to our societal restrictions we are restricted to having only one spouse. Okay dont get me wrong, I am definitely supportive of having only one spouse and being faithful to him/her, but i cant help but think about how similar these two deviant family structure are. Polygamy family structure could be functional and "normal" too. LGBT isnt "wrong", neither is polygamy , however these two just doesnt conform to our "traditional family" mindset which we are taught since young. They are grey areas that the singapore government is not willing to set foot into YET. Maybe its just me but my friends and peers my age are mostly understanding and accepting towards lesbians, bi and gays. I believe this is due to the education we received and i definitely agree that education liberates soceity. So good job to pink dot in educating the public about LGBTs and freedom to love, but sadly, like what Mr lee had said singapore is just not ready. Perhaps not in the near future, but maybe someday. 
And here's to all LGBTs, straights, cheers and best wishes to finding love in a hopeless place.

 Depending on how you define a 'need', sex can be a need because we are biologically driven to want to have sex and thus have children. 
But just because you need something, does it mean that it is justifiable to do anything to get it? 
Rapists are scum and no matter the circumstances, their victims do not deserve it. 

Rather than to call it ignorance, what your mother is doing is victim blaming. Victim blaming is a common phenomenon, and in my opinion, a very sad one. It shifts the responsibility of a crime away from the perpetrator to the victim. Most people have the belief that humans are inherently good, and that nothing bad will happen to themselves. Do you live each day thinking that you may get raped, assaulted or killed? Of course not. 

So when someone gets raped, assaulted or killed, people try to find excuses for the perpetrators. "The victim must be dressed skimpily; the victim must be a terrible person; etc. I don't dress skimpily; I am a good person etc, therefore I am safe from those crimes." Some people find it hard to believe that people can do bad things and do not want to entertain the possibility that they may be at risk, so they blame the victims instead. By distancing themselves from the victims, these people feel safe from the crimes. 

Back to the topic of rape, a majority of the victims know their rapists, such as ex-es, dates, acquaintances etc. Do you think the rapists will only choose to strike because of how the victim dresses? That's plain ridiculous and does a lot of injustice to the victims. Rather than to tell people not to attract rapists, shouldn't the message to be tell people NOT to become rapists?

To OP of , I am glad that you currently do not share the views of your mother, and I hope you will not. 
Victim blaming is a understandable response, but it shouldn't be tolerated. If someone is raped, then the only person to be blamed is the rapist.

I am the OP you're replying to. Sorry if I didn't make my statements clear, I didn't generalize ALL Singaporeans to be showing senseless/justified hatred against mainland Chinese. I'm just stating that the surge in this trend is a worrying sign.

Being a true blue Singaporean or not is irrelevant to the topic. 

Now to the topic of being a true blue Singaporean,

I've asked my Singaporean friends what makes them a true blue Singaporean, some of the responses were; they must be born here, ability to speak Singlish or experience life normal Singaporeans would.

I've spent much of my childhood in Singapore; going to a neighbourhood primary & secondary school, playing childhood games like "catching" and "ice man" at playgrounds below HDB blocks, eating ice pops purchased from the nearby "mama shop" after school, if these are the "nostalgic stuff" you've mentioned, yes I've been through most of it as well. But do that make me a true blue Singaporean?

If you can only be a true blue Singaporean if you're born and bred here, does that mean I will never be a true blue Singaporean and only my later generations would be counted as one?

The sole purpose of people migrating to another area is for them to have a better prospect. Will you migrate to Germany or the United States just to be a German or American citizen? No right? People migrate because they want to have a better life and there's nothing wrong with that.

My parents brought me here to have a better future because Singapore is known to be one of the highly educated and safest city to live in. I met my love here and I feel comfortable living in this city. I don't intend to migrate in the future because I've spent most of my life growing up here. Do that answer your queries?

I am an Engineering student currently studying in NUS. I came from China more than a decade ago and attained Singapore citizenship after graduating from secondary education. I served National Service as well so most of my friends treat me like any other Singaporeans and few people can tell I'm originated from China. However, the recent surge in hatred against the mainland Chinese in Singapore has started to irk me. I was furious that China's image has been tarnished by a few black horses and Singaporeans are so ready to jump to the conclusion that all the mainland Chinese behave like these black horses. I've tried to talk sense to people online but my words fell on deaf ears. The frustration and helplessness is driving me insane. Need some advice in how to convince the China-phobic Singaporeans.

Benefits of being single for a guy: save on money and lots of freedom. Benefits of being in a relationship for a girl: sense of security and being treated like a princess. It looks like there is nothing to look forward to in a relationship for a guy.

Being in NUS, friends see me from a family who appears well-to-do. However, what they didn't see is a family picture that is broken and pieced up by tape. Each year, there is a new crack that is pieced together with more tape. A mother who goes gambling and a father (still recovering from sickness) who is the opposite and just takes it in. We can't comment on going to casino as there will be threats of divorce, taking the money etc, and who knows what.

Gambling & Casino is a highly sensitive topic in the house.

As usual, relatives will ask when are you getting your gf? 

I can only just say that I don't have the time when in fact, because of the rising cost of living, I will want to say I don't have the time and money to go dating or support a family of my own.

I am thinking of the future when I have to take care of Dad and Mum in their old age, slowly taking charge of the household matters/finances. I just feel that if I can't take care of my house & parents in the future, I can't go on thinking about getting a gf or a family or a children of my own.

I mean even if your nails look great, but your facial, physical features and personality are abysmal, does it really help you look attractive? Maybe among ladies they tend to admire each others' nails, but as a guy, I hardly even notice your nails. 

Ladies, please elaborate. So I can better convince my fiancée to save up more for our future :PP

To , no! You're not alone! I felt that  and  were more like advertisements than real confessions. 

To  if you really feel upset for your mentor Hong being criticised, why don't you share your own success story with his methods rather than give  his background? How's that supposed to convince anyone. And honestly, if I want to learn the art of pick up, I'd prefer someone who has succeeded in picking up hundreds of woman rather than being rejected by them. It's good to learn from your failures, but until you've turned failure into concrete success, you shouldn't be coaching others yet.

I just want to tell you: never allow someone to be your priority, while allowing yourself to be their option.

 Altruism means helping others at a significant cost to oneself (sometimes death). What you've mentioned is prosocial behaviour, where you help others, but when the rewards are higher then the costs. The gains you've said, and repaying of debt is prosocial behaviour and not altruism.

I chanced upon an old diary of mine and randomly flipped through a few entries. 

Here's an excerpt from one of them:
"List all the qualities you don't like in other people [was reading some self-help book].
...narcisstic, homesexuality,..."

OMG, to all my friends who are gay, I am so sorry. I knew I was homophobic, but did not know I was that homophobic four years ago. Here is someone who has changed from being homophobic to someone who realizes people who belong to the LGBTQA community are simply just people. Hope that we will have an even more accepting society than we currently have!

To add on to  If you really want to look at it from an evolutionary standpoint (and not a moralistic POV), you would save your parents because your offspring with your mother (yes I know it is morally wrong but hypothetically) will on average have 50 [your own genes] + (0.5 x 50) [since 50% of your mother genes are also your genes] = 75% genetic similarity; compared to an offspring with a complete stranger that will harbour only 50% of your genes.

Also, to those who are invoking the theory of evolution by NATURAL SELECTION to argue for or against LGBTQ issues, please note: In order to use natural selection as an explanation, there has to be a unit of selection (in this case a gay gene). Since so many opponents of LGBT have claimed that homosexuality is not natural (read: not genetic), it does not make sense to have an evolutionary argument. If homosexuality is as they said acquired, it should not be passed on to the next generation because of epigenetic reprogramming. Whether LGBTQ should have equal rights is completely up to debate (by the way I'm gay); the point of this is to tell you guys: if you guys want to use evolution to back up your arguments use the proper terms. I (metaphorically) get cancer every time I read badly-substantiated arguments.

*ps There was a book to explain homosexuality from a evolutionary standpoint and I thought it was fantastic. Go read it if you can (since its summer vacation). 

Peace.

 I'm the one who wrote . The evolutionary argument is not sufficient to explain why we choose to save our parents. Assuming our parents are 50 +/ 60+, how likely are they going to pass down the genes (apart from us)? Not very likely, comparing to saving a stranger who we may have a relation with and pass down OUR own genes. Saving our parents therefore takes MORE than evolutionary explanation, otherwise we should save other people instead.

FYI, I discussed this with my psychology professor during the semester.

"It's not natural and serve no evolutionary purpose blah blah" but the Earth is overpopulated by humans, so maybe we shouldn't mind at all. Better than having them breed like rabbits and just add more stress to the environment.

This post is with reference to ,  and .

Some people are saying that Singapore is largely a conservative society, as evidenced by the Singapore law. But is Singapore still a largely conservative society? Do the current laws reflect what the majority of Singaporeans think?

I am straight, and most, if not all, of the people I know who are also straight are very open to the idea of homosexuality. 

I am not an expert in the Singapore justice system, but just think about  this question: who decides what laws to pass? Do Singaporeans vote on what laws to pass, or does the decision lie in the hands of a few ministers. 

Take the recent liquor law as an example. The law was passed based on the majority of a focus group of 40+ people and a couple of hundred surveys agreeing to law being passed. Where did they get the sample from and who did they ask? They sure did not ask for my opinion and neither they ask the other 5 million Singaporeans, including you. How are the results representative of what he majority of Singaporeans think? Were the results rigged? 

My point is: could it be that the truly conservative people are the ministers (who are most likely be from the older generation) who enacted the law? 

And most Singaporeans are open to the idea of homosexuality, but this 'fact' is hidden behind the facade of the law that may not be representative of what the majority of Singaporeans truly feel? 

I am not trying to say which is the truth, but would just like for us to be critical and not take what we are told at face value. I am sure those who are educated will know that what the government or news reports tell us may or may not be the truth. 

Peace out.

To , ah, the typical argument from ignorance. "It doesn't seem natural and serves no purpose evolutionary speaking" that is your claim, and just because it seems that way does not mean it is that way. And you make it sound as if atheism is a religion. I'm an atheist, yet I support their lifestyle.

And even if it isn't natural, or serve no purpose, what makes it so that the lifestyle should not be supported? Is it natural to wear clothes? Is it natural to kick around some ball, and worse, watch a bunch of people kicking one ball? Do all these serve any direct evolutionary purpose?

This is the OP of  and  and I promise this is the very last Whisper I will make regarding this topic. I never expected the original  made to defend victims of rape to blow up into a multi-faceted monster filled with so much love and hate in equal measure. For instance freedom of speech was brought up; social justice bullying was brought up. My initial intention of writing  was to emphatise and show solidarity with rape survivors. Unfortunately, like a porcupine I started getting defensive and hit back, which was a bad move. I lost track of my initial intention. As such I wish to tie up these loose ends and make several apologies in this final Whisper.

First up are apologies to Lexus and Jiawei. I took ~3 hours writing , trying to 1) be tactful, 2) keep my argument faultless, 3) be short and sweet, because the last thing I want is for people to TL;DR. It was tough trying to find a balance between these 3 but I had to do it. Unfortunately this meant I had to make several assumptions, and one of those assumptions would eventually be that both of you were making light of the rape survivor's situation, by using the phrase "what did I just read". It seemed like a reasonable assumption to make at that time, it seemed very convincing that you both were using "what did I just read" as the meme, not as anything else. As the events unfold, I eventually realised that was a terrible assumption to make, which means I failed at points 1 and 2. I am truly sorry for making that assumption, Lexus and Jiawei, and I believe both of you fully empathise with the confessor, and rape survivors in general.

Another way I failed at 2) was not acknowledging that men can be victims of rape too, and that the confessor was probably male. Actually I am fully aware of all that, but decided that 3) had higher priority than 2) in this context hence I omitted this. I did, however, include a Buzzfeed link with an PSA where a male is a victim of rape, albeit perpetrated by another male. Nonetheless it still wasn't enough of an acknowledgement, and I am sorry for that as well.

The next issue I have to address is how I was dangerously close to becoming a social justice bully due to . And I agree that I was close to becoming a social justice bully. But why would anyone not fervently defend something they spent a long time working on? As mentioned above I tried to attain 2), I failed because I put too much priority on 3). In other words, I missed the sweet spot between 1), 2) and 3). In actual fact I had so much more to say, and if I had said them, I would probably be spending less time now trying to defend myself, and sound like a bully while I'm at it. I was aware of the existence of social justice bullies, and wanted to steer clear from being one, but I got carried away, and spiralled to closely becoming one. But now I am stepping out of the spiral and making it clear that I stand for love, not hate, and in this context, it wasn't a good idea to fight fire with fire.

The very last point I wish to address is freedom of expression. In an ideal world, absolute free speech would co-exist with free consequence. And I would love for that to be the case. Too bad it isn't. Advocates of this ideal situation say that as a mature society we should be able to deal with speech of all kinds, even, say, inflammatory ones, and not silence them and sweep them under the rug. But sometimes that is still not possible. Take Charlie Hebdo for example. They published satirical cartoons, some referring to Islam and its fundamentalists. Yes, Muslims who take offence should just deal with it in a mature manner, either by starting constructive discussions, or by ignoring them, whatever. The bombers wanted us to push for more censorship because ignorance breeds animosity, so all the more must we resist. However, Charlie Hebdo actually drew visual depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in some of their cartoons. Can the Muslims just deal with that as a mature society? No. Because it is blasphemous just to look at visual depictions of the Prophet. Charlie Hebdo might just be critiquing the fundamentalists, they may or may not have intentions to make Muslims commit such blasphemy, but they did. Involuntary blasphemy commited by honest Muslims became one of the consequences. This is one reason why it makes more sense for us to be educated on and practice responsible free speech, rather than giving people absolute free speech and free consequence. I'm hopeful that society will eventually find the perfect balance between free speech and censorship, and as tertiary students of a prestigious Uni we should lead the way.

Kay what a long Whisper this turned out to be. Really appreciative of NUSWhispers for providing this platform for people to make peace with their fears and insecurities, for people to show their support for causes that matter, and for just general timekilling. God bless everyone in this community.

Hi all,

We're concerned over an increasing number of troll comments on NUSWhispers. From now on, users who continuously post troll comments will get a permanent ban on NUSWhispers without warning.

Likewise, feel free to report such comments by sending us a Facebook message or e-mail us at nuswhispers{at}googlegroups{dot}com.

If you think that a confession should not be approved in the first place (the moderators are humans too), feel free to drop us a message too.

Thank you for your support as we strive to make the platform better for everyone.

Regards,
NUSWhispers Team
To the ''trolls'' commentors: 

I love how this NUSWhispers platform has let some people reveal their deepest insecurities or fear. Similarly, I am impressed by the NUS students who have come forth and offer their support and condolences. This is a great culture of empathy and kindness that should be propagated and not destroyed or mocked at. 

You might not think much of your troll comments, but they can scar the OP who is sharing something that matters a lot to them and has haunted them for a long time. The people who read your ill comments get turned off too. Or even worse, people with trauma could be dissuaded from taking the first step to confronting their issues and sharing about it with others, for fear that people might react in the same way as you do. What we need to do is to let people believe that there are more people out there who are willing to support them, instead of making light of their matter.

Seriously, if you have nothing good to say, its better not to say anything at all. I doubt people are really laughing at your rude/snide/cynical/sarcastic/unsympathetic comments. There are better ways to get people to think you are funny and liking your comments (if you are into online self-validation). For your own sake, I suggest you take a break from commenting before more people get aware of you and you start ruining your own social life. 

Sincerely hope that the ''trolls'' would start exhibiting more culture and reflect their proper level of education. Personally, I think trolls are f--king lame and should only exist in parts of the internet where people have already accepted to be nonsensical. (e.g. 9gag) Do not turn this platform into a place of nonsense with your low EQ comments, thanks.

I am not gay and I do not know where i stand on the issue of gay marriages and so on. But what I would like to say to  is: Just like how you have the "freedom of religious rights to uphold traditional family values", the LGBT community should be allowed to fight for their rights too. You can fight for your values all you want but don't use your "freedom" to suppress others. 
Also, LGBT rights is not about "western values". It is about accepting people who are different from you. It is about not discriminating. 

Singapore is moving away from being a conservative society. I am glad to be part of NUS, because we are discussing about these issues instead of labeling them as taboo and ignoring them.

Recently, the newspaper posted something about the AVA rescuing animals from a workshop. Well, what they did was definitely wrong, keeping the animals locked up in cages. The first few comments that came in, very obviously, were those by people supporting and applauding the AVA regarding their efforts on the rescue. 

However, there exists a flip side to the story: while everyone sits there and shouts "hurray!!! AVA rescued animals from these cruel,cruel animal abusers!!!", no one actually stopped to consider that they might not be as guilty as you might think. 

True enough, they trapped the animals, but I do not think that they were actually aware that what they were doing constitutes to animal cruelty. It is common sense to us, university students and educated people in general, but it is not as apparent to them. I grew up in a workshop, I can see the huge divide. Instead of looking at one side from our perspective, I would suggest, instead, that the general public be educated more on animal treatment. 

By educating the general public, I mean, making efforts to reach out to places even such as workshops. We do not have the time to sit there and think about how to treat animals when we are busy working. We also don't know that we have to research for things other than what the animals eat.

There is a huge divide between the educated, the less educated, and the not educated. The people who feel the divide the most are people such as myself, who are at the bridges, and it is difficult to bridge the gap. The differences, in the things we talk about, and the way we behave, are actually extremely different. 

You will only condemn their actions because you know that it is cruel, and proceed to make remarks such as shooting them with tranquilizers. In doing so,you are refusing to highlight the fact that therein lies an issue that is wrong with society. You're just seeing things in a way convenient to you - it's natural, but can you, please, see things in more ways than yours?

Yes, I'm a student here. ME, yr 3.

there's too much stereotypes going on regarding people who loves anime and manga. 

1. we are weird - in terms of fashion and personality (i think what constitutes as normal is different for everyone) 
2. we are nerdy (i think we are more of geeky than nerdy) 
3. we have no life (i have a great social circle that consists of friends, families, sports and what not)
4. we all love hentai/yaoi/yuri (that's personal preference, like your porn preference) 
5. we are not sporty 

any more stereotypes??

I hate how people think I'm from China because I speak fluent Mandarin. Some even laughed at me for being "Cheena" and said that I probably "speak very lousy English".

And seriously, just because you fail at your mother tongue, it doesn't mean that you have to bash me for being good at it. 不瞭解自己母語的人才是最低級的

Referring to  I think she pointed out some valid points. Although, I don't think she is completely correct, I feel the comments are a bit too harsh.

1. She discriminates individuals who come from broken home
Indeed, she does. However, from what I observe (I have quite a number of relatives and friends from broken home), people who come from a broken home do have a slightly different view on marriage. After all, it is quite hard to believe that their parents's divorce did not affect them at all. I'm not saying that these people are worse than those who come from a 'normal' family, but differences in upbringing and views can potentially damage your relationship, not only with your spouse, but with your in-laws. Remember, after marriage, your in-laws are part of your family too. The question is 'Are you ready to have a broken family as part of your family?' If your answer is 'yes', then by all means marry that person, if 'no', then you should probably think twice. That said, marrying someone from 'normal' family does not guarantee a conflict-free marriage life.

2. Economic security or love?
This is where I feel the remarks that we made are a bit too harsh. We questioned her parents' motivation when they get married. If her mother is really only concerned about economic security, then she would have married one of the rich suitors. But she didn't, and I think it is a proof that her mother married her father out of genuine love.
While love is VERY important, one cannot neglect economic security at all. After all, you need to take care of your parents, your parent-in-law, your children, etc. Even if you love your partner so much, I think it is selfish if you neglect your (and your partner's) family.
Besides, it is also important to consider what kind of life you want to have. If you want a socialite kind of life, then it is a bad idea to marry someone who is unemployed. On the other hand, if you are content with simple living, then the economic status of your husband is not so important.

In the end, what is the most important thing to remember is people get married in pursuit of happiness. I don't think anyone in the right mind want to get married just to suffer. Although the criteria that she mentioned is important, I think love is the only thing that can bring you real happiness. That said, when we encounter too many problems, sometimes our problems prevent us from experiencing the love itself. So, ideally, we have to minimize this problem. That's where her criteria comes in handy. Her criteria shouldn't be a rigid rule whether or not you are going to marry someone, but rather a rule-of-thumb. What kind of person you should marry can only be handled case by case. I myself do not see any problem with my partner being very religious. I'm perfectly fine with my partner putting his God above myself since the happiness that I can give him cannot last forever, while his God promises him eternal happiness.

TL;DR: Follow your heart, but do not forget your brain

DISCLAIMER: I did not advise anyone against marrying someone from broken home (or someone whose siblings are physically/mentally challenged, etc). What I did is simply reminding all of you that we have to think before making a big decision such as marriage. If you think that marrying someone from broken home is not a problem, or your spouse's love is far more important than his family background, then by all means, marry him. But remember, every decision involves some risks, so it is important that we are ready to face the consequences of our decisions.

 What if I told you that there are actual people out there whose parents cannot afford to pay for their tuition fees, and even if they can, there are also people who have decided to be financially independent? 

I haven't taken a single cent from my parents since A levels, except perhaps their provision of shelter and food at home. Yes my parents cannot afford to pay for my tuition fees, and somehow the 18YO me back then committed to helping share some of this financial burden. I worked my ass off to get a scholarship so that I could pay for my exchange, which was well over $15k, which otherwise, I would not have gone for. Do you know how frustrating it is to deny open opportunities just because of your own financial limitations? And you say "just ask your parents pay lah"?

You say you come from an average family but you live in a condo. I don't know if you were trying to be funny but you certainly came off as a huge spoilt snob. I didn't know people could lack such empathy. Please grow some sense in you.

This is the last place where someone should seek real advice but what the hell. I'm an SG Indian girl (though I wasn't born here) and I feel like the issue of race is seriously limiting my dating options. I'm a fairly open minded person and I view any new person I meet exactly the same way. However, since joining NUS I've realised on a couple occasions that others don't necessarily think the same way. Being in a grades-driven college, dating is most certainly not my top priority, but a few unpleasant occurrences from the recent past definitely do bother me. What's the general opinion on this kind of thing?

I am pretty sure that the first, most human thing to do when another country's having an earthquake is to help them,or find ways to do so, and not saying that "they deserved this" simply because they primarily have a different religion.

I am also sure that the first question to ask about a person when he is in need is whether or not he needs help, and not "Does he believe in God?" 

I understand that people such as yourself have your beliefs. I respect that. But if you are going to put religion as a criteria to judge a person, I am sorry, your actions are terribly irksome.
