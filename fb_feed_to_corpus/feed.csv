695707917166339_1020248248045636,"Just wanted to share a story a friend told me. Do read, I promise it is worth your 5mins.
(Like really friend told me, and not a '' I-have-a-friend '' type of told me)
He was watching Chicago Meds, an american tv series so here goes...

Irony:

In the Emergency Room (ER) in Chicago Med hospital, victims flooded in. A shooting was reported at the cinema, in the middle of a screening. Word has it that a man entered the theater holding a gun and started shooting at the crowd. A teacher, armed with a licensed sidearm, eventually gunned him down with 6 bullets to the chest, after the other movie-goers ran from the  Victims poured into the hospital. Abrasion; bruises; as the entire audience was scurrying away from the mass shooter. Among the victims included a mother who hugged her child after they both fell down in the commotion, suffering from the stampede. Their father was separated from them, watching helpless as his wife was stomped, but protecting their child.

The shooting survived his ordeal. Carrying six bullets in his abdomen, he was sent to one of the trauma rooms. The doctors were not thrilled to save his life, and the police even commented: '' I won't sweat myself for this one if I were you. '' Nevertheless, the professional medical doctors did their job and treated the shooter to the best they could. He went into surgery, under the hands of Dr Rhodes.

The teacher arrived at the ER as well, suffering from a mild cut in his forehead from a fall. He was hailed a hero. And as the media caught wind of this, he gained popularity. Twitter trends, facebook post shares, everyone thanked his actions for saving their lives. His twitter followers skyrocketed. He was the hero. Being a normal John Doe in his daily life, he enjoyed his new-found fame, and begun happily reading the online messages. Things got sorted out in the ER. It was then realised that despite the mass shooting, the only victim with gunshot wounds was the shooter himself.

The heroic teacher got brought in for questioning. And police investigation revealed that the mass shooter was in fact a teenage kid named Tom, famous online for his troll and prank videos. At the cinemas, he was carrying a leaf blower and the shooting noises were from the movie itself. Tom has timed his entrance perfectly. Hearing this, the teacher was devastated for taking an innocent life. As news hit the internet, the public and netizens' opinion changed. Tom's followers and fans, learning how a childish action escalated things, started unfollowing him online. The plot thickens.

The mum who acted as a human shield didn't make it. She died after suffering too much blows to her head, but her daughter made it alive. The husband was grieving, until Dr Rhodes came to him and informed him that his wife was the perfect doner for a liver to Tom, whose injuries has crushed his liver. Without the liver transplant, Tom will not make it. Dr Rhodes knew what he was asking the man to do - to save the life of the killer of his wife, with his wife's liver. 

After a few moments of hesitation the man signed it. And the liver transplant proceeded. Meanwhile, the teacher left the hospital, shocked at the online comments and hate directed at him. After the surgery, the husband came to Tom and Tom expressed his thanks. In a shocking turn of events, the husband blasted at Tom, assuring him that the only reason the transplant was done was because death would be too lenient a punishment for Tom. He 'saved' Tom for Tom to live with the guilt, the pain of killing someone over a prank and for online popularity.

Just as the day seemed to end, and the chaos seemed to settle, another patient came in to the ER. A car crash, fatal, collision head-on, leaving the victim covered in blood. He died shortly after arriving in the hospital - he never stood a chance. Eye witness reports placed the victim jumping onto the road, in the middle of a highway. It was suicide. It was the teacher.

At the end of the episode, a day in the story:
The once-hailed hero descended into being a villain and was chided on the internet.
The heroic teacher who was cheered and thanked, entered the hospital alive, only to return for the second time, dead.
Tom, who was in the worst shape upon arrival in the ER, made it alive.
The act of forgiveness turned out to be an action driven by anger, revenge and hatred.
A unpopular teacher gained fame, and a popular online prankster lost his popularity in a day.

Once again, Irony.
This story really left me like.... wow! I can only applaud the author and scriptwriter for coming up with such a nice plot.
A cyclinder can cast both a rectangle and a circle shadow, depending from where the light is beamed from.
Guess I don't really know how to conclude this post. But like all confessions, it's just sharing and ranting.
Guess we shouldn't jump to conclusions huh? i learned a lot from this thought-provoking story. Just wanted to share. Thanks for reading.

695707917166339_1020492998021161,"Pardon the bad grammar, because this was written at 3am with a vengeful spirit:

""Hold on to your horses here, because I'm going to give you the -- rant of 3000 characters about why this module should be thrown into Satan's bottom and left there to rot like this piece of devilish shit it is. First and foremost, to have Quantitative Reasoning as a compulsory module for the general student population in the name of holistic-f*cking-education is a totally absurd idea and a crazy one to implement. Kudos to whoever who had the courage to even suggest a form of punishment like this, and pity to those who had to organise this failed education outreach. I had wasted 4 Modular Credits on trying to grasp concepts my -- friends found was a ""free A for the taking"". The sort of academic imbalance that you may have observed over the time of teaching this module might give you a slight hint as to what the problems some of us are facing in learning the module, but you guys don't take advice really seriously do you? I bet you, as the poor soul trying to go through all the comments for this module must have given up reading this piece of prose right now. You know what? THIS IS THE SAME FEELING I GET WHEN I'M FORCED TO STUDY FOR A MODULE I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE. Bloody f*cking hell. Secondly, let us just take note of some of the finer details in this module which you all may do well take notice. For one, GENDER IS NOT BINARY. The convenient separation of the human race into ""male"" and ""female"" may be useful for this module BUT THAT'S NOT HOW THE WORLD WORKS. Take a module in -- and you'll know why, but oh, you won't want to put yourself through that sort of torture, do you? Also, ETHNIC GROUPS ARE NOT AS CLEARLY DEFINED like the CMIO that you like to conveniently cite as an example. What the f*ck is an ""OTHER"" race anyway? Seriously, if you cannot check these sort of facts clearly for your studies, how do you expect us to take your module seriously and submit ourselves to your statistics and logic? If you want to attempt at an holistic education, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD PLEASE AT LEAST MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IT'S A GENERAL EDUCATION MODULE AND NOT A STATISTICS MODULE THAT EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE. If you're going to attempt at a ""General Education"" module please make it either equally easy for everyone, in which case I believe you may feel that there is no f*cking point anyway, or make it equally difficult for everyone, in which case I don't think you'd want to face the consequences anyway. For my conclusion of this rant that I feel sorry for the reader who has to be forced to read this, if this rant has touched your life, amused you, made you feel angry in any sort of way, please bring this up to the higher academics in the ivory tower, because this sort of badly planned, badly organised, poorly thought out, clearly uninspired, extremely forced and half-baked idea has no place in a first class academic institution we all hope the National University of Singapore is. Thank you for reading this. I really hate this mod""

695707917166339_1020298331373961,"I am always looking at the time when I was close to my family. When going home felt right. When I look forward to going home. When being at home is the normal thing. Now everything has changed. Going home no longer felt right. Instead I experience so much negative emotion when I go home, fear of loneliness, fear of losing what I have established for myself after so many sacrifice, and anger at myself.

There's no problem in my family. The problem is me. I am the one that have changed. I am the one that is becoming another person. They seems to believe that I have changed and I do tell them I am no longer the same person. I pride myself at changing, because that's how I have survived living alone and managing everything myself. However deep within my heart, I desperately hope to hear them saying just one sentence to me: That's I have never change and I am still their same old boy.  I just want them to believe in me and I really did not have any choice in changing because I need to survive. I missed my old life so much but there's no going back. Moving forward is the only way. But does that mean I need to discard them? Why can't I turn back to how I was back then? I don't know.

When I am outside wandering alone, when I saw people eating with their family together at food court, I will think of them. How I wished I can do that with them every day. How can something so normal seems so distant to me nowadays. I really want to tell them a lot of stuff that is happening to me nowadays. The happy stuff and the sad stuff, especially the sad stuff. But when i saw them and when there is a phone call, all these thoughts somehow just turn into one short sentences: I am fine. Don't worry about me. How can I make them worry? How can they help me when they are not by my side when I need them. I don't know why I am pushing them away, even though I am yearning for them so much.

People tell me that I don't know how to appreciate my family. Yes I really don't. Whenever I meet them for a short while  and I have to leave them, I tell myself quietly that I don't really deserve such a good family and I hope they can really live well. I am so selfish, always thinking about myself and never really spend any effort to be with them. They did have their woes in their lives too but all I can think about is my own pain. I guess that's what living alone did to you after a while. What will you do? If you have to abandon your current life to spend more time with your family? Which path will you choose? Friends or family? Work or family? School or family? Freedom or family? I never choose family in any of the option and this is the consequences. 

I hope that in a few years time, everything will be better and I can once again return to them without sacrificing anything. Is it possible? I don't know. I can only hope and pray that my family will still be well until then and that I don't lose anyone of them. For now, all I can do is keep moving forward, and to never look back.

You should ask yourself whether your passion for CS no longer motivates you to get past the hurdle. If it's true that the spark is no longer there and you don't wish to rekindle it, then yes I think you should find another path instead. Give a chance to those who'd like to accept the challenge. There's no right or wrong here, stay true to yourself!

In fact I'm also struggling with my assignments, having trouble understanding the lectures and often need to revisit the webcast over and over again. Sometimes I spent a whole day just to figure out the answer for a single question. It can be depressing yes, but hey what's the point of learning if everything looks dumb and easy?

I suggest that you should sign up for Summer Orbital Programme to have a taste in how CS would be like? The answer you're looking for is not from others but yourself. You have one whole semester break to think about it :)

It is that time of the year again. Where people frantically try to cram a semester's worth of knowledge in preparation for judgement day. Some are daunted by the rapidly approaching dateline, I too am no exception, but for an entirely different reason. 
We have five more days till the study break. Only five more days to walk from lecture to lecture together. 

Only five more meals together. Five more days to spend in your company before you leave for your internship or SEP. 

Thank you for being my companion for the past few semesters. Thank you for spending time with me even though I am probably not the best friend I should have been. Thank you for seeing the good in me that even I myself couldnt find. But most importantly, thank you for being my friend. Without you, my university life probably wouldnt had been as interesting as it was. For all that and more, I thank you. 

To the people that took the time to read this post, do not be too focused on your finals. Treasure the last five days you have with your friends. Of course some may say you can keep in touch, it just isnt the same. Be grateful for the friends you made. Speaking from the perspective of an introvert and likely socially awkward person, I am grateful for all the friends I have made in my university life. I have never been good at making and keeping friends. So if it isnt too much I have one last request. Won't you keep in touch?

I thought maybe she could be someone I could be better for, someone I could give a piece of myself to, someone I could fall for. But after a while, I realised it wouldn't be that way. I do not seem to have the capacity to love her the way she deserves or wants to be loved. I wish I do. I really do.

Of course, I have told her this and she wants to at least remain as friends, which I am very open to. But sometimes I feel that she's still trying and it saddens me to think of how exhausted she might be. I don't really know what to do. I feel guilty and trapped.

* continued from #18876 *

""Why did you drag me out on a perfectly fine Saturday evening? Well, at least this is a hotel lounge,"" Joker said as he fell back in mock melodramatic fashion onto the well-cushioned couch. ""We are meeting the Soulfather,"" Killstealer replied. ""So who is this Soulfather we are..."" Joker asked. ""You will know later. Ah! Here he is!"" Killstealer interjected.

Joker turned around and saw this stocky person walked to his area. Dressed in batik, he won't look out of place in a gathering of south-east Asian businessmen. There seemed to be a mismatch between what one would expect a person called ""The Soulfather"" to look like and what he actually looks like, Joker thought.

The Soulfather sat down on the armchair and rested his arms on the upholstered armrests. He smiled, ""What do you all want to drink? Tea, shall we?"" Killstealer nodded, so did Joker. It seemed, to Joker at least, that the Soulfather has decided long ago and any semblance of choice was merely illusory.

Pleasantries were exchanged before tea was served. Joker watched as the Soulfather poured his tea into the tea cup and added a sugar cube, and a second one, and a third. He stirred clockwise five times before stirring the opposite direction exactly five times. Killstealer drank without any additives. Joker himself opted to add a dash of milk.

The trio sipped their tea in silence. Then, the Soulfather broke the silence, ""So, what is the matter today?"" ""It's about succession,"" Killstealer said. ""Soon, it will be the end of my term and elections will come again."" ""Do you have any candidates in mind?"" the Soulfather asked. ""Yes, my Soulfather. One candidate,"" Killstealer said as he sipped his tea.

""Bring him or her to meet me and the rest of the elders. This, however, does not seem to be your main concern,"" the Soulfather looked at Killstealer. ""It's about Kennedy. Kennedy is going to propose reforms to the electoral system. He wants a minimum voter turnout. They will have to be approved by the Federal Forum, of course."" Killstealer said.

""Is it going to affect the succession?"" the Soulfather asked. ""No, but naturally, the faction chiefs are not very happy as some of them were elected on a very low voter turnouts, especially the Mechanics Faction,"" Killstealer replied.

""Let the Federal Forum deal with him then. He will be taken down by them and you will have one less obstacle,"" the Soulfather said dismissively. ""No, it is not about that. It is that... I am afraid Kennedy will cause problems for our succession plans by insisting on following the rules,"" Killstealer said with a hint of worry.

""Let Kennedy change the rules all he wants. As long as you are head of the election committee, he cannot overrule you. I also suppose that Joker here will be on the committee too?"" the Soulfather asked. ""Yes, he will be,"" Killstealer replied.

""Tweaking an election is simple. You can have fair rules but the person executing it holds tremendous powers. Reject a nomination form due to technicalities and the candidate is a non-starter. Choose a voting venue that is inconvenient and you will restrict voter turnout to favourable voters. Control the publicity and no one will know that a election is going on in the first place. All these will make your favoured candidate win more easily. Kennedy will not be a problem, not when you both will constantly outvote him on the election committee,"" the Soulfather lectured. Killstealer nodded.

""Oh, I am also chairing the alumni group for past SUN members. Of course, it will be restricted to 'friendly' members. Those who were our enemies will never get the chance to be in this exclusive circle. With the alumni group in my hands, you being the current Federal Faction Chief and getting your favoured successor in place, we control the past, present and future. The Solar Empire's dynasty will be secure and no one will know the Sins of the Solar Empire, the decadence of our SUN!"" The Soulfather said before unleashing a sneer.

Killstealer nodded and said, ""Yes, yes. Indeed."" Joker remained impassive, unsure of what to make of these.

As the trio drank their tea, someone at the far end of the lounge walked to a corner and took out her phone. ""Hi, Kennedy? I just saw the Soulfather, Killstealer and Joker having tea together...""

A long time ago, I was all about doing well in school to please my teachers and parents, toeing the line in my CCA, being prim and proper, politically correct etc... In other words, a nerd who seems to have no emotions, even though I used to have soft toys, and talked to and treated them well as if they were real.

Growing up, I had some crushes, eye candies and such, but nothing really came of these trivial distractions in my life. It wasn't until my sophomore year that incidentally I got to know someone and accidentally had a crush on her. Accidentally because I wasn't intentionally seeking out a girlfriend, and wasn't emotionally ready for anything of that sort. As you can guess, I am still evergreen.

Fast forward many years to now, I just want to thank her for making the colours of my world more vivid. The grass is still green, and the sky is still blue. It has always been. It's just that the person who looks at it is different.

In my more lucid moments, I could see that she and I were so different in terms of life goals, directions, motivation and drive, and now we're even further apart. Still, it doesn't stop me from thinking about her.

Selfishly I hope she finds her happiness soon (only if she intends to be attached or married). Selflessly I wish her happiness.
