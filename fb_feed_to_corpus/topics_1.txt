This week is officially my last of school in NUS before I graduate. I will really miss NUS, my friends, the happy times, the laughters, the fun :( I would try to meet up with as many NUS friends as possible over lunch/dinner in the next few days in school. All I want to say is thanks for giving me such wonderful memories in NUS. Because of you people, I have never once regret coming to NUS <3

I want you to hug me tight and kiss me gently and tell me that everything's gonna be okay. 

And I would love to do the same for you too. 
Right now at this moment, do you miss me too?

I am always looking at the time when I was close to my family. When going home felt right. When I look forward to going home. When being at home is the normal thing. Now everything has changed. Going home no longer felt right. Instead I experience so much negative emotion when I go home, fear of loneliness, fear of losing what I have established for myself after so many sacrifice, and anger at myself.

There's no problem in my family. The problem is me. I am the one that have changed. I am the one that is becoming another person. They seems to believe that I have changed and I do tell them I am no longer the same person. I pride myself at changing, because that's how I have survived living alone and managing everything myself. However deep within my heart, I desperately hope to hear them saying just one sentence to me: That's I have never change and I am still their same old boy.  I just want them to believe in me and I really did not have any choice in changing because I need to survive. I missed my old life so much but there's no going back. Moving forward is the only way. But does that mean I need to discard them? Why can't I turn back to how I was back then? I don't know.

When I am outside wandering alone, when I saw people eating with their family together at food court, I will think of them. How I wished I can do that with them every day. How can something so normal seems so distant to me nowadays. I really want to tell them a lot of stuff that is happening to me nowadays. The happy stuff and the sad stuff, especially the sad stuff. But when i saw them and when there is a phone call, all these thoughts somehow just turn into one short sentences: I am fine. Don't worry about me. How can I make them worry? How can they help me when they are not by my side when I need them. I don't know why I am pushing them away, even though I am yearning for them so much.

People tell me that I don't know how to appreciate my family. Yes I really don't. Whenever I meet them for a short while  and I have to leave them, I tell myself quietly that I don't really deserve such a good family and I hope they can really live well. I am so selfish, always thinking about myself and never really spend any effort to be with them. They did have their woes in their lives too but all I can think about is my own pain. I guess that's what living alone did to you after a while. What will you do? If you have to abandon your current life to spend more time with your family? Which path will you choose? Friends or family? Work or family? School or family? Freedom or family? I never choose family in any of the option and this is the consequences. 

I hope that in a few years time, everything will be better and I can once again return to them without sacrificing anything. Is it possible? I don't know. I can only hope and pray that my family will still be well until then and that I don't lose anyone of them. For now, all I can do is keep moving forward, and to never look back.

Sorry it is a long post.

It is that time of the year again. Where people frantically try to cram a semester's worth of knowledge in preparation for judgement day. Some are daunted by the rapidly approaching dateline, I too am no exception, but for an entirely different reason. 
We have five more days till the study break. Only five more days to walk from lecture to lecture together. 

Only five more meals together. Five more days to spend in your company before you leave for your internship or SEP. 

Thank you for being my companion for the past few semesters. Thank you for spending time with me even though I am probably not the best friend I should have been. Thank you for seeing the good in me that even I myself couldnt find. But most importantly, thank you for being my friend. Without you, my university life probably wouldnt had been as interesting as it was. For all that and more, I thank you. 

To the people that took the time to read this post, do not be too focused on your finals. Treasure the last five days you have with your friends. Of course some may say you can keep in touch, it just isnt the same. Be grateful for the friends you made. Speaking from the perspective of an introvert and likely socially awkward person, I am grateful for all the friends I have made in my university life. I have never been good at making and keeping friends. So if it isnt too much I have one last request. Won't you keep in touch?

I thought being on the giving end of unreciprocated love hurts the most. But being on the receiving end really hurts too.

There's this girl I've known for 3 years now. She's amazing: beautiful, kind and funny. I started getting more attracted to her in our final year of school and she did too, as we became closer.

I thought maybe she could be someone I could be better for, someone I could give a piece of myself to, someone I could fall for. But after a while, I realised it wouldn't be that way. I do not seem to have the capacity to love her the way she deserves or wants to be loved. I wish I do. I really do.

Of course, I have told her this and she wants to at least remain as friends, which I am very open to. But sometimes I feel that she's still trying and it saddens me to think of how exhausted she might be. I don't really know what to do. I feel guilty and trapped.

How do you "sell yourself" during an interview? What are some of the good points that employers like to hear? I have self esteem issues and i feel uncomfortable having to tell someone how good i think i am (ie why they should hire me) when i have no confidence in myself in the first place.. I can hardly even think of any good points. I understand that in this competitive society, faking it till you make it (and still sound sincere) is really important, but i cant help but feel that i'm lying...

The main reason why I visit NUSWhispers is to click on "x and y other friends like this", then click on the photo of z to go to her Facebook profile. (x, z∈{Facebook friends}, y∈ℕ) 

A long time ago, I was all about doing well in school to please my teachers and parents, toeing the line in my CCA, being prim and proper, politically correct etc... In other words, a nerd who seems to have no emotions, even though I used to have soft toys, and talked to and treated them well as if they were real.

Growing up, I had some crushes, eye candies and such, but nothing really came of these trivial distractions in my life. It wasn't until my sophomore year that incidentally I got to know someone and accidentally had a crush on her. Accidentally because I wasn't intentionally seeking out a girlfriend, and wasn't emotionally ready for anything of that sort. As you can guess, I am still evergreen.

Fast forward many years to now, I just want to thank her for making the colours of my world more vivid. The grass is still green, and the sky is still blue. It has always been. It's just that the person who looks at it is different.

In my more lucid moments, I could see that she and I were so different in terms of life goals, directions, motivation and drive, and now we're even further apart. Still, it doesn't stop me from thinking about her.

Selfishly I hope she finds her happiness soon (only if she intends to be attached or married). Selflessly I wish her happiness.

Is it reasonable if your gf/bf didn't buy anything for you when he/she goes overseas vacation?

When I stayed in campus, I invited a girl who didn't stay there to come over to my room. We were sort of interested in each other, but not yet boyfriend-girlfriend. She appeared a little awkward at first as I told her we were going somewhere else for dinner. Of course my intention was to bed her, but as we chatted in my room...well, it got too awkward and I decided to cancel my plan. In the end, we didn't become a couple. Thinking back, it was a stupid move to 'eat' her before we went steady. If I had managed to up her, she could have easily accused me of molest or rape, since she was in my room and she could have claimed that she couldn't resist. I've learnt since then to respect girls' limits, and certainly not invite them to my room unless they are interested.

I feel quite heartbroken to be rejected after confessing to a guy. And he told me I'm not his type cuz my facial features aren't his ideal type. The strangest thing is he was the one who suggested we could be a couple in the first place cuz we have much in common and to talk about. It hurts to have your feelings toyed with in this manner.

I believe the nice guy syndrome exist in our society. There was once my bag gave way while waiting for the train and all my files and notes came falling down. Just because I am guy, not a single person came forward to help me pick up my stuff and ask if I am ok. There are still many other similar instances but this is the one that I will remember. If it is a chiobu or may be any random girls, I bet there will be people helping. How can we even be a gracious society?

Last time I refused to watch Naruto because I don't like changes. Eventually, I watch Naruto and like it alot.

Last time, I refused to change phone because changing phone it take time to transfer data but changing to a better phone proved to be worthwhile.

Last time, I refused to find another target when I like a girl and decided that she is "the one" but months after rejection,  I finally decided to find new girl and thought to myself," If only I find a new target earlier."

What is the moral of the story?
Accept changes. If you gone through a breakup, don't try to get back to the way it was. Accept it and give up any hope that it will be back to the way it was. Months after you do this, you will want to give your past self this same advise.

Hi all, I have been reading many of the whispers and I have a quick question. Why do some girls take it that they have the prerogative to expect guys to make the first move on a date? I agree that there are some girls who are able or willing to step out and make the first move, but why do others take it that way? Also, I want to ask how should guys go about it? We dont do, we kena left on shelf, we do also seem creepy to you all. Get friendzone, get ostracised by your girl group, not fair sia. Please share if you have anything to add

I don't know what is wrong with me. I have been an evergreen for the longest time, and after seeing all my friends getting hitched up and some even getting married soon, I am lamenting the fact that I am still a miserable single doing things alone mostly. 

After my friend introduced me to tinder, I have tried it for a couple of months so far.  The girls on it were typically a waste of time. Majority of them are either not replying/ just swiping for fun usually or are already attached and yet giving out numbers to guys like me (just why?). Just lately, I have been chatting up with this girl, and our correspondences were very sporadic, though lengthy, and I have asked her out for a meet up.

I think it is because I have been single for all my life, I completely didn't expect her to say yes. She was even eager to meet up and she gave me her number without me asking. Now I am at a lost. Because I expected that I will be excited when a score a date, but yet right now I don't feel any excitement, and frankly I find the prospect of meeting up and dating a stranger to be scary/ a chore, and I don't know what to do. 

Any advice?

As a bro, I have some advice to my fellow Singaporean guy friends. Stop drowning in self-pity when girls don't desire you, because you're worth more than that. Just assume girls are after you for your success and money, and work for it. Think from a university Singaporean girl's point of view.  A poor university girl would want a better life in the future, having been sick of living that life for 20 over years, while a rich girl would never want to compromise on her existing life style. Love is never enough for a relationship to last towards marriage. Money(security) is. So if you're a poor Singaporean guy without a charming accent, or something that is terribly unique about yourself, just forget about finding any Singaporean girl for the time being, because it simply will not work out. Always remember that girls are biologically wired to look out for mates that could protect her using the resources that a guy has. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and go and earn money. The girls will come after that, I guarantee, no matter how unattractive you are. Just remember the affair of the Bukit Batok MP and judge for yourself. Take care brothers, don't let any girl be your world. Remember, you live in materialistic Singapore. So know how the game is played, and have the materials needed to be desired by these materialistic girls.

With reference to all the recent whispers about "guys are seen negatively if they are single (involuntarily)" - It's true. Before when I was single till my third year in NUS, most girls wouldn't even speak to me (much less befriend me) and would block me for no reason. 

But now that I do have a girlfriend, suddenly it feels like everybody treats me so much nicer - the girls who acted so high and mighty before now actually treat me like a person now, they now are willing to talk to me without recoiling in disgust. Even the guys are friendlier, and this has happened even though I do not feel I have changed in terms of personality and how I deal with people in any significant way.

Well, too bad. I'm not going to befriend people who treated me like shit before for absolutely no reason other than my relationship status. Hypocrisy is what this entire thing is.

Evergreen guy speaking and I have a rather unique situation here. I'm taking a module where there're only a handful of people in class. Now there are 3 girls involved in this story, let's call them A, B and C. I took another module together with A and B last semester while I only knew C this semester. However, I know that A, B and C know each other much longer than any of them has known me.

Last sem, I started liking A while ignoring the hints B seemed to give. However, other than A dropping hints that she didn't like me, nothing much happened until C came into the picture this sem. Being 'old' friends, one day A teamed up with C to tell me a fake fact about A that I cannot accept, hoping that I would let go of A. It worked, and I didn't reconsider her even after discovering the truth, realising the extent A would go to state her disinterest. 
It took me a while before I decided to give more attention to B, having remembered her hints previously. However, C would try to prevent me from talking to B too much and snatch over my 'airtime' with B as long as she was present together with me and B. Furthermore, it also seems that B is no longer interested by her latest hints; the 'escalation window' has lapsed. I then decided to pull out from B before I sink in further. 
A few days ago during a class event, I sort of finally realised why C was doing what she did: she had liked me all along. Being buddies, the 3 of them would have probably discussed what is happening, and seeing that I was finally safe from A and B, C decided to make her move. The hints are unmistakable. I would have probably experienced whatever hints you can find from google, like staring, tidying her hair, 'accidental' touching and so on. 
I never really liked C, and can only remember how she stopped me from getting close to A and B. I'm not that desperate, but I'm also on my final year and am worried that when I step out to work and have no time to socialise with girls. I also understand that feelings can be slowly cultivated. Should I try to accept C in this case? 

I know I'm screwed up, but then so is C.

There have been a recent influx of girls sharing their personal stories of being raped, molested, some of whom didn't even realise something insidious about it until much later. My heart breaks for them, but at the same time I admit I got a little frustrated at times and wondered, "Why do you want to meet him again?" Or "Why do you not feel more hatred or fear of him?" 

These thoughts played in my mind until it hit me. Oh my God, it happened to me too. Except mine was not a case of rape or molestation, but rather, pregnancy. 

He never liked to wear condoms. In the end, I think we've only used condoms 1% of the time. No surprise I got pregnant, right? I was crushed with grief, but I wasn't surprised either. But after the abortion last year, I only realise today that I've only been grieving over the baby loss. The guilt, the pain, the could have beens. 

It was only today after reading all those posts that I belatedly realised, "Wait, why have I not gotten outraged at his behaviour?" I was stunned by my blindness - every other student who got pregnant was as a result of an accident, they took precaution but it failed, or they usually take precaution but a few times they didn't, it happened. 

I was shocked that I've only been feeling pain and guilt over the baby loss when I should've realised and tackled the root cause from the start. 

He never wanted to use condoms, and I always put up a weak resistance. "It's not safe", I protested. But my insistence unknowingly eroded away over time. At the start, he'd count my period cycle because he wanted to not have to pull out (it's a huge downer while climaxing) during my non-fertile days. Again, I protested weakly that it was not safe. But again, my resolve wore off and his gentle (yes, he made it sound so gentle) insistence triumphed. Eventually he stopped pulling out entirely and I didn't even put up a fight anymore. I still liked him so much. Such a blinded fool. 

Tonight I lie on my bed staring blankly at the ceiling, overwhelmed yet numb with emotion. I always thought I was someone who knew better. I can't believe it happened to me and that I have been so, so blind. And I and my poor baby forever paid the price.

Should I initiate a breakup now during the most hectic and stressful time of the semester? It seems like a no brainer if I put it that way, but if I don't, I feel so burdened and guilty having to string my partner along for another month more. A month of pretense and pent up emotion.

But I really don't want to jeopardise our submissions and finals either should one or both parties end up taking it very badly. What should I do?  
-
 
 I think you are in love. You should tell the someone how you feel about them. It will make you feel better.

I never thought I needed a boyfriend (at this point of time) until I listened to a guy friend of mine describes the girl that blew his mind. 

He is playful and careless, but when talking about her, he becomes such a man. I mean even when we have been friends for years, I never knew such a sensitive, loving side of him. The way he tells stories about her makes me want to "AWWWW" with real heart eye emojis but I try not to because that is so immature haha. 

But then I start to wonder if any guy would think about me that way and it's damn sad, 'cause no, I will always be a "bro", or worse, a backup plan. I never felt bothered by that but now my stupid friend ruins it *sigh*

A recent rejection really made me do some self-reflection on why I was never attractive to the opposite sex. I try my best to be objective. So here goes...

Average physical attributes. Slightly below average height, average looks, fit build, bad hair. I'm not blaming my lack of good physical attributes but just recognizing that there is nothing on me that would be considered attractive except I take effort to keep fit.

Boring. I like to do the same things over and over again. I can run the same route for years, eat caifan over and over and be fine. I take comfort in routine. I'm considered a laggard in the adopter cycle so I'm not updated with the latest apps, gossips, hottest places to go etc. General lack of interest to try new things, learn new hobbies.

No effort to dress up. I personally find shopping tiring so I don't really have many clothes. I just wear the same stuff, function over form. Not that I dress badly, but it's just jeans, polo, drifit. Probably due to me being boring.

Nerdy. I'm not talented in sports/music/arts. My only strength lies in the ability to focus on doing something for long periods of time and not be bored, which is probably why I excel at studies. I like taking time to understand complex science/math stuff.

Introvert. I don't want to start a debate here so my definition is that my social energy gets drained as I interact with people and I need to recharge.

Not a good conversationalist in general. Not good at teasing, being animated, being energetic, telling jokes, saying interesting stuff.

Nice guy. I'm good at listening and empathizing with people, doing favors. But easily friendzoned.

Lack of ambition/direction in life. I study hard for good grades, but I've got no idea what to do with them. Unlike people who study for good grades to do achieve their next goal (e.g. get an internship, land a job).

There you have it. Now that I've listed them down, it makes perfect sense to me. To me, this really looks like a recipe for disaster. I wouldn't date myself if I was a girl actually.

The next step would be to improve on some of these aspects and turn some weaknesses into strengths. It's going to be hard, but I'm really going to try. I don't buy the "just be yourself and find someone who likes you as you are" theory.

Thanks for listening.

Hey , thanks for speaking my heart. I feel the same anguish. But I'm guessing that you have some time left, whereas I'm graduating this semester. Talk about losing hope.

For me, I'm just going to work on what I can: being financially stable and being fit. Even if I still remain single, at least I will be materially comfortable right?

I'm not a good writer but I hope to convey how I feel through this confession. #confessionsofaserialkisser
I'm a girl who has met more than her fair share of guys. I'm single and I believe in having fun as long as I'm not hurting or causing harm to someone else. But what about myself? Before I met all these guys, went out on casual dates and got physical and sexual with, I never once stopped to think what psychological harm I am causing to myself. Sure, it's fun. It brings instant gratification, it's consensual and there aren't any strings attached. But aren't there really? I'm a sensitive person but I've always managed to keep any kind of romantic feelings away from all these. But then again, some encounters just leave you wanting more and more. Not physically. It's the emotional craving that kills me. Some of these guys I click so well with, it's really hard cutting off ties with them. Most times it's not even me doing the cutting. What starts off with friendship develops into more and then it's a hit and run before we can blink our eyes. These encounters which start off meaningful end meaninglessly and leave a tiny hole in my heart. Then onto the next guy who fills that hole for a while but then takes it along with him when he leaves. It's painful and unnecessary and I guess that is why I'm lying here alone in the dark feeling utterly lonely and sorry for myself. Maybe the cutting off ties with another guy I'd become emotionally attached to is causing this feeling again. Well the logical thing would be to stop wouldn't it? But when you're stuck in this vicious cycle with no willpower, you know you won't stop anytime soon. What's the purpose of this post? Just to put into words what I'm feeling and rant I guess.

Recently I fell out with a friend over our disagreement regarding my insecurity of my singlehood. For the context, I'm a single male and turning 23 this year. 

I've always been very insecure of my self-worth even outside of a relationship and all through my life my growing up years have not helped matters much. All my life I've been the one chasing. Be it friends for outings, group mates for work, or girls in love. Now for the record I'm not some horrible human being who's a psychopath or something. I'd call myself an intense individual who's passionate about his values and loyal to a fault. But for some reason, other men who are utterly irresponsible (I believe the term "fuckboy" can be used here) seem to get all the luck in dating, love and friendships. Never mind that being fake or an asshat to gain popularity is pathetic to the max, the fact that they seem to succeed at doing so does nothing but make me feel depressed. 

I was the one that posted an earlier confession regarding how I felt bitter about hearing people console me about my relationship status with the "waiting for the right person/right time" quibble. That was precisely the argument I got into with my ex-friend. She thought I was too hung up on my singlehood status, and that I shouldn't be lurching from crushing moodiness to recklessness in mentality whilst dealing with it and growing up. I was the one that retorted saying that 1) good things don't always happen to good people so who has the right to decide when someone gets a happy story or ending? And 2) if a single person (be it male or female) can't date when he/she is young and not yet bogged down by life's commitments (jobs, bills, whatever), then good luck with finding love when you grow older and all these commitments start coming into your life permanently. 

Like it or not, society stigmatises single men as much as it does single women. Males are shamed tremendously for being single and/or not having a girlfriend or a significant other. Single males in media are portrayed as nerds or all-around losers. As soon as a male of a dating/marriage age goes without a significant other for any particular amount of time, the speculation starts. Is he gay? A player? Just a loser? Low self-esteem? Man child? It’s never discussed that he may be single by choice/no choice (because somehow he never catches someone's eyes), it is always speculated that it is some sort of failing on the part of the male. 

If you can’t even get into a relationship and hold it down and make it work when you have minimal commitments and are still young and in your prime, good luck imagining that it would supposedly get better with age because hey, society seems to believe that men’s dating values only go up as they grow older! How many older men get hitched up because true love happened, or is it because the women who hitched up with them are themselves afraid of being left on the shelf, or worse still these women are just gold diggers cosying up to men they perceive to be materially stable for themselves?

Maybe I'm just very cynical about love and relationships now. I'm not religious and therefore I refuse to believe in religion's rhetoric about how some "sky father in the sky" has a higher purpose for us all and that he has planned everything out for our life. I feel myself becoming increasingly bitter and jaded internally and in my heart I really don't know if I'll have what it takes to have faith in myself anymore. I'm confident in my own innate abilities to make it for myself in life, but who ever cares if one can make it on his own in life, when he doesn't have a woman who loves him for... him? 

I'm sick of it. For once, let me be the one who's desired and wanted.

Guys, if you want a girl to be your rebound/FWB, it's much better to ask/tell her directly rather than give her false hope that she can be your next gf. Lying a**holes are worse than honest b**tards.

To the OP, know that you are not alone in this. While I wasn’t raped, but similarly, I was molested by friend, a childhood friend. It’s really a mentally torturing experience to face to the fact that it’s frequently the closest to you that hurts you the most. How could this guy, whom I have always been holding hands with when crossing the road, or standing in front of me to defend me from bullies, be the same guy who molest me against my will? We are not talking about just touching, it was essentially rape without penetration part. We always talk about molest and rape by perverts lurking in the dark of night outside when we are alone and skimpily dressed or drunk. But that is only a small part of rape cases. In fact, the major percentages of these sex crimes are committed by people close to us. It doesn’t matter if you were giving hints or not, wearing sexually suggestive clothes or not. It only matters that there is easy access to our body and the fact that they have a higher chance of getting away with it. 

All these said, I am not trying to say that you should have reported him to the police 3 years ago or anything like that. Because it’s true, even if they did hurt us, how can we bear to get them into trouble and possibly ruin their life? If I did report him to the authorities 9 years back, I do not think he would be the same man, married to a smart and capable wife, graduating with a first class honours and working in an MNC while attempting a business idea on the side. In some sense, I gave him the chance to be a better person and at the minimal, I dun regret not bringing him to the authorities. If I did and he went to jail, then I would have condemn him to a totally different life, a totally worse off life. “He molested me, so he deserve it!” can sound righteous, but at least for me, I couldn’t bear the thought of taking revenge on his life because he molested me. 

It’s so hard to face someone who has rape you in the past isn’t it? I disappeared for a few years the way you did. Those few years were horrible, and not very different from what you described yourself. It’s also during that period of time that I spent so much time reading books on rape and survivor accounts. From there, I learnt that for many of these survivors, facing your rapist is a way to move things forward. There are of course other options and therapies, but the most direct way to face my own inner demons, is to meet that demon, that childhood friend, head on. Because most other option will involve revealing that I was nearly raped and utterly molested to someone else who may alert the authorities. And so I did.

Much like your friend, he was very apologetic. But at least this childhood friend of mine was honest and sincerely regretful and apologetic. I have thought so much of how I would have bash him and scratch his face, but when it came down to it, all I ever did was a light ‘punch’ and a lot of crying and breaking down. How crazy was I be showing my weakness to my molester, crying uncontrollably silently, because the tears would not stop no matter how hard I tried. Because, my molester was also my childhood friend. They say its always those closest to us that hurt us the most, but that also means its those we are closest to whom we hurt most too isn’t it?

He ask me how can he ever make up to me over that incident. He has been guilty all these years and told me it was a terrible mistake he made. Much like in your case, he was only 19 when I was 17. We were both young and we do make mistakes. And that scar, we carried on with it for so many years. We talked, and I told him about the emotional trauma I have been through, while he told me of his guilt, his confusion, and his fears. He apologies, and strangely, forgiving him wasn’t as hard as I have imagined it to be. And with that, after some time, I found a proper closure. 

While rape and molest are all terrible crimes, but the eye for eye kind of justice system may not always have the best result, especially when it’s between friends and family. For those who wants revenge as a form of closure, by all means. But for those of us, like you and me, closure is probably what we are seeking for. Past can’t be changed, revenge isn’t what we are looking for, than closure is the way to go. 

You dun have to be friend with him if you dun want to. It was and still is his fault. But more importantly, its about you finding closure. I have, over the last 2-3 years, gradually let him into my life again, and sees him more as my childhood friend rather than my molester. I have also learnt that during those years when I wasn’t around, the kind of family abuse he has suffered silently about. He molested me, his family burnt and slashed him; we all have scars and wounds from those who are supposed to be the closest to us. End of the day, we all need to move on and not dwell on it and let it take over our life. If revenge was your cup of tea, you would have reported him long ago. But since it isn’t, and you are sure he is a changed man, then help yourself, find closure.

It's the end of the semester and we're getting back our graded assignments... 

Everybody is your friend until they realize you are doing better than they are.

Sigh! Competition has killed the friendships I have made this semester. Should have known better. So much so for the HTHTs. (From a jaded final year student)

To  and  I was bullied into performing sexual acts for a guy when I was still a minor. He was of legal age. 

I see him in NUS sometimes. I hate him to the core and I cannot forgive him. He took my innocence.

Because of him, I wasn't able to speak to guys. I lost most of my guy friends then. We have mutual friends but I refuse to go anywhere near him without my boyfriend accompanying me. I'm scared he'll approach me and touch me. I'm afraid he'll pinch my cheek and tell me I'm cute. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm smart but he's smarter. I'm afraid he'll tell me I should straighten my hair. I'm afraid he'll tell me I should wear makeup to enhance my face and chest. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm too tall. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm too heavy. I'm afraid of his compliments because in the end they make me feel incompetent. 

I never made a police report because I thought my innocence was worthless. That I was ugly and stupid and that I was so lucky to have someone showing even the slightest interest in me. He told me all that. 

Today, I'm afraid of random guys approaching me and telling me I'm cute or asking for my number. I'm afraid they will push me against a wall and forcibly kiss me. I'm afraid I can't run fast enough. I never walk home at night while listening to music because he followed me one night and groped me while I wasn't paying attention. He laughed it off as a joke but I didn't.  

I recently heard that he'd done these things to other girls in university as well. I want to smack his face with a chair. I've outperformed him in every aspect- academically, socially, but I cannot get his smirking face out of my head.

I have trust issues. I have body image problems. My boyfriend tells me I'm unique and perfect and I feel happy but deep down, I don't know.

My advice to OP, stay far far away. You're better than that, unless you want the past to repeat itself.

I lost my childhood friend. She pushed me away. I always thought little of what people teased us, even our parents and other adults. It was until I developed feelings for her that I wanted to be more than friends. Childhood sweethearts. Even the mention of these two words sounded sweet itself. Perhaps it was our common hobbies, or the time we spent together because we were neighbours, or maybe it was always being in the same group during projects or class works, and i recall the days we used to sit together or near each other in class.

But after that night, what can i  do but weep over all the hope that is lost?

She got popular. Her blog gained traffic. People wanted to know her more. Guys and girls both. Role model. Beautiful internet idol. Social media sensation. 1000 LIKES within minutes. So on and so on...

But they didn't know her. They didnt know the her before she was popular. The girl who had her hands dirty from art class. Ate chocolate til it smudges over her lips. Her bad hair days. How informal she looks in her pyjamas. Or how she cried during her first period cos she thought she was goin to die and i even dialled 995.

And she told me that night that not only does she not want a relationship, she doesn't want me in her life. "People laugh at me for knowing you."
I will never forget that. Gone
... just like that. People will tell me to move on. Tell me it is her loss. She doesnt deserve me.
Yes. She doesnt. She deserves someone better. It isn't her loss, it is mine. Because the truth is despite everything, i can still forget and forgive her. If she were to step up to me, call, text to apologise,  with open arms i will accept her, even as a friend. 

And yet years passed and the day never came. Perhaps she never knew how much those words hurt a nobody like me. Seven years...

We can always change the future. The real feat is to change the past. And that is a feat i can never achieve.

Yesterday I was having my dinner at the food court when I saw him there. I froze up and pretended not to see to him but he saw me and came to me saying hi and asked if he could join me. I reluctantly agreed. He was my best friend during poly, and I was once been raped by him.

I met him through a sports event at poly as I was an athlete. He was not a good looking guy. A little nerdy, skinny with thick glasses and slightly shorter than me. But he was very well spoken and charming. He was very talkative and funny, so I enjoyed his presence most among our friends. Back then, I had a boyfriend. However I was interacting more with him than with my boyfriend, because I felt more comfortable and at ease with him. My boyfriend definitely noticed it and he became jealous so he initiated a break up with me. Honestly I wasn't really upset about it at all. I figured I was too young to be in a serious relationship, and felt that great friends can replace the role of a boyfriend.

I am from a single-parent family and I am the only child. My mother frequently drives to Malaysia for her business and she stays at our house over there whenever she goes for her business trip. So I am at home by myself most of the time. One night, he came over to my flat to chill out with me as I told him I get bored and lonely at home especially when my mother is in Malaysia. He even brought along a few drinks and snacks. We watched movies online. I was not a strong drinker, so I only tried a bit of the alcoholic ones. Then past midnight, I felt really tired and my head starting throbbing. So I told him to go home because I needed to rest. Till this day, I hate myself so much for not making sure he left my house before going to sleep.

When I woke up in the middle of the night, I felt like puking because of a stench. I was only partially wearing my clothes and I felt saliva residue on my upper body. The mixed sensation of pain and numbness was difficult to forget. I couldn’t remember how it happened as everything felt like a series of dream sequences. But I knew exactly what happened.

I got shocked and became frightened by reality. I quickly got up, wrapped myself and he was outside sitting on the sofa. He immediately stood up and wanted to say something but I smacked him across the face, screamed and forcefully pushed him out of the door, while he kept apologizing. It was so humiliating and embarrassing he saw and used my body. And took my virginity. I was so angry I thought of killing him or myself on the spot. 

After that, I did not socialize with anyone or attended classes for the next few weeks. I just stayed at home, slept and cried. He kept sending me messages but I did not give a F damn reading and I deleted all of them. Many times, I considered reporting to the police to have him arrested for violating me. But I didn’t. I hated him for what he did, but deep down inside I admit I have a slight crush on him as well. I could not bear ruining his future.

And looking back, it was partly my own fault too. I wore a low cut tank top and very short pants during that night. Since it was my own home and he was no stranger, I didn’t realized it was too provocative and I might have sent him the wrong message. But the fact that he betrayed my trust and took advantage of me is certainly unforgivable. Whenever I am alone and think about this, I cry and scream hysterically. And occasionally I cut myself as the pain on my skin distracted me from the agony inside.

Until now, I have never personally spoken to anyone about this, including my mother. I know she loves me but she will kill me if she knew I invited a boy back home during her absence and the thing she fears most had happened. She has always been warning me about it. I hated myself for betraying her trust in me. Judge me for all you want and call me stupid, but I rather keep this to myself than to face the embarrassment of being seen as a victim of rape.

Subsequently, I developed an unhealthy obsession of using pregnancy test kits. Every time I pass by Watsons, I will buy one and use it. I was afraid I got pregnant. Luckily the tests were all negative. And now, I am still doing it. Although there is no chance I will be pregnant now, it helps calm my nerves whenever I feel uneasy about it.

I became more wary around guys. I am usually a loner in uni but that doesn’t mean I don’t want friends. I want to have friends. But whenever a guy want to get closer to me, I get very uncomfortable and I make it too obvious. And some of my male friends in Nus are really trying hard to get to know me better, but I didn’t let them and always cut them off. I certainly noticed them although I pretend I don’t. I hope they understand that I am not thinking highly of myself or being a cold person. It’s because I cannot forget the grievous harm a male friend had inflicted to me, and my protective instinct kicks in. I am aware there are many nice guys around me in school who are not the type who would casually get into my pants, but I am really really sorry. Don’t ask too much why I am so emo or anti-social, and just leave me be for now.

So yesterday at a food court, I met him after 3 years without contact. He spoke to me and tried to catch up with me. I didn’t say much and I kept looking down while trying to finish my food quickly so I can get out of there. He still retains his sense of humor, and I noticed he has matured a lot, probably because of NS and because he started working. Although he didn’t say anything explicitly about that night years ago, he dropped hints of regret and apology relating to that incident.

Despite what he did, I still somehow liked him. He was not outstanding and definitely not my ideal type of man, yet I found him attractive in some ways I cannot explain. But I just couldn’t accept that he violated me before. I sensed his sincerity to be friends with me again, so I gave him my new number when he suggested to catch up again some time soon.

I wanted to rekindle our friendship, and discuss with him about that incident when I have the courage. He is the only person I felt I should talk to regarding this. When I didn’t interact with him for the past years, all these negative thoughts about him always come to my mind. I even mentally accused him for spiking my drink even though I cannot confirm it. But when I met him yesterday, the way he spoke to me made me feel positive about him again.

I want to let go of my grudge to live a more productive life. And maybe if I give him the chance to explain himself, I may eventually forgive him because we were young during that time and we made mistakes. But even if I forgive him, I will make sure he will be nothing more than an ordinary friend to me. I need more time to decide if I should let him into my life again.
 
Anyway, I wasn’t in the mood to go for classes today as I want to just stay at home to rethink about myself and maybe watch TV. And the subject today is quite boring anyway (sorry prof!). This is my first time posting on NUSWhispers so I hope you can pardon me for this long post. Thank you all for reading despite your busy schedules. It really makes me feel better to let someone know about my plight, even though it is anonymous. 

I pray for success in the exams for each and every one of you. Please take good care (:

I've been on exchange in Sweden for awhile and it's been boring at times. Are there any singaporeans who are doing their exchange there now? Maybe you can comment here or post a confession with your kik or Line id? I'm a guy by the way

So this guy that I'm interested in and who also likes me told me that he has a certain STI. We haven't officially gone out on a date yet but the feelings are there. I'm thinking should I continue with him knowing that he has this problem or stop it altogether? I'm concerned because I really do not want to get an STI at my age. I'm also worried that if our relationship doesn't work out and I contracted the STI, I will have problems with my life later on and nobody is going to want to be with me in the future. At the same time, I really like him and I will feel callous if I just cut it off cuz of what he admitted to me. It took him a lot of courage to even tell me that. Any advice would be appreciated thanks.

I am a guy here and I am in a few online dating apps. To be honest, I dont see the possibility of the event that my significant other and eventually my partner will be from an online dating .In online dating, I always feel that I am falling for someone based on only looks and that is definitely not love. I will still prefer the traditional way of meeting my significant other. It will be more mysterious and I believe the feelings will be more natural that way.

We got together 8 years ago today. The excitement was palpable and I remember it even after all these years. Through thick and thin we stuck together but we eventually drifted apart, though we never talked about why. Your family was my family and I just wish mine could've been yours as well. Today doesn't mean much either of us any longer, but I just want to say something to you in the words of a song we once shared: thank you, for loving me. For being my eyes, when I couldn't see. For parting my lips, when I couldn't breathe, thank you for loving me. 
-
 
It has been almost a year (take off a couple of months maybe) since I last talked to her on good terms. I still miss her and shed tears thinking of how awesome it would be to have her wipe them off right now. I will never find someone more fun and even though I should not be wasting my time thinking of what can't be changed, I feel more happy crying over her than pretending to have forgotten.

If she is reading this, I wish nothing but the best for her. May all her dreams come true! And I do hope there is a space at the corner of her heart where I can reside forever. I don't think we can ever be in a relationship, but it would be awesome to know that you have fond memories about me.
-
 
Do you know why I keep getting upset? Because everytime that happens, to me it's that you don't want to see me as much as I want to see you. I know you're not obligated to but I can't help not feeling hurt. Those girls in the dramas that you feel so bad over when the guy rejects them? That's me. And yet I don't blame you, I can't hate you, because I like you so much. Is there a way to stop feeling like this?
-
 
How many of you tried using online dating apps looking for a relationship but end up meeting casual daters and getting all sick and tired? There are so many options these days at our fingertips (with all the online dating apps), and finding someone or rather "The next one" seems to be easier and hence casual dating is flourishing. Maybe those who are successful in online dating can share their experience here?

Been having sex with this girl for months. She initiated. But she has a boyfriend. For me, i'm perfectly fine. For that guy, I feel sad for him.

 here, thanks for the suggestions! I think I'll bring kaya for them to try. Unfortunately, trip might not be as happy as I thought. I love my European bros (n-no homo), but an American guy might be joining us too. I can't stand this guy, even if I've only talked to him online before. I just hope he'll turn out to be better than I expect. Anyone else have experience with this?

after hoping for months, i finally saw my crush in the canteen. enthusiastically, i greeted him with a hi and a big smile. in return, i got a tiny and forced smile, as though i have offended him in anyway. now i truly understand what people meant when they say 拿热脸贴人冷屁股! :( this feeling sucks i won't ever say hi to him again.

Thanks to those who commented on my post or made an individual post regarding depression. Really appreciate all your advice. I actually went to the polyclinic last november to get a referral to see a psychiatrist. The doctor there was pretty adamant about me visiting IMH rather than NUH, as I would be able to get a quicker appointment date. I on the other hand was very adamant on wanting NUH, since it's close to school!  But I never went for my NUH appointment. It was scheduled right after a family vacation and I thought I had got better. Obviously that wasn't the case. But on the bright side, I've started to eat healthy and B12 pills have helped to improve my mood. ( or maybe it's a placebo effect haha?) Should start excercising soon too!Oh and yes, antidepressants won't be an option. Thanks again you guys! :)

Hi I am the op of . My post seems to have gotten people to doubt that my character is shallow just because I judge guys based on looks. Well the reason behind this post is to show that double standards exist both ways. Just look at . Seems like no1 doubts a guy's character when he says he doesnt see any chio gals but my character is being doubted just because I said there are no handsome guys.
My intention behind the post has been met!

Alright i need some advice here.

I'm the group leader for quite a large scale project (worth 8 MCs since it's 2 modules combined together). As a group leader i'm not the kind who would order my team around, like "you do this", "you do that". But rather i'll take the responsiblility and initiative to get things/discussions going, ask the tutor on behalf of the group if there's anything, make sure group dynamics are good etc. As a result i have quite a good relationship with everyone in the group. We're all comfortable with each other and get along really well.

Now the problem is that in the past week or so, i noticed one of my group members has started focusing less attention on his project do presumably do other modules. he's doing a double degree and i know that's hell. I don't think it's right for me to ask him to switch his attention back to the project as i know it would be unfair to him since he did put in quite a lot of effort earlier on. But we're nearing the end of the project which is also the most critical phase as we need to rigorously test everything. I know if i ask him to do something, he would get it done but i'm very sure it wouldn't be up to standard. 

I was thinking of doing his part on my own, but then again why should i help him do his stuff when i too have other modules to take care of?  I don't want to confront him directly about this as we're pretty good friends, but more importantly, i don't want to potentially cause any upset in the team dynamics, especially during this critical phase of the project. How should i go about doing this? Any advice?

Is it bad that I have given up completely on dating and settling down? I had 2 past relationships, but they were in my early teen years and so don't matter. Ironically, I get along with guys very easily but it always ends up becoming platonic eventually. (clarifying as in not like i am interested in all my guy friends, but if I'm interested in someone and he becomes a friend, somehow the attraction towards him fizzles out or he never reciprocates the attraction.) Is it wrong to be jaded with love because I have been hurt so many times? Like I met a lot of guys who said they could accept me the way I am but ended up choosing someone else over me.  
-
 
This post means a lot to me. I saw you at Arts canteen at around 2.30pm (7 April). It must have been fate. Coincidently, I am also wearing the same shirt when we first met outside the lift at CLB few weeks back. I am sure we did exchange glances as I walked past you. OMG, I wanted to talk to you but at that time I am afraid I will recognise the wrong person and was really shy. I really hope you will see this post. Its near the end of the semester and you are graduating soon, I really hope fate will let us meet again. I really want to talk to you.

After seeing so many relationship posts on whispers, I am starting to lament my own inability to form connections, with girls in particular, and to find myself a girlfriend. As an introverted guy with avoidant personality disorder, I have always had difficulty getting to know people on a deeper level. I don't know what to talk about and I am always hovering around the superficial topics with no idea how or what topics to delve into so that conversations can be enjoyable and personal. Conversations feel like a chore to me now because talking saps more energy out of me than me finding the topics enjoyable, also for most part sometimes my mind is blank so I don't talk, which leads to many awkward silences. As guys, social pressure has it that we must initiate conversations/ talk more, but I don't, not because I haven't tried, but because I gave up trying after I saw no results in my improvement of my social/ love life. My social life is almost non-existent since I kept on evading social events like a plague, fearing that things may go wrong/ awkward and I might get judged. My behaviour is so irrational, but yet I can't seem to escape it due to it having happened to me before in poly. And thanks to my personality, I only have two close friends now, who are both guys, making up my whole social circle, which I think isn't exactly optimal for finding a SO anytime soon.

For those of you who suggesting joining activities and stuff, I have been trying. In fact, my CCA records are pretty stellar in terms of the number of clubs that I joined, but thanks to my avoidant personality disorder I always manage to find excuses not to hang out with the people in the club. Also a large part being that I just couldn't fit in, I just can't get the attention of anyone. And when there's group dynamics involved where there's multiple guys fighting for the attention for a girl or two, I just ...zone out. It is not surprising how no girls initiate conversations with me, since as guys you need to be outgoing and unshy to be attractive. Even when they do in rare occasions, I don't know what to talk about to them.

The reason why I am writing all this, is because recently, I found myself  crushing hard on this girl that I am acquainted with, but since I have no idea how to talk to her/ don't know if she will judge me for my avoidant and introverted tendencies, so I have been deliberating whether or not should I confess. Also I am taking age gap into consideration too, because shes year one, and I am already graduating the next month. I really want to change my life. Also I am an evergreen so I have no experience also. Any tips?

I broke up with a friend of two years over broken promises and lies and still I cry, missing her every single day.

Saw a post regarding depression, and many of you commented. I don't suffer from depression, but I do suffer from social anxiety. I don't have any friends at school, and it gets worst during exam period. Just walking to MPSH makes my heart beat so fast. And beacause I have no one to hang out with, I just feel everyone's judging me. MPSH gets SO PACKED. It freaks me out. Plus the exam hall is huge! I feel extremely insecure there, I feel it's affecting my 'exam performace' too! Has anyone dealt with this before? I've been to UHC before regarding this, but I'm hopeless. Any advice? Would really appreciate if you guys could make a separate post, because I'm too shy to PM you. Thank you very much! 
-
 
hello all, this question may have been asked before but even if so, let's just revisit it again... 
so...how does one know if he/she is in love? I had read some articles discussing this topic but would appreciate it if you guys could share some of your real-life examples. thanks :)
-
 
Wonder if UHC offers services for dealing with phobias?
Been dealing with emetophobia for years and would really like to get over it. And I wonder how common is this phobia because I have always been too embarrassed to admit to anyone that I have the phobia... sigh

I am single and quite desperate but I really feel that tinder is not a very good dating app. I am a guy and naturally I will swipe right based on looks and I have to admit I do that almost all the time. It makes the idea of dating and relationship sounds so unnatural even if there is a match and it also narrows the opportunities of a potential clique for girls that the guys find not attractive. (Guy find that a particular girl is not attractive and swipe left even though there is a chance they may clique very well).Guys go for girl just based on looks. I really think they should just blur the profile picture. I am sure this is going to pissed many guys off but is just my personal opinion.

I know this friend who vehemently refuses to like this other girl's photos on instagram even though she sees it. She goes on to like every other photos however. As I took notice of this condition, I notice that some other girls do that to. What's the deal girls? Im genuinely curious, is it jealousy or do you not like the person? But why then are you still following the person :/ idgi but please answer honestly :X 
-
 
Hi OP of . I am curious too but I guess most people will be defensive and "mature: about it and claim that you are being nosy or immature, when you're really just curious as you've mentioned. I'll be honest with you, I'm a girl and I know that it is could be jealousy. I know many girls that dislike other girls for no good reason. They don't do it upfront and will still pretend to be friends in person. It isn't a good thing yet it seems normal and pretty much unspoken. The dislike is usually targeted especially so towards girls who are quite pretty but are awkward in groups. I guess they are seen as unfriendly or intimidating maybe? Hope that helps! Just rmb that not all girls are like that though :D
-
 
I sincerely hope for the guy who made a fake account of my friend on instagram to stop posting progressively weird stuff. I am not even sure if you will ever read this, but since NUSWhisper is so popular, there is a high chance of you reading this.

Although I know you meant the whole thing as a harmless joke in the beginning but I really think that you crossed the line. Indeed my friend likes to say horny stuff and has quite a high ego but this doesn't mean that you have to blow it up 100x for everyone to laugh at. Can you imagine if someone made a fake account of you and start amplifying your flaws for everyone to laugh at? I am sure you would not appreciate the joke as much. While you are trying to entertain others, please try not to do so at another person’s expense. 

I am sorry if I offended you in any way. 

-
 
Met someone on an app and his sincerity has moved me. He is credible husband material because of his devotion and earning capacity yet I'm going to reject him. He doesn't know this yet. 

I seem to be spending too much effort trying to like him physically, to a point where I feel like it's an arranged marriage and I'm trying my best to love him. I know I can do it if I really, really want to but it's just so unfair to him. It's so heartbreaking because he's been so kind to me. I feel like contacting some of his close friends to make sure they're ready to catch him when I'm gone ;( 
-
 
I'm the OP of . Thanks alot for the comments also the posts from  and . Really appreciate you guys taking time off to reply.

I've made my intentions clear to the girl and as expected, the girl is currently not looking for anything serious. In a nutshell, rejected. We're still friends and can still talk as per normal.

I've decided not to pursue this further. The thing is just that I've not been texting her for a few days now and there are real "withdrawal symptoms". I just feel damn sian and discouraged and pessimistic. I've been finishing up all my work (it's amazing really) and exercising a lot to take my mind off things but these feelings just come back when I'm done doing those things. Sigh...

Just a rant.
-
 
I just need some advice....I've known this girl for about a year and she has become one of my best friends. But she is studying in USA now for the next few years. We talk a lot over the phone and IM. Honestly I'm falling for her. And I know she maybe is too. 

But I am hesitant to confess for a few reasons:
- She is overseas and starting a new relationship of long distance seems like a bad idea. I know of many other girls here who are interested but i have not given a chance.
- I don't want to screw up our friendship if it doesn't work out. And I am always fighting myself to find out if i really like her.
- I really quite green when it comes to relationships and we know each other quite well. So from friends to BF&GF seems quite weird....
-
 
I sometimes find it difficult to meet up with people on a regular basis, but how do I hold off interactions without hurting their feelings? I don't think it's as simple as telling them outright that it's tiring, especially if we're not close enough yet and from what I know the other party doesn't seem like he/she would identify with the idea
-
 
@ the OP of 
You have to decide if it's preferable to (1) bear the weight of never telling her, against (2) the worst case (but likely) scenario that you may not be able to be friends with her anymore due to awkwardness. There's nothing wrong with telling her how you feel, but do think through it carefully. 

For not telling her: 
I know that there's a great temptation to be just confess, but sometimes that's just an urge that will pass. Your desire to let her know how you feel may pass. And your feelings for her may change. You stand nothing to gain from this except clearing it off your chest. Plus she'll be gone soon anyway, so this will be an old part of your life soon and you could have had a friend in a foreign country, but instead you might be left with awkwardness and regret.

For telling her: 
You get it off your chest and even if it's awkward you never have to see her again :D

Well there you have it! I'm not one to judge either way - besides I don't think it's immoral, if she loves her boyfriend she'll just reject you, if she gets together with you it means they were having problems anyway and you're just an excuse. You have to think about how this situation (esp in worst case scenarios) is gonna impact you.

Cheers (:

Is it alright to confess to someone through text? There is this girl i really like, but since we're both more of the quiet and introverted kind, we talk a lot more in the virtual world than in real life. In fact sometimes i think it even gets kind of awkward whenever we see each other as there are periods of somewhat uncomfortable silences haha.  I think i'll find it a lot easier to confess my feelings through text rather than face to face, and also it can avoid any serious awkwardness that might happen should things not work out. Will girls think less of guys who don't do it in real life? (She's somewhat like me though, able to express herself a lot better through text and writing)

Sometimes I wonder how many guys I have unknowingly friendzoned.

Then I remember I'm not really above average in terms of looks and I'm probably the one who gets brozoned instead.

Guys, I have a question. Pretending you are living in a university accommodation, how would you feel if food suddenly appeared outside your door? I want to pay back what I owe to a person (he did a good deed for me once), but I do not want to face him and I wouldn't care if he didn't know who it came from. In fact, I'll much rather he not. So would you eat that food? Or would you be suspicious of it? And would you wreck your mind thinking of who it came from and try to trace back its source? Would you tell your friends of the strange event even if a note left with your food said to forget this ever happened, tell no one and just be happy eating it?

Would really appreciate some advice or opinions. 

I'm currently in a medical course. It has always been something I wanted to do and I worked pretty hard to get into the course. 

The problem is, I have anxiety and mild depression. I'm currently in my second year but I'm already feeling like giving up. I know the course itself is a temporary thing, but the job itself is one that entails a lot of stressful situations that I don't know if I can still do this. Sure, I can study for the classes and would love to help patients, but I don't know how my mental well-being will stand up to it. Not to mention the profession has one of the highest suicide and depression rates. Should I give up now? Or persevere and see how things go? If I'm already feeling so hopeless in the course, how will I fair with the profession, which is lifelong?

I have been crushing on a guy for two months now, and I hate the feeling. I see him almost every day but since we are from two different cliques, I rarely, if ever, talk to him. I keep fretting whether he likes me back because sometimes he glances/stares at me when I'm "not looking" and he goes out of his way to say hi to me, (etc.etc...), but the pessimistic realistic side of me always wonders if I'm just blowing things out of proportion and if he's simply a nice guy. Either way, the exams are coming and my heartache makes it near impossible to concentrate on my studies. I really became a fool in love and I'm tortured by it. What wonderful timing you have, heart. 

And coupled with a lot of extra factors, such as the fact that I'm mostly an introvert and he probably is too, and that I naturally have a tendency to act bad around him (sorry >.<) because I irrationally want to push him away so I never have to see him again, make it very likely that this relationship will never happen. Even though, at the very bottom pits of my heart, I want it to. (Seeing how some people understand MBTI, I'm an INTJ if that helps you understand my character and I suspect he is an ISFJ. Sooo... if I did my research right, it's highly likely neither of us will show obvious signs that we like the other, and therefore without confirmation, neither of us will make the first move.)   

Despite it all, I've thought of confessing to get over it, but I know I can't as it'll be awkward later if/when he rejects me, because I'll still be living in the same building as him for at least two months more, and there will definitely be certain times where my clique will have to sit with his clique... And I do know that some of the girls that surround him will definitely gossip. It's like mean girls you know, except they aren't that mean but simply girls who like to talk about the "latest happenings". And I try to avoid those kinds of things.  

I've never fallen this hard before. There's an internal conflict raging inside me every day that I just wish I could get over it fast, ideally before exam starts...   

At least I've gotten this off my chest now, albeit anonymously. Sorry for the long post... I. just... feel... sad and frustrated with myself.

I have a boyfriend who's in NS now and we always talk about how we're gonna live our future together. I like how serious he is in our relationship, taking the initiative to introduce me to his family and wanting to be part of mine as well. He's also a very positive person, don't have much to complain about, very easy going. 

However, I'm extremely driven to save money for us, wanting to be financially independent and not depend on my family for my university loan. I hope we will be able to support ourselves early and get married young(he supports the idea of early marriage) without having to worry about (the lack of) money. I've taken up part time jobs and internships and worked hard to save up enough to pay off my uni loan. He knows I have enough money and this is where I feel things are beginning to feel wrong. 

He tells me that I'll be very capable in the future and we will be able to have a great life with our degrees which could fetch us decent jobs. However, from the way he spends his money, throwing in thousands into an (expensive) sport he actively pursues as a hobby, living in deficit every month even though he gets an NS allowance of 1.2k a month, I can't help but to feel insecure. He wants to live the 'sit and enjoy my wealth' kind of life, stay at home, pursue his hobbies and not work. He even told me that since I will graduate first, I will be a lot richer than him and would advance faster in my career. 'So we can depend on you to bring bread home and I will stay at home and cook for you, but you do the dishes' as he says. In addition, I am always the one paying for him when we're out as he's always broke. He says we're living like our money are each others, but it seems like it's only him who's taking mine. I cannot recall a time when he paid something for me, or gave me any presents. I'm not saying I need him to be rich, or that I need to be showered with gifts. I just hope for him to at least put in some effort, and for our relationship to go 2 ways. 

He always floods me with his love for the sport that he does, telling me about all the technicality and how good his equipment are. How he made a new personal record, etc. I'm happy for him that he has such love for something he does, but that's all he wants to say when we meet! When I try to tell him my life in school, he always cuts me off and go on with his sport. We only get to meet on weekends and I can't wait to tell him about what happened the past week but all he seems to be bothered with is his sport. Are guys just like that? 

I don't know whether he's serious about what he says, wanting to solely depend on me to support us. I tried to clarify but he says contradictory things. I love him a lot and I'm really serious about us, but if that's the way he's gonna live, i don't think I'll be able to live with it.

OP of  here. That day, one of my messaging apps notified that Girl 2 has joined that particular app. Apparently, over these few years, her number remained on my phone contacts because I loathed expending the effort to clean up my phone contacts. Yes, I am very lazy that way.

Feeling curious, I opened up the app and there it showed her as one of the automatically-added contact. As I have nothing to say to her anyway, I closed the app and resumed my normal activities. A day later, when one of my friend messaged me on the app, I discovered that Girl 2's contact has been shown as hidden (i.e. I got blocked).

Clearly, she must have realised that I was on the app and took the step to block me. The hurt must have been sufficiently deep for her to be rankled enough to block me over all these years.

It made me feel guilty.

So I'm going to be visiting some friends overseas in Europe this coming break. I want to bring them something Singaporean as a gift, since none of them have ever set foot in Asia before. Any suggestions? I was considering medicated oil, since that's one thing they've never heard of.

To OP of 18783, I graduated from NUS about five years ago. My boyfriend and now husband graduated from ITE (#truestory #nottrolling). We met while we were in secondary school, and back then, he was from NA and I was from express stream. I got to admit I was a mugger while he just slept his way through most of his classes. Similarly, he does not understand the need for mugging nor did i understood why he was just wasting away his chance to learn. Our differences was quite huge.

However, we continued dating and fast forward to today, we have children of our own. To be honest, the difference in our educational qualifications was not a major concern for me while we were dating (okay, maybe I was pretty naive back then). Today, we still have our fights and quarrels but it was never about the differences in our educational qualifications. Yes, sometimes I wish he was more academically gifted so that he can share the load of teaching our children when they grow up but at the end of the day, to me, these are just minor (but still important) parts of a relationship. 

What is crucial is how he makes you feel when both of you are together, how he make an effort to make you laugh with his silly jokes, how you both can laugh and talk about anything under the sun, how he cares and show his love to you in his own ways, how both of you fight against difficulties and brave it through together etc. These are the most important memories you will think of when you reflect upon your relationship with him, and not so much of his educational qualifications, his language etc. Education, money, status are just an external part of him. Take away all these, that is the man you really want to be in a relationship with. 

Of course everyone wants someone who is smart, rich, talented etc but no one is perfect. It is always a give and take in a relationship. But if you find it hard to maintain the relationship after considering education, money, language, status, then perhaps these factors are really important to you and you may need to rethink about this relationship.  

Thanks for reading! I wish you all the best in your relationship and studies of course! :)

Today i was queuing for my food when i overheard 2 girls discussing the fact that when a small group of girls or worse, a girl is alone overseas or whereever, they or she would be better off going off with a large group consisting of a few guys or if the girl is alone, it's better to have a guy as a deterrent against any potential danger.

Just wanna rant something, i think the sad truth is that a girl safety is never guaranteed eapecially if it's late or she's alone. A girl will have a much higher probabilty of being ambushed and raped compared to a guy. If only a girl is just as physically strong as guys, then there is no need for guys to serve as a form of deterence....

To be honest, I don't know how to phrase this without sounding callous, but hey, that's what anonymity is for right? Let's give this a shot.

For the vast majority of my time in NUS, I've been attending nearly all my lectures and tutorials with a certain few friends, the first few people I got to know in NUS who happened to be in the same course as me. We weren't "share our deepest darkest secrets with each other" close, but through sheer force of constant exposure to each other, we got along alright. 

That is, until we left for SEP. Because we had mostly become separated into different countries and universities, and because I took a weird combination of modules in the overseas school, I have been going for lessons without my usual group of friends and even without any Singaporeans at all, so I've kept pretty much entirely to myself. And I cannot express how LIBERATING it feels. How I can freely choose to listen to the lecture if it's interesting, or zone out on the internet if it's not, without having to engage in incessant small talk about inane topics I couldn't care less about. To be perfectly honest, I do not miss any of them in the slightest.

Looking back, I guess it was pretty obvious that this would happen. I have absolutely no common interests or talking points with them whatsoever. Our conversations in school usually revolve around discussing that previous lecture or that upcoming test or that looming deadline. Scrolling through my past whatsapp convos with them, I was slightly amused to find that all my past interactions with them, EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE OF THEM, had been either school or admin-related. It is painfully clear to me now that these are nothing more than friendships of convenience, friendships that I ended up with because making any more would be tiresome, friendships that are destined to fall apart once we all leave school and they no longer have any practical reason to speak to me. In fact, it's only been a few months of SEP and I can already see it happening now: I've become utterly disinterested in the whatsapp group convo, and only reply when specifically singled out. My apathy seems to grow more insurmountable every day.

Now the question is how I'm going to deal with this once SEP ends. Maybe I should continue to trade polite niceties with them for another year before we part ways permanently. Maybe I should start to distance myself from them. Maybe I should make one final attempt to find some connection, any connection, with these people whom I call friends. Or maybe this is just my latent sociopathy finally taking form.
-
 
Sometimes I wonder if he is genuinely busy? Not interested anymore? Or just doesn't know how to hold conversations with girls? As he comes from a male-dominated background. Knew him for a few months but yet not much progress, maybe I should move on too.

I have not been on any valentine's dates in my entire 23 years of life. As I will be on exchange next academic year during semester two, its going to be another year of no valentine's date again even if I am lucky enough to manage to get into a relationship between now and my exchange. That makes my earliest valentine's date possible to be in my final year. Haiz, screw my life. decisions can be tough sometimes.

The trouble with all the advice single people hear nowadays about how "their time for love will come/they have to wait for the right one" is that they never seem to come from singles, but from people who are already in relationships and often see fit to take a moral high ground in making such useless consolations in a bid to make themselves feel more blessed in being successfully attached. 

Call me jaded or not, but it's true. I know maybe somewhere out there some girl who's destined to meet me in future is now praying for me to stay single till she finally arrives. But when I finally meet her in my life I'm going to slap her and ask "what took you so long?" before kissing her hard and never letting go of her ever again. 
-
 
I have a girlfriend yet I still feel lonely sometimes. She seem so excited with her friends and is so chatty with them, but when she is with me, it seems like she has nothing much to say. When I ask her for some favor, she tends to give excuses like it is too inconvenient for her. I am tired of a trying so hard in this relationship. She says she love me but why do I not feel it? I have my needs too, can she think of me sometimes? Feels depressed just thinking about this.

There is this girl that I have a crush on. She is close to my perfect girl in almost every way. She is achingly beautiful, intelligent, fun, adventurous and even that air of feminine assurance. 

I am quite stuck because she already has a boyfriend and I won't be able to see her for awhile after this semester since she is going for exchange. So I won't see her for maybe half a year after this semester.

I do want to just let her know abt how I feel, even though it is highly unlikely that she will reciprocate. For me, it is also that I wouldnt really be able to forgive myself if I did not tell her what I think. 

I am not some indecisive guy who cant make up my mind abt what to do but it is really that I have this sense that even if I go ahead and let her know, it won't change anything and just confuse her. I know that when I walk down this path I may break up the happy couple but it is something I am already prepared to accept and face condemnation over. So really my heart is already made up. Perhaps my mind isn't. 

But still before I do so, I would really like to hear the community's comments/thoughts. 
-
 
 I was in a similar situation except that the guy is taking things way too slowly. So I basically ended things as there's no point in wasting my time further... 

Guys, if you are interested in the girl, please don't take your own sweet time... It is either you act fast or just let her go.
-
 
I'm not sure if she reads this but I can't get it off my chest so here goes everything. This goes out to anyone who's tried their best for someone else and it wasn't enough.

There are too many apologies and too little sacrifices in this world. 

I was in a relationship fo just over a year. There were giddy heights and massive freefalls but I really believed we loved each other and stuck together through it all. 

So when she said she didn't know whether she loved me anymore after an argument, it was a bolt from the blue. Maybe I was blind to the fact, maybe I was oblivious, I'll never know.

Our happy relationship stumbled and crumbled in weeks. Months of sweet nothings and inner peace gone in an instant.

When she finally said she couldn't go on any longer and that she needed space to settle herself before she got into another relationship, I was helpless to stop her. She said her feelings were numbed, but I guess mine were flayed and laid raw. Tears were shed, promises broken and words left unsaid.

So here I am, alone and on the road again. 

It's tiring to be happy when you're not, difficult to move on when you're lost, impossible to reflect when you're broken.

But we go on.

Need an advice. My boyfriend keeps stalking his ex-crush on Instagram.  Although he said that he is entirely over her, but the actions doesn't justify his words? They are friends and they still text from time to time. Whenever I use his phone, the latest / top few people search on Instagram will always be her. What is he trying to prove? Should I confront him about it or is it norm for guys to stalk pretty girls. I mean he doesn't stalk pretty girls, he just stalk one. At least to me, if I'm constantly stalking a guy that proves something right? He told me about how he really really liked the girl in the past and how much it affected him when it ended yada yada. If he is not over his previous crush, I am not going to stand in between and be his rebound. What should I do? 
-
 
Just wanna hear opinion from guys here:

How true is it that guys like to "disturb" (one of the ways guys use to find chance to start a conversation with a girl) shy quiet girls? Or it's true only to a certain extent, like if the girl is quite good looking (cute/pretty)? Means even if the girl is shy and quiet, but plain looking/quite fat there is a much lower probability that guys will "disturb" her right?

Dear J, 

It has been more than 3 months since the last time we hung out together. It was a Christmas party at your workplace. I was a coward for deciding to leave you because I was hurt and I felt unappreciated. I thought it was the best thing to do for both of us and moving on from there would be easier than starting all over again. But, J, 3 months on and there was not a single day that I stopped thinking about you. All the beautiful thought of what could have been between us, all the promises I made but never fulfilled, all the plans we made just keep coming back to me. It was the first time that you decided to let me go so I know there is no coming back from there. I did try to reconnect to you but I guess my messages never got delivered. I know you would just skip the rest of the message once you realise this message is to you but I just want you to know that I am glad that your life is better off without me. I do see you around school and you put on a bright smile when your friends are around. Just keep that smile on forget all about what happened between us. The world is not against you, J. It is just me. I am sorry for everything I did. I am sorry for the pain I have caused. And I am sorry for stepping in your life. I know you are annoyed by the little things I am still doing for you. But I will disappear in less than a month so just let me at least try to fulfill my promises as much as possible? 

I miss you, J. No matter how much you hate me, you are always something special in my heart.

 Does shy quiet and pretty/cute girls exist in the first place? Have anyone encountered such girls before? Or shy and quiet is mutually exclusive with being good looking lol?

 I hope that this song can make you stronger.

The time has come to stand our ground,
We have hope inside us.
Depression think they won, but hope is all around,
We won't let depression inside us.

And we won't see another day,
And you won't see another day,
If we don't take them on today...

We are strong, we are tough, we're invincible.
We are here, we are now, we're invincible.
We are strong, we are tough, we're invincible.
We are here, and as one, we're invincible!

Depression send their best, we will not run,
Depression set their aims to destroy us.
We can not rest until they're done,
I'm sure they love to annoy us.

And I don't see another day,
And you don't see another day,
If we don't take down on today...

We are strong, we are tough, we're invincible.
We are here, we are now, we're invincible.
We are strong, we are tough, we're invincible.
We are here, and as one, we're invincible!

And we won't see another day,
And you won't see another day,
If we don't take them on today...

Let's go!
We are strong, and we are tough, and we're invincible.
Let's go!
We are here, and we are now, and we're invincible.
Let's go!
We are strong, and we are tough, and we're invincible.
Let's go!
We are here, and as one, we're invincible!

Idea for the song come from

I was wondering if any of you suffered from depression and how you overcame it. I'm pretty sure I'm depressed, but I'm really not sure where to go to seek help? Which hospital etc. I've been like this for a while now but have finally accepted the fact that I'm depressed. I haven't made any friends in school either and kept thinking that was the main reason for my sadness. But it's much more than that. I have no motivation to study or do anything. I have difficulty getting out of bed. I have no interest in socialising with my current friends either. In short, just no purpose in life. 

I told my mum about my illness. She feels like I can't be depressed because she knows I have a supportive family etc. As you can tell, I don't have much support from home.(ironically) Depression still seems like a pretty taboo topic. But maybe I get where she's coming from as I don't think any mother wants to accept their child has a mental illness. But I really need help. She just thinks that it's insomnia. I feel so sick of being this way. I would really appreciate if any one could share their experiences on how they overcame it. Thank you. 
-
 
 What I would want to tell you is, there is nothing wrong with you. I do experience such similar situations like yours but with some dissimilarities. In the past, relations wise, when I felt that i'm getting close to a girl, or when i felt that the girl is trying to get close, I felt the urge to pull away completely, and establish distance between us. It was as if the natural defense just got activated and telling me to gtfo. I have no idea why is it like that and this 'activation' only applies to certain girls. It could also be due to my introverted nature? Idk. And of course, i don't have any r/s before.
-
 
To  Wow you sounded so similar to me I thought I was sleep-whispering. I'm not sure about you, but I realised I behaved that way because I feared being abandoned in the end, so I would rather be the one to end things first. I took some time to psyche myself into thinking that it's better to try than not try at all. At least if it didn't work out, I would still gain some good memories from it. For the bad memories, I would use them to make myself cry (then get over it) as a de-stressing method when needed.

Anyway, I finally met a guy with the right "frequency" who didn't make me feel like "ew why is he texting me so much". So I'm guessing you just need to meet the right one too! (cliche, yes, I know)

Hope this somewhat helps!

 I probably had depression once. It was after a breakup. It was the longest month in my life. I literally ran out of things to do and the days were so long. No motivation to do anything. Not even the thing I used to love, video game. You know, usual things: loss of apetite as well. At those times I realize that friends are of no help. They don't really cheer you up. You don't wanna get out of the house. I live alone, far away from my parents.

Anti-depressants, though personally I have not had them; studies showed that don't work too well. They are basically like amphetamines or cocaine. It jacks up your dopamine and helps you get through the day. It gets you to function, but part of the problem of depression is you have no close bonds, no close intimacy that get you happy. It's not really different from any other addiction. Like porn, sex, heroin, or cocaine.

Anyway, there's the issue of how to deal with work. Not really study. Study requires motivation; something you are in short supply in depression. Work, I can soldier my way through the more monotonous tasks. Not reading or writing though. I got through that with massive amounts of cheap instant coffee. They are really disgusting (now that I drink fancy specialty coffee; and manage to differentiate the coffee brewed at 2 degree Celcius difference), but they provide the dopamine required to not crash.

Other than that I went to lots of meetups and parties. Download the Meetup apps. Talking and socializing with strangers put your depression into the background noise. I learned so much socializing from those. Not realy making friends though. But a few hours after work drinking and talking with strangers take my minds of the depression. Made me tired enough to actually sleep and get 8 hours of bedtime.

I learn improve and acting. I read Homer and a few books. Online dating. All of those. Just to pass the time.

Well, what really kicked me off depression train is my current relationship; which I got into after that one long long month. Somehow my conduct on my first date was attractive enough to land myself a new relationship. I've never been happier in my life. She's just perfect.
-
 
I secretly feel flattered when my crush steals glances at my boobs when he thinks that I'm not looking. Lol

But word of advice to guys not advisable to do it unless the girl is into you. Otherwise the girl will think that you are a perv/creep. Double standards but this is just how it is :X
-
 
To . I am really sorry for what happened to you. 

I suffered an ordeal similar to yours. But I can't say I know how you feel because I understand how insulating it was to me back then when others say " I know how you feel."
All i replied was: Do you really? 

My girlfriend back then was an insurance agent. That was how we met. On the street, a name card. Like any fairy tale story, except there wasnt a happy ending. 
Country obligations made me serve my two years. And i hope i would not contribute to sparking arguments about how NS makes boys lose their gf. I am not so immature to blame the necessary evil for my breakup. Time passed. 3? 4 years? She works, I study. And she meets with clients. It was until the last few months of our breakup that I realised she keeps meeting with this Mr Hadman client of hers. But I tried my best to be understanding, so i didnt pursue the matter. I placed the trust I had for my gal in front of the jealousy I felt. Hadman was rich. I will give him that. And he wasn't any spoilt rich brat. I met him once and hell, even I respect him. He has this vibrant aura of confidence that he has his life planned out like how an NSF plans his MC days. 
I can still remember it was when i literally reached the halfway mark of my savings (while studying) to be able to commit to a BTO flat (even though I never proposed it yet) that she drove the BMW that Hadman GAVE her as a gift to find me for a date.
Hadman treated that as a gift cos she salvaged his business loss blah blah blah. I accepted it and I believe Hadman had no ill intentions.
I am not a small minded man. My parents taught me well. I dont mind my wife earning a larger salery than me. Hell i could even be househusband for her sake. Tongues wag and I didnt even bat an eyelid. 
Then the dreadful day came.
She never cheated on me, to be fair. And when the words came out of her mouth, i realised that I couldnt stop her or change anything. Hopelessness hit me first. Not rage, sadness or anger.
She told me a lot of things that night, but i didnt know how to reply, how to react. All I could think of was: Would anything I say matter? Would it change her mind.

She said she couldnt bear the fact that people looked down on me. And she was the reason. She said she felt the r/s gave her guilt. And that she wanted a better life. Indifferent from what your ex said. Security. 

The thing is... I never blamed her. I called my ns frens out for a drink that night and amongst the bitching by them about how a gaijin took my girl and how ns caused it and all, I found myself thinking of only one thing that night. She once told me that she led a tough life since young. Working and studying at the same time. Single mother. Tough family.
This is the part where haters like my ns frens come in and throw assualts. About how her sob story is BS. And this is where i tell them they are wrong. They have no rights.
I was the victim. And even i feel no hate or rage for her. Just regret that thing didnt work out, and just sadness at my helplessness. Til today i never blamed her or called her a bij. She led a sad life. And as the only child she probably felt the responsibility to give her mother a happy life. I understand that. Did I mention she was 4 yrs older than me? She couldnt wait. One of the many things she told me that night. 

And after the drinks, i remained sober, i called and tell her what i meant from the bottom of my heart and what i meant to say.
"I hope you will be happy. 我希望你幸福。"

You are a religious man. I respect that. I am a Taoist. I don't pray. But I have values and beliefs taught to me which I treasure.  And one thing I always believed was that You can learn something from everyone. And that everyone is brought into our lives for a reason. Perhaps you were brought up with the belief that life is planned by Him. Then so, let it be. I was taught to learn from everything and everyone, and with time, i moved on, although it wasn't easy. And now, i am learning how to live, and how to love again.

 Hi OP,Im not sure if this will help but I hope it does. Forgive me if the post sounds weird Im sick atm.

I'm currently serving my ns right now while my gf is going to uni, yeah it's been rather tuff on a relationship especially when the guy is on some far away island shooting and sleeping in mud, not being able to text or call. We try to meet up as often as we can during weekends when I bookout of camp. 

For us, certain rules and boundaries were already in place to hold our relationship through this phrase. One of them is no contact with the oppersite gender unless necessary. Yeah some pepple will say thats extreme but to her and I, the only other guy/girl we will ever need is each other and our family, so I dont have any friends that are girls, she does not have any friends that are guys, they are all aquiantences whom we only talk to for work, if not none at all.

Things like yours OP where the girl falls for another guy etc etc was the reason behind this, to us, after witnessing countless breakups caused even those tgt since Sec 2 because of a 'friend' in uni is one that we learned from.

All in all, Im just saying that yes you need to distance from him, if necessary cut contact. Yeah, it may not be fair to your friend, but it all comes down to priorities, what do you consider more important? Your relationship or your friendship with the guy?

For us, relationship trumps everything. Then again, not every couple is like us, so you can take this post as a grain of salt, I hope you grow stronger with him through this phrase,its a trial by fire to all couples

It's really tough to concentrate in lectures in a male-dominated faculty. I would totally want most of my male friends to be FWBs with me (doesn't mean they'll agree because none of them has ever tried to make a move on me) but my morals are stopping me from translating my thoughts into actions. So I am here to rant it out :[

 There is a problem, is that you rush things too much. As such, you burn out too quickly. The solution being, you have to learn how to take things slowly. 

Meeting a new person, you will have this rush of wanting to find out more about this person, who is he, etc., right? 

1) Well, you have to feel more confident in your own skin first - because partially, you're reacting this way in response to something alien to you.  

As a guy, I learnt more about myself, about what kind of behaviour will stress me out, etc., so that I will learn how to deal with various situations less anxiously. You have to be more confident, and less insecure.

What I do, about that rush that comes along, is that I try to calm myself down, and distance myself a bit (not too much) - because from hindsight, I can analyse the situation better, and adjust my pace. 

2) I focus more on learning about the new person's situation first, rather than immediately knowing how the person is like, what he does, etc. In time, this is the way I know a person better. 

Understand that if I meet you, and if you talk to me, I will take a bit of information about you, and that tidbit is what I allow myself to take and develop further; I think about it, and delve deeper into the topic, rather than asking you about all other stuff that you do.

This is how I prevent myself from rushing head-on into friendships and relationships - because it's not about the intensity of the fireworks, but more about keeping the fireworks alive. 

You should re-evaluate your efforts - because, as how we engineers describe problems, it's not just about the amount of effort put in, but is your approach wrong?

It has been 6 months since I give up on my relationship. I thought she was easily jealous of other girls, but now when I think back, I did not give her the time and attention that I should give. She was just a back up to me since I started uni. There are many temptations in hall and school. I thought she nags and scold me alot, but I was wrong. A good girlfriend nags when she find that the guy has gone off course from his goals. Now I realised that she nags because she care and love me. It is too late to realise all these things. She has her current boyfriend now and I hope she is much happier now. I just missed her. To other guys out there, dont neglect your girlfriend just because you have your 'excuses'. Do not think that your gf is such a nag, she nag because she want you to be a better man. Behind every successful man, there is a woman. That woman will nag to guide you once you go off course. Treasure her. Dont be like me.

I turned down a really persistent biz guy, his reaction is to belittle guys from engineering and computing right away (I am from engineering). Granted, I was harsh on him when rejecting him, but his attitude towards rejection is exactly the reason why. Gone was the charisma, the helpfulness, and confidence he had, typical of biz students, as though it was just a show. And the worst thing, he's trying to use me now to get close to one of my friends.

i know you are deeply in love with your boyfriend, but we are not, so don't need to bring him up in almost every other sentence. it is really boring to be bombarded with tiny bits of info of him that may mean the world to you but really mean nothing to us. it's damn amazing how you can continue doing that even though he is in UK now.

It seems like quite a lot of my (girl) friends are putting on a lot of weight from their time in uni. Sometimes I stalk their profiles back to when they were skinny and do a comparison. Feeling quite bad for them since losing weight's a bitch and the extra weight can alter your facial features. Not so cool when you're trying to get attached. 

I myself also gained weight in uni and am doing my darnest to lose the extra weight. Slim is still a good look.

Hi I'm posting this confession to find out if anyone has the same problem as I do and how do you overcome it? So basically I think I have commitment issues. It's like every time I meet a new person and I'll be super interested in him, but after a while I'll be like "ew why is this guy texting me so much?" And I'll naturally ignore his texts until he gives up completely. This has happened more than once and I have no idea what to do... I honestly am trying very hard to settle down but every time someone likes me back, I will try to end things. Is there something wrong with me?

You're jealous by your friend dating, you're wavering and feeling guilty towards your boyfriend...come on now, be honest with yourself. 

You don't have to cut all contact with your friend, but some distance now will do you and your relationship good. If you wanna do what's right you'd set yourself clear boundaries with your friend. 

When in a relationship and you start feeling tempted by another person (be it emotionally or physically), it is all on you to take a deep breath and carve distance before it progresses further. Otherwise you're being cowardly and yes, cheating, wanting the best of both worlds, doing your partner very wrong indeed. 

I also think you might have to work on your independence. You seem to be very dependent on regular close company, relying on them to combat loneliness so much so you get emotionally attached. I don't think that is healthy or fair to most of all your bf, but also to your friend and even yourself. 

As to your last question on what you should do when your bf goes to Australia to study...ldr? It's pretty obvious. You have mentioned you two talk about the future together a lot, so why have you lost confidence before even getting there? He might still think all is well. 

Truly, some distance from your friend now to clear your head and straighten out your thoughts will be very helpful. All the best.

To the OP in 

Thank you, I really needed that. I care a lot for my bf and would never leave him. I feel much better knowing what to do and having a clear way forward instead of just feeling like a horrible person but not doing anything about it. 

I don't know you in real life, but you've really made my day. (:
-
 
It's been a few months since you rejected me and I've minimized contact with you. But up till now, I still think of you. Even when I know I don't stand a chance, I still dream of it everyday. It's really affecting me and sometimes I don't have the mood to do anything but think of you. I miss you...
-
 
I'm debating whether or not I should go up to this girl whom i think is really pretty in one of my lectures and talk to her. I'm kind of afraid that she'll think i'm a creep or something, especially since i'm not exactly the best looking guy around. So may i ask how common is it for a guy to go up to a girl to start a conversation with her? It's with the intention to get to know her and perhaps be friends, and see if anything deeper can develop from there.

I think I understand how you feel! My boyfriend is in NS too, and with all his outfields and extras I hardly get to spend any time with him in person or even through text. And sometimes I do feel distant from him too! So naturally I talk more to my other freer guy friends. It’s easy to have feelings or even fall for someone who has more time for you every day, and who wont be leaving you in the future for Australia. I think its natural for you to look to your best friend as a potential partner instead (and I have done the same too) But I think its important for you to evaluate what your boyfriend means to you! If he is really someone you can marry, then hang in there! Stick by him! It sounds like he’s the one for you. A selfless love is the best kind of love anyway! 

Im pretty sure that telling you that there’s Skype and there’s LDR couples who made it wouldn't really help! Maybe you can take comfort in the fact that Australia is pretty near to Singapore and you will most likely graduate earlier than him so maybe you can join him there! And time will surely pass and he will be back from Australia in the end! Who knows, after putting your relationship through such challenges, you’ll be a stronger, more grounded couple! Talk to him about it, he’s the best person to make you feel better about this. If he is really the one and you know it, then love him with no conditions!

As for your best friend, dont make him an innocent victim! Dont ruin a perfectly good friendship just because you cant help but feel jealous. Figure out how you feel! Its not a crime to fall for him, but if you can get over him, please do! I think the ball is in your court for this one! Only you can stop yourself for having such feelings for him. Dont worry, you will make it out of this alive!! Keep pushing on and always find the bright side amidst all this bullshit life throws at you. All the best!

Hi. My name is P.

I think the people whom I will be confessing about are on NUSWhispers anyway, but fuck it.

I became girlfriend to a girl called Y. Originally she was D's. D thought that Y was just a horny girl who could not control her sexual urges and needed a guy to satisfy her. That is only partially true.

The reality was that Y and me were already together, and she was indeed super horny. Hence, I told Y that she could hook D up and be FWBs if she so desired (I'm better, anyway).

Some context:

I was trying to deal with a bunch of D's friends who were conveniently Y's enemies. How this came to light was because D was attending a few sex parties too many until Y came into his life. What D did not know, of course, was that Y and I were already conspiring quite a bit beforehand. Actually D was a fine friend except that I knew he'd genuinely steal Y from me if I was too careless.

Y, being the girl she was, wanted to seek vengeance on a party gone wrong where she was impregnated by a guy whom I will not name, but is fairly infamous on NUSWhispers already. (Hint: He's Very Horny) Hence, Y struck a deal with D to attend D's parties in the hope of striking out at some of her adversaries (actually she meant almost everyone except D, who she legitly thought was a nice FWB and myself).

What forced me to write this confession was because, after we managed to screw up some of the fuckers responsible (they're either infertile, have broken up with whoever their gfs are or have their sex video spilled on the Internet), Y started asking me if she was too despicable. Actually, she was, and so I told her straight. I did not quite like her for her less than noble intentions of deliberately kicking guys in the nuts and passing off as accidents. Y was trained in the martial arts, and so I was hesitant in whacking her. We talked, albeit coldly, about this.

Recently, I was told she had a clean break with D. I was a bit shocked, but happy for myself as D was finally no longer involved with Y. What I did not know was how D was tortured. Y demands I report to her flat in the East daily for sex. I did. Y demands that I "invite" D and his eye candy for sex. I also did. She could do all these without a condom thanks to her arrogance of her "IUD protecting everything".

I actually like D's eye candy but cannot tahan Y for her daily sex. I appealed to her but it was merely lowered to 5 times weekly.

In some sense, I feel fucked because I took over D's curse, but have little way out. I don't feel like a bf to her. I feel like a FWB. On the other hand, D is so happy with this girl who I'll only remember as "young, bright, with a flash of green in her eye".

It has been a month since i drop that hint, I'm sorry i took too long to respond to your hint. but it seems like you have already moved on...

To all the guys and girls out there mourning over being cheated on. If someone else could steal him or her then he or she was never yours. 

There are many fish in the sea. As much as it hurts to part with someone you gain sentimental attachment from, always know that john cena.

Most guys I've been with has asked for "facials" and sex...through the backdoor at some point, if not persistently. Thanks a lot porn. 

I'm normally very chill about porn, and I think it's ok for guys to watch it - all in moderation, but I also have a secret resentment for a lot of it because it has normalised things like facials and anal. Not just normalised, but even a mandatory part of sex. So I have to feel guilty and look like a prude when I won't let them come on my face. And they want it SO BAD. Not only do I find it gross, I also find the whole point basically humiliation. Being submissive is one thing, but feeling completely demeaned is a turn off to me. I know a lot of women either like it or just put up with it. 

Also in porn - girls slurping everything up. Again, guys who insist on this due to their fantasies, I suggest you to 1. Taste how horrible that stuff is and 2. Really think why you want her to go lapping it up. It makes you feel powerful, doesn't it? Know that such dominant-submissive fetishes are not for everyone and definitely should not be held as an expected norm. 

And for backdoor sex, the mere thought of it repulses and terrifies me, so why should I have to do it? And yet they pester me, saying I'll either come to love it with time, or how will I know if I don't try. Do you not get it? I shouldn't have to if I have absolutely no interest whatsoever to. And it shows you prioritise your pleasure over her pain. 

Just an FYI to all guys out there who watch too much porn and have unknowingly developed unrealistic expectations and ENTITLEMENTS during sex in real life. It is not the same.

To the person who wrote . I totally feel you. 

Exactly same situation as you.  In terms of break up over incompatibility, both of us weren't at fault, both of us handled the relationship maturely, I can't convince her that we have a future etc. 

It has been almost a year since we ended our 1y10m relationship. After the break up,  when looking at things objectively, i was certain that she isn't the right one for me, i don't want her back anymore etc.

But it just felt so blissful in the dreams: she regretting her decision and coming back to me, we had a future, we enjoyed each other's company so much etc. Such dreams wrenched my heart for the next few days. I can really feel it. The heart crushing sensation. 

The dreams have been so repetitive that my friends were asking me to use tinder. Just socialise and not for the sake of getting attached/getting a fling. So i tried tinder. True enough, talking to new friends helped me better understand the female's perspective. It was really quite pleasant exchanging life stories. 

But talking to them made me realised one thing, my ex was still better compared to all of them. Except for the fact that she doesn't love me as much as i loved her.

I have no idea why am i posting this but I genuinely hope that you and i (and everyone else facing this situation) can learn to love again.

This month has been terrible, I have done one thing I fear the most. I fell for a heartbreaker. 

I mean I am not that experienced in the love scene, I went on dates with two guys and I am an evergreen. So, my expectations for the first boyfriend are high, or at least I thought I learned from people's experience enough never to fall for cheesy tactics and such. To be honest, as a listener to my girl friends' heartbreaks for more than 10 years, I can say nothing is as bad as being played by a heartbreaker, a player or becoming a plan B. 

And look where I am. Ha ha. I've been saddened these days because of his on-and-off attitude. Whenever he shows signs of withdrawal, he oozes me with some grand gestures and I am confused whether he actually likes me. Whenever his lack of response annoys me, I cannot but refer to times when he used to be so attentive. If he doesn't feel anything for me, why would he bother to do so much? 

Believe me some guys go farrr lengths just to egg girls on, like they would find you, would ask you out, would squeeze time for you, making sure you believe that they care and then "bye bye". I am not generalizing all guys! But girls, do beware, the trap is not as visible as ones you see in the movies. And now that you are no longer a listener, you will understand why your girl friends made such a fool of themselves sometimes. 

IMPORTANT: when dating, do not initiate anything, that is to be safe. And when you are sure you were played, do nothing but pretend that guy never existed, they feasted on your anger, desperation and reactions. No one laughs at you... I mean I used to, but karma would make sure everyone has a taste of this shit so...

I often have trouble expressing my emotions and how I feel about someone. My MBTI type confirms this. I'm an evergreen guy but I can foresee that this would be a problem if and when I start dating, as I know the initial phase would be really awkward since the girl would not yet understand the true me. 

Many of my close friends have said before that i'm a rather cold, serious, quiet, sort of robotic-like person, but i tend to be that way only to new people or people that don't know me well.  I'm definitely not the socially awkward kind of person, nor do i have any trouble holding a conversation with someone i barely know. When I'm talking to someone i know really well i feel that i can really open up and be a totally different person from the one i described above. 

I often believe that actions speak far louder than words, so instead of showing my interest and how i feel about someone through words, i tend to do it in my actions such as helping that person do something, buying a gift for him/her etc. So my question now is, does anyone have any tips to survive the initial phases of dating? I obviously wouldn't know the girl well yet and therefore i feel i can't really buy her anything or do something for her to express my interest, as i think it would be kinda awkward. All those gifts, love poems etc. would probably only come much later into the relationship. From the girl's point of view she also wouldn't know me well yet and i wonder if my personality at the initial stage would be a turn off to her.

"why are you not attached?" 

I don't know how to get attached when I simply don't love myself enough. There is nothing that I am good at. Trust me, when I say nothing, it really is nothing. I've tried time and time to think of something that I am better than the rest but no, there's nothing. 

Maybe I simply have low self esteem but really, how do you love someone or expect someone to love you when you don't even love yourself. 
-
 
To  hello there, your post has been greeted by rather angry-sounding, indignant responses from other people but I'm here to play the devil's advocate (to them) and express some opinions that you may agree with. 

As with many things in life, a timeline for anything to happen is arbitrary and people do things when they are ready. What's right or wrong is very subjective, so it's up to your threshold/ inclinations. You're not wrong in preferring certain things and if your boyfriend doesn't see eye to eye with it, you need to decide for yourself whether you can live with someone who separates certain parts of his life very distinctly from yours. It may well be an extension of other secrets that you're unaware of because he is able to hide them from you. (case in point: my ex cheated on me with one of the girls in his group of friends and I know her personally) 

I would say that being with someone includes the entire universe that the other person comes with, not just *merely* the other person alone. It is justified to want to meet his friends and be shown off so that you know that he is proud to be with you. In my opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to meet his friends and seeing the kind of people he hangs out with. In my case, my boyfriend's friends are absolutely welcoming even though they have long solidified their bonds before he met me. They're mature, sensible human beings who understand that the world doesn't revolve around them and so their group is permeable to SOs and even friends of SOs who occasionally join.  

Personally, I think it's important that you are able to involve yourself with his social circle up to an extent (to your discretion) because of very practical reasons as well. If you want to plan surprise events/ know your boyfriend better, you'll have a group that is familiar with him to provide you the necessary information/ support. I think you should be free to be yourself when you're with your partner and not put up a front by overly-tolerating things you're so uncomfortable with and poisoning yourself with all these thoughts. 

Also, in response to a commenter's point about power placements, it should not be a numbers game when you meet his friends. It's not about you against them, or any semblance of a fight for attention or priority. It's just a get-together, don't overthink that shit man. I expect and know that my boyfriend will protect/ explain to me if anything goes wrong since it's not about the length of time you know someone but how intense your connection is. I date with the view to marry, so if he chooses his friends over me he can jolly well marry them, adios I'll show myself the way out.

Hope you know that you're not alone in wanting a partner who shares everything with you!

I'm in the same situation. And you know what hurts the most? I believed in the cheesy tactics a guy deployed to get me, thinking it came from real kindness, and care. I mean I was confident that I would never fall for things like that, but look where I am.

When he stopped the chase, I do feel sad. Unexplanably so. I know I don't like him yet, but I feel disappointed that I actually held on to the thought that someone really cared for me. And that this was going somewhere. I even thought about asking him what he really felt about me, but I don't want to become a joke anymore. If he's playing games, at least I will pretend that I was playing along all the time. 

Cheer up... Everyone has this moment. But at least after this time you know where you are and how gullible you can be. When you see signs he was not that much into you, walk away before you became a joke.
-
 
Some guys just do not know how to chase a girl. If you like her, you ought to be texting her and asking if she is doing okay frequently right? Learn how to use sweet tactics but some NUS guys are just too slow or noob. These guys have to learn from korean dramas!
-
 


I often get that question too..from friends, parents (just note that my parents aren't really the typical ones who are eager to see me get attached.), ex-colleagues, etc.

I'm still studying now, and I'm an evergreen for a good 23 years of my life. I've always pondered about the same thing as you. I usually have low self-esteem, not feeling good about myself, feeling so judged by people, and etc. At times when I feel confident, the confidence goes so high that I dislike myself for being 'arrogant', 'cocky'. 

Even though I've spent times trying to teach myself to love me for who I am, but I also have great doubts, because, no one seemed to love me. So, is that...an evidence that I'm just not...someone that people would be willing to spend some time with? I am aware and grateful for the love that my parents give, and my close friends. But at times, I just really want to ..be cared for. :(

Well well, this is making me feel so emotional, because this feeling gets stronger and stronger. When I watch movies/dramas about love, I cry, not because someone died, but because I couldn't stop hurting myself mentally by questioning myself why am I not worthy of being loved?

People say we should take care of ourselves, yes. Be proactive in things, yes. I understand. But understanding and executing are different. I just wanna say, I hear you. :) I find Justin Bieber's new album actually quite healing. Especially his song on "life is worth living". I'm not a huge fan of any star, but his songs are pretty nice. I hope you feel better.

Ever felt deeply hurt because you lost your girlfriend to a rich guy? I did. I will probably post this since neither is she an NUS student, nor does she read these confessions. So my gf and I have been together for about 2 years when we met at church. We started off as friends then we got along well and I confessed to her, then we became an item. She is probably the prettiest in the group but I love her because we have something in common; we are both committed to the gospel and we love reading books. 

So there's this new guy from SMU who joined our church group via a common friend. I am not in the position to judge him, but I feel he is simply in church for fun, and not serious about learning more about the gospel and grow as a person. It is okay. In fact, to be very honest, most of us are in church for various reasons such as to find the meaning of life, or to seek God's blessing etc. I love it that he is a happy-go-lucky person and very easy to get along with. As my gf is quite conservative, she would usually just say "hi" to him but kept her distance from him. 

During an occasion, we held a prayer meeting at this guy's house, since he said his house has ample space to accommodate our large group of church mates. His house is a luxurious modern mansion at Bukit Timah Hill and he's got four cars at home. The one he usually drives is a modest Honda SUV and the other three cars are less modest; a Mercedes, a Lamborghini and an Alfa Romeo. The first thing that came to my mind when I stepped into his compound was that this guy is freaking rich. The interior was breathtaking as well, it felt like a 5 star hotel. So we did our prayers and sang the hymns, and then the group disassembled to socialize with each other. Then it was when I started feeling uneasy.

My gf became more friendly to the rich boy and kept hanging around him at the balcony and talking to him. Naturally I joined in the conversation, and then I noticed the guy is the one trying to include me in their conversation while my gf relentlessly tried to exclude me from the conversation. And she wouldn't stop patting his arm. I felt really really uncomfortable. I put my arm around her shoulders, to subconsciously remind someone we are an item. But it was just very awkward and so uncomfortable. And this was only the beginning.

Subsequently, I felt my gf is no longer enthusiastic in our relationship. I have to keep initiating conversations and dates with her. She is nonchalant to everything I said when we talked, and she seems to just want to go through the motion and be done with it. Whenever I asked her if she is okay, she would say yes but her behavior contradicts her statement. I was very tired and upset. Back then I believe maybe it's because`she had other troubles at school. However, I realized that at church or when dealing with other people, she seemed perfectly alright. So I asked her straight if the problem is with me.

She told me she just needed some personal space for time being as there are a lot of things going through her mind. So I gave it to her. We stopped going on dates or talk about anything beyond what ordinary friends will. This went on for about a few months. Then one night, she called me. I was so happy she did. However, my heart broke when she told me she has fallen in love with someone else and that the person has reciprocated her feelings. 

Yes, it's the rich guy. I got angry and asked her why is that so. She politely told me it's because she felt he was a more driven person and explaining he has plans to go to the U.S. for further studies, whereas she said I am always easily contented with life, and she felt I am not the type of guy she truly likes. And she kept emphasizing he gives her a lot of security due to his good family background. I teared up a bit and told her if it's okay if we can still be friends. She agreed and apologized once more before hanging up.

I always told her I plan to work full time at church after graduation, but I didn't expect her to interpret it as a lack of ambition, considering she is devoted to church as well. Most associate ambition with material rewards. But I strongly disagree. Even a person who wants to help make the society a better place is also an equally ambitious and self-driven person. 

I know my gf wants a better life. She comes from a poor family and sometimes I feel that she is in church because she wants to believe in something spiritual to give her some hope for a more prosperous life. My background is similar to hers. My parents are poor and works as a coffee shop assistant and a taxi driver. However they are very hardworking and it is not because of a lack of ambition they are not better off. Their ambition is to earn enough money to support me and my siblings through school so we can have a more comfortable life in the future. And if you classify all poor people as lazy or lack ambition, then I am afraid you are out of touch with reality.

Nonetheless, I still attend the church. But I control my emotions whenever I see the both of them arriving in a sports car while I alight at the bus stop. Haha. I reminded myself they are humans like myself I shouldn't blame any of them for my misery, because I believe if I forgive others, I am also freeing myself from these negative emotions. And on a positive note, I am thankful my gf (ex-gf now) was honest about her feelings and material desires, and does not cheat while keeping me in the shadows. Although I still pray that things could have been better for me. 

I used to think that I will only get along with someone of similar religious beliefs, following the advice of my pastor. However he and I were both wrong. For two people to love each other isn't about how similar they both are. You can be of any race, any religion, any socioeconomic status... who cares. It's all about having the courageously love to accept your differences and forgive the shortcomings of the other. Not many have such courage it's because they fear others around will judge them for not meeting up to the expectations. Therefore, they would rather please the larger crowd of people in their social life, then the person who they should truly love. 

Perhaps in good faith, I will find the right person one day.

If a guy always leave your messages hanging, does this mean that he doesn't have interest in you? I die a little inside everytime I see the blue ticks but no response.

When you're crying in your room for the hundredth time contemplating a breakup, and your partner sends, "Hey, I just wanted to tell you I miss you and hope you have a good night's sleep." 

My heart is breaking. I still like him and will always care for him but we are too incompatible to work out in the long run. I can't bear to do this and I don't even know where to start but I know I will have to do it eventually. 

This is so painful and I have never done this before.

 What if I tell you: your boyfriend has no friends. It's embarrassing to admit. So don't ask.

Tcher remember those days you thought i was a bad kid but couldn't tell what was wrong? You said i was stubborn and too logical (when i point out what was actually wrong). Today I would tell you it was because I was good that's why you couldn't tell what was wrong. I was just waiting for someone to show me what was the right thing to do. :/

I'm graduating soon, and I think I've overachieved in a certain dimension but not the other. I haven't had a relationship ever. Though the need is gnawing, it is often superseded by the chase for grades, internships and a MAP, and probably promotions for the years to come.

There was a previous confessor who shared her aversion to evergreen graduates, calling them "not good enough". I'll concede that. I can hold many a conversation with girls but am clueless in the art of dating. I have some clue of what makes a good friend but am clueless as to where to begin looking.

I'm uncertain if my let-it-be attitude is tenable in the long run, so I'm taking (only) one more step - learning about advertising the open position. I would like to humbly ask about the avenues that people use to interact but not in a manner conducive only for flings.

Any help is appreciated!

I'm not depressed, but I'm around so many people who seem to be?

Many people around me (boyfriend included) seem to be depressed- not just upset, but legitimately unable to get out of bed/can't study/non-stop crying sad (to varying degrees).  I'm not talking the self-diagnosing sort; some of them are very obviously clinically depressed and one is even diagnosed but refusing medication.

I'm not surprised given our relatively stressful position as university students, or even some NSF buddies. But it's just immensely tiring to be around negative people so often. This means things like spending hours just sitting next to a sobbing friend, or forcing myself to actively reply FB messages that don't accomplish anything. 

I know that this isn't any of their faults, and that they can't help it. 
I know it's presumptuous to assume that I'm doing some immense service that deserves praise, and honestly I don't even think I'm helping by just repeating the same things over and over.

Hell, I've gone so far as to physically force two of them into a counsellor's office because I want so badly for them to be somewhere close to okay again. But I can't keep up with all of this sadness, and it's gotten to a point where I've considered breaking up with my partner and cutting off all contact with these friends just so I can spend a week without having to watch another loved on hurt so much.

Some of these people have suicidal ideations, and on days that I've run out of things to say and energy to listen, I find myself wondering if I should even bother trying to dissuade them?

it's frustrating to want to help when it seems like nothing is getting better, so I'm wondering-- should I be bothering at all?

My bf of 3 years is in NS. Things are great between us - we talk about marriage and the future and we meet up weekly. Unfortunately, our schedules have started to clash and we haven't meet up as much these last two months. It worries me because he's going to Australia to study once he ORDs but nowadays when we can't meet for a week I already feel like we're more distant. When we do meet up though, all is forgotten and things go back to being great. 

My best friend in school is this other guy. He texts me everyday and we study and eat lunches and pretty much spend most of our time together. We're in the same groups for multiple projects. I know he only sees me as a friend as he tells me about all his crushes and dates and asks for advice. It's been very clear that we are just friends. But I recently i find myself more and more enjoying talking to him, bec we just have so much things we do together. I feel very lonely whenever I'm not with him and sometimes tell him about my school stuff before my bf (because my bf wouldn't really get it anyway).  Last week,  I accidentally saw my friend on on a lunch date (which he told me about) with his crush and I suddenly felt really jealous.

My bf knows about my friend and is slightly jealous but doesn't object to me being around him. But I feel like I'm emotionally cheating. Do i cut contact with my guy friend? He'll be so surprised and hurt and I'll be even more lonely. And how will my bf and I make it when he goes to Australia? What do I do? :(

You played my feelings, led me on, chose another girl over me and decided to break off all contact with me. And then one fine day, you decide to sashay back into my life asking me if we could start afresh and claim that you still want me. You already have a girlfriend, so what more do you want from me?

We've been on a few dates. And though i could feel you distancing sometime back, you were ready to let me know we weren't over. The thing is, i'm just really filled with fear. It scares me how comfortable i feel with just revealing my honest opinions with you, with my argumentative stance and strong opinions on certain topics.  You're the second person i ever really revealed this side of me to. It scares me how you reveal bits of your childhood to me, and let me see a vulnerable side to you i never knew existed.
 It scares me that you're the first person i just want to fall into and not run away at the thought of having to spend the rest of my life with. It scares me that you're the first really attractive person I dont naturally become tongue-tied around.
At the same time, it scares me that you have a past i don't know about, I was never a club go-er like you are. And what about our beliefs? Are you still meeting other girls from where we met? 
What happens then if those dates develop into something further? 
I'm just really confused right now. I'm not ready to give you up now, but i don't know if you're really what i would be willing to throw myself into. The thought of just putting a stop now or going further both overwhelms me with a mess of so many emotions , what should i do?

I saw her on stage. That was the first time I saw her. And I would tell you what I told everyone, I swear that at the moment I laid my eyes on her, I fell for her.
She wasn't pretty. Quite plump, but not obese. Short and I remember how clumsy she looked while dancing on her fat thighs. She wasnt perfect. But as textbook as it sounds, I love her for her imperfection. I would never forget how confident she looked when she was dancing on that stage. And I told myself as I stood in the audience, that I HAVE to know her.
I am what you youngsters would call evergreen. Never asked a girl out, never dated, and I even screwed up my first date with her. No experience in dating. No confident. And just the average John Doe asking himself what is he doing with his life. I am the exact type of person who spends 5 awkward minutes answering the question "Name something special about yourself."

And years passed. Ordinary me never had to miss the confident crush which I saw on that stage. Every time i doubt where my life is heading towards,  the regret of choices I make, the life I could have had, there is always one thing I will never regret.

Because no matter how long has it been, no matter how many times I said it, every time, every day, every night when we had dinner together, every quarrel every reconcile, I would thank the stars at the bottom of my heart and the tears in my eyes.

I thank that I had the courage back then, to do the bravest thing I have ever done in every truth-or-dare combined, to do the dumbest thing I never thought I would do and to do the one thing I never thought I could ever do.

"May I have the honor to date you?"

Be dumb enough to try everything. 
I read about so many young boys and girls get worried about love, contemplate, hesitate. But events are only embarassing if you yourself are embarrassed by it.
I recall myself at what seem to be the bravest moment telling myself that " i am a nobody anyway. So why not risk it? Shame? No face? No one would remember me anyway."

And this story. No matter how many times. I would say it with pride, with tears, with thanks.
10 years on, at every anniversay party, at every gathering and on the day of our wedding itself. Today is the 10th. And i lie on my bed, thinking about the memories we shared in the school. My wife would be too shy for me to reveal who she is. But I just want to reassure every reader, I was a nobody filled with uncertainty too. But in life, there is no correct path. Just different ones. Dont be too busy being worried about what might happen, until you find yourself regretting what you didnt do. #YOLO

I will not say that I am very successful at the dating game. After all, in the past 5 year, I've only in 2 relationships. However, the break time between those 2 relationships are only about 1 month. I have not spent any of the past 5 Valentine days alone; and probably will not; since I'm marrying at the end of this year, unless one of us die a sudden death or we break up. Anyway, I can probably attribute my success to my psychopathy. I'm not a psychology major, but according to the self-report psychopathy test, I am a high primary psychopath but low secondary. According to the test, primary psychopathy concerns affection side of psychopathy with the lack of empathy for others; while the secondary deals with the anti-social side of psychopathy: withdrawals, rejection, failure to learn, and inadequate motivation.

I can attest to the lack of empathy. When I read the recent news that a little girl got her head chop off by a crazy fucker, my first thought was not "how horrible", but "Holy shit, off-the-shelf meat cleavers can do that?" followed by "that crazy dipshit was lucky to be alive to be arrested". I generally do not give two shits about people I do not know. Live and let live. As long as they are not in my way, we are cool. I do not care if you die away from me. But if you die in front of me, it signals to me that something dangerous is going on and I should GTFO. But if you are in my way, or harm someone I care about, I will go to the end of the Earth to destroy you. My views on the refugee crisis is: "the fact that they can run away will make the war a lot longer". War's objective is to stack up corpses. War usually ends when enough corpses are piled up and people are too exhausted to fight. All the ceasefire, peacetalks, and people running away just delay that inevitable end; leading to Eternal Wars. Get on with the dying and perhaps we can end these war (before you flame me, take 15 minutes to read this excellent essay https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1999-07-01/give-war-chance . Give War a Chance!). The best way to stop the crisis is to send commandos to attach mines to refugee ships BEFORE people get on them. That's also perfectly legal. Countries are only obliged to care for refugees when they are on its soil. As long as they die somewhere else, it's not out business,

As for the secondary psychopathy, luckily, I'm quite good at not having. I'm sociable enough, appear friendly enough, and somewhat motivated for my work and study. I also found that while I do have enough energy to care and love others, that list is unfortunately very very short. I have no problem with staying faithful since my capacity for loving someone is limited. I learn from my past mistakes in my first relationship and apply it to my current life. Some of the mistakes are quite generic: taking them for granted, wanting to win in an argument, losing physical affection and attraction, failing to surprise, being a bit needy. I can't be happier in the current rs, but I still hate my ex for causing me one month of pain and suffering. I don't exactly hold on to the grudge, but I will leave my ex alone. Unless I can get away with it, and the opportunity presents itself.

So there, some guides on the dating game. Here's a few thing you could do to improve your social skills (very important). Download Meetup apps and find things you might want to do. Sports, drinks, party, interest groups. I suggest learning Social and Ballroom dance. It's a good opportunity to interact with the opposite sex, there's always more girls than guys, most girls there are single (if they are not, they will be there with their bf. And those twos only dance with each other). Improv is an excellent thing to learn because it teaches you to be extremely fast on your feet, and how to be expressive. Acting is not bad, if you can find the class.

If you are in a relationship, here's a big tip: physical intimacy changes everything. It's like sitting on a truck, closing your eyes, and hitting the pedal to the metal. It increases the closeness and intimacy very very quickly. It also blinds you BTW. But be consistent. Always escalate; not descalate, if you want it to be steady. Don't suddenly one day say: "I don't want us to do it anymore"; unless you want to derail the r/s. Without physical intimacy, you two are just a pair of close friends. It does not always mean sex. But a few orgasms here and there by whatever means work wonder. Yeah, guys, learn your arts and crafts of making a girl orgasm. It helps immensely. And no, not with porn.

Why the guy who texts me alot never asks me out? But the guy who only texts once a day will ask me out? Guys are confusing.

Oh crap I think I fell for my best friend so I'm trying to distance myself from him and this feels horrible.

I am the OP of . I wanted to write a note thanking everyone for all your encouragement.

After I submitted that post, I took a job as a cashier at a supermarket near my home. It wasn’t a job I had in mind, but I just needed a reason to wake up everyday and do something.

I took on the night shift together with a Makcik. The first night, she looked at me and asked why a university graduate was working in a supermarket. 

I said I wasn’t having much luck with a full time job and that I was just recovering from my struggle with depression. She looked at me and she said, “Oh, it’s okay lah. Good to hear you’re doing better.”

Over time, I got to know her better. She kept assuring me that one day, I was going to find my lucky break and to not give up.

Well, I got my lucky break.

After three rounds of interviews, I finally got a job offer at an MNC. I thought I screwed the final interview. But when I got the call yesterday telling me of the job offer, I was just so happy.

The first person I told wasn’t my parents but that makcik. She was happy for me and said she’d miss having someone to talk to on the night shift. I didn't tell my parents first. Though they supported me financially during treatment, I felt that they didn’t understand what being mentally ill meant. I didn't feel like I could talk to them without having accusations thrown at me. Often, they thought I was just being lazy or faking the depression. 

I’m so happy to start work next month. I feel like I’m finally getting my life together. Strange as this might sound, I will miss the cashiering job, the night shifts and the encouraging makcik.

I have a question for guys. What does it mean when you suddenly stop chatting with a girl you have been talking to everyday for hours? And what does it mean when you, still, drop a random mess, only to never reply to her? Aren't you supposed to pretend she never exists if you're bored of her so that you can get rid of her?

Really noob evergreen guy here. Well I haven't been a really talkative person my entire life, even when I am with close friends I am super quiet and in my head. To top it off, I am kind of shy and inconspicuous and in computing as well. So it is no surprise that I have absolutely zero luck with the fairer sex.

Well, I want to change my life after seeing some of my friends already getting married/ planning for kids/ honeymoon while I am still stuck in a rut. Right now I am willing to be more assertive in asking girls out, but I have several concerns that might be irrational (I hope), but seemingly really real to me now that it has been hindering my love life progress for almost 22 odd years.

1) Do you girls feel awkward as hell when the guy you are dating with is silent most of the time? I mean I can talk when I am probed, but very often girls don't initiate conversations, and I am not really good at initiating and holding conversations too. This is why all my friends are guys.

2) Because I have been evergreen for so long, do you girls think it is weird to date someone like me, who is inexperienced?

3) How do I get closer to a girl, if I can't even initiate and hold a conversation long enough to have a conversation/ connection. Is it still possible? Any tips?

4) Is it weird for a guy who you have known for quite some time (known as in just acquaintance), were to suddenly ask you out saying he have liked you for a while? Especially if the guy is shy, introverted, poor, have no car, slightly short? Plus side is that I am decent looking though, had some girls (those that unfortunately I am not that interested in) say that I look cute. But no matter how decent looking I am, somehow my quiet personality eventually alienates them, so its useless.

5) Do girls normally spread rumors about how they just rejected a guy nowadays? I got burnt so hard the last time I tried, and I hope there is a more mature environment right now.

6) When after a few dates, or longer when you guys have known each other, how do you deal with silence? What do you talk about or do during the more awkward moments? This is a big issue for me and a real concern because I am a really quiet guy that likes to spend time alone. Also, what should the frequency of dates be?

That's it for now.

Serious relationship advice needed! I've been going steady with my introvert boyfriend for a year now and we've both met each other's families. He has met all my close friends and acquaintances, but I have yet to meet his friends in person.

At the early stage of our relationship, I mentioned that I wanted to meet them, but he wasn't keen on the idea, citing awkwardness and a lack of commonalities between his friends and me. "They are not like your friends," he told me. "Group A likes talking about guy stuff like marvel movies, group B (mixed sex) doesn't have a culture of inviting our SOs to meetings."

Today, after one year of being exclusive, I popped the question of when I would get to meet his friends again. His response was the same. He asked his friends if he could bring his GF to one of their meals and they responded negatively, reason being they rarely get to meet up with their busy schedules and it would be very awkward if a stranger was in their midst. It would be uncomfortable.

"So your friends are all exclusive social groups," I reasoned.

"Yes, they are."

"Unlike my social groups where SOs are all welcome and where we've all met each others' SOs in person, your groups are exclusive."

"Yes."

"So when will I get to meet your friends...? When we're about to get married?" I asked.

"Well, that looks like the case," he replied as we walked through a crowded shop.

I hope that readers can weigh in on this situation. Whenever my friends ask me "What are _________'s friends like?" I have no answer to give them. They're always surprised when I mention that I've never met his friends in person.

When is reasonable for one to expect to meet her BF's friends? Am I asking too much to meet his friends just once...? I'm not asking to hang out with them on a regular basis. I just want to be a part of HIS life. I feel shut out from his social life. I feel uncomfortable that I haven't met his friends. One is the average of their closest friends, right?

Does it mean anything if a girl doesn't really carry on the conversation in whatsapp texts? As in she most of the time replies in such a way that it is quite hard to follow up the next text (not exactly one worded answers like hahaha or lol or ok, but i think you should know what i mean). I kinda like her so i want to see how she's like with me before asking her out after exams. 

I've known her already for about 2 sems now (around a year) but we're not exactly close in real life. We used to text once in a while previously but everything then was mainly due to school/project stuff. It was only recently that our texts started to get a bit more personal, but as i said, most of the time she makes it quite hard for me to reply. But i guess a good thing would be that she reads and replies to my messages pretty quickly, sometimes even faster than me replying to her. 

I'm not taking any modules in common with her this sem, but we're both from the same faculty, so i would bump into her once in a while in school. I don't know her well enough to understand her character and stuff, and that perhaps it's just normal for her to just reply what needs to be replied and not follow up anything. She's also the more quiet and reserved kind IRL so i wonder if that has anything to do with it. Thanks for reading and appreciate any advice from you guys!

I am a year 3 student here who do not like talking to people whom i don't know. However, i talk a lot to people whom i had already known for years. I dislike joining any social events because i do not have much interest to make new friends as it requires me to step out of my comfort zone. Furthermore, up till this point in time, i never had a single guy friend (i'm a girl) even though i was from mixed gender schools all the way. I admit i am very shy to interact with the opposite gender and never overcome it and neither do i know how to talk to guys. I am intending to stay single anyway so it does not matter to me if i can communicate with guys, at least in my opinion. I already had the intention of having a good female pal if i ever need companion. If cannot find, i don't mind being alone either. However, i had 3 qns below: 

a) whenever by chance, i happen to catch a guy looking at me, i was always the first to look away because it felt so awkward. Even when guys do try to approach me for a convo, i simply cannot talk so i don't make any effort to talk. I don't bother either because i don't intend to make friends with any guys since i really don't know how to talk to them. In other words, don't know and don't care. My parents warned me that if i had zero guy friends, i had a high chance of getting cheated by bad guys who only wish to take advantage of me. How true is this statement? The guys here seems decent though.

b) whenever i walk along the streets or to/from NUS, i always stare at my phone and refused to look at people because i do not want to end up seeing people whom i might know because i felt lazy to smile or greet people so if i could i would avoid that. I do not even know who is in my module cohort because i simply go lecture just to gain knowledge so i don't care who is in my cohort. Can i just continue the way i am simply because i feel so comfortable by keeping to myself?

c) obviously i had never gotten into a relationship before because i know falling in love is to be vulnerable. You have to be prepared to get hurt. Of course there are happy endings but i do not like to enter anything that is uncertain. This is also part of the reason why i never wish to be friends with any guys so as to make sure i have zero chance of developing feelings for anyone. Don't even ask me to try even once because i will not. Is this a wise move? 

Perhaps i should provide some info about my family background. I am the only child so naturally my parents are very protective of me. I do not have to work just to earn my own money, so the only time i ever worked was for 3 months as i wish to clear an internship module. In fact, i appear so innocent that many people thought i was still in high school. So far, i had been able to get almost anything i wanted. For now, i felt so unmotivated to learn to talk to people because i felt too comfortable being by myself. 

I wonder if there's is anyone in similar situation as me or used to be like me. If there is, please do share your experiences on another post if that is more comfortable to you? 

Also, is there any correlation between my family background and how i dislike socialising?

Please don't flame me as i genuinely wish to hear some views and perhaps some advice on how to make myself motivated to learn to socialise... Thanks.

When guys flirt, its really serious business. I am a guy btw. I was talking to my friend and when this chio bu comes by, he suddenly stop talking to me and flirt wiith her for a very long time and when I try to join in the conversation, he completely ignored me, making me look like a retard.

 Your problem is that you ask too many questions. Go experiment and find out the answer. Don't trust any words unless it can be verified by your own experience.

was browsing through instagram, I realize this person changed his gf already, they were really sweet before he came to uni, then now because uni girls are prettier and cuter xmm, so he decided to dump her. i know what you guys will prolly say something like when the feeling is gone, you cant force love etc. i just want to say that it is really unfair for the girl, since she waited for him, when she could've ran off and be some other guy's xmm when he is trapped in ns. the least he could do is try to be a little more faithful and loyal.

Does she like me or not?

I had this crush who I suspect that likes me as well

She invited me to take MRT home with her once, invited me to eat lunch with her several times and she voluntarily gave me her number.

I tried to ask her out for dates several time. This is where things started to become strange.

She initially claimed that she is interested. However, she always come up with excuses at the last minute such as event being too expensive or something cropped up the last minute. End up, we didn't really went for any date.

If she was to make excuse, why did she appear interested initially instead of making excuse from the start? Furthermore, some of her "excuses" turned out to be true.

I dreamt about you last night. 6 years after you walked out of that door, telling me you can't do this anymore. Best April's Fool joke played on me - a dream about you.

I dreamt that you came back to me, to my arms. I dreamt that we continued, or we started over. We were together. We had a future. We had a family. We had each other.

I woke up. Trying to replay the dream in my mind. Trying to recall every single moment of that fantasy. Us. Together. You always did call me stupid for letting my dreams affect me so deeply. But as reality hits me, and I prepare for the day, a drop of tear escaped my eyes. Unintentionally. I didn't even have enough time to hold it back. The harsh reality that like all April's Fool joke, it is a joke. You would never come back. Like your final words: there is no more us.
Perhaps the most heartbreaking thing is the fact that neither of us was wrong. Neither of us were the demanding party, or the childish one. In fact we were both too  mature that we understood how both of us couldn't have a future together. 
Nothing went wrong. Because it was never right to begin with. We werent compatible. But I was convinced I could make it work. But I couldn't convince you. And as i lay on my bed now, thinking about you,  looking through our photos together, typing this. I wonder if i will dream of you again tonight. I am grateful seeing you in my dreams. For you will always be in my heart and memories.

Every day since that night, I doubted if I could ever love someone as much as I loved you. Or if I could even love again at all.

And like every cheesy romance movie: I will choose it all again if I had a choice.
Sleepy. I close my eyes. I cry. As I remember the day I first met you. How we got lost and met on the bus. The words I first told you. And the words that I always told you out of the blue, during our dates, and the night you walked out of my life. Do you remember?
"Did I ever tell you how lucky was I to have met you?"
Goodbye my pris-cess

Just passed by LT25 (Faculty of Science) and saw this cute little caterpie on one of the banners. 

Reminds me of the good days where everyone around me was innocent and carefree. Now everyone just look gloomy and seems so stressed. Maybe things will get better once they get to level 10.

How do I know when to end a conversation? Whenever I give the other party the opportunity to end the conversation she texts back. Is it out of politeness?  But I take it as a cue to continue. Am I wrong?

It's always nice when someone is there to listen to you. That particular friend that you confide with and can say anything that's on your mind but it gets a little nerve wrecking when she doesn't share anything about herself. Yeah, she might be shy but after so long, does she still not trust me? Relationships are supposed to be a 2 way thing and when it's been like this for far too long, it gets kind of weird. I don't think I can continue anymore, I don't know how to fix this.... Any advice?

I am a year 1 girl here and I really need help! So for the past few months I have been suspecting my BF is cheating on me. He always WhatsApp girls behind my back and when I ask to look at the messages, he refuses to show them. So yesterday I used his phone while he was asleep to access his WhatsApp. His WhatsApp kept crashing and I can't open it. I updated the app but it still doesn't work. Then I tried WhatsApp on my phone, I faced a similar problem. Anybody knows how to fix this issue?? Thanks!!

I am dating a lady. We seem to be hitting off well during our dates. But recently it seems that she seems to have texted me less and dont really reply to my msgs.

Hi You,

It's Me again from . Lately, I've been thinking about you more than ever after I wrote that confession. I was reminiscing about us and how we came this far.

Do you still remember that day? I mustered up a monstrous amount of courage and approached you that day? I knew it was my last opportunity to do so I was glad I did. As a female who would never fall for a younger male, you were an exception.

Remember those talks about the ideal characteristics we would like our future significant other to possess? I was secretly hoping that I would match those descriptions of what you shared. However I was the complete opposite. Thus I kept my feelings hidden as I was unsure and afraid of rejections.

Despite that, we still fell for each other. Yet, we didn't happen. Our story ended on the day it started. Thus, we parted ways.

I only knew about your feelings months later but it was all too late. It was at that moment when all feelings have faded, confessing were therefore much easier. It was also then when I found out that you fell for someone else. Thus it was easier for both of us to move on.

5 years isn't a short period of time. 5 years later, certain things still reminded me of you. 5 years have passed and I never fail to wish you on your birthday. I'm thankful for you being a part of my life even though it was for a short while.

Love is capable of turning a rational person into a fool. I still remembered making up stupid excuses just so I can see you once again after 5 years. 

I hope you'll do well in my alma-mater even though I've graduated from NUS. I wish I hadn't... Because I still miss you.

Love,
Me.

Evergreen here. Any bro-tips on what are some good places / activities to ask a girl out on a date? 

Some context: I've known this girl for over a year. We belong to the same clique of friends and meet up almost everyday (though seldom alone together). So it's quite lame to ask her out for coffee to "get to know each other better". I also don't like movies either as there's little chance for interaction (both of us are the rather quiet type so I've to try really hard to avoid silences or she'll just end up picking up her phone) 

I've actually tried to ask her out before to one of those Halloween horror events, but was rejected...so maybe something on a smaller scale perhaps?

I met up with a group of friends whom I've known since secondary school last week. We all have been a great group all this while. However, now that we're in uni, I feel very out of touch whenever we start talking. I enjoy intellectually stimulating conversations - not just about work, but also about topics on self-development, even the best places to go for food etc. Just interesting things that allow me to go like, "wow I feel I learn something from you guys!" However, my friends are into discussing things like - gossip, latest shows, celebs. Strange thing is, whenever I am with my uni friends, they see me as someone who is reliable, capable and at times, funny. When I hang out with my secondary friends, I became the person they always knew since I was in sec sch - too serious (?), on different frequency I feel. Sometimes I say nothing because I do not know what to add to their conversations.  Anyone been through such a phase before? How do you deal with it?

I find that I can pick up new things rather easily, but the learning curve quickly tapers off and my progress stagnates after a short period. Due to that, my enthusiasm and interest wanes as well. Is this common or am I alone?

i have this hypocritical friend that always make the "psk" sound at me or give me disapproving looks whenever i make a sick joke. we are all adults already i don't think there is anything blatantly wrong with cracking this kind of jokes. what is even more infuriating about her is that she is attached, she talks about marriage and she keeps telling people she really like babies. In other words, she cant wait to have sex lah! or she think babies drop down from the sky?

I really can't stand the way she acts like she is so fucking innocent all the time, rolling her eyes at me, like i am something filthy. if she indeed so innocent, her mind won't be thinking about marriage, she won't even have the desire to get attached!

she whole day think about baby making, then judge me for a simple joke? wts is this?

I know I'm good looking, I have confidence in my looks. Or so I thought. Cos if I really did, why do I see really nice and good looking guys and think about how he's never going to be mine cos he'd never go for a girl like me..

I wanna try dota, but anyone willing to teach me? I'm a total beginner, so much patience is needed.

Is it true that with the right person, you are willing to tell the deepest sadness? And is it true that if you feel right when you confide something sad to some person, they are the right one?

I want someone to talk to, about my worries, ask advice and many other things. Yet I don't want to dump my emotional baggage or infest other with my negativity. 

There was a time long before WhatsApp when I was often tethered to my desktop, and got to chat with a few people via MSN. After MSN died, I don't really have anyone to talk to. One was only contactable via MSN, another got married (and probably is busy when her own life), others simply fade away due to non-contact, and I also don't really want to talk to them only when I need help. Even when some of us do talk, it's often just some customary talk like how are you etc... And it ends rather quickly. People have their own closer friends now, and have their own lives. People have aged and have different priorities and are at different stages of their lives, while I'm never past the just bumming around and stuck-in-a-rut phase. And somehow I never did transit chatting with those friends from via MSN to WhatsApp, so I effectively have no one to chat to, despite being in a group chat.

But then again this is only happening now. It happens when I'm put in a stressed or sad situation. Got blasted recently by my boss for not doing something which I was sure I did but have no way to prove, only to later doubt if I have actually done it, and only much later to realise that I have most likely done it (meaning not my fault), but still no way to prove.

Now I'm in ICT, and it can get depressing talking about jobs when one realises that one is earning relatively little. Actually I don't really need to earn a lot of money. The amount I have is probably sufficient for myself, however I need to support my parents too and I'm worried if I'll be able to cope once my dad retires. It doesn't help that many people around are married or attached, even if I'm not desperate to be, as it makes me feel how truly alone I am.

But it's only just for a few days. After that it'll be back to work. Assuming I can get the job done on time, life is going to be pretty ok and I'll be back to my normal self soon, giving advice to people on NUSWhispers.

I try to be nice. I didn't look at yall because I'm afraid I'll get angry and give yall the bitch face. So I just stare at the computer and replied one word answers. I know it's not polite, but I can't help it. We are fretting and worrying about important things and there you are doing other things. I was angry at first. But now I just want to get it done. 
-
 
I know I don't have the right to be angry in the first place. I don't own you, perhaps never will. But my apologies are sincere. And my feelings are real. I guess your distance means I must give up right? I would, but please give me time. We were close and you started shaking up my world. But now by keeping your distance away from me, you're doubling the force. See you tomorrow. 
-
 
I'm always there when you need me for help, when you need a listening ear or when you just need the company of someone. Despite all these, you tell me that we can never be anything more than just friends... 
-
 
I tell my friends I'm with my parents. I tell my parents I'm doing work. I tell my work that it can wait until later. Really I'm meeting up with my girl of tinder.

I have been in NUS for 2 years but i find it really hard to make true friend than in secondary school and junior college. In the past we just become good friends without any intention to make use of each other. It was genuine friendship. However, just recently one of my close friend in uni help me out in something and demanded that i help her back next time as i owe her a favour.      I find it rather ridiculous as i had helped her out in a lot of minor stuff before without saying anything. I really wonder what have changed as i have heard a lot of similar stories about making friend in uni is tough.
-
 
I started liking someone but after giving some hints, my friend advised me to move on and let go because 'others' are judging me. That I'm a flirt, maybe I just want money, etc. The person I like seems to be just enjoying my attention. But I dont mind since I sincerely have feelings for him and just wanted to be close with him. Does this person know what others are talking about me? It's very hard to resist not to talk to and be with someone  you really like just because other people are judging you and watching your every interaction with him. I didn't know even just 'expressing'  my feelings need consent from other people especially his friends. :( 
-
 
I really don't like it when people keep adding to be honest when they speak or chat. It sounds like they are very arrogant. Like they need to be honest to tell you something because you probably won't understand if they tell you normally. When someone keep using to be honest, usually I would want to honestly tell them to shut up, because to be honest they suck.
-
 
I realized something last night while trying to fall asleep. Many a times i'm always the one initiating meetups on a one-to-one basis with my close friends. Whenever i text them asking whether they would like to have lunch/dinner, they would most of the time readily agree and ask when a suitable time would be. 

Not that i mind initiating meetups or anything, but the thing is, i can't exactly recall a single time in which they initiated anything with me (even if there was, it's probably countable on one hand). So it just got me thinking whether these friends whom i consider really close (those that i know really well from army, JC, sec school) feel the same about me? Or do they just see me as another friend whom they don't mind having a meal together with once in a while. 

What do you guys think? Am i being too unreasonable here? I know that everyone is busy with school/work stuff and all, but if I bother to take the time to think about them, text them and ask whether wanna meet for lunch, surely they can do the same to me?

I am attached with my boyfriend for almost 2 years but we have not had sex even we slept together in the same room for quite some times. Both of us are virgins. Does anyone believe?
-
 
How do I stop overthinking about stuff? It's giving me mental paralysis and coming at the worst time when exams are soon :(
-
 
I wish I could tell you this but I can't muster the courage to. I'm actually really tired of waiting for you to come around. I'm tired of how you keep hurting by telling me you're not sure. I secretly wish that my feelings for you will vanish so that I don't have to do this anymore. I secretly wish I've never met you.

Asking help from all love advisors here, male and female alike. If a guy asks a girl to find another guy. 99% chance no hope already is it? :(

It's interesting. I saw some people I really didn't want to see today - my previous group mates. It really reminds me about how I was a destructive group mate. Not a pleasant memory.

A huge part of me is still disturbed, about how they won't really know "taking time in understanding a person", even if it slapped them in the face. To them, I always had some dubious reason or another, to do things - I like "something" supposedly because "a close friend of mine likes that said something", when it's just a side they didn't see.

I was supposed to behave in a certain way because it's "my nature" - they don't know that I hate, with passion, to have to live up to someone else's standards. It has to do with my background, which I doubt they'ld understand - even less so if I explain it to them (they'll just dismiss it easily as bs, even if I am dead serious).

Then again, they do not understand - because I never really opened up to them, much less talk to them properly. This, should be reason enough, to put that rage aside. My peace now matters more than something that happened, that I cannot change.

I have come to realise many things - that looking back, I have to face the bitter fact, that I am reaping the consequences today, of the lot of foolish stuff I did in my first few years. My priorities then, were in all the wrong places. 

I became entrenched, after a while, in a rush to try to push my grades, but to no avail. (word of advice: generally, don't do projects with graduating students - not that they're all like that, but they legitimately have other priorities)

I looked at my falls, glaring at me every day, reminding me that, if I had worked harder then, I would have been in a much better position today. 

I look at my falls, and realise, how much I have yet to learn, about materials, about drafting work, about control, fluids and much more to come.

I learnt how I can learn - by doing more machining. Though seriously, paperwork does not work at all on me for some reason - things just don't make sense to me that way - but they do make sense when I see them coming together, falling into places.

Ironically, it is my failing grades at my uni level, that returned the spark and flame, to drive me to be interested in becoming an inventor again, after so many lost years.

Strange, isn't it? That a guy sharing the same name (not background) as that other guy from Meet the Robinsons, is telling himself the same thing, to Keep Moving Forward?

If a guy keeps making eye contact with me for the past semester, does it mean he wants to be my friend or something? I'm a girl if it matters.

I know you won't see this but I just want to get this off my chest.
This is an open letter to you:

As much as it kills me to say this, I miss you. And I wish you would come back to me. Even though you hurt me. Even though you probably would again. I just miss being with you, and talking to you. Because of you I don’t want anyone else. I can’t lose myself in anyone else because all I want is you. You’re the first guy I’ve ever loved. I know you won’t be the last. But now I’m trying to duct tape my broken heart back together and sew my soul back into my skin.

People tell me to move on, that there are better guys out there, that i shouldn’t settle for you. But what they don’t understand is they’re not you. I could date a hundred guys, but i know when i look at them, all i’ll see is how they’re not you. I can’t even begin to imagine myself being with anyone else. You are still constantly on my mind. Matters of the heart barely encompasses logic.

There really is no happy ending if you’re not in it. Forgive me for not being able to let go, i forgave you for not being able to hold on. I just hope that one day, my mind would just let go about thoughts that i’ve built upon, where i saw a future with ‘us’ in it. No matter how much pain and hurt you brought me, I’m still hoping its me and you in the end. 

I still and always will love you.

To my ex, sometimes I still miss you and the way that we were. However, too much time has passed and i hope that you'll find someone for yourself.

It ain't difficult to find a partner, the difficult part is to marry the right one...
-
 
Despite being around so many people (friends and acquaintances) in uni, I often feel lonely... Anyone feels the same?

It's been three years since our break up. Thanks for all the love and care you have showered me with. Hope that your new girl is more appreciative than me. I still miss you.

So prior to my relationship, I was an avid texter, clocking up to 5k smses(before whatsapp was around) per month, talking to classmates and friends about everything and anything in general. Fast forward 6 years later, it seems that i have no clue how to talk to girls/ sustain a conversation in general. i'm not sure if the problem is i only want to talk to my gf, or im not a good conversationalist, or people are just not interested in talking to me. In any case, as a result, after 2 years in NUS, i havent been able to make a friend that last more than a semester, with people from past sems being hi-bye friends. what should i do?
-
 
Like most guys, I am very desperate to get into a relationship. But when I reflect on myself, I realise I may not be ready for relationship -  I still consider myself immature and playful, I cant really take care of myself and I do poorly in life. Each time, I want to confess to my crush, I am really worry I may ruin her future. Girls will not go for this kind of guys right? I guess I still have lots of improvement.
-
 
I need some advice and comfort. I went through a breakup recently and I spend my days being miserable and hopeless. I am able to distract myself at school or work, but when I go home or about to sleep or just waking up, I'm overwhelmed by fear and loneliness. I used to spend every weekend with my SO and now in the weekend, I even feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience cuz I sometimes found myself looking up and realising I'm all alone in my room. It's strange cuz I'm not used to being all alone during the weekends. It makes me feel so lonely. 
-
 
Something has been bothering me recently... My close friend (who is very happily attached) keeps telling me how cute my boyfriend is. I would be flattered - in fact I was, initially. Until she started telling me about her fantasies of my boyfriend engaging in sexual acts with herself. She often tells me about sex with her boyfriend in great detail and then proceed to say stuff like "I'm sure W would last much longer than him... I would make him slide his d*** against my p**** until I come first". I just don't know how to respond whenever she says such things. She also pesters me to tell her about sex with W and things like how big his penis is. Should I be worried or am I just overthinking? It is affecting my studies and I cannot concentrate in classes. BTW she said those things in front of me and my boyfriend before so he actually knows.
-
 
So I met this person from a dating app, and we've been chatting for over 2 months. I really like him, and would love to meet him one day. He's been really busy with studies and projects so we couldn't really find time to go out. But now he's free, and I'm just waiting for him to ask me out... I've hinted my interest to him several times, but he doesn't seem to get it :( or is he uninterested in the first place?

My questions are, 
1) What does it mean when a guy chats with you every single day without fail, but never really explicitly suggests meeting up?
2) Should I initiate a date instead of waiting it out? Time is running out (I'll be leaving Singapore in a few weeks' time), but being a more conservative type of girl, I'm apprehensive about being so proactive...

What should I do? Would appreciate serious answers. Thank you!!

It took me a long time to be where I am today, but I can finally consider myself to be somewhat out of the woods from my one and only toxic relationship that lasted x years. I was emotionally and mentally abused besides being sexually assaulted, and to this day I still have flashbacks every now and then. Being a really private person, no one will ever be able to guess how strong I needed to be to brave all of this on my own. I just wanted my own fairytale of being together with my first and didn't want to let go despite being repeatedly poisoned by an arsehole. I told myself I could take it,  and psyched myself to think that it was good training ground for my character (lol). Luckily for me, the time came for me to leave, albeit it being far too late.

I am not naturally an introvert, but I have since become afraid of speaking out and being myself because I've been so used to being submissive, compliant and passive under his bidding and expectations. 

Since then, I have met a certain someone who has all the qualities that every girl would want in a boyfriend, and while I haven't accepted him, he is breaking my walls down in the softest, sincerest ways. His affection towards me is unthinkable, to the point where I catch myself feeling unworthy of such love and kindness from another human being. The way I know my heart will be secure with him, the tenderness with which he beckons me, how he pays attention to my boundaries and remembers my preferences, how he respects the things I'm good at without comparing me to others who are better.. I feel like crying. Has the world we live in become so hardened that basic human decency makes one teary? 

Previously, I always thought that I deserved a lot from my partner because I am above average, but after going through what I had and then being treated like royalty, I know that my sense of entitlement makes me a shitty person.  Even though the second guy comes from an incredibly humble background, his ability to give me everything he has is so unreal. In a nurturing environment like that, I see my old healthy self peeking out once in a while. I am so afraid that he will not like what he sees, so I constantly expect him to ghost me or unveil his true colours after the excitement of the chase has died down, but it has been half a year and he is still at it, more wonderful with each passing day. I don't have to earn any of his goodwill as a reward for being abused, and this is what I've always known a functional, loving, sustainable relationship to be like. Seeing it play out in real life is truly surreal.

All I want to say is, thank you for making me believe in love again. And a heartfelt thank you to all the guys out there who conscientiously treat their girls like queens. May you all receive the love you so much deserve. To girls who are in a toxic relationship, grow some (really big) balls and leave. Never look back. Take care of yourself. To the singletons, keep focusing on making yourself a great partner, and love will find you soon enough. Don't lose hope. 

-
 
We met recently... You're 24 and I'm 21. Our conversations have always been long and meaningful. But we only have it once every 2 weeks or so... You're about to graduate while I'm just waiting to start uni... So sometimes I'm not too sure whether is it convenient to talk to you... Sighpie. I hope there's progress.. 
-
 
Oftentimes, especially when I'm at the receiving end, I feel something is not right, however I cannot immediately express it out.

Sometimes I get a case of "staircase wit". "Hah, if only I said this then, they would have shut up and shown themselves the door". But I tell myself that it's no use to be witty, or even argumentative.

More importantly is that when some time have passed, and I analyse the situation, I often find that their argument is full of flaws. I never tell them, because it's already over (yes, I've actually effectively  forgotten all concrete details or examples such that I cannot recall any at the moment, only the 'meta' analysis that their argument was flawed), and I don't think they're interested or receptive. It's kinda useless though, even though you can confirm you weren't wrong way after the fact. It's like knowing the answer to a question after the exams.

Should I try to respond faster (even if I can't think quickly), or just continue to 'suck it up' and be bullied rarely, since I avoid conflict most of the time anyway? Sometimes tired.
-
 
How do you forget a bad test experience? :( 
-
 
The saddest friendships are with people you cannot trust, who disappoint you again and again and make up stories about you behind your back. I won't call it friendship, but I'll stay friendly (and hate myself for the asymmetry). All the best leeching off other people. I hope you get what you want.
-
 
I normally do not identify with regret. I was the kind of person that didn't do much or go out much, but somehow I got into a hall. My best friend and I got a room together, and we were all ready to laugh our way through school. 
Then I met a girl. We met during a camp. She was smart and funny, and most importantly, she loved me for who I was. Obviously we got together. It was like a dream come true. 
Shortly after we started dating, my best friend also started seeing a girl, part of the clique in hall we always hung out with. But that didn't go so well. Things ended badly. And before I knew it, the clique that I spent the past two months hanging out with just vanished. Later I would find out that they were all still meeting, just that, my best friend and I weren't invited. But it was okay, if I lost all my friends, at least the two most important people in my life were still here. 
But my best friend and I started growing more distant. Despite the fact that we were roommates, we hardly said more than 2 sentences to each other in a day. I tried to start conversation, but it just doesn't flow anymore. Being friends used to be so easy and now it was trying to breathe without air. My best friend, who was very nearly the other half of me, didn't give half a shit about me. 
Now I struggle to make by every day. I wake up and wonder why do I bother. Why do I care, when it can be so easy to end all the pain just by taking one step off the edge. The only thing that has held me back is my girlfriend, that I couldn't possibly make her cry. She's the only thing I have left, and it's only going to be a matter of time before she realizes just how broken I am, and leaves. I don't know what to do anymore. 
-
 
I hope marriage life is treating you well. I am honestly truly happy for you when you walked down the aisle with your now-wife. Hopefully, I can find someone who made me feel the way you made me feel.

-
 
This OP is a nervous wreck. Everyone is getting offers one by one while I'm just waiting for a phone call or email on DA... The wait is torturous
-
 
Even though I've only known you for less than 2 months, it kind of feels like I've know you forever. It might be hasty to say this, but I really feel like you're THE ONE. :>
-
 
When I was the one putting in more effort.. you didn't appreciate it and ignored me. You made me so upset and lonely.

Then i made the decision to stop giving and just be the one taking. You came back and you treated me better than before. You smiled and laughed at my jokes and told me that i looked good.

Now, i have felt what it is like to be wanted, even by strangers and sadly, i dont want to give anymore. I only want to take.

This is why i said to myself, i'll make you come back to chase me again.

Secondary school:

Talked to 5 people at morning assembly, found out what they watched on YouTube last night.  Ate recess with 10 people. Discussed homework. Did group project with 3 people. Ate lunch with 5 people. Talked about teachers and life. Hung out at the mall. Took a bus home and chatted with 3 fellows. 

Uni: 

Have a conversation with 3 people, once a week. On average- talk to 0.5 people a day.

Does anyone feel like they sold out on their dreams? Or do you reckon you can still chase them down?

On a side note, Zootopia was a wonderful movie

Hey, you.

I love you.

Here's to a lasting relationship ahead, my partner in committing bad pun crimes. :)

Is caring for your ex-boyfriend/girlfriend while you're in a new relationship a good thing? Does caring mean still having feelings for the person? Or it could simply be caring about the welfare and wellbeing of the person, like a good friend?

, hi there, just want to tell you to never stop trying :) It may be tiring and difficult sometimes, but we should always try to give our best in whatever we do so that we will not leave any regrets. Though I'm not exactly good in some engineering concepts too, I will still do my best and practise over and over again to make sure I grasp the concepts well. What others can easily understand in a short period of time, I need at least double, or even thrice that amount of time. 

I know some people can be really insensitive, and their words definitely hurt us in some way. We can try to forgive and forget. It's tiring to bear grudges or to be sad over whatever they've said. And chances are, they won't even remember it. Why should we be sad over something that they so casually said it? 

Don't worry about not articulating well. When you meet the girl that you like and she also likes you, I think you'll naturally open up to her. You guys will have something in common to talk about. You will want to know more about her family, friends, hobbies, etcetc. Perhaps you will get so comfortable talking to her that you become really talkative before you know it. I've also seen many short male acquaintances getting attached. I think height is not an issue. When the girl really likes you, your height and look will not matter much.

Lastly, quite many engineering graduates chose not to work in engineering-related industries and opt for banking, marketing, business-related stuff. So, you still have chance to work in business-sector :)

Have faith in yourself and never give up trying! There's no harm in giving your best. Clothes-wise, wear something you're comfortable in. All the best to you.
-
 
Damn! I think I'm missing someone. Is thinking about someone, reading their chat with you and hoping they would text you considered real missing? I got no chill LOL
-
 
It was a great night 2 weeks ago. I unexpectedly enjoyed it and I hope you did too. I initiated a few meet-ups after, but alas, you weren't free. You didn't even get back to me :( I guess I know where I stand.. for that one night. 
-
 
To a  silent reader here who contacted me a few months back for relationship and sexual advice, thanks for just deleting and blocking me off WhatsApp and Facebook after you've chatted and asked me all the questions on your mind. You're a nice person but the way you act towards me now is nothing short of shit. 

All the best. At least I know we're on different sides now.

LPT(Life Pro Tip): If your friend bitches to you about another friend behind his/her back, this is the kind of friend that you should watch out for as you might be the next victim.

Background: There is this upcoming camp where the head of this committee threatens to bitch about the person to his course cohort if he/she do not meet the head's standard. Is this how a leader should behave?

Not an NUS student but I would want to date an NUS girl since they seemed more mature than the ones from my school :(

I am so tired in dealing with my family issues that getting into a relationship is the last thing in my mind. And because of this, any guys who expressed interest in me, I will just avoid them or give them cold shoulders, hoping that they will give up. There is this guy who is my ideal type, or i would say he is more than what I can ask for. I can see that he puts in a lot of effort, trying to break through the walls that I have built in between us. I am sorry that I have to do this because I don't want to fall for him further and I am sure that he can find a much better girl than me. I guess we just happen to meet at the wrong time.
 
My friends say that I should just give him a chance. But I think it would be unfair to him. Firstly, I know I won't be able to tell him the stuff I'm going through now truthfully. (It is something that even my closest friends don't know). Secondly, I know he will be the one who do more things for me and I would be more at the receiving end. Thirdly, if he were to become my boyfriend, half the time he will be worried for me which is not what I want. I don't want to weigh him down with my emotions and my own issues. 

For now, I just want him to move on and find a sweet nice girl to have a simple love relationship. My life is too complicated and messy now and I don't want him to drag him into the sufferings with me (not even a bit). People say that if he likes me enough, he will be willing to go through everything with me. But nope, the pain that he will experience if he is with me, is going to be a lot more worse than him being heartbroken now.

To him: Yes it hurts when I make the decision to cut you off from my life, this paragraph is something which I would never dare to tell you in person. Cause' I know you too well, you will stand by me no matter what. If there is something as fate, may fate bring us back again when I have recover and resolve my issues. If both of us are still single and still love each other then, that is when I can accept you and love you whole-heartedly, giving you the happiness that you deserved. It's okay that you think of me as a heartless girl for now, as long as you move on and find your true love. All the best.

*warning: long post ahead*
Hi , I do hope you see this. I'm sorry that you haven't been able to find someone who reciprocates your love, but I'm sure you will one day. As a single lady, I'm also waiting for someone I love who loves me back. You aren't alone here in this, there's a lot of single people out there - and who knows? What will be will be; it's best to wait and find the right one rather than end up with the wrong one.

And yes, studying can seem like a real chore if you don't like what you're studying or if you don't do well in it, I agree. But..if it isn't something you can change, then I guess all you can do is to grit your teeth and bear it. Worrying and being upset over what cannot be doesn't make things better - perhaos what you can do is think on what you really want and pursue it :) after all, a degree really is just a piece of paper. Just like how grades are just a number. Being in a course you dislike doesn't mean you must be condemned to it your whole life~ 
As for internships, may I ask what field you are looking at? Is it a field within your engin degree, or a field within your passion? If it's in line with the internships I'm looking out for, I may be able to help :)

And if you think being unattractive and short is an issue.. I would say no, it isn't. 
Really.

This is coming from a girl who is also not what you'd call pretty, short (probably -2SDs below the mean lol) and kinda chubby, I definitely don't fit the bill of what you'd call 'chio bu'. But I've learnt to let that go because love isn't about looks but about personality. Cliché, I know, but looks can only go so far right? It may be the face/look/body that attracts, but it's the personality that makes someone stay.

I can tell you're doing your best, and given the circumstances life has given you, it's a testament to your inner strength you have overcome them. To be able to continue trying and working so hard even though you may feel like it's hopeless. To be able to even tell your story here on NUSwhispers.

Don't think badly of yourself because you are much stronger than you think you are.

Sometimes I feel just like you do. Why the things I pursue don't go right, why I can't get decent grades, why can't I at least have lesser things to stress about even as I deal with studies and the prospect of never finding a guy. Why I can't have a 'normal' family.

It's depressing. It's hard. It makes us feel shitty and crap when those who don't understand make snide or insensitive comments. I won't tell you to ignore it because frankly..the phrase "words can never hurt me" is utter bull, isn't it? Sometimes words cut deeper than sticks and stones ever will. 
So..screw those peers of yours who laugh at you. You're fighting a hard battle - one they are unaware of, I presume - and those words are the last things you need to hear. I distance myself from people who are like that, so perhaps you can too :) no point associating with such negativity. 

About work..is it possible for you to find work somewhere else? It isn't healthy for your well-being to be stuck in a place where you have to deal with even more negativity. 
And no, it isn't you. It's probably just the supervisor..for reasons unknown, but it isn't your fault okay? You didn't do anything wrong so there's no reason for him to angst.

Right, now for family. 
I can't comment on your family situation, but I'm guessing everyone is stressed over finances? And it might affect the mood of having a meal together.
I really am in no place to give you advice here, but I do hope it turns out well for you. I'm sure your mum and brother care about you too even if they don't show it. All the best :)

If you ever need someone to talk to, you can PM me (though Idk how we can do this lol maybe you can reply this anonymously or something, things can be worked out somehow).

So before I end this..I just wanna say
I hope you find peace within yourself, and continue with the strength and courage in dealing with daily life.
All the best for your family, your internships, your love life, and your work. I hope you have trusted friends you can confide in too :) take care! And know that while you probably don't know the writer of this post, know that whoever she may be, she cares - and I believe there will ve others that do too.

 You're conflating "incompatible with many" and "not good enough". I'm only interested in people who can keep up.

I have a very close female friend who is still a virgin, but she always told me she won't mind having sex with her bf "if the feelings are mutual". As i've seen her go through many short and failed relationships, i've always persuaded her to not have pre-marital sex because she's a very emotional person who would self harm and be severely depressed after a broken relationship. Won't it be worse if she gave her all to a guy who left her? Am i living in the past? Am i selfish?

 Hey girl, I am in the same situation as you. We still talk everyday and have really good chemistry but recently he fell for a girl who was more available. I can only say that, it's not easy but it depends on what you think is more worthwhile? For me I just see if they end up together, since I think there still is a chance. I'm just keeping my options open at the moment though,

Hey dear, I am having the same problem, and it seems like I will give you an opinion different from that of the guys. I say you move on.

He is busy, yes and you can put up with that, but what is the point in trying so hard when the effort is one-way? Relationship must be mutual and balanced, you get his problem but he never bothers to get yours. Then is it fair for you? 

I know this makes me sound like a spoiled brat, but there is a fine line between cannot affford to make an effort and not even think about trying. Seems like your guy does not care enough to see any potential problem in the way he is behaving. If he truly cares for you then he should be worried about the way you may feel. It seems like he may like you...but not to any significant extent. Otherwise he would not confuse you like this. If you are looking for a serious relationship, as opposed to a casual one, it's not the time yet.

Dear G,
If u like me too, please take the initiative to text me because so far I've been the only one initiating all the texts. Even though I'm 99% sure you don't like me, there is still the 1% which I am clinging on to. I'm tired and I fear I am losing interest and if we can't try it out, it would be the biggest regret in my life.  
-
 
My life is never smooth. Everything I want, no matter how hard I try, I usually don't get it.

All of the girls I like do not reciprocate my feelings for them. I am 25 years old and never had a girlfriend, not even a close female friend. And sadly, they are not even gracious at all. After the rejection, they deliberately avoided me like the plague. Yea, say all you want about the benefits of being a single and all, but personally, I want to find someone I love and who loves me just as much to spend my life with.

I wanted to study business at university, I worked very hard for my 'A' levels. In fact, I did well for prelims. But unfortunately during my 'A' levels, my father passed away and it deeply affected me. And most unfortunately, the GP questions which came out are totally out of my grasp. I passed my A levels but the only option for me is engineering, but I disliked it. I considered to study business in a private university but they do not allow me the financial benefits a local university would. And since my family is not well-off, I don't have a choice.

I really try to love whatever I am studying. However maths and physics isn't my strong suit and interest, and obviously this is important in engineering. And I wanted to change course, but my CAP must be good in order for the faculty to accept my transfer. But my grades are below average. I feel stuck.

Any internships I apply to, I got rejected. I realized that internship is not really for students to learn, although that's what those companies claim to be doing. That's a myth. In reality, internships are either for companies to look for cheap labour or find potential talents to work them. I am willing to be either if they can offer me the chance at all. But after the interviews, I do not hear from them.

My part time job as a retail staff is tough as well. Whenever I work, my supervisor finds trouble with me. It is not constructive criticism to help me improve myself, but it is outright sarcasm and bullying. And when I asked the other staffs if the supervisor treats them the same way, they disagreed with me and said the supervisor is a very nice person. I really think something is wrong with me.

My relationship with my mother and brother is bad. I am always trying to bring them together for outings or meals to bond our family together. However, they are usually busy or not interested at all. I cannot change them. It really hurts me to see other families spending time with each other but mine doesn't. 

I know there are plenty of opportunities out there. But I am just so unlucky that whatever I want to pursue, it always fail. I have the opposite of the midas touch, everything I touch turns into rust. Maybe I should lower my expectations on others and on myself? Yes I tried. But guess what? When I lower my expectations, the real results are often even below those low expectations. I just can't get anything right even though I try very hard.

I am a physically unattractive short person and I cannot articulate myself very well. And I believe people will judge me for that. Even if I try to dress nicely, my peers sarcastically joke I am going for a date, even though they know I don't have a girlfriend. It's very hurtful and even though I am a guy, I have feelings as well. And I am a human. Although I am not useful to you, and I don't have anything special to offer you, I have dreams and aspirations for a happy life too like the rest of you. Please don't treat me like a lesser being. Please at least give me a chance to try before saying no :(

Just curious to know if anyone shares the same sentiment as me.

I personally don't find a lot of the student activities or just activities some of the people my age do... Appealing? I never liked the idea of playing games, clubbing and that sort of thing. I prefer simple chats or just doing something simple like watching a movie, having dinner together etc. Which is why I hardly go to such activities cause I know I won't enjoy myself and I don't want to upset the others who are enjoying themselves. I sometimes give the excuse that "I'm too old for this" and I'm wondering if that's really the case or that I'm just a boring person.

Girls actually really like it when guys text first... Try it sometime. Yours truely, Girls.

How do you know if your boyfriend is serious about you and is gonna marry you in the future? 
-
 
So...I've known this guy for close to a month now. We don't text everyday though we used to at the start. The first time we met we had a really good chat over lunch and realised we have a lot of common interests and ideals. We even made a pact (sort of) to hang out more after our exams are over. It felt like a really good start.

Owing to my interest in him, obviously I hoped to see him more before that. However, this is where it all kinda goes wrong. I've plucked up the courage and attempted to ask him out...twice, only to be rejected as he would always have something on. He takes forever to reply texts as well. 

I have thought of giving the whole thing up since he's so uninterested. The rational side of me says to bail before I become further invested (a guy who raises so many red flags is so not worth it) while the emotional side of me knows that I still bear feelings for him which makes moving on a little harder than expected. After all, it is hard to meet someone whom you share the same frequency with and could click so well with so much potential. 

And yet, I do wonder what have I ever done to push him away. How is it that such a promising start would beget such a seemingly tragic end? Did I get all the signals wrong? It makes zero sense to me. To persist or to move on - can't seem to decide sigh :(
-
 
Hi you,

I hope you are doing well in school. I kinda miss those days when we talked about anything under the sun. The image of you still popped up now and then which made me wonder what my life be like if you were a part of it. We fell of each other but we just didn't happen. We were left in disappointment and confusion and we parted ways. 

Remember how our conversations got shorter and shorter, and the replies took longer and longer? Our relationship, our friendship vanished. We were left bewildered. We questioned whatever happened to us.

That day, we met again after 5 years. We were on the same bus and you were standing right in front of me but you did not recognize me. I wanted to approach you but I was afraid. I wasn't confident that I was still the same girl you met years ago. Thus, I watched you leave once again.

We are at our prime right now and I wish you the best in everything that you do. Thank you for telling me I was beautiful even though I still do not believe it. It meant so much to someone who has problems with her self-esteem. I have found someone who have replaced you but you will always be that special friend I miss. I will still wish you on your birthdays and I hope you would too.

Love,
Me.

i wish those girls will stop posting hearts and stuff on my crush's post. it makes me feel as though they are much more daring than me and they will certainly catch his attention and he won't ever notice my existence. feel like crawling into a hole and die now.

His slow-ness in replying messages may not necessarily be a representation of a low level of interest. 

I can only text properly after I ended work. Even during meal times, my brain will be pre-occupied. So unless it is really urgent, or a yes/no kind of message, I tend to only reply after I finished work. I might not even catch the urgent message since I don't check my phone when I am working. It is not so much of a lack of concern/interest, but rather I would not want to reply messages without an ounce of thoughts into it. 

Some people are just like that, and it depends on whether you are comfortable with this level of aloofness during working hours. Don't expect him to change when you two get together. I think my ex hated this part of me. :(

-
 
 I agree with you. here's a POV of a female. my job is quite fast-paced and the hours are not necessarily 9-5. usually, i check my phone when i am going to the toilet or during lunch breaks. when work ends, some times, i find that the replies i give to my friend(s) are not the best. neither do i reply them properly 100% of the time. and this isn't something to be proud of (in my opinion). so yes, i agree with you. 

 how about letting him know what you think about his texting? some people just are not naturally good at texting and multitasking.

my neighbour is moving on to her 3rd boyfriend in 3 years. i just saw them walking back to their room. my heart burnt with jealousy as they laughed and chatted so happily. i dont understand why is life so unfair to me. i just want this one person, and yet i cant even make that intention clear to him. while i am waiting so stupidly for this one person, she is having the time of her life with three different guys. i just wish that tomorrow when i wake up, i will somehow be blessed with the thick skin of my neighbour's and i will be able to tell him what i need to say... 
-
 
what does it mean when a guy you texted started typing like you? from the way he phrases questions, emoji, smiley face (i use a unique one and not just the :) that everyone uses) and even random symbols like ^^, all of them are used by me! since he did not use any of those initially, so you cant say that its a coincidence. then now he is totally talking to everyone in this way (via text, fb, insta) and it is starting to annoy me. cant he be more original?!
-
 
Home is where you hang your heart. Sometimes to death. Ugh. Can't take it. Can't accept the way home and loved ones in my life are right now. -Rant complete-
-
 
There is always this extremely sociable (same gender) friend of mine that "likes" and "comments" on any and every single random posts and comments I made on Facebook. I don't know if it is just me but I find it extremely annoying. A random photo or status update will generate a "like" followed by spams of comments such as "HAHA", emojis and "OMG" from him. Worse, he even went to "like" and comment on every single photo in an entire album of photos I uploaded. The truth is I am not even that close to him and I find his over-friendliness uncomfortable. I have thus set my privacy setting to exclude him from seeing any posts of mine recently and I hope he doesn't find out if not things may turn a little ugly.

This semester is ending soon. Time really flies...haizzzz.....

We haven't meet nor talk to each other ever since that fateful day. Our friendship ended with a big quarrel after I found out that you had been doing something that I personally detest a lot. 

Till today, I'm still asking myself, "Do I really hate you or love you?". I guess our greatest mistake is we shouldn't have appeared in each other's life. If only I could suppress my feelings for you... Perhaps it's 100% my fault, yes it is. If time can be reverse, will I still be that evil villain again? Yes ! I would make you hate me down to the core, so that you will forget my existence easily.

After that night, you left my life. I got struck by the worse fever in my life and my whole body is aching badly. I told myself, "If this fever is the embodiment of your sorrows then I shall bear every single bit of it".

I'm glad that you have move on in life. The happy songs that we used to listen became sad and emotional for me. Time cannot completely heal my scars, this is my karma for failing to fulfill my promises to you. No matter how painful it is, I must still carry my sins into my grave.

those people that say that getting out of a friend zone is easy clearly hasn't tried getting out of a friend zone with an ex :( how???
-
 
How do other guys ask a girl they like a lot out? What reasons do you give? E.g. Movie or study? Ask through text directly or face to face? And is it better to act fast? Many questions I'm sorry cus ... evergreen here 
-
 
 Both of you are not at the stage where it is expected to keep chatting. I would suggest you to keep showing interests to him and see how it goes after a month. If nothing improves, then have a talk with him and see how it goes? Hope that it works out for you guys!

P.S. It is a good sign to be able to meet once a week even for a short dinner. It means that he is making an effort to squeeze time out for you and he did that every week.

Every time I think about wanting a girlfriend, I remind myself that even if I did have a girlfriend, I'd probably not even have the time to spend with her. I remind myself that I just probably want one just so that I know I have one. Allow me to explain.

I realise I have a kind of possessive behaviour when I think about the things I did when I was younger. A very good example would be when my mom hid my gameboy because I was starting to get addicted to it, I would scour the entire house just to find it and when I found it, I would return to doing whatever I was supposed to do. I wouldn't play with it but I love the feeling that I know where it is with utter certainty and that I could choose to play with it whenever I wanted to. But I never would...

Back to the present, I think I am currently experiencing the same feeling. I want a girlfriend just for the heck of it, to know that I have someone to talk to if I ever get lonely or bored, to know that there is someone that would go out with me if I wanted company. But I never would... or would I? Maybe I would since the circumstances are different but as of right now, I will never know.
-
 
I have a friend who's making her bf pay for everything she wants (dates, stuff she buys like  bags, clothes, makeup, etc). But the thing is...she doesn't love him back. And yet she keeps telling me how lucky he is to have her as a gf. (It's really making me annoyed.)
None of our mutual friends really approve of their relationship.

Anw I'm confused...guys, will you really tolerate being with a girl you like but who doesn't like you back, and who makes you pay for everything she wants?
-
 
Guys, if you like a girl, will you be interested in everything she says? Or at least will you care enough to feign interest? Will you be smiling all the time she is talking to you? Will you wait for her to catch up with your long stride? Will you try to figure out smt to say when there are awkward moments of silence? Or you just set aside some time for her think that she knows your heart? This is not a blame, I'm just wondering. 
-
 
I know some people prioritize work over love life and that does not mean they do not care about their partner, or the girl they like. But is there a limit to it? 

I've known this guy for a month now. We text everyday and meet once a week. He initiates everything because I dare not to make the first move. That's why I think I have the rights to have some hope in his interest in me. The thing is, he is very unresponsive with his texting, to an extent that it makes me feel like he just picks a random chat and asks random questions out of boredom. And he only texts me late at night, when I assume he has finished all his work. He's a very busy guy, he showed me his schedule and I appreciate that he would set a side an hour everyday to catch up with me. But when I mustered my courage to text him first, I'm always disappointed by how long it takes him to reply to me, or how short his answers are. As if he is not excited or happy at all.

When we meet in person, it's even sadder. He looks like he can't wait to get back to his assignments during dinner, and he always looks like he can't wait to leave. I have respect for dilligent people like he is, but it makes me feel like he is not that much into me. 

Though I repressed the urge to ask you, I really want to know "Do you like me at all? Or am I overthinking? I understand you are occupied with millions of important things and don't worry, I am not the type of girl that begs for attention. But I need some signs of confirmation, reassurance. I need to know should I have any hope in us and wait for you or should I just forget about everything and move on before I fall for you? I am tired too, especially when I am slowly feeling closer to you and the more I get to know you, the fact that you may not care that much about me is heartbreaking". 

There, I said it. Now I feel much better than last night sighh.
-
 
You made me feel something I haven't felt for so long that at first I couldn't tell what this feeling was. I only met you once tonight but that was all it took. In matter of hours you became my North, my South, my East, my West. And with your looks and personality, I know that someone like me doesn't stands a chance. Knowing that, a little part of me dies inside and I regret having met you tonight. But once more... just once more... I want to see you again.
-
 
He used to like me, I used to like him. We both know we liked each other, but we didn't happen. He got together with another girl just this valentine. We hardly spoke since, only twice. He keep asking me to get a boyfriend. He at first avoid mentioning his gf, then he keep mentioning he's going out with her on dates.  It feels so awkward! It feels like he's trying to avoid telling me about his girlfriend, but showing off at the same time. I feel down when he talks to me now.
-
 
How much physical contact is normal for two platonic friends? Where is the boundary between just friends and something more?
-
 
I feel like my past is holding me back from having a boyfriend. 
I'm green, but due to how my dad is treating me and my mum, I have an innate fear that any relationship I embark on would end in pain.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with feeling this way? I do have a few close guy friends, but I just can't 'see' them in that way...
I DO want to get attached one day but I honestly can't see myself letting anyone in :(
-
 
To the OP of , it seems like your BF has some other reason beyond that. Maybe he cheated on you? Perhaps you guys need to have a proper talk to iron things out. In the mean time, lean on your close friends for support. You are not alone! Focus on doing well for your FYP. You are worth so much more than this guy! Do not ruin your FYP because of him.
-
 
How do I get out of the friendzone if we've been friends for years? We ain't exactly those kind of super close friends though, we don't pm each other unless there's a need to. We hang out together with other friends, sometimes grab food together. It's obvious he doesn't like me because all these while everything stayed the same. But is it weird if I suddenly text him more, just for chit chatting and not cause I want to ask him things? Or am I too deep in the friendzone to ever get out of it?
-
 
Projects and being in uni have thought me a lot. Be thick skin. If you never ask, no one will help you. And if no one wants to take the lead and initiate things, you do it. Be the bad guy. At least there will be progress. Scared of being criticised? I don't care. Whatever I do, people will still comment. So why care so much. Be the bad guy with the magic touch to change things, instead of being passive and wait for things to happen. Cos remember, this is uni, and you are an adult. 
-
 
I feel extremely sad and can't stop crying. I lost interest in things I liked to do last time. Sometimes I feel like stabbing myself with a knife or hoping I go to bed at night and not wake up but on the other hand I don't want to die so early. I am too overwhelmed to explain why. In short, I feel lonely and excluded from social circles and feel like a complete failure in social life. I can't take it anymore. Can't  explain why. This is not a troll post. I genuinely feel this way. Perhaps I thought I'll feel better if I wrote it here...
-
 
After a date with my crush today, I felt that there are so many smarter things that I could have said. And I was slightly nervous around him that it was a bit awkward. Would this be a turn-off for guys if they find that the girl they like cannot keep up with their conversation?:/

I've graduated from NUS and I'll never date men who are still evergreen by the time they graduate. Call me shallow, but if they still can't find partner after 3-4 years, means they aren't good enough.

There's this guy whom I met on a lecture while I'm on a local exchange. Didn't take much notice of him until on the 3rd lecture, he started buying me drinks, which I accepted out of politeness. Few weeks later, he asked for my number. I gladly gave it because, no harm making a new friend yeah? We've been texting and he has once asked if we could go out for a meal when we're free. I agreed. Since then, we have been texting and there was nothing about meeting up for a meal except once when he impromptu asked me to join a group of his male friends for dinner (was too last minute and I did not know his friends so I told him I can't join). Can't figure out his intentions - does he sincerely want to arrange for a meal? Or, is he stringing me along through the occasional texts, perhaps with other females too? Oh yeah, our texts are irregular, could be a handful of texts in a day to just a few in 3-4 days. I'm not crushing on him or anything because I do not know him well personally except for his occasional texts asking how I am. Will appreciate if someone can suggest what is happening here. Thank you!
-
 
how do you know for sure that a guy has zero interest in you? there is this guy who used to be interested in me but as i was going through a really difficult time, i didnt treat him very well (not that i abuse him or anything of course) and now i think he has moved on? help anyone?

Social media and numbers.

People tell you - numbers don't matter. Which is true. They mostly don't, especially in the context of social media. The endless comparisons, mostly built upon insecurities we have about ourselves can destroy ourselves completely.

There are times I thought I had completely understood and internalised the concept that numbers are not important. Yet, there would be times where I would check my instagram every two minutes after making a post, and would get disappointed and depressed when the number of likes is not what I would have liked it to be. 

It's worse when thoughts like "This person has such an ugly and toxic character, why can he/she gather so many likes but I can't?" Then it would dawn on me. 

Ah. I'm the ugly one now. No wonder the lack of likes.

I know I shouldn't think this way. It should never be the case where your value is determined by such superficial numbers. I know. But sometimes, I would be extra conscious of it, feeling that my worth is based on the little numbers underneath my posts. On days like this I feel incorrigibly shallow and ugly on the inside. 

I wonder if the day will come when I can fully get rid of these feelings and appreciate social media without all these toxicity. Even now, I'm typing all these out in deliberation, with some hopes that I'd gather likes.

Ugly, isn't it?

Dear P,

I'm sorry I didn't send you those notes in Y1. I didn't think they would benefit you since we were doing different questions; maybe I should have explained that to you. 

I'm sorry I contacted you after you won that competition - it made it seem like I was "using you" for your smarts. That wasn't my intention at all tbh, I just wanted a friend and I thought it would be cool to hang out with you. 

I hope it makes you feel better whenever you gossip about me. 
-
 
I got dumped out of the blue by my boyfriend. He says he still cares about me but that we are not compatible. He says I make him happy but that I drive him crazy since we are too alike in our negative and destructive behaviour. He also says he is a fucked up guy and that it's him and not me. I don't understand why he would break up with me if he says I make him happy. He drives me crazy and makes me mad too, but I continue to try because i know we are happy at other times. He says we can still be friends but I don't even know if that means we will talk like what, once a week, a month, a year? I know that he must have his reasons for breaking up and maybe he probably feels loads better now, but it's hard to empathise with him when i feel so pathetic and alone. I keep checking my phone every few minutes for messages that aren't coming. And i have to cope with all of this alone in the midst of my preparation for the FYP thesis. I just need to feel like i'm not alone, that's all. It hurts to be abandoned by a person you trusted at a crucial time in your life but I guess I have no choice but to bear with it.

Why do we always love those who hurt us and hurt those who love us?
I'd like to thank this girl who came into my life like a ray of sunshine. 
You believe in me more than I believe in myself. You've always been encouraging and always cheer me up when I'm down. 

Recently, you heard from my friends that I actually have a crush on someone else. It must have been painful for you to hear this, yet you never blame me. I can feel you drifting away. I understand. It's just that I'm so into another girl so I couldn't give you the respect and love you deserve. 
You deserve to be with someone who makes you happy, who won't hurt you, who never ignores you. 

Thank you for making me feel special when I feel like no one will ever love me. I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you.

These few days I have been wondering, what is a life? Is having a SO a life? I am attached. But recently we quarrelled. The reason was, he wants his life back. I was thinking, the fact that we are together, building a relationship together, isn't this a life? It seems like, I do not have a 'life' outside my r/s with him? Well I go to school, friends in school, outside school, maybe sometimes people would ask me out, but I would reject cause I was having a 'life' with my SO. He said, 'get a life', I want my life back. I know the concept on giving space even you are in a relationship. But what is, a 'life'? Please enlighten me guys?

if you dropped a massive hint and you decided to avoid the person for the rest of your life but one day you suay suay met the person on the way home. instead of avoiding you the person smiled very brightly at you, will you drop another hint?

Hey you, I sent in a confession about you 3 weeks ago and even texted you but you didn't seem interested in wanting to be friends again. I've been spending a lot of time in the west lately and every time I do, I always wish I would bump into you so I could explain myself in person. I'm really really sorry I made up excuses when you asked me out. I really wasn't ready for something serious back then. Anyways, if you see this I wish you all the best in whatever you do.... :)

What should I do if there is a creepy stalker guy that goes to every means to contact you? I've already made it very clear that it is impossible between us, but he continues to contact me even though I've blocked him. It's getting very creepy and scary because the texts or emails I've received are all very negative thoughts. I really don't know how to deal with it and I don't want to blow the whole matter up.

It's very awkward if I actually reveal this to you personally (because it's weird, and on this platform, it feels a bit less personal), but thank you.

You've actually managed to do something few people have ever done for me. With your sincerity, and your genuine character, you have made me remove my earpieces.

Sorry if I sound or behave extremely incoherent, jumpy, or awkwardly silent nowadays, but I am actually very shocked and stunned at the moment - because, looking at the scale of it all, there is a lot for me to absorb (and even more for me to learn as well).

I will need a bit more time (hopefully, not too long) to collect myself. After all, you're a really unique and interesting person - the first of which I have come across. I feel that, you can make a great friend in time to come.

In case you're wondering if I'm referring to you... Pacman!!!!!!! ;D

What should I do if I dislike my boyfriend's sister? Should I tell him? Part of me died whenever I had to "talk" to her. I guess a relationship does not revolve around the two of us, sadly both of our families are involved. :( Sigh..
-
 
Is it true that opposites really attract? My boyfriend and I are poles apart and I feel we are drifting apart. He's no longer interested in replying my messages, as if what I am sending him are trash and not worth his time. Why is he treating me this way? Making me feel like shit. I really envy couples who have endless of topics to talk about.
-
 
To , I was the one who asked if she is your colleague. Somewhere in my mind, I had hoped we're talking about each other. But after learning you wrote 18250 as well. I guess not. 
May be you're the guy I really really like but you're talking about another girl whom you shared this deep past. If you are, I just want you to know that there's another girl out there who really really likes you too. :(

 You are dealing with a despo guy so you better make sure that you do not ghost him. I ever met a despo guy on the dating app and trust me, I ghosted him and it was not good. Because I met him on another app and he basically planned his revenge on me. Luckily I discovered it and "ran" away from him again. My advice is that you can say that you are not free on that day but do not suggest or commit to another date. If he still pester you, tell him nicely that you are looking for some other type and wish him all the best. You will want it to end on a good note before avoiding him for good.

Hi guys! I'm the poster for . Thank you for all the advice and it seems like the majority is telling me to 'RUN FOR MY LIFE!' and I agree it's sound advice. So now I'm wondering how do I tell him I'm not going to go out with him anymore? Be frank or make up some excuse? Then just ignore his messages or block his number? Thank you!

I'm quite interested in a guy but recently he sent me a yellow heartshape and even explained that yellow symbolises friendship... But he also started calling me babe. I'm so confused right now? Did I get friend zoned or not

Meet for coffee on first date/meetup is ok but if a girl asks to meet for coffee on subsequent dates/meetups then it is a red signal. Do you guys agree?

i am depressed as my crush disabled his whatsapp last seen.

Sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough for my crush. He's getting really good grades but my grades are really average.. Also, his parents are university graduates while mine have only completed secondary school. Even though we click really well, I'm not sure if we can become attached because I'm scared he/ his family will look down on me :(

Dear OP , it's not such a deep past. I only started liking her since Oct 2014 and nowadays the past 1.5 years just felt like it flew past without me knowing it. Maybe it's because I realized that my feelings for her never changed all this while. But I know a lot of things did change. It has been 1.5 years after all. Although she also graduated from NUS, I doubt she reads NUSWhispers. That's why I have never thought that you could be her. Since you are not the girl I'm talking about, isn't it better for you if I'm not the guy you are talking about? 

I still think that he is really behaving a lot like me and there is a good possibility that he may think like me too. Thanks for telling me to be nice to her. I think subconsciously I'm trying to despite the situation that we are in. Somehow, that makes me really happy. I think you should really try to give him some positive signals too. Show him in some way that you are actually happy that he is around. It will help. Trust me, I'm quite sure of this now. Cheer up and have hope! 
-
 
This goes out to all those who feel like they like someone and don't know whether or not to tell them. I read so many NUSWhisperers saying that they are scared they'll get rejected and such like... I'm just gonna say that you might as well do it. There's no harm done if the other party knows because even if they don't actually like you back, you guys really don't have to make it awkward y'know. There's really nothing to lose. In my case, I liked someone who's an introvert. I really didn't know whether the feelings were mutual but I just said it and he told me he's really thankful I said it. You may say this is a one off case but seriously, the time in Uni is short and if you really like them just go say hi, it doesn't kill you to say hi. You never know what may happen :)

I need help (serious question), I am here because I don't know how to go about asking anyone for advice.

I have never gotten into any sexual interactions before but I really do have a high sex drive and it is driving me nuts (I am a girl btw). Pleasuring myself no longer feels good enough, is it really wise to get a FWB? 
-
 
my friend finally broke up after 1 million or so lovey dovey photos of him and his gf on instagram. so now he has to manually delete all of them. so a good piece of advice is: dont brag so much about your rs online la. you get double the joy from posting them but when you break up, you get double the grieve since you have to delete them.

I'm in a course with predominantly outgoing people and social circle is very important during working after graduation. Ive been introvert since young, and its not because I dont bother to talk to people or make friends but I sometimes dont know what to talk about or continue the conversation. It's only recently when i started proper internship that i realised how much I'm lacking in social skills. I really want to get into the department but i often find myself unable to interact well with the people there. And when i see that they prefer to talk to the other interns who are more outgoing, I get really panic and disappointed with myself. I tried to be sincere and chat with them whenever i can, but it always ended up very awkward. as a result I found myself crying every night and fearful of going to internship every morning. I just want to hide at home. My confidence level has dropped really low and I couldnt even think properly for these few days. the voices in my head tell me that I've probably lost my all chances of getting into the department because people dont like me despite my previous hardworks. Even my mum says I'm very self centered and I'm not going far in my job or get married if my personality doesnt change. I'm really at a loss of what to do. Can you suggest any course/advice to build confidence or increase my EQ or social interaction? i would really appreciate any advice. Thanks

Has anyone ever like someone so much but things got into such an awkward mess that there's nothing you can do to fix it anymore? When I realized that my feelings for her is only being troublesome to her, I kept my distance and can only love her from afar ever since. I made so many bad decisions that I regret. I only blame myself that I got so blinded by my strong emotions for her and only realized what I should have done when it is too late. And even then, when i tried to make amends, the same emotions stopped me from even doing what i should. 

People close to me told me it's just an infatuation and I should forget her and move on. I seriously tried to. I ignored her, got angry at her, psycho myself a lot and I wonder what other crazy things I did. But nothing seems to work. There came a point when I gave up forcing myself and tell myself that maybe I should give myself some time. But it's almost 1.5 years already. Nothing has changed. I thought something did. But recently I realised I felt as much for her as when I first started liking her. What sort of infatuation last this long? Why, even when other girls appear in my life, girls that i got so much closer to, girls whose character is so much more compatible with me appeared, yet i felt nothing for them and still think of her without even wanting to?

I know maybe it's irresponsible to be blaming everything on my emotions. But what can I do when it's so overwhelming that I can't even control it. All I can do is to try to suffer its effects alone. I don't talk to my friends about her anymore. Even I can see that they are tired of hearing me talk about her. They have already say what they had to say. Nowadays, I see her day after day knowing very well that there is no future between us. Sometimes I just feel so alone and helpless. But I also know that I deserve this. 
-
 
Now that there is only 3 weeks left to my entire school life, sometime I wished that I have fought harder for you. I still remember knowing you since Year 1. We got closer, but somehow you chose to distance yourself from me, knowing that I liked you. We distanced, got close again somehow, and then distanced again when you left for Exchange. Now that I am going to graduate, I just regret that I did not fight enough for you. Sometimes I just wish that things would return to how they were in the past. Instead of the awkward silence whenever I see you. 

Certain things were just not meant to be, but you will always occupy an important part of my heart.

Dear OP , I am OP . Why would a guy get jealous if he is not interested in you? I wrote  too. I am probably in the minority who is so inept at handling relationships but his actions sounds awfully like mine and maybe he is having the same thoughts too. How have you been treating him on your side? If you always looked annoyed and angry when he is around, it may have caused him to withdraw to a distance like me. Did you ever give him any signals showing that you don't mind him around or even hoped that he could be there? Does he have even the slightest idea that you may be interested in him? I didn't want to hang around and continuously upset the girl I really care about when she could be happier without me around. Sometimes I think I cared too much about her feelings. I don't know how many % you are at now thinking that he doesn't like you. But from what you said, I definitely think it's not 100%. Maybe you feel that the ball is in his court and there's nothing you can do about it. But I think it will really help if you can show him in some way that you are actually open to something. 

That said, I'm really grateful to you and OP 18200 for hoping that there can be a happy ending between me and her. I haven't felt so comforted in months even though I know very well that that will only probably happen in an alternate universe where I didn't make all those bad decisions.

P.S. She's a colleague. I wondered why you asked.

Responding to 
I went through that last year. Personally, it was the toughest period of my life when I was just at a lost of what to do. For me, I approached my dad before talking to my mum. I texted him that I needed to ask him something and it took me days to muster the courage, preparing myself and playing the different variations of how things would go down in my head. It was bad, it was really bad, that is something I can tell you. He told me he was and I was shattered. I had to tell my mum and she went into depression for a few months, but things have gotten a lot better. 

My parents are no longer together and it was certainly tough to have to juggle with finals and support my mum through the few months. If you need someone to talk to, we can arrange it. I hope you've all the support you need and just know that things will get better. 

It's good to clarify and I am glad I did. My mum is definitely in a better place without my dad. I am still in contact with my dad though, if that is something you're curious about. Hang in there my friend.

Hey guys I need some advice. Recently, I've been chatting with a guy I met on Tinder, but because of my busy school schedule I haven't been exactly the best replier so we pretty much still don't know each other at all. After a few days of 'chatting', he asked me out, and being somewhat freaked out, I postponed it saying I was busy. After a week or two I felt kind of bad so I agreed, I mean give the guy a chance right? Plus he had a gf before so I guess he would be decent (not saying that evergreen guys aren't, there are so many wonderful evergreen guys out there) but you know what I mean. But then even before we've met he's already saying he misses me and wants to be my bf?? But we haven't even met! I really want to give him a chance cause maybe he's just socially awkward or just a really forward guy? And I really appreciate his courage and honesty (finally a guy who pursues) but I'm kind of scared too because what if he's a creep? It's really really moving really fast in his case. What do I do? I'm meeting him in a few days, should I just back out?
-
 
Dear  and , I just happened to reject a guy who finally had the guts to pursue me after 5 long years of being into just a "mutual attraction" relationship. When he finally made his decision, my feelings was gone anymore no matter how I convince myself. I waited too long. And I knew he regretted the chances he didnt take. 

So please don't do that to the poor girl you like. You can annoy her anytime but be nice to her once in a while amd make your intentions clear soon enough. Maybe she really really likes you too but cries herself to sleep because she thought you will never like someone like her. And so maybe one of these days, she'll move on from you without even knowing it could've easily been the two of you together. It's so sad. So please be nice to her. Trust me, I'm in the same situation right now being the girl in question. I'm almost 100% sure he doesn't like me because he always annoys me and makes me angry and even worse - ignores me. Back then, he always gets childishly jealous  of other guys trying to get my attention but now he just goes blank and only tries to annoy and hurt me every chance he gets. After I read your post, I'm now only 99% sure now that he doesn't like me. Should I hold on to that 1%? Honestly, it will all depend on your decision.  If it won't happen to me, at least I hope you and this girl (is she a colleague or a bestfriend by the way?) will have a happy ending. 
-
 
Does it mean anything when I feel happier being with my FB than with someone whom I have been going out with for a while? 

Don't get me wrong, I genuinely like the latter, and I don't really give two hoots about the former. But it just feels so good to be with someone even when I know that both of us are only in it for the sex. He actually treats me a lot better than the potential guy, just so you know. 
-
 
I have a female friend that usually asks a bunch of questions regarding school work and I always try my best to answer whenever I can. However, when recently, she found out about my CAP, she stopped asking me questions about school work, and even if she does (in a group chat), she would ignore them.. like wtf?
-
 
to , you perfectly worded my thoughts. Yes guys, "make your intentions very clear to her"! Treat her like she's special. If there's no clear distinction between how you treat her and how you treat your other friends, she'll probably think you're just a nice person and not interested in her that way.
-
 
hey , you are right. don't get involved. in the past, i hated my dad a lot and my parents would quarrel everyday (and i play dead all the time, and it became a habit). i even plan to revenge on my dad and the mistress.  As time passed( it's been 5 years already), i don't feel anything about it anymore, and i realized it's none of my business. Just, don't learn from it. if you need someone to talk to, you can email me or something. 
-
 
When should girls make the first move? I am shy but i know it is hard for him too, if I rarely initiate anything, ever. Much as I like him, I let him take care of everything and I feel sorry for it. Sometimes I would text him first, or ask him whether he has slept. Is that enough? Or should I take it to another level? 
-
 
when i was younger, i used to laugh at people who do silly stuff to hurt themselves (slit their wrist, overdose on sleeping pills or worse) for unrequited love. i reckon this will never happen to me ever, because i am smarter than them.
yet now i feel so fucking helpless when my feelings towards this bastard is just left hanging, neither rejected directly nor reciprocated. I am dead certain that i did not misread the signs of attraction. but it just stops there. i don't understand why. why do nice guys just fall miraculously on my friends, and i have to struggle so hard and still not get what i want? and furthermore he used to play mind games with me, making me jealous on purpose, what kind of reaction is he trying to get? he so twisted in the mind and i am so trapped. i wanted to end this shit so i kind of confessed and he didn't even give me a fucking response. I wish he would directly reject me and stop encouraging my advances, because it is really hurting me. many nights i cry myself to sleep because i feel so dumb for liking someone that is really not worth it.  other nights i immerse in my memories with him. this emotional instability is taking a toll on my life. my schoolwork is lacking behind and my friendships are breaking apart because of my mood swings. right now i really feel like throwing myself off the building and see if this can induce any sort of remorse in him.

Hey! I understand how you feel. So I am a person who does not have many friends, but I have a number of good close friends. Most of the time, I couldn't stop, just couldn't, stop thinking about what others may think about me. Even to some of my second degree close friends, I may really appear very rational and reserved and careful under every situations, so as to be cool and..be 'normal'. 

So I too, realize that this isn't going to work. I can't live my life like this and I decided to change, by focusing on myself, listening to my thoughts, and trying to be sincere to people around me, instead of being fixated on those unstoppable overthinking. So I took up some external classes alone, to boost my confidence. The progress is slow, but it's making a difference! :) After some time, a friend of mine, after we talked, told me that she loved seeing the human side of me. Then it hit me that, we are all human. Humans make mistakes, wrong choices, and so many more imperfections. Even perfectionists get criticized/negative comments by some people. So, the thing is, if I continued living, pretending to be a 'sane' and 'normal' person, I'd be boring, and lifeless to be honest. Try thinking that the things people talk about, will also attract and appeal to other people. Our qualities are liked and disliked by different people, right? :)

So, if your friends leave you, then too bad they step away from a valuable friendship. If you really want to continue with them, it's okay to compromise to achieve that goal, but remember to put yourself in priority. If they don't treasure you or your effort, then it's really not worth the time to please them. 

Keep holding on. :)

if a slightly tipsy guy attempts to become physical (like touching the shoulders of a girl), does he like the girl or is he just drunk? Let's say we have known each other for a while.
-
 
Dear OP , i'm sorry but i'm not on exchange. And probably she will never like me. It's too late for me to do anything now. Is there anything that you can still do? If yes, don't wait any longer. I regretted making plenty of wrong choices and not telling her how I feel. If things can go back to the past, I would definitely have done many things differently. I hope you would not end up with the same regrets as i did.  Good luck.

I feel so superficial that I can't overcome what other people think of me. A friend of mine heard gossip about me and he longer acknowledges me as enthusiastically as before.. In fact, sometimes he will just say "good bye" and continue walking away. I'm so upset.., The gossip was from such a long time ago and I'm a different person now.. I'm obsessing over this and Analysing how everyone treats me. it feels as though all my friends would leave me.. please advise me!!!

Uni made me realise that ppl can be so selfish and inconsiderate. Seriously. Taking hours to check messages. Not participating in discussions and expect to be babysitted. Want other ppl to spoonfeed. Not asking for permission to use other ppl things. And I thought in uni ppl are adults and know how to behave politely. I guess I was wrong.

2010. I had a stupid crush on a guy I subconsciously knew would never like me back and yet I did all sorts of stupid things for him like buying him gifts (even though he's loaded and I'm barely there). I was crazily infatuated and did the stupidest things

However, the dumbest thing I remember doing because of this crush was skipping meals because of my intense emotions and poor self-esteem/perception of self image. I thought that maybe I would be noticed if I was prettier and lost the weight from my face. I remember how there was this one time I didn't eat anything for 3 days except for 1 slice of bread and some water, and I still continued with my cca trainings and practices. And the worst part was actually feeling like I was finally worth something every time I felt light headed and almost fainted. Like my struggle was finally getting me somewhere. I felt validated when I felt the dizzy spells coming and thought that that was what happiness truly felt like. 

6 years on. I cry now because I think of how the bad times I put myself through and the love I never had for myself and my well being. If I could turn back the time, I would never let myself go through that phase because it made me a real mess and gave me severe trust issues as I grew up. If only..
-
 
I know this sounds stupid but I'm really worried about my dad having an affair. I don't know how to allay my anxiety and suspicion and it keeps eating away at me. I know some people say you shouldn't get yourself involved in your parents' issues but I know my mom is more emotionally vulnerable than she will let herself be seen. So i really wish my dad isn't having an affair. I really dont like snooping around into his call records and texts but I find myself doing it more and more recently. Advice please.

To  
I feel that you should go ahead and pursue her :) what is past is past, so don't bring it into your present & possibly future w her.
From the way how you don't wish to repeat the "happenings" with her, you obviously care about her.
Perhaps the reason why she had shown less interest is becos she may feel that you're not serious about her, or even seeing her as a fling like the wild girls in the past (if you had told her about them). So be more obvious about what you want with her, more clear that you're interested in her. 
And if she doesn't like you, it will show (extreme slow replies or ignore msges, reject going out, try to avoid you etc). 
If she likes you, it also will show (willing to go out, reply your msges quickly, cares about you etc). 
If she doesn't like you, at least you tried your best to chase her anyway :) 
If she likes you, all the best!

To all the couples out there, how well did you know your SO before officially getting together? Like did you already know his/her likes, dislikes, interests, bad and good habits etc etc.?  I'm thinking of confessing to this guy i really like (after exams of course), but i was just thinking it through and i realized i don't know him that well yet. I mean we do text a lot, like almost everyday and even gone out together on a 1-1 basis a couple of times, but I feel i haven't really connected with him on a personal level yet.  do you think i should get to know him better first? or perhaps wait for him to show similar interest back? Any advice? (and yes i'm evergreen!)
-
 

1) She may genuinely be busy 
2) It's a good sign if she continues the convo
3) Go to her if she doesn't go to you. For instance saying that you are around her area and maybe can meet for dinner or supper?

She sounds like someone busy though. Don't be too pesssimistic. But then again, I had someone who kept texting me daily and always asking me out but actually does not have any interest in me. So... until it's set in stone, don't assume anything.

I've no dating experience, but I think I'm interested in my groupmate. Sadly, the last tutorial is over, and because she's from another faculty, I think that'll be the last time I'll see her. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say be achieving this, but I sure hope it's not a self-fulfilling prophecy. I may have been interested in her because I don't really talk to girls much. Randomly-assigned groups for tutorials really helps people like me who do everything alone. 

I think she's really kind-hearted and pretty. I will her all the best in love (for all I know she's attached). 
It maybe better that I keep these walls up, I don't really want to hurt anyone by dumping all my emotional baggage. 

When I had dinner with my mother today, I wanted to tell my mother how I wanted to give up many times. I dreaded going tutorials and lectures. I dreaded eating in public places. But I held them in. I think social interactions flourish only when the relationship is balanced. No one deserves to have emotions dumped upon them.

I know I would forget about her soon, just like all previous crushes. 
 
5 years ago, I found it hard taking it the first step.   
Now, I just find it impossible to take the first step again. 

After today, we're just strangers. Again.

6 months into NUS and I am very disappointed here. Honestly what I was promised differs so much from reality. For example, I have already spent half a year here in NUS but I have yet to have a chance to sit on a grass patch with my multicultural group of friends, each holding a laptop/notebook/sketchbook and smiling at one another. I came to NUS exactly for such experience, guess life is full of disappointment.

To  Don't you think that it's super premature to get together with someone whom you already acknowledged not to have a deep personal connection with? It leads to a much higher chance of a break up later on if you don't know the person properly first, presuming you are not into casual dating. Unless you're prepared to face a rejection if you were to confess first, or get a rude shock when you finally find out some things after getting together (which you could've known beforehand), I highly recommend that you do your due diligence before getting together with someone. 

That said, kudos to your courage for thinking of making the first move. As a girl myself, I would never make the first move because I want to know that the guy is vested in this potential relationship. I would at most drop obvious hints to gauge his response, but otherwise it's typically no loss for me if he doesn't pick up the hints. Don't really want someone who can't pick up on such cues. Call me a traditionalist for waiting for the guy to initiate, but at least it makes me feel more secure knowing it's two-way and he's leading it.

In response to , yes. I'm in a platonic relationship with one guy. We both mutually friendzoned each other so it's all good :)

It's been more than a year since we broke up. Not only did I lose a lover, I lost a friend. Sometimes I really want to drop you a text and catch up w you, as what I'll do w my other friends..but I'm not sure should I even disturb. 
It's funny how we turned into such strangers. 
I wonder how's your parents doing, how's everything w your sis and I definitely miss your dog. 
I'd love to be friends w you again.

My crush have good grades and it is an all rounder while me on other end have very poor grades and do not have any personnal goals in life. Even though I don't do fwb or hookups, I am afraid I may end up becoming the wrong guy dating the right girl. Regardless of what, I still wish that a guy can truely treasure her.

OP  , are we talking about each other? 

I really really like him. Especially recently, he's been annoying me quite a bit. At the end of the day, however, I still really really like him. 

"I guess all I can do now is to cherish whatever time is left of the days when I could still see her everyday." 
Like you, I can only cherish whatever time there is left when I can see him everyday, as our exchange is coming to an end. Tell me, are you on exchange with me in the US, are we talking about each other? 

If we're not, I still hope that OP will find a happy resolution. Maybe she really really likes you too?

Hi, would appreciate some advice here (no trolling please).

I met this girl 1 or 2 months back. We've become quite comfortable with texting each other, and she always replies very quickly and the replies are the kind that can keep the conversation flowing. She will sometimes ask about me e.g. "How about your...". We've been texting almost daily and we can text late into the night until she sleeps, sometimes until 3 or 4 AM. We've also journeyed to school together a few times and it's quite enjoyable chatting with her (not awkward or anyth). I've managed to ask her out to exercise once.
However, there are a few signs that she's not interested being more than friends.

1) she doesn't initiate the conversations (99.9% of the time). So if I don't text her for 1 or 2 days, there's not going to be any texting.

2) she doesn't say goodnight unless I catch her at the exact moment when she's about to sleep. But if she doesn't say goodnight, she will just continue the convo the next morning.

3) I've jioed her twice to go out for movies/a meal but so far she's been busy, and she doesn't offer to reschedule.

4) Once, she did say she would likely be free for a meal, but the night before she gave some reason on why she couldn't make it.

5) I haven't had much luck asking her out to exercise again (tried 3 or 4 times). Mainly because she's busy (doesn't reschedule).

In a nutshell, if I don't initiate anything (texting or jioing her out for anyth), nothing's going to happen. Basically I feel like I won't be missed if I just disappear.

I'm more of a pessimist so if I'm to analyze her behaviour I would say she's 90% not interested to be anything more than friends. However, my friends tell me there are some good signs (e.g. the texting) and tell me not to give up yet (maybe this is her busy sem, maybe she's the independent kind).

I'm really confused and also emotionally getting fatigued from trying to guess the situation. Also, there's a limit to how many times you keep asking without being a creep. Should I find out from her directly and move on if she's not interested?

Would appreciate some advice (especially from girls who have had similar experience/fit the profile).

Thanks a lot!

I dread crawling out of bed, putting a mask on my face, and pretending everything is okay when I'm breaking apart inside. Sometimes, I fear that if I take it off, I will completely fall apart.

I've lost count of the number of times I silently cried myself to sleep. I've lost count of the times I felt like home was nothing better than a field full of landmines, whereby saying/doing a trivial mistake will set of a series of events that ends in a big fight.

And I'm tired. Tired of faking a smile, tired of hearing that I'm "stupid", tired of studying because I just have no more energy to deal with it anymore. And then there's the financial and health situations I wish I don't have to face... *sighs* 

Thanks for listening to this rant of mine, just had to get it off my chest :(
Just one more thing...
If someone you see is withdrawn, quiet, or awkward, please don't judge them negatively simply based on what you see on the surface. You don't know what scars they may be hiding.

To  Dear confused guy, I sound very much like the girl in question since I seem to exhibit similar traits to hers, but I can assure you that I'm not her. 

For starters, make your intentions very clear to her i.e. that you see a potential relationship from this and you're serious about it etc. Don't use ambiguous language to let her guess your intentions because that just adds to the fluff. Definitely sound her out by asking her directly how she feels about you since this is the best way of finding out than play guessing games by yourself. 

If she is lukewarm about it or unsure, I think you should mentally set a time frame for yourself (e.g. 3 months etc) on how long you can keep going at this. Once the time is up and there is no palpable progress you know it's time to move on.

However, don't become threatening/ coercive/ passive-aggressive, thinking that you can instigate some kind of action from her. Give her space, be encouraging, genuine, and constantly tell her what lies on the other side with you around so that she can feel thrilled at the prospect of being with you. Do not over-promise, though. Allow her to see that your presence adds value to her life and that your company is sweeter than her solitude. Lead her but don't make decisions for her. It is also okay to be the last person to say something in your conversations. It is an ego thing for the girl. 

For myself, it's a really weird phenomenon how I gravitate towards being (extra) passive towards someone whom I feel has a romantic interest in me just to see how much he wants it. I recognise that it's a bad habit but I just can't help myself. I want to know that he has the balls to take the initiative and that he wants this (me) a lot. Unfortunately, this passiveness can also translate to my not wanting a relationship very much with said person. I am currently trying to be more upfront about my thoughts and feelings when chased so that he doesn't waste his time but it's hard. Girls love being adored and to an extent, worshipped. 

I find that I am usually quite fast in deciding whether I could potentially be with someone. Any further conversations/time spent normally affirm my initial suspicions. Some girls can be moved with more persistence and sincerity, but it is difficult to overcome the first gut feelings, especially for me. Indeed, your friends are right that the texting could be a positive sign; I honestly wouldn't bother if I had zero interest, but take this with a huge pinch of salt. The premium is on getting her to actually hang out with you more.  

Good luck :)

Is it possible for text someone all day, every day, and not fall in love? Has any platonic friends managed so?

Would you be comfortable with your gf texting her ex?

Anyone else hovering on whether to get together with someone you already have *something special* going on with? It seems like I'm waiting for something to push me over the edge considering that I'm evergreen.. Love is truly a decision/gamble and I feel really scared knowing that if I go ahead to pick this person it means that I'm actively choosing to forgo potential (better) choices, taking me back to square one because I'm indecisive af. The analysis paralysis IS REAL. 

The people I meet get increasingly better but there has to be that someone who feels like THIS IS IT (or is it?) I did sound him out to see what he thought about the possibility of my not wanting to enter a relationship with him, partly to gauge his response and assess how I felt about his reaction. All he said was that I was free to go, but if I see the world and decide that there is no one better, please remember him and come back to his side. I've never regretted anyone I rejected before but I want to make a decision before the tables turn on me :( 

Truly, there are many things we would throw away if we were not afraid others would pick them up.

first night: 
I cried in the shower and I had never cried so hard before. Suddenly all of the love songs were about you. Suddenly the colour of my world was washed away. 

First week: 
I no longer received messages from you. I no longer studied with you. I no longer walked with you. 

First month:
I would see you talking to people and I would watch you by the sidelines. My heart still yearned for you. 

Second month:
Exam time came and you talked to me again. I was over the moon. I missed you. But then I realised you just needed help. I was disappointed and heart broken again 

Third month: 
School finished. I was not able say my final goodbye to you. I cried that night, because I knew I would never see you again 

Fourth month: 
I would religiously check my social platforms to see if I could find you, to see what you have been up to. 

Fifth month( present)
I am still constantly thinking about you. I no longer feel grief for my loss but I do wonder how life has been treating you? I just want to hear your voice. I was tempted to message you a few days ago but I know that our friendship is beyond reparable. I am sad. Bye bye? But I don't want to say goodbye. 

Sixth month (future) 
Will we ever meet again? Will I forget about you? Will I ever stop missing you? 
-
 
 I kinda feel you on this. There's this person who always teases me about what I post publicly but never bothers to add me on my fb/ig much less send me a message on those platforms. There is much to be gained from being direct- maybe you can ask him casually why he doesn't add you on ig or maybe if you aren't already following him on ig ask him for his ig nick.

As for me, I prefer not to wilt in an ocean of what ifs so I leave lukewarm dudes be...sometimes some people just get high on feeling noticed/ feeling like someone is interested in them. Jy babe!

when a guy tried to chase you but you aren't sure of your feelings (whether u r interested or not), is it fair for the guy to continue to chase you or ask the guy to give up (for wasting his time, if in the end, you end up not liking the guy). I'm lost AF.
-
 
To the guy who cheated on my friend and friend's friend simultaneously, and had at least one other girl on the side and told them all to keep it hush hush so you could keep your single image and still went on to cheat again after being discovered and forgiven, you are a lying manipulative psychopath, and while you conveniently unfriended all of us in the know, some day your spots will show themselves to your future sets of girls.

How do people find fwb? I mean, how would i know if my friend is willing to be my fwb? I cant possibly just go to her and ask her directly.... Can someone pls advice thanks

It's so sad when that very person you really want to impress with your job only see your mistakes. Even if I try really hard, I never once heard a single compliment. May be I'm really not good, but can't he at least see that I'm trying?

It has been exactly two years since I last saw my ex. Today, I saw someone that look like him. Although it was just a back view, i didn't dare to summon enough courage to see his face. In fact, my heart beat increased. Why? Is this a sign of me not moving on from the past (I thought I did move on) or am I just afraid of seeing him because of our past? I need to get this off my chest because I'm currently dating my present bf and I'm not sure why do I still experience such thing. Is it even normal?

Will girls date a broken guy? Broken as in a guy who has low self esteem after many failed relationships.

Hey y'all, how do we know a guy is "interested" in more than just you? Can we tell from the amount of time he spends for us? There is this guy who would text me every night at around 10ish to talk until either falls asleep. But he is not responsive, even when his reply is long and he asks questions to keep the convo going. And every week he would ask me out once, but always is the one who says "Shall we?" It's been a month now and believe me, he never added my instagram even when he has my fb. I don't want to play hard to get but i always hold back because I'm afraid I'm not the only one and that's painful af :(

I got to know this wonderful girl about a month ago. She seems to be a decent girl, not like the previous wild (though fun) girls I used to date. Not too sure I want to continue, as she doesn't show much interest as before, and also because I've been damaged by previous ''happenings'' with other rabak girls in the past and do not wish to repeat them with her. Any advice? 
-
 
I really really like her. Sometimes I get so emotionally affected by her, I don't even know what to do with myself. But all i did was to make her annoyed and angry. I did nothing for her. I used to get jealous over the smallest things but these days I just felt I was being so silly. I really shouldn't expect anything when I don't even deserve it. I guess all I can do now is to cherish whatever time is left of the days when I could still see her everyday.

I'm a girl from a pretty privileged background, and currently staying in one of the most coveted neighborhood in Singapore. In many ways, I'm pretty above average in terms of looks and personality, I do volunteer work and generally nice to everybody I meet/know. However, when talking to guys, the topic on where I stay will surface, and sometimes some guys will tease "Wah your family background quite good ah, your future boyfriend sure stress' I've not been attached before and I'm graduating soon. Just wondering if guys, do they get intimidated by the family background of their partner or am I just being over sensitive?

to 
i'm annoyed with my friend too. how do you cope with it? ignore her? I have been ignoring all these "love" nonsense she's saying all the time but i think she couldn't get it that i'm tired of hearing them every single day. she is kind of similar to your friend. she had a potential boyfriend from tinder(Z) and is hooking up with one of our course mate (X). always telling me every single detail about her and the X. X didn't know Z exist. she never really talk about Z though. She also creates opportunity everyday to be near X. I think it's easy to detect whether people around you like one another or something. I don't feel X like her , but she always tell me she thinks X likes her. I mean.. it contradicts right? if X likes her and she doesn't like X then why always floating around X. If she likes X, then why stay in contact with Z? And then.. it's already the 4th semester.. in every semester, there will be AT LEAST a new guy. So, I'll hear the story of the same guy for 13-20 weeks. Thank god she changes guy regularly if not i'll hear about them for the rest of my life :D like you, i have no idea what point i'm trying to prove, just ranting. Lastly, I hope she settles down and leave me alone. 
-
 
 omg hi I was the one who wrote the post about my best friend being desperate for guys! I swear your description of your friend totally sounds like my friend haha! Really wonder how to deal with her cause she keeps asking for my advice on how to deal with her guys but she'll just do the exact opposite of whatever I tell her. So annoying. 
-
 
I really really really like you ever since the day I see you at the welcome tea session. The only thing is that I'm afraid that I couldn't give you what you want. However I'm even more afraid of losing you.
-
 
I am OP of . Thanks for all the encouragements! Regarding whether if she express interest in being friends, how do I tell? The only observation I can describe is she seems aloof towards me when we are in group but normal when she is with me alone. She doesn't initiate conversation with me while in group but does so with others. She did talk to me when not in group though. And I haven't texted her for days now. 
-
 
 I am a guy and I feel the same way. Somehow in the midst of all the physical intimacy something in FWBs never feel right. Its not always easy to look in the eyes of someone you don't have emotional attachment to while having sex with them. And after you're done, even though you may be physically satisfied and pleasure you feel as though something is still missing. 

Only when you truly find someone who you have a connection on physical spiritual and emotional levels would you have achieved "making love" otherwise its just mindless sex for physical pleasure. 

Of course, some people irrespective of gender are able to compartmentalize and separate their physical and emotional desires though I believe this compartmentalization is naturally more prevalent in men (because of the difference in hormones released during sex by both sexes)
-
 
Just when I thought that I have finally found true love, she told me that I'm just a rebound. 

It hurts ! It really does! My friend tried to comfort me by saying, "aiyah at least you still got the sex". But they don't understand that sex is the least i care about. I should have prevented myself from giving in 100% of my feeling, now I'm taking 1000x damage.

Every night, I look through the photos I have of you. Once in awhile, I come across pictures of us and it always makes me wonder what it will be like to be with you. I go to sleep imagining that you're right next to me. Whether or not I'm in love or infatuated with you, I just can't get enough of your handsome face... It's funny how you think that you aren't good-looking at all. It's sad that you tend to underestimate yourself--and I can only wish to prove otherwise on your behalf. Sadly, I'm in no position to do so. Anyway, it makes you even more of a perfect man--one who is kind, humble, down-to-earth (although I think you're out of it). You're ridiculously talented and good with your hands (cooking, musical instruments, paper-folding, etc) and yet you don't realize it. You're dependable, thoughtful, funny and charming (even without realizing it).

What will it feel like, to be the girl in your arms. She must feel really safe. Some days, I really envy your girlfriend. But on days when you piss me off, I'm glad that I'm not. At the end of the day, however, I still find myself drawn to you. It's so wrong because we can never be together, but I just can't help but to think of you. Right now I'm just excited to see you again. You treat me like a sister, and I see you as an older brother. Some days, though, I feel that we could be more than that. If only we've met way earlier. Some days, I get the feeling that you might feel the same way--but I highly doubt it most of the time. 

As I was roaming around the streets this week, I can't help but to imagine that I'm walking with you. I can't help, but to wish that we can all have just 1 day when we could just completely leave our commitments and responsibilities behind and be together, with no consequences. But hah. As if that will ever happen. Either way, it would've been wrong.

I wondered if being in  a fwb relationship would leave a permanent scar on my emotional health later in life. I only meet him when I want to satisfy my sexual urges, but at the same time I grew saddened by the fact that humans can be so physically intimate but so emotionally disconnected. 
Do guys feel like this in fwb? or it is just applicable to females, who are burdened by craploads of sentimentality.:(

Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice.

A freshie in FASS intending to major in Global Studies, I chose this path against the wishes of my parents, whom wanted me to major in something more "prestigious"
like Business or Accounting instead. I was never really the artsy type but Global Studies seemed like an upcoming major that would be increasingly relevant, so I thought i should try challenging myself to do something that I wasn't that great in. (And tbh, maybe this is a stereotype, but I didn't exactly want to stay in the lab, or do repetitive and continuous business presentations throughout my 4 years in uni.) 

I guess the problem now is that I am feeling some doubt over my future. People around me kept asking me why I chose to study arts when my score was good enough to bring me to what they think are "better faculties", and my extended family just keep going on and on about how an arts degree is worthless. My grades just make me feel even more depressed and worthless, and I find myself sighing and questioning myself what is life (lol), feeling unmotivated most of the time. 

In short, I am just confused and don't know how I should go about life now. Sorry if my train of thought is random or confusing; I can't really express my emotions well in words and I'm just feeling sian now while looking for a place to write all this down.

Any advice please? )):

This might seem silly to some but this has been troubling me a lot lately. I am falling for a colleague, who is a genius. I am in awe of his sheer brilliance and love talking to him even if I know little about the topic. Both of us are committed in different long distance relationships (quite happily). But again, we spend good time together, work on research together and I have come to develop feelings for him. I am really lost now. I realise this is just attraction (on intellectual levels) but I seem to not get a handle on it. I don't want to ruin our work-relationship, and I am not even sure if he likes me as well. 
How do I get a grip on things? Any suggestions/perspectives on this.

In response to  and the comments that it garnered. I'm a girl who does her makeup everyday when she goes out or goes to school. My makeup is often light and done just right enough to enhance my features. By no means do I purchase all that makeup and wake up 15mins earlier to perfect my artwork on my face TO IMPRESS MEN WHO CANT TELL THE DIFF BETWEEN MASCARA AND EYELINER FOR INSTANCE, AND TO ATTRACT THEIR ATTENTION. I'm pretty sure most girls do it out of pure interest in the art and to feel good about themselves. I've worn makeup since the start of year one and have continued doing so throughout my four years here. I didn't stop even though I met my boyfriend back then (who doesn't mind my bare face). And to all those guys who commented that they prefer girls without makeup cos *cue reasons centered around bruising their masculine ego*, you can be rest assured girls who make an effort to look good won't be doing it for you. You do your thing we do our thing.

Does anyone with social anxiety find that they are really boring?

Do you feel like you have no opinions (brain doesn't throw anything up) and don't add to conversations? It really makes me think and feel that I'm really stupid. How do you "connect" with other people? 

I have never emotionally "connected" with anyone. I no longer break out in cold sweats in conversations but I feel really bored talking with people. I know I bore them too. Sometimes when I try to speak my mind, I realize most of the things I say are considered weird, irrational, plain stupid or non sequitur. Stifled conversations. Bane of my life.

I've always been stealing glances of pretty girls from a distance because I don't have the balls to approach them. I have the perpetual fear that they would probably think I'm a weirdo or creep for approaching a random girl especially since it's pretty obvious that your intentions are to woo her. I do work out a fair bit so I look kinda athletic and toned but other than that, I'm pretty nerdy looking and definitely not handsome at all which is gonna creep out the girl even further. So I do find it a little nonsensical when girls say they like it when guys take initiative to approach them cos' to be honest, it's never the case unless one looks like a stud.

@ In my experience, it's code for "I want people to think I am not shallow. Actual depth might varies". It does not really matter in the inital stage of dating.

Also in my experience, actually discuss those stuff are not gonna help building a rapport. Ok, let me explain: once you are very familiar with each other, like being in a relationship, seeing each other day in day out, blah blah, those topics are a nice change of pace. You can pass hours, and hours doing it. Occasionally you will fight (and hopefully make-up sex, some of the most awesome sex out there). But in the initial stage, talk about yourself, for herself. Personal stuff. It builds rapport.

And there's deep rapport. It's after you two are already past the getting to know part, quite comfortable with one another, find each others' company enjoyable and fun, etc .... This is when you break out and start on the kinds of things that happened in your past that kinda make you into the person today. Like past relationships, parents, familiy, etc ... Future aspirations, personal philosophies on love, deepest fear and insecurity, etc ... This is in the relationship territory. If you tend to talk like this, it has a relationship vibe to it. If you keep everything light and fun, it might be just a causal thing, a hookup of sorts, but once you dwell into these things, it's kinda an exclusive, love, relationship thing. It can be a bit confusing.

Whoops, I wrote a bit too much. Well, I've meant to write a small guide to dating. Too lazy to actually start writing, despite already drafting out in my head. I'll settle for shorter writings.

I read a confession a few days ago about someone's best friend only talking to her about guys and not caring about her when she needs someone to talk to. I really thought that we have the same friend!! 

My good friend does that too, she also finds guys in clubs and on tinder, and she likes anyone who pays enough attention to her. If the guy doesn't text her within 1 hour, she will complain to me so I hear the same complain every. single. day.

She keeps saying she is very low maintenance and doesn't know why she can't find a boyfriend (she just broke up a few months ago but already started looking for guys within a few weeks) but isn't requiring the other party to constantly text her, even at work, considered high maintenance? 

I guess I don't know what my point is, I just wanna rant because she just treats me and other friends as an emotion/love dump and complains to me every single day about the same issue and doesn't really let me talk about other stuff

- 14% of male university grads aged 40-44 remained single
 - 20% of female university grads in their early 40s remained single.
Do you take into account that there is a rapidly growing trend of women choosing to stay single?

 Well, perhaps, the guy may be pre-occupied with something else currently, maybe work? This may very well present itself to be an opportunity to understand the person you are with on a deeper level. 

When some guys are focused, they really put their mind into it - anything else might just seem to fade away (though yes, you still remain important, just not of the most urgent priority right now). 

If you can go along with the flow, and work alongside with the guy, well, I do feel that it will give you an insight of how the guy is thinking, and how he's really like.

Getting together is always the easy part. Working together and maintaining the relationship, after all the fireworks are gone, that's when things happen (no shit, duh).

To every girl asking how to get out of the friend zone: just keep texting him!

He treated me as a friend because he was with someone else, and I liked someone else in between as well. But I never gave up and I texted him rather freuqently, even chatting till late at night (the best!) I also got him to work at the same place as me during the holidays. I think it also helps if you have a common interest and hobby? Just be there for him and listen to his worries, and he will slowly look for you when he needs advice. 

He will slowly fall in love with you if the two of you interact on a daily basis.
-
 
Recently I got together with a guy I like. The thing is, it's getting quite monotonous and it feels one sided on my end. 

Is this because he has gone back to his 'usual', non chasing state but is still interested in me? Or is did he lose interest in me in such a short period of time? 

So confused and hurt.

At 18033: Thought you were posting my story cos of some of the similarities. Was told I was a "hidden gem and natural leader" in primary school, where I did reasonably well and went to a good school too. I thought I would make a good leader and took up many activities in secondary school, but after handling my responsibilities poorly I started to feel otherwise. It really put my confidence down and I remained largely inactive in JC. I started to struggle with several exams in uni, and at the same time my memory greatly worsened. It was hard to process or retain new information, which is a huge since my profession is really knowledge intensive. This made me second guess and doubt myself whenever someone asks me "are you sure", despite triple-checking prior, since I cannot articulate the full answer with confidence. More recently, I noticed that I was having mild-panic attacks when my supervisor asks me something I can't answer - my mind goes blank and I'm just searching for an answer without knowing where to start. It makes me feel really stupid that I suffer from a lack of common sense and logic, and I was told that I'm making my profession look bad in front of another profession.

Yet, anyone who meets me would think that I am happy-go-lucky, optimistic, naive, and clueless. In reality, I have not felt real emotions for some time; I don't feel happy, nor angry or sad. I don't feel loved despite having a supportive partner, nor do I have the ability to love. I don't feel motivation, nor despair. Mostly it's just...apathetic. Whatever emotions that manifest are what I deem appropriate of the situation. Sometimes, I wonder if it's just a protective mechanism to prevent myself from feeling hurt or disappointed from failure, or if these are initial signs of depression. It wasn't always like this. I have contemplated seeing a counsellor, but have not done it. 

Sorry that I (and I guess most of the well-meaning comments) can't be of much help. Just thought I'd share that I'm going through something similar - it's not self pity, wanting to be the best, or being too hard on myself, simply wanting figure out what's wrong and working on the issue.

To  I'd like to respectfully disagree. Everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - needs to take ownership for their own relationship status. If you're single and you want to find a life partner, take responsibility for your singlehood. Ask yourself how to improve your chances of finding a life partner. Are you putting yourself out there? Are you meeting new people? Or are you stuck in your own social circle of same-sex friends and platonic friendships with the opposite sex?

My friends used to tell me to wait for the right one to come along. Throughout my life, I've met many potential girlfriends. We'd talk on msn after school every day, sms each other after school, stay up all night talking on the phone. Some girls would agree to a date, some would turn cold and ghost me. Every failed romantic encounter left me sad for awhile, but eventually I'd meet the next girl and the cycle would repeat itself. Despite all this, I never really found the right girl, the one that I had confidence in committing myself fully to and who wanted to commit herself fully to me. By full commitment, I mean taking the relationship seriously (the goal being marriage) and being completely honest with me, keeping no dirty secret in the dark.

I grew tired of meeting girls naturally. Natural is too slow. If I had left it to nature, I'd probably be single by now. In university, I joined OkCupid and spent my free time scouring through the profiles, looking for my potential partner. Unlike Laoniang, I didn't go out on many dates. I only went out on three dates. And it took a lot of effort for me to secure myself these dates with these three different ladies. It took conversation and rapport building. Success! I eventually asked one of the girls to be my girlfriend and she said yes! This is my first girlfriend and she means the world to me. She's kind-hearted, selfless and I can imagine waking up to her sweet smile every morning for the rest of my life. If I had not made the effort to actively date, I would still be single.

Whether one chooses to use dating sites like OkCupid/Tinder/LOLA/Paktor or chooses to ask their friends to set them up on blind dates doesn't matter. My point is that people cannot be so passive about their dating lives or relationship status. Take some damn ownership for your singlehood. The statistics shows that the number of singles in Singapore are growing over the years. If you want to be passive about dating, good luck to you. You're headed in the direction of singlehood for life. Start doing your financial planning for singlehood.

Life isn't a romance movie, nobody is going to come and "find you" if you're going to lock yourself up in your own social circle. Put yourself out there, start actively finding your own partner and be proud of it! You know what you want, so go and get what you want with your head held high. If your friends jeer at you for being  "despo," remind yourself that these friends are not going to be responsible for you being a 45 year old single. Only you are.

Guys, do you ever harbor any negative feelings towards the more quiet teammates in your group? I do my part, raise questions for discussion and contribute new ideas, but my contributions are never good enough, so eventually I feel really drowned in the group dynamics if you know what I mean. I feel excluded and sometimes they do not even look at me when discussing. Is it because I am not bright enough?

Sooooo, when girls write "prefer to have in depth discussions" in their okcupid profiles, what am I supposed to talk about!? Need some tips on how to initiate a conversation to at least get a reply.

Do you know that a monad is just a monoid in the category of edofunctors?

I don't know what I am doing with my life. At 24 years old I am so emotionally stunted that I have never had a SO nor had sex before. The closest thing to intimacy was just a kiss with a guy.

...and I am a guy. A straight guy.

Do you have any opposite sex friends that you chat with everyday? And by everyday I mean that chatting with his/her has become part of your life. It's like a habit and you wouldn't want it to end although deep down you know that it will end one day. Is it pure friendship or is there something else?

There was a time when 恋人未满，那些年 , sounded so distant and unrelatable. But as time goes by, you start to realise that the lyrics are so relatable. Sometimes it takes just that one bit of courage to tell that person that you like him or her before it's too late

For all singles out there, don't seek and ye shall find. Just be yourself, make friends, and be open. You will meet someone naturally.

quite a dumb question but do guys usually use emoji in private chat with girls? i understand it is prolly just the way they text and there is no other meaning. but still i would like to know if guys actually use it to flirt or just being friendly?

Seriously what is it with people trying to steal other people's HT topics? Do you really think that others don't know what you're trying to do?

I write epiphanies and thoughts on my books when I read. Not textbooks, but like, literature and fiction books. Like I need to hold a pencil when I read. Please tell me I'm not the only one. I know it ruins the book and all, but it's cathartic and it actually helps me to pen down a waterfall of words. It's a double-edged sword sort of feeling.

Hi guys, there's this girl who I really like who doesn't really like me. We chat a lot and she reply to my texts quickly but sometimes she do not reply to my texts and just leave my hanging. I want to give myself some respect and not start another convo after that but I am finding it really hard because I like her a lot and just want to talk to her. How can I get rid of this feeling? 

-
 
Thanks guys for the comments, honestly wasn't expecting anyone to reply, so thank you! Yes I did confess because it's better to be clear. The feeling I got from him from the start was that he cared for me more than a friend (but not in a sister/bro), and was actually alerted to this fact by people around us. We are very close, asking each other out is not an issue. 

As for attractiveness, he told me I am smart, funny, pretty, friendly (the usual cheerleader stereotype). I feel that I should have no problem breaking out of friendzone but just how. He claims no romantic attraction but maybe he has baggage he is not telling me? We are still on usual good terms though.

How do I get a guy to stop asking me if I wanna be fwb with him, even after I repeatedly told him that I'm already attached and not interested? I don't wanna stop being friends with the person but if this goes on, something has to stop. 
-
 
I got out of my shyness and have the courage to speak to the girl I am interested in. Even though it feels like there's a great chance, I had to give up on her just because she's too strong headed (or probably protecting herself?). I am totally clueless how to even proceed on. Maybe leaving her alone is the best choice.

What is the craziest thing you had ever done to stalk your crush?

For me, I seen every single of her facebook photo one by one even though she got over 1000+ of them.

When I was younger, I always dreamt of being able to represent my country in the olympics. Coming from a family who had a firm sporting pedagogy; My dad represented Singapore at the SEA games at his prime, my Uncle represented Singapore at the Asian Games. My older Brother is currently still in the national team. Growing up in such a family, it was inevitable that I also concentrated a lot on sports since I was young. When I was 9, my coach and others around me were already commenting on my talent in the sport. 
Everyone all said that I could go far with the talent I had. I trained hard. I was disciplined. As I grew older, I won everything there was to win at age-group level competitions. I proceeded to represent my country at age group level against the ASEAN countries, and did well there too. My school recognised my achievements. I went on stage multiple times to receive awards and medals I won from competitions. I didn't become complacent, instead I worked even harder. My ultimate goal was to to represent Singapore at the Olympics. It was only 2010 and I was only 16 years old, but I already had a goal in sight then: Rio 2016. I really felt I could do it. 

Then, when things were progressing so smoothly, everything came crashing down.  Due to a freak accident which I shall not describe here avoid revealing my identity, I tore my ACL. For those of you who don't know, an ACL tear is one of the worst injuries that could befall a sportsman, an absolute nightmare. It was not a minor or  partial tear. It was a complete tear. I required an operation. Recovery would take at least a year and half. Even after that,  the doctor said that it would be extremely difficult for me for me to reach the level I was before my injury. The mental trauma of such an injury, he said, would scar me for life. 

Regardless, I tried my best to recuperate and recover. It was a painful and long  road towards recovery. But I never recovered eventually. Although I was "cleared" to be able to play my sport again after what seemed like an eternity, my performances were nowhere near the level it was before my injury. I tried, I did try. For 2 years after my injury I tried. But I couldn't even get a look in to the national team anymore. I faded into obscurity and I quit the sport shortly after I enlisted. During NS, I withdrew into my shell, suffered bouts of depression and started to binge-eat to drown my pain. I grew fat and unrecognisable from what I was before my injury. It was a painful two years of NS for me but the passage of time eventually helped me to recover, albeit not completely. All this time, my parents and brother were supportive of me. But the more they showed their support for me, the more ashamed I felt and my mental state worsened as a result. I kept all my issues to myself all this while, and my family still doesn't know of it even till know. 

Fast forward to the present. I'm just a unknown fat low-esteem student studying in a mediocre faculty. I have no friends. Girls shun me because I'm fat and sweating all the time. Guys think I'm weird. No one knows about my past. 
How I wish I could rewind time and go back to the past before my injury. Before my life ended.

To , yes I got out of the friend zone.Here's how you do it. Have a personal connection with the person you have in mind. Talk about important stuff that's close to the heart like family and deep thoughts. Talk about smart people things like philosophy and shit. Then, when thats established, text them more often. Have lunch, just the two of you. Go do things that both of you like. Show how confident you are, how attractive you are. It took a while for me but finally managed to get this dude who was wayyyy out of my league to date me. Flirt a little, be secretive a little. Then BOOM. You're in bed together. However, it came at a cost. Our mutual Friend really hated it and we no longer talk but ayy whatever right? 

All da best!
-
 
 hey, I got out of the friendzone (honesty hate that word though)  :)  it happens, don't worry! But it's very important that you try to get over your feelings for him while remaining friends. Sounds impossible? It might be. But the thing is you learn how to be without the guy, learn to accept yourself and be comfortable around him. 
It also took a lot of communication between us both before we really got close after a huge misunderstanding, and slowly grew even closer over a few months. So have hope!

 I feel you man. 

I picked up a sport in JC and played for almost 6 years before injury derailed everything. Well, I was only ever an amateur at my sport at my peak, but I had dreams and I had passion too. One year ago I tore my left ACL - complete tear too. Had it reconstructed and went through physiotherapy religiously. Plenty of "suggestion" from my parents that I give up this sport for good. But 7 months later I was overly optimistic, I was impatient, and I went to play a match. Guess what, I partially tore the graft and a bit of meniscus too. So I decided to lay off for a while longer. So this year I thought, perhaps I can start again slowly, and so I did. Going back to light trainings once a week, and everything was going well for a few weeks. But life sucks and shit happens. Three weeks ago I tore my right ACL at a training. While I was slightly mentally prepared that I could possibly tear the left again, this was completely unexpected and I am beyond devastated. And I still had to contend with I-told-you-so's from my parents, which I have to quietly suck up because they're footing my bills.

What's my point here? I don't really know. I can't offer anything actually useful. I too know that sympathy and well wishes don't heal ACLs. I won't pretend that everything's going to be fine - it's not. Having something that has been a major part of your life suddenly taken away hurts like hell. In my quiet moments the rage and the feeling of helplessness consumes me. I guess if you were or are still passionate about your sport, you could still play it recreationally or maybe even coach; I reckon you still have at least 1.5 good ACLs. Me, I'm out for good. With or without surgery for the right ACL, the risk is way too high for me to ever play again at any level. 

I could've made it big. I also could've remained mediocre. But now I will never know.

Hey! Oh my gosh, I always wonder that I'm alone at this. I always question why would I even feel nervous during group discussion when it's supposed to be informal, somewhat getting to know each other, yet I feel utterly uneasy when I want to voice out my opinions.

You're not alone in this. :) Yes, I believe it's largely due to low self-esteem. We are not confident in ourselves. However, I feel that, say in a group discussion.

(1) It is really not necessary to voice out opinions just because everyone else is doing that. We may take time to think and that's alright, it's not like we're slacking. We're just processing the thoughts until we are certain about them before suggesting it out loud.

(2) Which brings me to the next point. When you want to speak up, do try to rehearse it in your brain once or twice real quick. Think about your logic and sentence structure. Even if it was a topic discussed earlier on, just bring it up and say hey, about the thing you discussed earlier, I have some thoughts on it. It really doesn't harm your image for doing that. :)

(3) Like what the commentators have said, slow down. One trick I find is useful is to keep reassuring yourself. Just keep thinking, "it's alright, I can do it, I'll be fine". This sounds cheesy, but I feel that when you keep thinking this until it becomes automated in your mind, it brings wonderful effect. :) Even if you don't have much faith in yourself, thinking about positive things could really help.

I admit that I'm still struggling in this area too, but one thing I feel is that we could have faith that the other parties would be patient and listen to what we have to say. Trust is important. :) You can try to practice looking into people's eyes, this really helps to show sincerity. :)

Good luck in everything. :) Many of us are here for you. :) Cheers!

Warning: long post ahead. 

I am not very sure what's wrong with me; from young I have been praised as smart and talented, along with criticism along the lines of laziness and arrogance. I did reasonably well for PSLE (258) and got into a good school. 

The first setback came in sec 1, when I failed a test for the first time, on math as well which was my strongest subject along with English. It seems I never recovered from that, as I continued to struggle with math even in JC. I got bullied as well that year, and perhaps that sapped what confidence and self esteem I had left. I transfered to another class.  I was an outcast, almost always alone. To be fair some of my new classmates tried to involve me, but I had become socially awkward. I had refused them multiple times. And eventually they stopped. I would have too. 

More recently, I screwed up my A Levels. I could not even attain the National average, let alone the school's. The subjects I had the most confidence in, I did not get a distinction grade. As a result I could not get even an interview for the course of study I wanted. My sense of self-worth dipped even further. 

I was in a UG during secondary school, and returned as a cadet officer in JC. OCS is a shoo-in, I thought. But no, I was let down by myself yet again. I got posted to SCS instead. I couldn't understand how certain people could get into OCS yet I couldn't. 

It was hard putting up a brave front, telling people the setbacks didn't matter, keeping up smiles all around. I had become worried my friends would look down on me. That they were getting tired of me. I wanted reassurances, yet I could not bring myself to ask. I don't think I would have believed their answers if I did ask too. You see, I just lost belief in myself. 

My parents almost constantly remind me of my failures. They would say "if only you did better on your exams." "if only you had been more prepared." "if only you had gotten that internship, what a waste." and while most times I ignore them, hurting inside, sometimes I can't help but lash out. 

It has been some time since I noticed that my emotions are numb. I do not feel joy, or sadness, or jealousy, or peace. I feel mostly empty, and sometimes rage. The emotions I display are those I deemed appropriate for the situation. And I feel detached from it all. I'm afraid of pushing everyone who cares away, if there are any. 

I have friends, I have family, I'm not sure why I feel so alone. I'm not sure what to do or what I need. And I'm not very sure what's wrong with me.

Bad slump bad slump always hits me this point in the semester. I wish to go for counselling but am reluctant because I don't know if I can afford it, and if I go will I clam up because its a stranger I'm going to be facing and suddenly all my problems will seem obscenely trivial and I will be as some of my friends have been saying "overthinking"? Like yes well of course this type of thinking is driving me nuts and I want to stop?!?!?!?!?!??!!!! Have been feeling either restless or totally not in the mood for anything except sleeping lots this whole week. One day I was ridiculously happy the next I was back to being a hermit. Please advise and I would really appreciate no trolling in the comments.
-
 
totally overthinking this shit but i need to ask this question. If you wanna give someone a gift but the person is somewhat reluctant to take it. and while trying to push u away he says thank you for the thought. i mean what the fuck is that supposed to mean? if he wanna reject me then have the balls to outright do it. don't wishy washy thank me and yet push me away at the same time. bloody idiot.

I know guys like to hang out with girls who use makeup and find them pretty. Sometimes I feel like I can't compete with other girls if I don't put makeup. But just a question for the guys, won't it be weird if one day you see the regular pretty girl bare faced? What are the thoughts that go through your mind and what are your honest opinions  of those who don't use makeup (during normal times too) at all
-
 
I need your help guys. I have a feeling that my friend is upset with me but I'm not sure why. We were really close last semester, like we'd message each other almost everyday. Then this semester I sat with him for during the first week of school but in the second week, he saw me sitting by myself, looked away and sat with someone else. From then on we never sat together and he was always with his other friends. I know he's not obliged to sit with me and all that but the messages stopped too. Also, when we see each other, we don't acknowledge each other cause it felt awkward. I'm aware we are bogged down by class but I was thinking of messaging him next week to ask what's wrong (since our tests and assignments are mostly done by next week). 

I don't really know how to put it in a way that shows that I still consider him as a friend but not overdramatising the situation, lest I was overthinking it (no one likes to be falsely accused). If he was really annoyed with me that's fine, but I just wanted to reaffirm (or hopefully clear) my suspicions that perhaps he is indeed upset with me. 
-
 
so I've always had a huge problem with speaking up. I'm absolutely comfortable when talking to family and close friends, but things always become difficult whenever I have to discuss in group projects or engage in class participation. this is especially so when I'm alone (without any friends in the same group or tutorial class). Like, the words come out in really short sentences with awkward pauses in between because my brain struggles in formulating a proper train of thought. things are okay in presentations though, because at least you get to practice. but when it's impromptu, I get really worried about my opinions and then my words will come out in an awkward way (coupled with awkward laughter because lol, tried to make the situation less awkward but obv it didn't help). as a result of all this, I find myself not really contributing in class although I want to. I think it's a problem due to my low self-esteem but I've no idea how to improve. please advise. :( 
-
 
Dont know whats the reason behind this, but sometimes is like i feel angry suddenly. Thankfully i have been able  to control it so far. But i am afraid one day i may not be able to control it. It may be because of violent games i have been playing, like dota2. Well, i stopped playing for a while, i have to say, it helps. But i still feel it occasionally.
-
 
it's almost 3am... And I'm still preparing for my tutorial tomorrow. I have not attend school for some time, procrastinating and wallowing about. I'm so behind on my work, and I might as well give up but I can't. I'm busy being anxious about what people think of me and I'm obsessing and obsessing over the fact that people at school don't like me. I've made so many bad impressions and mistakes when I'm handling people; I'm sorry alright... wo cuo le. 
I feel so shallow that I can't put this matter aside and properly prioritise what is important in my life.

Hi everyone. I'm evegreen and I'm toying with the idea of setting up a Tinder account. No, I'm not desperate, but things have to start somewhere, right? However, I still have some reservations. I'm inexperienced, afraid of meeting those with bad intentions, and well. Any advice for a naive noob like me? I'm a girl.
-
 
My best friend is kinda despo like she constantly tries to date guys she just met from clubs etc. even though the guys show no sign of interest. She'll ask me for advice sometimes but she never listens. So when the guy ignores her, she'll get upset and complain to me and I always want to reply "Told you so." but that would be mean. Also, she has started to ignore my messages and only text me back only when she need advice or talk about guys. And every time she replies my messages, she'll just say some useless things that makes it sound like she doesn't even bother thinking before replying. This got me thinking if I should just let her go and stop contacting her since she's so caught up with other things and we also share different views on many topics. What should I do everyone?:(
-
 
Would be graduating soon but has yet to secure a job. Am I the only one with this issue? Really worried :(
-
 
Why am i so awkward with you?!! 

So, i met this girl from one of my Y1 breadth modules. We became friends instantly because of the group work we needed to do and as it so happens we took the mods solo and knew no one in tutorial. Fast forward 2 years later and now in Y3, we still keep in contact after all these years via text and the occasional calls. Plus, we can text till the wee hours in the mornings, like say 4am or 5am! But as soon as we bump into each other like in NUS shuttle buses, or the walkway along FASS, or even sitting across in The Deck, we would always avoid eye contact and not even say hi or wave...

Funny thing is, then afterwards when school ends, we'll ask about each other's days... Its like when we are in virtual space, there is no barrier between us and we could talk about anything under the sun. But when we're face to face, we're complete strangers...

Oh well... Life i guess?!

"What type of girls you like? How tall? Do you like girls who like to study?" She asked me 8 years ago. We were in secondary school (4th year) then. "The sporty kind like you. About your height is just nice. It doesn't matter if she likes to study or not." I replied. I liked her, so I described her when I was answering. It was an obvious hint from her and I believe I dropped a hint too. In the end, we remained as good friends till the end of the year. Why? Neither of us made a move to pop the question. I teared for the first time when we graduated. I didn't want to be separated from you.

I was and introvert while she was outgoing. She had many guy friends from other classes as well. I live with $5 allowance everyday and so I hardly (or rather never) go to the city area because it's expensive to me. I felt that we were incompatible. Honestly, I prefer a girl who is quiet, like myself.

Ever since graduation I regretted. Even more when I we went to different polytechnics. We got further and eventually lost contact.Sometimes I still visit her Facebook page and see pictures of her clubbing with people, it hurts me a little every time. Not that it's wrong, but I just didn't like girls who club (Noisy place with sausage fest). 

I'm summary, fuck my life. Fuck myself. I once had a chance, and I missed it. You were the first girl that I am close to, and is still the last. I don't have other female friends since then. Probably because I live in a cave, and I study computing, and I dislike CCAs. I like to be alone but I don't want to be alone. I wish I can find someone so we can be together but away from the rest, I guess I am selfish.

-
 
Hi guys, I am just wondering if any girls had successfully gotten out of the friendzone? I read that most guys would consider dating their female friends and they are either attracted to you or not. I am torn between just walking away and waiting (foolish of me I know). How often do the miracle of "guy realizes girl is there all along and falls in love" kind of thing happen in real life anyway?
Feeling kinda sad now, would appreciate if no trolls :'(
-
 
 I would say it really depends bah. I come from some course where there are quite few ladies, and frankly speaking, (or maybe by nature of my course), the average lady w/o make-up looks quite pretty, actually. 

I see such ladies all over the place, and generally, I feel that they seem a lot more approachable than a lady who wears make-up. It's frankness on their part, and the girl-next-door feeling that I get when I see them around. I won't feel nervous. I can say and wave hi to them with a laugh and cackle, no problems.

Now, a lady who wears make-up, well, I look at it from a very different perspective - they know what they want, and take the time and effort to look good (like how some guys go to the gym). They have a lot of class, but they seem a lot less approachable because of that. If they ever appear in front of me bare-faced, well, I already gave my answer.

It won't really be weird, though, because I do believe that most guys can just look closer and see through make-up. I'm a scale-modeler, so I do pay a bit of attention to details (so I'm biased in a way), like how that lady I randomly walked past on the way to Arts in the morning today... Her mustache is smoother than mine.

Now, after the looks, comes your character - because if I feel comfortable around you, I don't look at you by your looks anymore - I look at your character instead, because at this point, you're a friend, so the demographic changes.

You're a friend, you're defined as, well, like that, it's a given common sense thing that I would accept you regardless of your looks. It's like... "Omg you're so cute!!!!!!!!" Uh... Ok can. Let's get a move on.

Well, at least, this is an oddball's honest opinion bah. Not sure about other guys though.
-
 
I am a guy who don't mind dating fat girls ( I dont mind dating any girls as long as they are biologically female and we click well) just that it is frustrating to be constantly judged by people. To be honest, sometimes I feel fat girls can be quite good looking also. I am saying this cos my ex was considered overweight and people around me including my family started judging me saying that I should go with someone who is thin. With all these judgement, it becomes very hard to maintain the relationship. 
-
 
I'm tired. Of always being there for you, of being so ridiculously happy everytime I see you. Everytime you tag me in something, everytime your eyes light up and you start telling me about everything that's happened to you, be it through text or in real life. But then I see that you tagged some other girl on Facebook, or you're talking to another girl on Whatsapp, and I get upset. Because it just reminds me of how you just see me as a friend when I told you I see you as more. And then your best friend comes and subtly teases you about us and it makes me wonder if maybe you're starting to feel the same way towards me now. Its ridiculous how much a random text from you brightens my day, especially when now, suddenly, we don't talk anymore. I'm falling into a deep pit, and only you can save me. My heart hurts, a lot. I wish someone would just assure me that someday soon, someone will love me as much as I love you right now. And that I won't be alone anymore. ): I know you're going through tough times now so please be strong and find the faith again because I'm here cheering you on.

I'm crying inside so much, but no one can ever find out. I'm dying inside, but I cant turn to anyone. 
I hate my life. I question my existence everyday.

You know what really hurts? Being around you, pretending that I don't have any feelings for you. Being there for you whenever you needed me. You fell sick? Here's some herbal tea and lozenges and tons of "are you feeling better?" messages. Nervous for an interview? Here's some comforting words and lots of encouragement. Issues at home? Here's my listening ear. Problems with your FYP? Here's my advice and help. Cute girl you met at a module? Here's my insights on the female.  You quarrelled with your best friend? Here's me trying to patch things up for you guys. Often I wonder if life is treating you well. But I bet you never wondered if I am well. I can only blame myself for being so foolishly in love with you. Someone who will never love me back.

It's interesting (this one's not about food around campus). 

Somehow or rather, I keep getting ads to get me to sign up for a fb account. I deleted my account quite some time ago, and actually, I have never been happier. 

Because I don't know what others are posting on social media, I don't constantly subconciously compare myself to them anymore. This creates room, you see, for a  lot of other stuff.

I learnt to appreciate real life interactions more, and i actually notice things around me more (hence the food stuff), and it sort of gives that... Sort of unique status that makes you maciam like some legendary pokemon - you can pretty much only find us offline. Though, no one actually notices when you're gone from social media.

To  and all other guys who think Singaporean girls are close-minded: 
I'm a Singaporean girl in university, like 

May I put out another perspective: 
I was using Tinder for a while back, for about a month. I had a bunch of matches and talked with a handful of guys. Being the awkward person I was, I didn't initiate conversations with many of my matches. I usually wait for them to initiate it. I mean I could then double confirm whether the guys I matched with mindlessly swiped right, right? Not to mention, I honestly have no idea what to talk about.  Most of them were genuinely nice (except that one guy who had to point out, hey your friend is cute. Wow, well-played!) 

Okay, so my main point is a few asked me out for a friendly meal/ meet-up quite early into the conversation. I just rejected them (even though I honestly felt bad) but guys needs to understand that some girls rejecting you is not that they think first dates are "akin to marry" the guy. There could be plenty of personal reasons by the girls, like 
1) they are not comfortable with you yet
2) they don't know you well enough yet (I mean come on, there are probably rapists on Tinder right?)
3) they are too self-conscious to meet you (I am not as pretty as my picture, I might look better in the photo because I chose the best looking one and no I didn't photoshop it OR the pictures I chose does not show my full body, my thighs are actually quite thick)
4) they are genuinely busy (like I didn't came up with an excuse that I have a project/test) etc. THE LIST GOES ON, just because girls like to overthink (or am I over generalising? okay maybe I am) 

And also, after I reject the guy, I usually don't ignore them. Unless they reply "Haha Lol" "haha yeah" etc and don't say anything else. LIKE DUDE, what do you expect me to reply to that? "Haha lol to you too"? sure! There was a guy who asked me for a meet up quite early on, I rejected him a few times (SO SORRY TO HIM) but, he was understanding and he continued to talk to me normally, eventually when I felt comfortable enough, I did decide to meet him (so no, I don't think some girls ghost you after you asked them out. Could it be the fact that you didn't talk/ ask about anything else?)

But generally, I prefer to have a bit of rapport/ common topics first before we agree to meet up. If not, it's really going to be a waste of yours and my time if we were to sit there just for a meal with a weird and awkward atmosphere. (and yes, I did meet a few Tinder guys eventually. The conversations somehow died after and no my replies didn't change. I mean the topics just ran out (guess I'm too awkward))

In my opinion (and my preference): I don't really like guys who are too buff. I prefer if they are lean instead, then again. I prefer boyish-looking men to very guyish-looking men because I go for cute rather than handsome. And cute is general and very broad, so good-looking is really subjective. As for social clout.... Maybe girls are just looking for guys who are sociable, I mean when guys are sociable, they are naturally easier to be friends with right? But don't some girls think that guys who have too big a social clout is bad as well? I mean for me I would tend to think that he would have a lot of friends to meet and he would be pretty busy (meaning less time for me and cause I would definitely hate it if I had to ask you to choose!) and not to mention a bigger social clout means more female friends (self-consciousness alert!)

TL;DR: don't just see from a guy's perspective. I mean well, the grass may be greener on the other side.. But how about widening your search? Like instead of just looking at girls who are that cup size/ height/ body shape/ etc basically widen your circle in terms of aesthetics. 
(Personally I do hate it if all guys started to date girls from other nationalities, cause I do prefer Singaporean guys because I think it's easier to communicate since you know Singlish. LOL. My English suck and my Chinese is worse. My best language is Singlish :( Then again, my personal preference is just for me, if you want to date girls from other countries, sure sure! Just don't miss the local girl who might be right in front of you.)

Recently, I started having immense feelings for someone taking the same module as me. It is hard to approach her due to our different cultural backgrounds and contrasting course of studies and I find myself misunderstanding the things she says at times. 

However, this post is not about myself or her, but about my friends. When I let my feelings for her become known to my friends, I was amazed by the overwhelming support I received from my various circles. I had friends offer me advice, give me encouragement, take me shopping and even accompany me to lectures just to provide moral support. I am honestly taken aback by their incredible unadulterated support and spontaneity, so much so that this transcends the typical Singaporean 'kiasuism'. Here's a shout out to all my 'kakis' for helping me with all my romantic woes. If you have recently helped someone out with their romantic problems, then you know who you are.. 

At this point, even if things don't work out between me and her, I am glad this incident has helped me encounter some of the most AMAZING people in the world. No one is more blessed than me to have such good bros.

Hello! I have a few points regarding dating in Singapore.

As a reasonably social male student, I have hundreds of female friends, and many of them are attractive, have great characters, are intelligent, friendly and have good values. Would I be open to wooing or dating some of them? Yes, of course. That being said, i'm not sure if its because i'm conservative or have high standards, but out of all these friends, I would only have an immediate yes to one of them, the reason being that I like her.

Someone pointed out that all the details don't matter as long as you like someone, which I believe is true. Love is blind, and despite all my extremely eligible female friends, I am not attracted to them in that way and hence I am not immediately open to dating them. Conversely, I am not particularly fond of a girl who would date anybody, since that anybody could also be anyone but you. I would like a girl who knows what she wants and sets standards for herself.

I guess one moral of the story is that if you have found someone who likes you and whom you like, please cherish each other because love is not easy to find. Have a great week everyone!

Hello . Thanks for your suggestions on why I probably am still single. These are indeed possible reasons for why someone can still be single. They don't all apply to me completely, but I know that you're simply suggesting various reasons in general, so I don't have to explain myself.

I'm sorry to hear about your experience with the ladies at your previous workplace. I have also been with good-looking friends who get a lot of attention. You sound a bit bitter about it so I hope you won't hold this unhappiness as you go about your life.

The main point I want to bring up regarding your comment is that there might be more reasons why someone is single. (I'm not talking about myself, but in general. Some may apply to me.)
1, Social circle. A lot of my very nice single friends who are nice to people around them, just have no one they are interested in their social circle, and no one made a move on them. 
2, Expectations too high. You talked about expectations of looks. There can be other expectations that become barriers, e.g. personality, values, hobbies, beliefs. 
3, Lack of interest in relationships/marriage when younger. 
4, Conservative upbringing, which makes one feel like going on dates is a huge thing so the person tends to not be very open to dating.
5, Low self-confidence/no confidence of being able to get married. Lack of confidence makes you restrict your own socialising, and you don't dare take action when you like someone. Also, someone lacking in confidence is less attractive, from a psychological point of view. I think.
6, Personality when younger. I was from a girls' school and a lot of girls were quite non-feminine and sporty and rough, which was cool then. All single then. Hard to attract guys if the girls are too boyish. Some are still boyish and attached, some became attached after becoming a bit more ladylike. Maybe this is a reason too.
7. Luck. Sometimes you like a person but the person doesn't like you back. 

I have a small problem with you mentioning the overweight part. You kind of implied that someone overweight is unattractive and unpleasant (correct me if I'm wrong). I think attractiveness is a holistic thing - personality, looks, character also factor in attraction. I have found an overweight person attractive before because of his awesome personality and cute face haha. If someone's weight factors solely in determining the chances of being attached, then this is pretty shallow (just like your female coworkers) right?

All the best to everyone out there looking for a companion. 
-
 
To me, basically everyone has different sets of criteria for choosing their partners.
For me, i have quite a few criteria like my future gf need to be... So, i think that singaporean girls dont want to hurt the guys, so they may be more brave and outright reject you, since they know that you probably wont meet their criteria. Its also quite hard to change yourself one. So not say most singaporean girls are really wont give a chance, its maybe due to reason above. To be fair. But thats just my opinion. One day a person maybe meet the right one, who probably can fufil like 70% and above of his or her criteria. Until then maybe he or she dont want to hurt the partner or commit to relationship.
-
 
 It's nice to know that Singaporean girls like you exist. But there is something I wish to say that might or might not be applicable to your situation. You have mentioned that you're in your mid 20s and still looking. 

Assuming that you would do the things you have claimed you would do, there are some possible reasons why you might be single from a guy's pov. Number 1, you might have offended or turned off a lot of potential suitors through your actions when you ere young. It sounds quite silly listing this as number 1 but I know of many Singaporean girls who have behaved one way in their 20s and changed track the moment they realized they weren't getting the guy that they want. Some examples of this include being very condescending when you're young. Again, you might say you were young and immature but these things stick. 

I remembered going out for lunch with a very good looking guy friend for a couple of times when I was young and working some job. I was completely ignored by some of my female coworkers whom obviously showed how shallow they were. Would I give these girls a chance now that they are older, less desirable and I am much richer and successful now? Not a chance. No one wants to be second choice, period. 

Number 2, actions speak louder than words. I think it's very easy to say you will do A or B or C. If you truly would treat your partner that way then show it and be appreciative of the people in your life. The word will get out, and you will either be introduced or guys will want to get to know you better. Already in NUS whispers, you can see it for yourself, right? 

Number 3, looks and aesthetics. I don't think guys are looking for super models nor are we looking for super pretty girls for wives. Just look pleasant and take care of your appearances. If you're overweight, lose weight. This will bolster your chances. 

That's it. My take, hope you aren't offended. 
-
 
 Dear Miss holier than thou, let me be clear. I am only telling the truth. If you're offended, so be it. All through your diatribe of words, it appears that you have missed out a simple fact. I am simply treating the very same girls who did NOT give me the due respect and recognition when I was young (and less rich/powerful) how they deserve to be treated. 

It's a vicious cycle and I am not here to act noble. When I was younger, I was quiet, introverted but thoughtful and sensitive. That got me no where with the girls. I focused hard on my life, graduated near the top of my class and embarked on a successful career. I have had many people, especially those from universities asking me for help or favors to get into their dream company. Some of whom include the typically ungrateful girls that thought too highly of themselves in the past. Why should I be nice? I simply laugh or ignore them when they email me asking me to review their resumes or if there're openings available. 

This is life for you, deal with it. 

P.S: No one really wants to date fat girls if they have a choice. If you can't accept that  then it shows how delusional you are.

@17872

I've been through this, and dated someone 12 years older than me when I was 19 years old. It did not end well. I was evergreen, and somehow a guy who was funny, able to drive, with high purchasing power was really attractive to me. A little similar to you, I like to build walls and do not fall for people easily, and was surprised that I would like someone like him (physically not my type). I kept desiring to meet and see him, for some reason. 

I was very opposed to the idea of us getting together initially, and only wanted to treat him like a very close good friend. However, he kept bringing up the idea of us getting together, and kept convincing me, and somehow this age gap became more and more acceptable to me as time passed. We got together, and he kept pushing my physical boundaries (we had talks about this and I expressed my discomfort but he kept pushing). I still regret everything I've done with him and wished it did not happen. We were also very different people (the age gap meant that our childhood/friends/lives were very different, and we were at different stages of our lives - me entering uni, him working). Beyond our "liking" (unsure whether we really "liked" each other) for each other and lust (maybe just from him), I don't really think we had many common topics to talk about. We didn't have a mental connection. Maybe I was just way too opposed to our age gap or his physical appearance, I actually felt disgusted when he touches me (in the intimate sense). He did say he felt like a rapist sometimes. We were together for about two to three weeks before I couldn't take it and called it off. Today we are no longer in contact and neither do I want to remain in contact.

Frankly I still don't know if he was just looking for a young girl to date (or easy prey) or he did take it seriously, but I'm in a happier position now. Perhaps your case is different from mine. Ultimately it is your choice, and I hope you wouldn't regret whatever decision you make.

To , thanks for that well worded reply. I would just like to point out that I was speaking in generalities. I do have close and wonderful platonic Singaporean female friends, whom I treasure and respect. 

However, broadly speaking, I personally feel that a sizeable number of Singaporean girls (esp those in local universities) are close minded and insensitive to the needs of others. I have many examples to write about. Not just my own but my friends. I shall just talk about one, my own personal experience. I had a female friend whom I was interested in, and we were talking almost every other night. Once, she asked me for help with her job applications - I was lucky, I managed to snag a job even before graduation. I decided to help her out and went out of my way to do so. Before you call me out on pretending to be a nice guy, let me caveat my response by saying 1. I don't think nor will I ever claim I am a nice guy, 2. As long as you ask nicely, and it's within my means, I would be willing to help, doesn't matter girl or guy... So I helped her out with her applications, and even went through some interviewing tips etc. 

Not so long after, I asked her out for a friendly cup of coffee. Instead of being mature about it, she did this "Oh, you're too good! You're too wonderful for me" with tons of smiley emoticons. It was so contrived and fake, and I believe many guys here know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. I shrugged it off and said "Ok, no worries, have a good day!". I thought that she was cool with my answer because she behaved normally for a bit after my reply. I didn't contact her till a while later just to wish her well on her birthday. But nope, not a single reply from her, she just went all ghost on me from that point on. 

And when you contrast that with say foreign girls, it's very very different. There are a few points I like to address here. I believe that you attempted to put up a dichotomy of sorts to somehow argue that Singaporean girls are more educated and so should be entitled more (?). I don't wish to address the second bit, you can feel free to believe that if you want :) . But even when controlling for education (meaning the foreign girl is equally educated, maybe even from NUS), foreign girls are typically more grateful and willing to give local guys a chance. Let me give one example. My friend is dating this girl from a developing country. He was sending her home in his car and in his car, there were some used tissues stuck in some of the chair rest. Without saying a word, she took them out one by one and threw them away. She said that's the least she should do as a passenger. It might not mean much in terms of dollars and cents but it goes to show what kind of character she has. Grateful, appreciative, simple minded even. Are those the traits you think are somehow secondary to "educated and pragmatic"? 

Btw, you would be right to say that it is completely within the rights of the Singaporean girl -as above- to treat me how she has, and I have absolutely no ownership on her actions. Yup, I agree with that. When the ball is in my court, it's also within my right to reject girls like that, right?  

Anyhow, this isn't meant to be about me. As I have said to my fellow Singaporean guys, go out and try dating other girls from other countries and do a cross comparison for yourself. Just be careful of posting it publicly on NUS whispers.. because hint hint, it's social suicide :)

Peace.

I'm only writing this here because this is something I can't tell to anyone I know. That's because I know I shouldn't be having such thoughts and I'm trying to fight against these feelings that I'm having.  

As I was having breakfast, I couldn't help but sigh and stare at his beautiful face as he sleeps. It makes me want to get closer to him. As I'm typing this now, he's still sleeping right outside. 

I met A last year and we became really good friends. I was really attracted to him and he really seems to be the perfect guy-cute, smart, kind, cooks (a bonus) and he plays the piano. Most days, we'd eat together--just the both of us even when our friends are too busy to join us. Some days, we'd tease each other as good friends do, we "bicker" and stuff. Some days, we'd  play with each other like kittens (it's a weird simile, but just imagine).So I grew to like him a lot. Mostly as a friend.

I really tried to see him as an older brother. I MUST see him as nothing else, but a good friend and an older brother. You see, we're both attached to different people. I love my boyfriend, very,very much. There's no way I'll ever give him up and we are set on our future together. And as I got to spend more time with my boyfriend over the semester break (we're in an LDR), I really found it easier to see A as a brother. Especially when he started to piss me off sometimes too. 

Last night, I DREAMT that A came to wake me up in my room. As dream-me enjoys sleeping in, I just pulled him in and we ended up cuddling in bed. And this is not the first time I've had such dreams of him. It's just really terrible. 

But I'm taking it to just mean that I miss my boyfriend very much. And it's just my head screwing with me because I can't control my dreams. But I can control my impulses. Anyway, I'm just writing this because I really need to get it off my chest. 

In a parallel universe, maybe we'd have met each other first. Maybe we'd be together. But I can't imagine a world without my boyfriend.

Hi , I feel you, esp when your parents gets super worried when you go alone :x
-
 
@17872: This guy is in a different stage of life from you. But more importantly, do ask yourself if you share similar interests and values as him. These are important for a successful long term relationship. If they are different, then both of you will have to talk and negotiate past these differences to reach middle ground. Finally, take this last piece of advice very seriously. If he happens to be your supervisor or professor or tutor, stay away. Do not make the mistake of entering into a relationship with him. 
-
 
Totally agree with the OP of . I guess many people nowadays don't think that way anymore. Which is why it seems tough to get attached...
Anyways to the OP of , if you dont mind maybe we can get to know each other? :) Let me know through another confession or something

This is a shout out to all the evergreen guys in NUS. I used to think it was me, and that maybe if I had a better personality, I would have been able to get a Singaporean girl as my gf. While I have gone on dates with some, it didn't lead to anywhere. I had more rejections than dates to be fair. However, after going on exchange, I realized that I was misled into thinking that being "unwanted" in Singapore means you're unwanted globally. Throughout my time in exchange, I was able to date girls from many nationalities, korean, taiwan etc. When I came back, it was back to the same old, same old. 

One thing I realized is that a good number of foreign girls are actually very open to date local men. They might even come from developing countries like Vietnam and Indon but that shouldn't be an issue if you truly like her. In my personal view, I hope I don't get flamed for this but.. I think that Singaporean girls tend to be pretty close minded. Unlike girls from many of the places I have travelled to, they would rarely if ever give chances to MOST guys for first dates. To them, it's akin to asking them to marry you, the whole "wanting to know you better" line doesn't fly here. It's how buff you are, how good looking you are, how much social clout you have. Don't believe all the tinder stories on dating.. They tend to be the exception rather than the rule. I thought I was having it bad.. but a lot of my single guy friends have confided in me that they were shot down pretty badly. And a lot of the time, it ends with the girl becoming a complete stranger, as though asking her out is some sin that you have committed.

To put a long story short, Singaporean guys who are still single, open your eyes, and be willing to date girls from other nationalities. You might really be surprised.

Reply to 
Ok. Here's the thing. I had really bad social anxiety just 1 year ago. I didn't dare to join any ccas cause I was afraid others would judge me for not being fit or strong enough, was afraid to eat alone, was afraid to be seen studying alone, I even trembled when I wanted to show my friends videos that I found funny; because I was scared that they would not find it funny. I was permanently looking for books like "how to win friends and influence people", "the charisma myth" etc etc, except that I would never have read it in public, for fear of being judged. I was afraid to go to the toilet during lectures for fear of interrupting others lr the lecturer.

Fast forward a year, I'm not afraid of anything now. I go to the gym alone, not afraid that other buff guys will judge me for being too skinny, lift too little etc. I can even have long conversations with complete strangers with ZERO anxiety (even if I don't particularly like it) I am not afraid to stand up for myself against the "alpha" or cool kids. I stopped comparing myself to others. I found my life purpose. And more.

You wanna know how I did it?
Hard work. Im in NS now, so every weekend when others were spending their time playing dota, watching anime or whatever shit, what I did was to tackle my social anxiety head on. Don't listen to the advice of others who don't know shit or hasn't gone through the stuff you are going through, or hasn't found a solution themselves. 

I spent hours outside, first, by asking strangers for directions, then asking them for the time, then slowly increasing the difficulty, to giving them compliments, to asking them how was their day. To giving them high fives. To doing jumping jacks in the middle of a mall. And more. And of course, this increased my social courage. I began to see people as potential friends, not people who'd judge me or demean my value. 

If you don't believe that such acts will increase your confidence and reduce social anxiety, check out youtube: ted talks: how to be more confident, lie down on the street for 30 seconds.

There's another thing I did. I am not going to post it here. All I am going to say is, you can read all the self help books in the world, which is what I did, and nothing in your life will change. If you are serious about handling this area of your life, I left my email address with the admin.
 
You can ask the admin for it and email me.

I guess I should stop thinking about my groupmates. They may ignore us, agitate us, talk over us, prefer some other groupmates over us or feel awkward with us, but they are one-time friend. 
-
 
Went to PGP's canteen to try the ramen which I once asked if you ever tried, but it's really just an excuse to potentially catch a glimpse of you. No such luck, and I was being stupid - you cook, and you've snapped your own meals so many times already... 

I'm intrigued by you, and I miss talking to you a lot too. Probably too much. Please stop popping up in my head at random times of the day. T_T 

-
 
Despite how bad I treated you and taken you for granted, you never left me. You keep asking to try again but I didn't put in effort although I agreed to try. Now you are really gone. I regretted. I have seen your instagram posts with your new guy. I wish you all the best. If time can be rewinded, I will keep you close to me and never take you for granted. To all the guys out there, do cherish the gurl that says that she loves you, even with those hurtful things that you did. Dont take your gurl for granted because when she really leave, you will never have her again.

I would like to add on to  

Im a singaporean guy and most people regard me as nice and all, ive had alot of trouble dating singaporean girls in the past largely due to the kind of expectations they have. I feel that many singaporean girls have spolit expectations, but it really isnt their fault. Guys in general have spolit them for all of us. 

Maybe because of social media proliferation and stories of tinder and perhaps even feminism, singaporean girls expect certain traits of an ideal guy, eg, someone who plans big birthdays and anniversaries, perfect buff bodies, perceived as cool amongst our peers, spend alot on her etc, which they have gotten before! Because it is relatively easy to fake these things in the short term, especially during the courting phase. Which is why girls want to "chase" to never end, or say that their boyfriends "changed" once they gotten together, and start to be drawn to new guys who seem to be more their ideal again(new guys courting mode). These guys havent changed, they just became themselves again.

I never gotten around to pretend or meet these expectations, i chose to be myself when i date, it was not enough. I often ended up friendzoned or end up in a situation where the girl loses interest after awhile. I always thought it was me, something wrong with me, so i started being the "ideal guy", i drove my parents car to pick her up, spent hundreds on her birthday presents, did "cool stuff" like joining parties and basically did things i normally didnt do, i was a douche. It worked, it was easier to connect with girls with my new "status", i dated afew for awhile but i realised it was an unsustainable lifestyle, not so much about the cost but i hated not being myself. So i went back to doing so.

Everything changed when i went on exchange, it seems Singaporean guys are incredibly popular and demanded amongst foreign girls. They often say we are not Male Chauvinists, we are more considerate and more mature than the equivalent foreign guy counterparts. They also like the fact we undergone NS and work alot harder to "chase" girls too. I personally found it disturbing how other foreign guys treat women, if girls ever thought singaporean guys were oppressive, they should visit other countries, even the first world ones like japan, korea. It opened my mind to many things, i also realised these girls were very realistic and not living in a constant princess-like fantasy. They wanted to find a guy with an honest character, who was hard-working and shared certain interests. So was i.

Fast forward, I met my girlfriend there and we've been dating a couple of years now, shes applying for her EP here now and we hope to get married within 2-3 years.

I dont know if im right or completely wrong, but this has been my genuine experience. I dont think singaporean girls did anything wrong, i think that due to many factors, their expectations in general has risen alot quicker than guys can keep up with. But everyone has the right to set their own expectations.

My advice to fellow guys facing similar situations, keep your eyes open, there are many amazing girls around us even in NUS, those studying here from ASEAN, those here on exchange, and they too are looking for someone realistic and honest.

To  I write from the perspective of a currently single Singaporean girl in university. While I'm sure each girl has her own standards for choosing a boyfriend, I'm personally quite willing to go out on *first* dates with guys just to get a feel of our chemistry. As long as I feel like we could have a good time and I don't mind being seen in public with him, I don't see why I would reject someone just for the sake of it. Not sure if you're being too presumptuous by stating that local girls are close-minded, but I can only speak for myself. If a girl already does not feel comfortable with the thought of you, I think the rejection for a date may actually be a blessing in disguise considering that no one's time/money/emotion is further wasted. To be an advocate for your side, why would any self-respecting individual continually waste his time on a dead end cause? 

It sounds like you and your buddies have been having quite a tough time getting local girls, but maybe the fault really lies in not having enough magnetic compensation for whatever you lack and your misjudgments cloud you from picking the right league for your game. Take an objective look at yourself and try to see from the perspective of a potential girl you target. Your mentioning that girls want buff/ good-lookers/ influential may not be misguided, but it is also in line with how, in exchange, you may want a hot/ intelligent/ chef for a girl etc (fill in with your own criteria) Each for his own really; not every girl wants the same thing and any girl worth her salt will know that 'perfect' doesn't exist without imperfection in this world. 

I might get backlash for this but since you mentioned girls from developing countries, I would offer my two cents on that matter. I would go as far as to say that perhaps educated and pragmatic girls are changing the tide for guys, in the sense that they know what they want and will therefore demand more just because they are able to offer more to their partner. People with simpler mindsets usually want less and are easier to satisfy. Of course there will always be black sheep everywhere and girls who just want too much for the little contributions they give and vice versa, but I'm sure you would be able to judge for yourself in those circumstances and run from it. 

Like you mentioned, after a girl gives a rejection she might become a complete stranger - this could be that she thinks you're a creep and it's too weird/uncomfortable to continue being friends with the wonderful you. Unless you are able to give a sensible, mature reply to the rejection, it will be awkward to keep such a friendship going. Equally, it could be the case of immaturity on the guy's part. Some guys I know have brutally fragile huge egos, so little wonder why being rejected would lead to two people becoming strangers. I understand that some girls just don't know how to let a guy down easy (which is NOT easy by the way), but in the event they don't, you could take it as their loss and a nice summary of themselves for you as a last impression. You don't want a girl who can't appreciate effort. 

Take heart. I get that it's not easy being the chaser.

So stressed/sad. Feel like messaging my (former?) crush, for just a little joy in the anticipation of a reply.

In the past I would have done that. Take a little breather in the toilet and send an sms/WhatsApp.

But so much time have passed, and I no longer feel the same, nor can I make myself feel something even remotely similar.

I guess the only thing I can do is to just stop being sad and be awesome.

Nonetheless I can see only two paths, in a matter of two weeks, either I'm going to get my act together, or I will crash and burn.

Thanks stranger for listening, and I hope you are happy.

To the people who say that success stories on Tinder are the exception to the norm - LOL?! Please stop spreading the doubt!

Apart from myself, I have three female friends in serious relationships with people they met off Tinder. One of the couples just BTO-ed. For my boyfriend and I, we're still saving up to get a flat but we're tremendously grateful for the app. No app, no us. We always marvel, "Can you imagine if _____ didn't ask me to download Tinder and ______ didn't ask you to download Tinder? We would've been strangers forever." The thought is horrifying! Can't imagine not having him in my life.

There are some amazing boys and girls on dating apps. If you try hard enough you might find a diamond in the rough. Sure, it took me many months on Tinder to find the one but I still found him. Dating apps are not for everyone but to discredit them isn't fair to all who've found love online. And to generalize all Singaporean girls as close minded?

" they would rarely if ever give chances to MOST guys for first dates" Hmm, maybe they won't give you a date because they're just not that into you? Rebrand your profile, or just continue fishing in the pool of daters. Some girls are quite open to going on first dates. I have no idea where you got the idea that "To them, [a date is] akin to asking them to marry you".

Is it possible to have a relationship when there aren't any mutual friends between the guy and the girl? I'm asking this because I got to know this guy from my tutorial group and we clicked quite well from the start. Since our tutorial is around lunch time we would normally have lunch together after class. I'm not sure how he feels about me but I definitely like him. A lot of my friends got together with their boyfriend or girlfriend through mutual friends, acquaintances and the like, so i'm just wondering whether a relationship is possible when there are no mutual friends involved..

From your behaviour yesterday, I have come to realize that you were never fond of me. Your actions though subtle implied that you found it bothersome to help me even when I needed it.

When I think about it, I realize that it may have been my fault. I must have underestimated the amount of energy required for you to bring an extra sheet of 70gsm paper to the department office, maybe carrying an extra piece of paper consumes a bigger fraction of your daily energy consumption than it does mine. Look, I'm not asking you to walk an extra mile, I'm simply asking you to hand my assignment in as you hand in yours. Such a simple request and yet you had to show your reluctance to help me.

It makes me wonder if you really do consider me as a friend. Maybe I didn't get the hint... I was never your friend, was I? Well, you can rest assured that I will NEVER ask for your help again in the future unless circumstance dictates otherwise. Even then, you will always be my final resort, the lesser of many evils.

Take this confession as the end of our friendship. I don't need you and I hope I will never have to be closely associated with you anymore. We may still see each other during classes almost every single day of the week, sit together and talk, but I will never help you against my own convenience as I have done before. 

My only regret is that I didn't see this coming earlier.

I really really missed you today. I miss you the most at my highest and lowest. I miss our crisis calls and silly notes. I just want to sink my head in your neck and cry. Today I just really needed a safe place to cry. But I don't have you anymore...so I'm crying on the toilet. Ya I'm a class act I know. And I know that you're probably someone different right now. Whatever it is that hurt me enough to have never returned your efforts to make up, I've forgotten. Is it true that time that burns everything? If only we could pretend that one of us had gone away for a while and-  Actually that day I sat there stunned that I was hearing you laugh. It was peculiar. But it will never be the same. Wishing you the best.

Hi guys, how do you tell if a guy is interested in you? What are some of the more obvious clues to look out for? I think he treats me pretty well, looks out for me and I think he is happy to see me whenever we meet. However, he also treats his other friends pretty nicely, and on top of that he doesn't really text me to chit-chat(but he talks a lot in real life). So i can't really tell what are his feelings towards me. 

I do kind of like him and want to give things a try.. But what are some hints that I can give to him? I think he can be quite dense so it needs to be more obvious. Is choosing to ask him for help among other friends strong enough a hint?

Please can there be more nonsense confessions like taped chest hair dude I feel stressed and increasingly isolated and I need the bit of ridiculousness when I take my online breaks #nota9gagger #noraredditor

Also I miss two of my old friends but by that I miss the persons I (thought I) knew then...how do you get over friendships drifting or cut off

 To the OP of that confession - yes, I find that PC/SJW culture is getting increasingly prevalent here too. And it's beginning to feel overbearing. Perhaps it's not directly related to racism or whatever, but last year, I had this experience that left a terrible impression of such SJW-esque people.

So I was just sitting at the UTown foodcourt, doing my own work on my computer and minding my own business. Some time afterwards, a group of girls came and sat at the table across from mine, and starting loudly discussing their group project, which sounded like something about gender studies. Now, that in and of itself isn't an issue at all, of course, but they were discussing so loudly that it was difficult to avoid overhearing their discussion, which at one point went something like this:

"... but we can't forget about male oppression of female expression! Because of the patriarchy right?"
"Yeah, the patriarchy is *so* obvious here in Singapore."
"I know right. Disgusting."

And at that point, I looked up, and I saw all three of them looking in my direction with a plainly disgusted look, as though I was to blame for whatever they were talking about, even though I hadn't spoken or interacted with them one bit since they started discussing their project. I mean, what the hell...?

I've been reading some confessions on 'racial preferences' when it comes to dating and I thought I'd share my opinion. I'm Chinese, an ex-NUS student and gay. I work in the military as a uniformed personnel and for the most part, at work, I'm closeted. I've to be for obvious reasons. For the last five years, I've been with a Malay boy. We live together now and like me, he works in public service. I met him on Grindr - an app gay guys use to meet other gay guys - and for the first week, we kept our conversation to within the app. When we finally met for a date, halfway through it, he asked, "You don't mind that I'm Malay?" I said no. I genuinely found him attractive. And he was smart and driven, and he spoke about his work with lower-income groups with great conviction and passion. I found that charming.

When it comes to my dating life, I happen to have physical preferences. I like lean fit boys. I like big eyes and sharp jaws. I like someone who's sporty and tall. Race, for me, was a non-issue although I must admit that I've been with more Chinese boys than Malay ones. He was the third Malay guy I've gone on a date with but the first I saw a future and a life with. For me, it's simple. As long as you fit my physical preferences and I think of you to be someone worth pursuing, I will make the chase and not beat around the bush with regards to my intentions. If I want to fuck someone, I will say so. If I want to be in a relationship with a guy, I will go to great lengths to woo him.

Over the years in our relationship, we've had some difficult conversations. One of these happened to revolve around the insecurity he had built over the years being Malay and gay. One night, while we were watching Bridget Jones after dinner at my place, he confessed something to me. He told me of his experience growing up Malay and gay. He said that he had this deep attraction for Chinese boys and for a long time, he wouldn't date anyone else but a Chinese. 

At the time, when I messaged him, he had only started seeing other non-Chinese boys and he thought I was a troll. That night at my place, I asked him, "Why? Why this preference?" He related to me the environment he grew up in. In school, he had more Chinese friends than Malay or Indian ones; naturally, over the years, his school crushes were always Chinese boys. He watched a lot of Taiwanese dramas - Meteor Garden happens to be his favourite (ewww) - and he had built this idea in his head that he would find a Chinese boy to settle with for the long-term. He grew up not liking what he saw in the mirror - his tanned skin which I happen to find really, really beautiful - and he felt it to be a limiting factor when it came to dating. He's dealt with a lot of rejection from Chinese guys who preferred other Chinese guys (and he realises as well that he had built an internal racism to his own and that he's been a jerk to other non-Chinese gay guys). For the most part, he dealt with those rejections well, but he quickens to add that at times, he felt his sense of worth and confidence ruined. 

When I talk to some of my Malay and Indian gay friends, they often say the same thing. I noticed they've 'yellow fever' as well. It's a real phenomena especially within the gay circle and it can have damaging effects on someone's psyche. I know it did on my partner. I had to remind him, especially during the first year, that I loved him for all that he was and will be. 

During NUS, I visited San Francisco to visit a friend over the term break. He's an American-born Chinese. I got to know him when he visited Singapore for a holiday. When I told him the issues my boyfriend faced, he said the same thing about himself except now, instead of 'yellow fever', he had a 'white fever'. As a teenager, he grew up attracted to White guys. He preferred dating White over a non-White (he refused to even date a Chinese guy). He told me about the profiles he saw on Grindr and Jackd that said, "No Asians. No Chinks. No blacks. No Indians." It did affect his confidence level when he was a teenager struggling to manoeuvre around the gay scene, but he's grown out of it. He doesn't feel affected anymore by those profiles because he knows exactly his worth. Last I saw on Facebook, he's with a Latino guy now and he seems happy. 

As for my partner, yes, he eventually found a cute Chinese boy - me! - to settle down with but this was unplanned for both of us. I didn't date him because he was Malay. I am with because I saw a future with him. I had a list of attributes that I wanted in a life partner. He doesn't satisfy all of it, but he's perfect for me. Great to have expectations, but expectations can sometimes limit possibilities and love can happen in the least likely scenario.

Personally, I think it's fine to have racial preferences when it comes to your life partner. It's a very individual thing. Cultural similarities do attract. And you should never dictate someone's choices when it comes to a life partner. What's not fine and racist is when your racial preferences are based solely on racial stereotypes you've of that person. If you like someone who's fair skinned, you'll also find attractive a fair-skinned Malay, Indian or Latino or whatever.

I've always believed in what Ellen Degeneres says. We've a short time in this world. Let's just be kind to one another. See from different perspectives; put yourself in different shoes; if you've done that i.e. really put effort into challenging your value system, and you still hold onto it, that's fine but do show empathy for someone who doesn't share your view. If you can't do that, then I guess... my advice for you would be to write a blog and remember to turn off the comment feature.

Hi Whisperers, I really need some advice here. 
So the situation is, my boyfriend is the driven sort, want to achieve this and that, and although has no career achievements to speak of at the moment, I have been nothing but supportive of him. 
When it comes to me, I'm the type who takes one step at a time in my career. I don't have long term goals. I work towards short term goals and grasp opportunities as they present themselves, but don't actively go searching for them. And honestly I don't think there's anything wrong with my way. 
So whenever we discuss about our career choices/goals, I feel like he's trying to force his opinions on me, that I should have a goal and work towards it. Honestly I really feel pressured. And when I tell him that, he says that I am not open to advice and becomes defensive when it comes to discussing such issues. 
I honestly try to avoid discussing my career with him, I don't know if it's the way he communicates his thoughts, but it just makes me not want to share my thoughts, knowing it'll end up in an unhappy situation. Is it my problem? Can our relationship last even in the face of such an issue? (with the understanding that supposingly couples should be able to discuss everything under the sun).
Do note that I'm looking at him as a potential husband; Im just thinking if we can't even discuss about this, what about the discussions with regards to finances, kids, housing etc?

Hey friend, Idk if this can help but try to keep it natural (I know this is hard because during this "blurred" phase, we would die to know if the guy likes us). You may want to know his intention, but try to tame it, instead ask yourself if you're really interested in him or you are only feeling like that because he shows signs of interest in you, which we are not sure though. Sometimes knowing that he likes us can put an end to our interest and the next thing u know you are running for your life.

Why does it seem that the further you get in your education, the harder it is to form close friendships? Sometimes, I'm not sure if people want to be friends just for the sake of it. I used to have some close friends, but everytime I go to a new place, those friendships are lost. I guess that means I'm bad at keeping friends, well I hope university won't turn out like that. Is it true that the older you get the less close friends you have?

I have been on three dating apps over the past few months and even though I am still remains as an evergreen guy, I really learn a lot about online dating and will like to share it over here. Online dating is really not suitable for everyone unless you are really a guy who can catch the attention of a girl among the hundreds or thousands of guys that are vying for her attention. Secondly, most girls really don't look at looks (though they look more on your height and physique), they look mostly at a guy's personality and whether he can start and maintain a good and interesting conversation. If you ever find yourself stuck, it means both of you don't match. However, that does not mean your profile picture is not important. It tells a lot about your personality. Lastly, when you are on these sites, you have to accept the fact that the probability of finding your significant other over these sites are still very low (can go google on the statistics, btw there are a lot more guys than girls on these sites). Girls still prefer the traditional way of finding their significant others as it may not be very safe meeting someone online and it is hard to tell someone's true colour online. Having said that, guys, please dont feel so let down. Online dating is really more than just dating, you learn a lot more about yourself (and improve on yourself) and the opposite gender and I am still in the process of learning.

How do you ever stop liking someone who could never like you back? You see him almost everyday at work,and its's killing and making you alive at the same time. 

The reason why he can never like me? It's because I'm not Chinese. Life is so sad. 
-
 
To  Thanks for taking the time to reply. For starters, I do not believe in chasing guys so when one infrequently comes by, I do a thorough cost-benefit analysis. I approach love from a very logical standpoint because I do not trust the impermanence of feelings. To clarify where I'm coming from, I would choose to be with someone who treats me incredibly well and learn to love him (given that we already very click well) than be with someone whom I comparatively love more but ends up treating me considerably less well.

I'm not terribly uncomfortable with him as you may have mistakenly suggested, since we share an uncannily similar philosophy on love and life - the more pressing issue is for me to better understand how people regard the issue of looks when picking a partner since it is of appreciable importance to me, and when a person would know if the search ends. If I do choose to be with him I wouldn't want to make my life difficult by constantly nitpicking at his flaws. By my standards I know that he is husband material, and I gather that I will be much less likely to have a difficult time emotionally with him by my side compared to previous lovers. Devoted, quality, (good-looking) guys are like unicorns, and the probability of snagging one is even more remote so I just wanted to source for constructive feedback. Appreciate your taking the time :) 
-
 
I like someone more than ten years older than myself. Not because I have a preference for older guys or anything; he just so happens to have the qualities I'm most attracted to. Should I do anything or should I even be considering this? I'm a girl btw, and I'm above the age of consent. But there are so many things I'm afraid of, like what if I'm not good enough (I'm evergreen), what if I'm too naive and he'll take advantage of me (although he doesn't strike me as that kind of person) etc. Yes, he's single. And he seems interested but I could be reading this wrong. 
Oh man, now I sound like such a lily-liver. I'm usually confident and cocky and I rarely like people so this caught me off guard. I hate this state I'm in. Can someone please talk me down, so to speak?
-
 
Here is my theory. Nerds study very hard when they are young and get good grades. But they hardly interact with girls. In Singapore, these nerds get scholarship from government and become politicians. At this stage of their lives, they get tempted to flirt with girls because they have not eaten the forbidden fruit. 

That's why I suggest boys to play around first before marriage. Those who don't know how to play around are likely to cheat.

Wondering about this for many years already...
Do people actually get aroused when they see attractive people in normal situations? I hear people talking about "sexy"/"hot" but I never experienced such a feeling.

Whenever I look back at why our relationship failed, it all links back to me. My failures, my faults. I keep going back to the fact that I was the one who caused you to leave.

I can never forgive myself for that. Which is why time and time again, I keep going back to you and asking you for forgiveness.

You have said you dont hate me.
but you dont love me anymore.
Your heart is to someone else now.

I guess that hurt me equally as bad as knowing that I was the one who caused you to leave.

How can I put it all down to start afresh?
The memory of the loving relationship that we once shared comes back to haunt me everytime...

Sorry but I just need to rant so badly about work life.

I'm barely a month into my job and I'm already feeling very sian of my boss. She always want something to be done a certain way but she never tells me what way it is, so when I do something which doesn't sit right with her, she'll be pissed and I'm like..."what?" I understand that I'm a newbie, so I am trying really hard to learn. But what's there to learn when I'm not taught properly. She has a tough management style which makes me feel really intimidated. And idk why but I feel she dislikes me, even though she was the one who hired me. The only comforts are my nice colleagues and my drive to excel in the industry, so I'm just gonna ride it out with my head held high. I am highly ambitious, and also, I know that even if my boss is mean to me, I'm not bothered by it. After all, mean people's actions say nothing about me, and everything about them.

Can anyone share their stories about such problems and how you overcame them?

In response to , I'm also facing a similar situation. But instead it's my gf. My gf has a close male friend and he always msges her. It seems as if they're more than just friends. But instead of reassuring me, she still continues to do things that hurt me. Sometimes I will ask her who is she talking to and she will lie to me. And she likes to spend time with him eg. preferring to go out with him than me. Is it fair for me to ask her to cut off friendship with her male friend? I met this male friend before and I feel uncomfortable because he's too chummy with my gf. Really need some advice here.

To  That is because the meaning in the term GG has evolved over the years in the era of online gaming... It was normally used as compliment or show appreciation at the end of games; but because it started to get so popularized, it started to also signify the end of a game - more often implying or predicting a coming lost rather than a win. So, when people describes something as GG, it describes a seemingly futuristic "end"/"lost case". This is the age of the internet we live in! :)

I really really wish you would care about me as much as I care about you. I'm really exhausted thinking and wondering if all I'm here for is to listen to you grouse, offer advice, help with school... and wonder if you care for me beyond just that. I'm so tired of telling you to take care of yourself and yet feel like even if I stopped replying to you, you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't go, 'I wonder if she made it home okay?'.
-
 
To  I don't know what to say about the first part of your problem because I don't know anyone whose bf is like that. If you're not willing to confront him about it maybe you see if he do the same thing next year. About the second part, it seems you are very aware of the difference in treatment between his ex & you. Why do you think you are not as pretty as her? Unless your bf admitted that he thinks that way? Anyway, I don't think there is anyting wrong with wanting to be "shown off". And if he did it before it means it's how he expresses love. So if your bf showed off his ex alot and is currently still active online but he keeps you a secret, personally I find it suspicious. If he checks up on his ex it just shows even more that he is very active across social media platforms. Your friend may not be wrong, and I think you know this. Maybe you can start a blog also? Then he will read yours more and read hers less haha.

After years of regret, I decided to go for a dream of mine. I took what little money I had saved up and dedicated myself full time. One year later, I did not succeed. I dealt with a ton of rejection, self doubt and feelings of being utterly lost in life. But I fought through it and kept trying. I did not succeed on paper. I poured my heart and soul into something and felt absolutely devastated by failure. But I learned I'll be okay in life. And I'll find something else I can be passionate about. 

You don't need someone else's approval or some outside influence or opportunity to be happy. 

Be good to yourself, focus on what you can control and don't beat yourself up for things that you can't control. 
-
 
Sweetheart, thank you for loving me so faithfully. My name feels different when you say it. I have not met anyone like you and I'm not sure if I ever would. Our love is unparalleled to any other couple I know of, and you make me so happy. I only wish that you feel the same about me and maybe one day, I will voluntarily choose to be with you. 
-
 
Ever had someone who was obviously into you, started all the conversations, kept it going everyday and you replied too but only saw the person as a friend? And over time the person realised yeah this was only going to be friendship. But now the messages are about how's she seeing person x, person y. And the things she mentioned was good about you last time now she makes it sound negative. What are such ppl trying to do? 
-
 
To  I was in this exact (and I do mean exact) scenario a couple years ago, and it later transpired that they had physical dalliances behind my back. At first I chose to trust him since he told me nothing was going on; I was allowed to read their messages under his supervision; the other girl was attached anyway, but in this case it turned out that they were weaker than their desires. 

You've got every right to be in a relationship that you feel secure in, and if your boyfriend is not doing enough to settle your mind, you need to decide for yourself if this is a deal breaker and not prolong your misery. I personally want someone who chooses me over his friends (especially over those of the opposite sex. Duh, right?) If it has been going on for awhile and you've been tolerating it, I hope that you find the strength to change things for yourself. Give (him) enough warning and carry yourself with self-respect. It's not easy but leave if necessary and start over again with someone else who truly values your presence and not take advantage of your kindness. 

On another note, I wouldn't approach the other girl to get her to stop because any decent, self-respecting dude would be able to rise up to the occasion and deal with it appropriately. Extrapolating it a little further; if she wants him and he goes, she can have him. You don't want someone who doesn't know how to stay.

Maybe I am hardened from my particularly scarring incident but it's always a good reminder to keep your long term happiness in view. You don't want to be in a relationship that constantly acts like a heavy metal ball at your ankles, dragging you down from being happy.  I wish you well.

I was a evergreen guy who recently got a girlfriend for a few months. I got to say, I thought having a girlfriend was much better than this. I guess I just like the feeling of liking someone and the thought of being with her but not really being with her? 
-
 
Ok guys. Okay. Okayyyyy. Stahp. Stop. SATAMP. Actually, i mean girls. Stop it. 

All these posts about bf watching / stalking other girls and now i have fallen into scrunity under the eyes of my girl. (She is an avid reader of this confession page. =_=)

Doesn't she read the news? One terrorist who happens to be muslim doesnt make all muslims terrorist. One horny bf argubly cheating on his gurl does not mean that imma the same. 

T_T somebody save me from my gf paranoia. She is ignoring me so I am not sure if she is playfully ignoring me or just gonna REALLY dump me for things i didnt do, like cheat on her in any way. '3'
(I can barely ask her out and she is thinking I have the balls to stalk other girls !?!?!)
Took me 3 days of decision-making to even press the [add fren] button on her fb profile.

Soooooooo, the thing is, this poor evergreen boy is trying to please his girl with an advance birthday surprise. (Duh. A surprise means you dont celebrate it on the actual day itself. #sonotsurprise ) currently waiting outside her corridor silently with a gift, or gifts.

So i implore the admins to approve this post quickly, and let it go up the page, cuz there is a few ways tonight can end.
1) she sees this post, opens the door, sees me, happily ever after.
2) she opens the door cuz she sees someone outside, sees me, happily ever after. Whichever comes first.
3) neighbors calls police cuz of suspicious guy loitering at hdb corridor. Yours truly ends up at a police station or makes it to stomp.
4) scenerio 3 happens and Admin approves the post! (Yes lah such nice timing). Girl opens her door and feels cheated or angry cuz she tot i left. Yours truly loses the girl and his clean-slate record after a night in the police station.

Well i will leave my fate in the hands of the admins and Cupid then.

P.s. she doesnt sleep til 3. She is an owl. Scenerio 5 is that she decides today is a great day to sleep early so i end up spending the night at the corridor. The end? Time now is 2345, 10th March.

After being single for more than two decades, every time I see a guy with an attractive girl, I would secretly wish that they split up. Especially so if the guy is the notorious overly confident, attention seeking pretentious prick type that you see on social media all the time with all the fake and totally not sincere posts that are designed to garner likes. Like girls, why would you even go for guys like that? To make your own life miserable and forever annoyed with their arrogance? Like what? I also don't understand how pretty girls would go for ugly guys too, but if the guy is nice/ not irritating/ quiet then I will feel more at peace and want to wish them all the best, as it is usually rare to see that and I know how difficult it is for a non-imposing and reserved guy to get a girlfriend. I simply don't understand how being reserved and nice as a guy can be seen as defective/unattractive by girls, while being obnoxiously pretentious, attention seeking and cocky is seen as attractive?

I just woke up from a nightmare. You were in it. 

It:
I was in one of the labs, doing my work, when it happens, that you, and some unnamed boyfriend entered the lab. I overheard your converstation, and your boyfriend left you to do your work. 

In a moment of foolishness, a moment of courage, I mustered all I could, and took the initiative to talk to you. "Hey, it's been a while." You replied, with a simple, "Hey," and went back to doing your work. 

"How have you been?" 

And the conversation went on with a short series of short replies. "Look, I see that you're busy, just wanted to apologise..."

And we started quarreling. I let everything out. 

I am very sorry, that initially, I pushed you to someone whom I thought, would be able to provide a better future, than if you're with me. I threw attitude problems, etc., and ended up, by alienating myself, you ended up with the person, who still broke up with you.

I am very sorry, that after that, I took the convenient excuse, to chase my grades that weren't there. I worked hard, but I never held anything in my hands. 

I AM SO SORRY, that while you were undergoing difficult times, I was never there for you, chasing something that was never there, when I could have been beside you, even as a friend.

I am sorry, yet again, that I simply cannot face you anymore. I cannot try to fake a smile if I ever talk to you again. I actively ignored you, even if you tried to say hi. I am so sorry. 

If anything, someone snatched my phone the other day, and messaged you, to apologise on my behalf, to clear a bit of load off me, at least, I think.

I again, took the convenient exit; I feel all these, but you do not know that. You don't see me around anymore, and very much less talk to me. You're living a better life already, I hope. I apologise for this, but you won't know.

I wish, that this nightmare was real, because if it was, I would be a lot happier, because at least, I am with you, little birder.

From,
A person who summitted a mountain, but never could get over people.

 First, I'm not even going to say npnt because that's redundant. If looks are that important to you and you've clearly thought about this for a period of time, it probably means that you have not been able to be attracted to him despite having considered him as a potential partner. My advice? Don't go with him then. I've never believed in the saying of getting together with someone who loves you more is better than with one who doesn't. Yes, my viewpoint may differ from others, but ask yourself, can you live with picking at his flaws your whole life and future? Would you honestly be happy just because he treats you like a princess? Even people who are truly in love fall apart when the whole factor of living together comes in and seeing every tiny flaw of their partner they never saw when they are dating. Marriage requires understanding and tolerance. If you are already so uncomfortable with him now, what happens when you guys start living together and taking up the responsibilities in reality?

Not exactly a confession, but just want to know people's opinions:

When do you reply an email and when do you not? That is, let's say a person is not expectating a reply anymore (i think) but you want to thank them for giving an answer (even if it's negative). Would you reply to convey your thanks, or not reply so that the person won't have to deal with an extra email? 

And let's say you decided to reply only after two weeks, would that be weird? 

What do my fellow nuswhispers think?

This is more directed to people who are engaged/married; how do you decide if your partner is as good as it gets and your search stops there?

I'm single and someone is hot on my heels because he's really enamoured by me. While he's not packaged into something I would have picked off the shelf (no, I'm not objectifying him, it's just a metaphor of speech), quality-wise he's everything I need and this is deeply troubling. Looks ARE important to me even if they aren't to someone else (think of the kids, think of the kids. Good-lookers do get an edge in life although I know smarts and bravery can triumph later on), and I want a partner who is roughly in the same category as I am. How much do people forgo looks in deciding if your potential partner has top notch qualities in compensation for the lack of looks?

it's really hard to find a good quality guy who has the same love ideals and overflowing chemistry with me but at the same time God giveth and taketh; as superficial as it sounds, I am postulating that should I get together with him, I may not feel as comfortable posting pictures of us on social media. This is NOT  for mere societal validation sake or anything, but a real personal preference to be someone who is closer to being an equal with me. I want to love the face I wake up to, as much as the next person would want to pick a guy whom she can sing duets with. Before people start hating on my fussiness regarding looks, please understand that this is a genuine concern for me and recognise that there are many types of preferences out there and we should not impose our own value judgements on one another. I know people grow old and ugly but while I still get to pick, I'm not sure if I'm keen on the constant negotiation and cognitive dissonance within myself to accept someone who did not arrive in somewhat acceptable terms. He is otherwise a 8.6/10 lover. 

Additionally, he has not fulfilled his earning potential and I'm wary about committing to someone based on potential (in any aspect) because I'm someone who needs to see concrete proof of effort and substance first. Potential is merely that and if it goes unfufilled, I would be really upset with myself. I can only make one choice this lifetime and I want to have no regrets. 

I know that people say pick someone who loves you more than you love him and I recognise the merits in that but I can't help feeling like maybe it could be that I'm addicted to the feeling of worship that he gives me? He treats me like a princess! I can learn to love the person I'm with, even though it would've been better if I liked him from the get-go. It seems like people are getting together with someone they can live with, but I'm just wondering how many people out there are together with someone they can't live without? Please let me know if you got lucky and are in the latter category! 

For me, that distinction makes a world of difference since I'm not someone who gets attached at the drop of a hat. I'm incredibly picky about the people I associate myself with and ain't nobody got time to get a heart broken or break hearts. Excited at the prospect of being able to choose a partner but it's really daunting business! Peace out and love to everyone x

Hi guys, I'm a year 2 CNM student, which means I have gone through not just a few group projects...my interaction with teammates has not improved though. Except for a few groups where I could click with others quite well...There is always one girl (or two) in every group who is very vocal and friendly to everyone, but always seems to hold back when they talk to me. It's not an assumption...it's solid conclusion from 4 sems of observation (i even tested some girls and they all admitted with their friends that they are awkward with me). I don't get it, I have been all smiley, and collaborative. Do u all have the same problems? Like some awkward interactions with your teammates or am I just overanalyzing everything?

I've been noticing this very pretty Korean exchange girl in my lectures. Her attractiveness is seriously on another level and she's easily the hottest girl in the whole LT. I just wished I could somehow get to know her but there's probably no possibility of getting together anyway .... :(

 Hi there! Firstly, there are many orientation camps available, so don't limit your options! In FASS, Arts Camp and Arts OWeek are bigger scale. If you prefer something more "quiet", different majors in FASS also hold camps, some of which are smaller scale. These camps *might* not (depends on the major) involve loud cheering, social night or games with physical contact with the opposite gender, which might suit you better! 

I've attended many camps in NUS, and haven't seen any hazing or girls being taken advantage of. Perhaps these are rare incidents but received more attention In fact, during my social night, the guys in my OG constantly looked out for our safety :')

I'm not sure about special traditions, but Arts Camp and OWeek would involve things like cheering and social night. If you feel awkward cheering loudly, or feel uncomfortable reciting cheers with sexual connotations, you can always choose not to do so. Some people also skip social night because they don't like clubbing. Most seniors would be understanding and respect your decision. 

I think orientation camps are great for meeting new people, and you stand to gain so much if you get over the initial fear of awkwardness. On your part, this is a good time to get out of your comfort zone and meet new people. There will be many opportunities in life that you can enjoy if only you step out of your comfort zone, so why not start here?

Of course, this also depends on your luck. Some OGs remain close, some drift apart. I also have friends who are not close to their OG, but made a few close friends from camp. All you need is those few good friends to make your camp experience worthwhile. Friends don't fall from the sky, and it takes a bit of initial effort to get to know new people. 

From orientation camps, I have made friends who were there for me during difficult times, and also met seniors who were incredibly helpful especially when I was a confused freshie. Of course, many people end up as acquaintances, but that is what happens in life and should not be a reason to deter you from meeting new people!

Hope you'll enjoy your life in NUS! :)

I have a friend (no it's not me. Okay maybe it's me but let's just call him Friend A). He is 23 years old and is still evergreen. Should he be worried at all? Some people can be 18 and have already been in 3 relationships. Should my friend be worried at all? What if he never finds anyone compatible and spends the rest of his life alone? Asking for a friend.

Hello! That's this girl that I really like but I'm experiencing some issues in finding topics to talk about:( sometimes I tried too hard and the convoy gets awkward and ends there. Any advice?
-
 
In response to , i too has found my boyfriend liking and stalking a number of girls whom he had found attractive and has also told me that they are only his friends and he thought they were pretty thats all and he had no feelings towards them whatsoever. This has however made me feel extremely uncomfortable and i had brought it up a number of times. But time after time i found him stalking again to "see what they are up to". Especially this one particular girl where he actually had the thought to cheat on me, but he keeps going back to look at her stuffs. I dont know what i should do as this topic has already been brought up countless of times and that his reason for continue doing so is because he thought i was already okay with that. He had previously also screenshot snaps of girls whom he had found pretty where for now he had already stopped doing so. And while we are talking things through, he asked me "So does this means i can't even look at pretty girls now? But its only natural to look". And also FYI, all of this happened while we were together. Many occasions he felt that i was over-reacting. I am already at my wits end. Some advice please guys.

To  If you aren't afraid to show your interest in her, then just talk to her about anything. If she feels the same way as you, she'll try to not let the conversation turn awkward! Then see if she ever initiates a conversation. If she does, there might be a chance that she feels the same way as you do! (:

Hey! i feel you, girl. I am not the prettiest or anything, but I love to make people laugh. I also made the effort to look decent, but I also always wonder why there isnt anyone ...who shows any interest:(. I want a bf, just to feel the different kind of love that everyone talks about, but I am not desperate. I still wanna look for someone that will be happy tgt with me. :) I just wanna say that I totally understand you. I too look at couples with the same thoughts going through my mind.

I am happy being myself and I am glad you are too.:) 
-
 
Women, don't you hate it when men ask for your number or message you unadvised? If so, message me your number, and we can talk about it.

Need some opinion please. My bf has a close female friend and he always msges her. From the msgs, it seems as if they're more than just friends. To be fair to my bf, he always assures me that they are just friends, and that female friend's attached. Also, he allows me to read all the msgs. In my mind, I feel that there is always the possibility that he deleted certain msgs, or he speaks to her on other platforms. Is it fair for me to ask him to cut off friendship with his female friend? I have met that female friend in person before and I feel kind of uncomfortable around her because she is too chummy with my bf.

Hey, I'm the poster of . I just wanna add on to some points. I sometimes look at couples, but wonder what each of them see in each other that makes them fall in love with each other, or ..enjoy each others' company so much that they hang out together so frequently.

I think look and taste are one thing, but character is really something that we should focus more when looking for a partner. :) I believe all these couples like/love each other for something that just appear so special in their eyes. :)

Stay who you are, and people will naturally be drawn to you. :)

I cried when we broke up. 7 years later I cried when I receive a wedding invitation to her wedding. It was not because I was still not over her, but because I realize something even more grieving.

Out of curiosity when I got the invite, I google search the groom’s name (no idea why I google instead of facebook at that point) and I came across a blog. It was my ex’s blog. I backtrack her posts and realize that 5 years after we broke up she was still not over me. I took about the same time to try to get over her too. There were times when I wanted to contact her again but I was just could not lower my pride to do so because after all she initiated the broke up.

In your exact words: I will tell you I love you again if you want me to. We could have had it all. Don’t think you will ever read this but I wish you a happy marriage.

 If you're really not a troll, then have fun when you come in. And make sure you don't start complaining at any point of time in your 3 to 4 years.
-
 
Do you believe in platonic friendships for members of the opposite gender? Is it possible to talk to someone everyday for 10 years or so and never develop feelings for him/her? Or one party secretly harbours feelings for the other?
-
 
Sometimes, when I'm having a long one-to-one conversation with someone (prof, project mate, etc), I like to imagine how the other party would react if I unexpectedly and suddenly sucker punch them in the face, or splash water in their face for no reason at all, and then continue talking as though nothing had just happened. I've never done it in real life before of course, nor do I intend to, but it's interesting to just imagine.

What's the best way to cut ties with a toxic friend?

I always felt that this particularly friend was only using me to help him with his studies but I never had the guts to confront him about it, lest I was overthinking it. But this sem, even though I've helped him a handful, he started acting cold after he got what he wanted and doesn't even acknowledge me when we see each other.

What's the best way to go about this? Should I just ignore him? Or confront him? Problem is I'll still be seeing him in class for the next 2 years so things may get awkward between us if I choose to do something drastic. 
-
 
Enrolling into NUS soon (i took a gap year)

Am a really introverted girl who is considering joining the orientation camps.
But I really hate the hazing process, the games where everyone just throws their face together and supposedly bond. My older female cousin even told me of how some guys tried to take advantage of her. How is the girl to guy ratio? I am entering FASS

Can everyone (or anyone reading this), can to share your best and worst experiences in the camps?
Also, is it like any orientation camps? Or are there any special traditions? 
Will there be another orientation camp once we enter halls too?

Please share! Either by a confession reply or comment. Thanks!

I recently found out my bf likes to see this particular girl's fb/insta. Before you all say "See only mah" this makes me feel uncomfortable. I have talk to him about this and he had assured me that she is just his primary school mate and he does not find her attractive. I have seen their chats before me and my bf got together. Its filled with "How about picnic at botanics?" "How about going to a dance?" "Let's go to the beach and have dinner".  It makes me sick to the stomach. I feel like punching him or her or both.

Maybe you guys can slap some bloody sense into me cos my mind is filled with anger.
-
 
I have this really close friend from JC until now, even when we are in uni. I regarded her as my bestfriend but one day she just turns her back on me. I have tried having a "talk" with her but it doesn't seem to work. Should I still try to talk to her again?
-
 
 I'm op of 17634. Not gonna start a war with you. In fact, I agree with you, having learnt the same lessons myself but in a different way. If you wish to continue trading and are happy doing it, I wish you all the best. Just don't shit on things you deem invaluable. You think its shit but it may be impt to others. Value is not always measured with tangible means. Also, shoutout to Mr Allan Yeo. I'll definitely remember your advice. I know I have still a long way to go and much to learn. After all I'm only 20. My mentors are very clear on that. I just cant standby and watch this person shit on things others may hold dear.

If my years in uni are supposedly the best in my life, I can't imagine how the rest of my life is going to be.

I saw so many posts of "oh he's so fat and nerdy yet got a gf while the buff, gymn everyday me got nothing" complaints. It's simple guys: that guy is doing something right, and you don't. Whatever you are doing right now don't work. So suck it up.

But fret not. I'll show you what you are doing wrong, and how to fix it. I'll try to write a dating guide for young men in the next few days or so. Based completely on my own life. Sorry can't do jack for girls. My advice for them? Somewhere out there, there's a straight guy who will fuck you.

My credentials, I'm not a Pick Up Artist type, first off. I found their life styles and goal pathetic and creepy, though they have skills, and I respect them for that; in the same way that the Desert Fox respected the Desert Rats while trying to kill them. But let's say ever since I graduated, in Aug 2011, I only spent 5 months being single. No V-day alone since then. I'm getting married some time at the end of this year. So I guess I'm doing sth right. I had discussions and chats with my fiancee on what she, and girls in general find guys attractive; and I'll throw in some extras. I'm in no way physically attractive. I'm not particularly handsome, I don't go to the gym, I don't diet, and I get fat easily. Nor I am that rich. Comfortable living, yes; but partially because I'm a cheapskate and I save a lot.

But let me tell you that I won't be so good at telling you how to FIND and ATTRACT a girl initially. Why? I forgot how I did it. I spent way more time being with someone than chasing someone, so I can definitely tell you more on the keeping part than the chasing part. Trust me when I say that keeping is harder than finding.

And guess what, it's free. It pains me to see good young boys (yes, that who you undergrads look like to me) getting their knickers in a twist over getting their dick wet. This kind of advice typically cost you money, ok. Enough to get you comatose by sex with hookers for weeks.
-
 
This is slightly NSFW. I recently broke up with my partner whom I had been having a lot of sexual relations with. I want to find a guy who has a big package and who can also satisfy my high drive. Before you comment that "size doesn't matter", sorry to dash your delusions guys but size DOES matter. How do you check if someone fits your criteria and from there approach him to be your friend with benefits?
-
 
To the girl who was with me in the elevator in PGP blk1 today, i just want to say you have such a beautiful smile. Although we only exchanged a few words but i can feel that you are a really cute and kind girl. Hope to see you around more often ;)

Guy readers, can I ask you something? What does it mean when my boyfriend doesn't seem be over his ex and still keeps in contact with her parents? Is it a standard thing to text your ex's parents on special occasions and holidays like cny? I get that it is a politeness thing if they broke up recently but it's been a year already. He says he is over her but I know he checks up on her social media platforms and even reads her blog. I asked a female friend and she says that he keeps connections because he is still hoping for a chance to get back together with her. I don't want to believe my friend but sometimes I can't help feeling like he doesn't love me as much because he doesn't show me off on his social media platforms, while in the past he showed his ex off a lot. I don't know if it's because I'm not as pretty, or because he wants to give off the impression that he is still single. It's making me feel quite insecure. I can't talk to him about this because I'm scared he will take offence and flare up at me. How should I interpret all this?
-
 
People always say... As long as you are female, somewhere out there, there is a straight guy who would fuck you. 

From a straight female, this isn't my goal? So what kind of advice is that? Knowing how most men would fuck...almost anything (I don't even want to say "in a skirt", because some men have different inclinations. No hate there.) 

So how is that statement meant to even be reassuring? 
-
 
 It is just that you exist outside their framework of how people should generally behave. Naturally,it makes them uncomfortable to be associated with you at the moment. 

Give them some (a lot,actually) time to warm up, and realise that, you're not as bad as they perceived you to be. 

Take it from a guy who does a lot of quirky stuff.
-
 
Hate it when someone ass you to do something r give something to him and when you do it, he rejects. Seriously? 
-
 
17631: Tbh I user to have this kind of mindset. I'm a girl btw but yeah, similar thinking; I was a smily cheerful person, slimmed down after a lot of hard work, dressed up well, took care of myself. But yet I was still single after so long. Well I didn't flirt to anyone, but there weren't any guys chasing after me either. Then I look at couples where the girls don't make an effort to groom themselves, then think to myself, why am I not in a relationship? 
Then there was a thought, I take a look at their partner and honestly I wasn't interested in dating someone like that either, so why be envious of them? I just do me, be a happy single, and you'll be surprised at what will follow. 

I'll prob get a lot of flame for the superficial talk but oh wells
-
 
 It's just depressing when this clearly undateable fat guy has a girlfriend when I've tried everything in the book to become more dateable. I even took up gymming, which I've always hated, since girls always say we have to at least "look good" to be considered, but then someone who won a girl without even going through all the shit I went through in gym.

A conversation between me and my female friend on 8 March 2016

Me: You know that today is International Women's Day right? 
Me: Also known as 三八妇女节
Her: Yes I know. Why?
Me: No wonder women are sometimes known as 三八
Her: You surely know how to link
Her: Then what's men called?
Me: Dunno leh
Me: You tell me lor
Her: They are called idiots
Me: LOL

Anyway, Happy International Women's Day.

When people post about not being sure if someone likes him/her and wanting clearer hints, how come most of the answers say stuff like "just ask directly"? What about risking a great friendship? What about fear of awkwardness if the person doesn't feel the same way? Sometimes you're such great friends that it is not worth it to risk the friendship over a possibility of being together more than as friends
-
 
My height is 1.82, lean built and i guess ... above average looking. Everywhere I go, I will pay attention to the surrounding people and of course, be easily attracted to decent looking girls. So I am curious if girls too are very sensitive about your surrounding male companions, especially those that stand out from the crowd.
-
 
SIGH like he asked me out for lunch after occassionally dropping texts asking how my day was and things like that. But more than once he seen my replies and never texted back until after an hour or even days. And on the actual day, we talked internships and work and nothing more. He did not even fill in the silences very eagerly (u all know the difference between eagerly and not so, right?). He did not even hold the door for me or wait for me to catch up with him. I knew I should not have raised my hopes up but why did u ask me out to begin with.

Recently, I've found a new level of intolerance within people I know in NUS. I'm far from what you would call "normal" in terms of my personality and way of thinking and such, but I've learnt to get by and have my own circle of (reliable) friends and whatnot. But I find that when I tell more typically "normal" or "popular" people about myself, they either: 1) Try to change my way of thinking/doing things to be more normal or 2) Give off this odd feeling of being threatened and then just shut off all further commuication.

I'm perfectly fine with this, of course - they are free to think and feel what they want, and I lose nothing from them thinking this way - but what I cannot understand is why it is so difficult for such people to accept that others have different ways of thinking and expression.
-
 
He is from one of the blk at PGP, and has been toying around with my feelings. Telling me he love me. Then, being cold to me. Please, if we already settled what we have talked about, then just keep to yours promises. Stop flipping your words and said you have no time for me and yourself. When you can go cycling at Corney island and watch friends play badminton. Please just stop disturbing me. Thanks. If he continues to be like that, I think I will get depression. 
-
 
I met this girl through tinder. We have been on two dates so far and things are going slowly. We haven't discussed a relationship/ kissed though maybe this will happen or maybe we will remain friends. We have flirted a little (read a little not a lot). If I had met her another way I wouldn't feel bad meeting up with another girl. Does meeting through a dating app imply exclusivity until we have some kind of talk?
-
 
To me, i lost a guy who flirts around, adding random pretty girls on instag and never cherishes me. To you, u lost a gal who loved u with all her heart. Lol.
-
 
Oh please, please, PLEASE make weekiversaries a thing! Monthaversaries are just too far apart to celebrate. Don't get me started on anniversaries now! I need to celebrate every week with you. EVERY week. The world needs to know how much I adore you and most importantly how long we've been together. It important to continuously focus on the progress we've made and the amount of days, weeks or months we've been together than to live in the moment and organically experience a relationship. Can't wait till day-anniversaries become a thing!

Anyone else feel unsafe with all the scooters/e-bikes zipping around school? They don't have bells and the users don't slow down in crowded areas.. Instead they expect us to leap out of their way. I've had a couple of near misses. What can we do to improve the situation?
-
 
It's pretty hurtful when you ask someone u trusted to help you with something, and the next thing you realized they've blocked you. If you didn't want to do it, you could have just said it instead of being all passive aggressive. I'm glad to have seen your true colors and yep, although it's hurtful, I think I can live without a fake friend like you. Can't believe I never saw through that fake facade of yours for years
-
 
I believe that friendship can only be maintained by efforts from both side. I cared. I put in effort. I gave you the benefit of doubt when I didnt sense your effort, thinking that you may be busy. But no, that is not the case. You are simply uninterested. You much rather spend time with other friends than me.
Fine, i stopped caring. I let you have your time with these other friends. Then you ask me what is wrong. You said you still cared, you wanted the friendship back (when I didnt even say anything along the lines of "i'll unfriend you". I just drifted apart on my own) You said you will care more, you will put in more effort. You will come drag me out of my house even when I dont feel like going out.
Alright, I gave you another chance. And guess what, everything just went back to the same again. You not contacting me at all unless I contacted you first. Pangseh me last minute just to hang out with other friends. 
You say you are interested in maintaining the friendship but your actions proved otherwise. So i drifted away again. 
And now you are telling our common friends that I am an asshole for not contacting you and not talking to you. And you wanted them to ignore me to "let me have a feel of my own medicine" and 帮你出气?! If you have any 气, you can jolly well msg me and tell/scold me. And for the record, everytime you msg me (which is pathetically little. Like, less than 10times in the past 3years) I replied. 
Lucky for me, some of our common friends have the sense to check my side of the story first. So to you, my dear friend, friendship is not one-sided and do not involve only one person putting in the effort. Rmb, you reap what you sow. So if you dont sow, there will be nothing for you to reap.
-
 
I used to be the kind of person who always wallowed in self-pity when things go wrong. Recently though, I have realised how much I have to be grateful for compared to others.

For example, some travel thousands of miles to Singapore, leaving their family behind while others abandon their normal jobs, risking it all, just for a shot at fulfilling their dream of being an F1 driver.

Sadly, due to the cut-throat and competitive nature of the industry, all of them end up driving NUS internal shuttle buses. :(((((((((((((

So the next time you feel like wallowing in self-pity, remember these poor souls and be grateful. #deepthoughts #boulevardofbrokendreams #yolo

To Mr. Tall guy. I know you're reading this. I like you. I really do. Words can't contain the emotions I'm feeling for you. I got over him because of you. I hope you get over her because of me too. We enjoy each other's company don't we? Or is that all we'll ever be? :(

From Ms. Shorty.

I am getting to know this lady via texting. We met online. She works in finance and is very well paid, owns a car, goes fine dining, plays golf.

I earn way less than her. We haven't met in person yet and i am not sure what she will think when she finds out our disparity in earning and spending power, not to mention that i dont have a car to bring her round for dates.

Any advice? Should I subtly hint before we even meet?

I also don't know why we got matched. She is 9.5/10 but i don't think i am anywhere near 10
-
 
OP of  here. 

Turns out both of us were really busy despite our efforts to schedule a date. But we kept chatting everyday and she asked me out for brunch (such a cool girl to ask a guy right?)

The thing is she intends to bring her dog along. So quick question, what are the restaurant/cafe policies regarding pets? Any pet friendly restaurant and cafes to recommend? Any points to take note regarding dogs? I don't really interact with dogs. The last time I interacted with a dog I was really stiff @.@
-
 
And here you are not even bothering to ask why your friend blocked you. If you were friends for years, there would be some sunken cost even if that friend was 'fake', so there should be a good reason wouldn't it. Besides, what was it that you were asking help for exactly? Can we get the full story (like Illegal stuff etc, just to give an idea). Lastly, why the heck is there a correlation with being 'genuine' friends and helping?

P.S. blocking someone isn't 'passive aggressive', least in my book


-
 
One thing good being an evergreen guy is that you get to flirt around without being judge as long as you don't get involve in looking for fwb or prostitutes. Its a best time to widen your social circle with the opposite gender (like networking) and understand who you can click well with. But please don't go around flirting when you are attached. (Btw, just an opinion from an evergreen guy)
-
 
OP of  here,
Thank you so much, , that was really encouraging and useful :)

Um as for the commentator, I guess you assumed that all I did was texting because that was all I mentioned. Actually I hang out a lot with that guy a lot since we're coursemates. I never intended to have a relationship with him. It's just that I've been too used to having someone to tell stuff to, to share a funny vid with, etc. And now when I initiate convos, he barely replies though I know he's texting other girls at the same time. I feel really hurt and humiliated even though he's just a friend. 

And my insecurity doesn't have to do with the fact that most guys are creepy and gross...it's being afraid of being too emotionally reliant on another person. 
-
 
,  That is the entire point.
Either you stick to your viewpoint or you give yourself over. If the latter sounds like a terrible prospect (as I meant it to), then well, there's the answer right in front of you; you know what you have to do.
-
 
Just some random question:
1. Do any of you feel that JC days were the best? Back then, we all share our notes and teach one another. Over here, some people are really selfish with knowledge. And then these people are shameless to 'consult' us when they are in doubt seriously.. For example, how to calculate probability in ST2131 and then this person be like.."can calculate.. in the notes..*quickly turn away and find other topics so that he/she can move away from answering you*" Then, when you ask the lecturer something.. this person be like "what did you ask the lecturer? Oh.. so what is the answer? Oh.. Why? can you explain?" After explaining... this person continues.."Oh.. is this all the lecturer said? "  ya.... " you sure?" 

2. What are the characteristics of a toxic friend? How to 'break up' with the toxic person? Do toxic people have genuine friends? 

3. Do you have a friend who always creates opportunity for herself/himself to get closer to the guy/girl they MAY BE interested in? But when other people try to ship them together, he/she will always deny and and apparently "hate being teased by these people" ? Then after the teasing, this friend will mention about this "teasing" thing again and again and it's obvious he/she enjoyed being teased. I'm in year 2 now and this person haven't settled down with any of the potential mate/victim? And this friend don't feel tired after 2 years but i'm tired of hearing man...

-
 
Many of my friends are currently single. Most have been in relationships before, while those who are evergreen have at least been asked out in the past (i.e others showed interest but they rejected). But for me, no one has shown romantic interest yet.

Is it uncommon that as a 22-year-old, I have not met anyone who came remotely close to being a romantic partner? Should I be worried?
-
 
To  uhmm, as a person who sometimes unfriends in FB or unfollows in IG, there's only one reason - it's because you have very little to no updates at all so I just assume you don't use your account/s anymore. Unless I really really like you, I'd still keep you in my following/friends list even if you don't post any status or photo at all. 
-
 
I got asked out on a dinner date. This is my very first dinner date. Should we go Dutch or should I let the guy pay? 
-
 
My gf is about to go on exchange. I've heard so many couples break up during exchange due to drifting or cheating or finding some hot foreigner overseas. Even if it doesnt, I think I can't stand the demands of an LDR. You basically become a monk and can only talk over a phone and see each other through a screen, which is frustrating. Not to mention the constant missing and insecurity. Should I break up beforehand to minimise the pain? 
-
 
If your girlfriend is talking to this guy until very late at night almost everyday, and when you ask her who is she talking to she say it's her friends. If her conscience is clear and there's nothing to hide why can't she be honest with you and say she's talking to the guy? You are okay and you are not stopping her from talking to her friends as you believe everyone has the right to. If it's the case where your girlfriend is afraid that you may be misunderstood if she tell you, isn't this worse since she knows you will misunderstand but she still continue to talk with the guy? Are you right to think this way or are you overthinking and being overly sensitive?
-
 
I met you when you were getting over your ex. And at that point, I only had the intention to make friends casually. I told you time and time again I was never an option, but you kept insisting that you wanted me.  All the talks about a future together was nothing but lies and sweettalk. However, you soon got colder. And then few months down the road, you tell me you found a new significant other and you only wanted me as a friend from the start. I guess i was the one who was blinded. 
-
 
It's really so tough to put everything on your shoulders and smile. My friends always see me as the girl who's cheerful and optimistic, but in actual fact, I cannot find a reason to smile in my life. Some days I just look into space and tears just start welling up in my eyes as I think about my life. I feel so much like an underachiever. So stressed over everything that's happening and there's no one I can speak to.

Hi, I'm the OP for the post . Thank you to those who have replied to my post.

Just something to clarify, I am not those who will randomly add strangers or people who i barely know. The people who have "unfriended" me on fb are actually my poly classmates.. we have been "friends" on fb for quite some time since poly year 1 or year 2? 

We have graduated from poly less than a year and suddenly I discovered about this. Yes I am not really close to them in real life, but we do talk here and there once in a while.. Also I've realised that they (those that unfriended me) are still "friends on FB" with some of my friends in my poly clique. My friends in my poly clique also seldom chat with them.. (I can say the level of closeness with them are almost same as me).

So I just kinda don't understand.. But not to worry, I've tried not to think about it anymore. Thanks all for reading it :).

I really wish I can find a girl who likes star wars so that we can have a star wars-themed wedding together.

Hi, I am someone who regularly unfriend people on Facebook, insta and other social media etc. 

I unfriend people because they are probably people who i don't really know, only met ONCE through camps (tricky~) or other events. (might have advantage in networking, up to your discretion)

& i don't see any harm in doing it. Because firstly, i feel weird looking at feeds of people who i only saw once.
Secondly, i will feel weird FOR the people who i only met once. looking at MY feeds (through just timeline, not because stalking). 
Thirdly, you wonder if people who you don't really know are just kaypohs.

Now i learnt my lesson, never give my social media accounts that easily for such situation that i have to unfriend them for privacy sake.

& For those who get unfriended... Don't think too much. I do get unfriended too. But really, you only need to focus on people who mean to you. (which you don't even need the use of social media to interact anyway) Take those who unfriended you as people who you don't need in your life.

Xx

The words the lighted up my phone screen suddenly plunged me into this strange, terrifying feeling. My heart felt like it was going to stop with every breath that escaped from my lips. Is this how a panic attack feels like? Sometimes I wish I could go back to before I confessed to you and you broke my heart, so I wouldn't meet him, and be entangled in this web of passion and lust. When what I need and want is so mixed up and confusing that I can no longer tell, you, or him? And the fear of losing both of you is too much, the fear of both of you not loving me back is too much. I'm tired of finding love and losing it, of chasing love and having it run further away. Can love find me instead and let me know I'll love and be loved?

Hi, got a question for the evergreen girls. How would you feel if a friend of yours confessed his feelings to you? Would you be flattered since it's the first time a guy ever told you how he felt about you? Or would you feel awkward since you don't really know how to react? Let's assume that you're pretty close to the guy (but not on the "best friends" kind of level), you see him twice a week during lecture (and have lunch together) and you don't really mind hanging out with him.
-
 
Wth does it mean if someone literally blocks you off all the social media platforms that you both exist on one at a time for no rhyme or reason even though you aren't even communicating with each other? Like where did I even strike your raw nerve? 
-
 
response to 
I think there is a misconception of an evergreen girl. Although an evergreen girl has not officially dated, it does not mean that they have not been asked out before. Some evergreen girls receive lots of requests to date officially but reject the guy as they feel that he is just not the one. Thus, they might not necessarily feel flattered etc. One shouldn't be in a relationship just for the sake of being in a relationship - it has to be the right person. In fact, if they want to remain as friends, it might be quite a burden. Just hanging out together means that they really like your company and probably that you guys can communicate. My best advice to protect yourself from emotional hurt would be to make sure the girl has some degree of romantic feelings towards you as well.

Recently I found out that the number of friends on my Facebook has decreased. With my "analytical skills".. somehow I know who are the ones that have "unfriended" me on FB. Maybe because I do not have a large number of friends on FB hence it is kinda easy for me to find out which friends "disappear" from my friends list. 

It is kinda sad to find out... I wonder why do they randomly just unfriended me? I am not someone who post nasty/rants/disgusting posts etc. I am those who don't usually post much stuff on FB. I can still find their account on FB hence, it means they have unfriended me (Not their account being deactivated). Anyway, I am just puzzled by their actions. Like we were classmates/coursemates etc.. there wasn't any arguments or conflicts between us... but just suddenly they aren't my friend on FB?

At first, I thought could it be that they accidentally clicked the "unfriend" button? But couldn't be right? Or maybe it is possible? haha. Anyway, this matter did not bother me much already...Just felt puzzled and *why??* (I'm not those social media addict. I just felt that when a person "unfriended" you on FB, It felt like they did not want to have any personal contact with you again in future.. which kinda makes me feel upset? I mean probably not gonna be any chance to keep in touch again. *Or maybe I'm being too sensitive..*)

Does anyone encounter such situation too? 
-
 
 I totally feel you. Like you I take every meeting seriously, and when the other person cancels on you, you feel so angry, yet you can't do anything in case you offend him/her and wrecks the relationship. But cheer up, these emotions will be gone in a while :)

I met him as part of a community group we both were a part of. He was special: not the best looking, but the smartest, funniest and the most talented, and I fell in love. So I had to leave or risk being hurt, and I don't think I regret anything else as much.

Fast forward three years later, I manage to grasp at the thinnest of straws and make it into NUS! I join a residence/hall and I meet another bloke. He is special: definitely not the best looking, but he is nice, he is very helpful, he treats me well and talks to me like a friend I have known forever even though we have only known each other for less than half the year. We can spend hours together doing everything or nothing and I really enjoy this. I enjoy listening to him being excited about the things he enjoys, be it his games or his studies and I never want to stop being in his presence. Again, I find myself falling in love. Again, I leave, choosing to leave my residence for good after just one semester in order to avoid the possibility of getting hurt.

In these late nights I find myself feeling extremely lonely and wishing that I never ran away, because I still feel so strongly. They say you never forget your first love. I am sad at myself for running away and not sticking around to see things through. And I only have myself and my bruised and battered self-esteem to blame. Now I can only hope that I will have the courage to move forward.

Guys...if a guy remembers ur name without u having to tell him or spell it out for him, then gets ur contact and texts u once in a while (like whazzup on Mon and then shuts down until next Mon) and then asks u out for lunch. It's completely platonic, right? 
-
 
 Here's a possible reply. It may even be me that has unfriended you. :/ If it's me you're referring too, and I think I know who you are, I'm sorry for having removed you from my friend list. I was at a point where I didn't want any possible "disturbance," so please don't take it personally. Possible here meaning anything more than zero probability.

Otherwise, I guess people unfriend one another for various reasons even in your case. I have a friend who regularly clears them as there just have been too many social connections and it's draining for him. But I guess for him, those connections were more than mere acquaintances where there's a lot of conversation going on or many acquaintances who would drop him messages occasionally.  Another account I can think of is probably people just wanting to remove strangers or hardly known acquaintances as a routine maintenance. Some people just want what is in their space to not spread beyond their close friends. Fourth and last account would simply be that you offended someone without you knowing. Again, I apologise if it was me you're referring to.

 You've said something I've been saying and want to say now. Effective communication. Maybe you know who I am in real life. Maybe. After all, what's in front of me is only a screen.

Here's how I think the text kills:
1) Face-to-face interaction (FTF): There's a face attached to the conversation.
Text: In the worst case scenarios, there isn't, but in some, there is.
Note: You want to know who you're talking to and not have to guess although you may get it 9/10 times right. Unless you are wanting to talk to a random stranger. Things don't get pretty even if that's 1/10 time when you don't be skeptical and commit to the person's identity together with what he or she has said.

2) FTF: There's speech, and with that comes tone
Text: There's no speech, no tone, but only words.
Note: Tone plays a very important part in conversations. Someone with the same words can have a straight face, be smiling, or be angry. Tone helps us understand the other party's mood, and hence, their attitude towards us. Their attitude towards us helps us understand the intention behind their words and the meaning of those words. What do you get from text? The best you get is emojis and maybe a few gifs, and I think we all know not to trust those. To be sure, people fake their tones in FTF interactions as well, but those are less common and you get to cross-check with other cues being presented. Also, words help us to read mood as well, but in this aspect, FTF interaction is way better than texts where correct words are less readily chosen (keep one's sensitivity constant).

3) FTF: There's body language, including facial expressions.
Text: There isn't body language.
Note: The cues we get from body language is somewhat different from tones but they ultimately help us comprehend the meaning behind those words. It's one of those factors that help you cross-check with the information you get from tones of speech. Not just that, but the actions themselves convey meaning. Again, they're all subjected to misinterpretation and false signals. But even if you are talking to a well-trained evil doer and you are extremely bad at picking up cues from body language, I'm sure FTF interactions do better than texts (no body language), most of the time anyway.

4) FTF: Instantaneous.
Text: Not instantaneous.
Note: Texts are not instantaneous, although the technology might be. That's why you have people, me included, who reply at a later time. Some because they are busy or because they want to spend more time with a better crafted message, or for some other reasons. And there's nothing wrong with the latter, just as some people prefer to make sure that their words are appropriate in the context they're in before they speak. But what happens in the interval for the party waiting to receive a reply? Thoughts start to wonder (constantly check your phone for new messages is a sign), and that's bad if you commit to your thoughts. This is detrimental in several ways, especially emotionally. I've been there. That's just one aspect of spontaneity. I think most people find that overall, texting is extremely tiring or at least more tiring than just talking, and needless to say, things get worse for texts. How many people actually prefer sending and reading huge chunk of texts? Another pro of spontaneity is that everything gets cleared up on the spot. Anything that you don't understand about what the other party is saying or has said, or events that are occurring or has occurred gets clarified readily. More understanding and less "unnecessary" thoughts, and whatever that leads after.

With technology, there are always better alternatives than texts, than the worst kind of texts, besides FTF interactions. There may be various reasons especially in our hectic life that we have to do less with FTF interactions, but my thoughts are that, always try to get the best form of communication. This applies regardless of whether or not there's a conflict. Worse yet is when there isn't a clear understanding of what kind of person the other party is and all the cons of texts that has been mentioned above gets amplified.

That's what I can come up with for now. Maybe there's a better guide out there online and if that's the case, sorry for wasting your time. Maybe readers just think I'm an a**hole but that's not important now. Thanks for reading this and best wishes to everyone.

You decide how much you care. You decide how many times you want to try, and how much effort you are willing to put in, to try to convince the other party and persuade him/her over to your view. 

Or, you could stop trying. You could let yourself be persuaded instead.

I have to confess. I'm very needy and get emotionally attached easily. It's been like this since I was a teenager and had a really bad experience. If I've been texting a guy for some time, and suddenly he stops talking to me or takes longer to reply, I get really upset and hurt, even if I don't like the guy. I'm afraid of developing such relationships because I don't want to be used to getting messages from someone. Recently, I met a guy and we've been texting day and night but now he doesn't bother replying sometimes. He previously initiated all our conversations, so I kinda got used to receiving texts from him everyday. Now I actually feel extremely disappointed when I look at my phone and see that I haven't received a message. I know it's really stupid and obsessive of me to be like this, but I have no idea how to get rid of such feelings. I'm quite introverted and it takes a long time for me to open up to someone and equally long to get over such 'almost relationships'. Any suggestions?

On the surface, the book How to Win Friends And Influence People and How to Stop Worrying and Start Living doesn’t seems to give relationship advise but on a deeper look, it does.

Here are some relationship advises you can learn from the book How to Win Friends And Influence People
1) Arouse in the other person an eager want. Instead of thinking about getting a good girlfriend, why not, think about giving the girl a good boyfriend instead?
2) Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers. Instead of confessing directly to a girl and hope that she will accept you, why not, let her be attracted to you first and make her think that he gained a boyfriend.
3) Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. Think about it. If you are a girl, would you give your number to some random boy?
4) Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. Similar to point 2

Here are some advises from How to Stop Worrying And Start Living
5) Use the law of averages to outlaw your worries. So what if you crush rejected you? There are many people you can potentially fall in love with. If this isn’t true, you wouldn’t have a crush on anyone else except your first crush.
6) Cooperate with the Inevitable. What is the first thing you should do after a breakup? Accept it. Acceptance is the key to recovery from losses.
7) Expect ingratitude. Instead of complaining that girls don’t like nice guy, why not, do nice thing for girls unconditionally and expect ingratitude.
8) Count your blessings, not your troubles. Instead of complaining about the flaws your girlfriend has, why not, think about what make you like her in the first place?

Hi all. Really need some practical advice with this. Have been feeling this way since last year and upon turning 23, the desire to move out has only increased. As a young woman I feel like I need to have my own space, not only for privacy and practical reasons which I will explain, but also for self-expression etc. 

I am not an angry person who hates living with family. Most of the time, I am okay with it and in fact, I feel privileged to be able to live with my parents, and be able to come home for dinner and have a nice warm bed to sleep in. My mom is also a wonderful person, I feel like I owe her a lot because she takes really good care of me. But there's one caveat: the life which I aspire to have simply isn't the life I have right now. My lifestyle habits are rather different from my family: I am an early riser they are not; I like eating clean they do not; I love peace and serenity while they feel that noise adds life to the house and they can get pretty insensitive about it. As I am the lone voice, I often get into big trouble with my parents which may result in huge fights actually. If I could I would have rented a room elsewhere, but my finances do not permit it. And my parents read it to be an offensive and unfilial decision. Sigh. I really do not like certain lifestyle choices which my two siblings have, e.g. Gaming and shouting at 1am or being very messy and cluttering up the house. Every reminder I make for them to keep quiet or clean up is taken to be offensive and an instigator for family quarrels (which I "lose out"). 

It almost feels as though I will never have my own space. I fear moving in with my in-laws after getting married; I even fear that the same issues would arise if I move into a rented apartment with my bf (that is, if I do get attached and married next time). Just some circumstances which always run through my mind... I can't always be outside home because I do have to do work at home because of the com and other technical stuff. And when we fight they would just tell me to stay outside home for all I want or move out, simply because they know I do not have the means. Hall and residence is not an option - finances, and plus I am graduating soon, so what for. 

I don't know what I am getting at. But I think this is something that many people can relate to. I envy those young adults who can get their own apartments in other countries and grow into their own. I like that. And I want that for myself. Sigh. Advice is much appreciated, and thank you in advance.

What does it mean when a guy is cold to me on WhatsApp but rather sweet or flirts with me in person with or without others around? Can someone enlighten me?

Time can never mend the careless whispers, of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find

Should've known better

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you are not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

P.s. It is not wham... it is WHAM !!!

I know what I want: to love and be loved; not to love and be hurt, devastatingly, over and over, ... till such time when I revert to the girl I once was who had no feelings and no will to live life pursuing anything beyond basic survival.

It is too late now. Gone are the days of chasing love, passions and happiness. How can you, when you can't even feel?

My friends are teasing me with this guy in school since were kinda close and I do admit I like him but whenever they tease us, his reactions are always poker/blank. Are your reactions different when being teased with someone you like compared with someone you dont?

Seems like i have seen quite a few confessions regarding relationship based on appearances. I shall give my truthful opinions regarding this matter.

1) Q: Are you superficial?
   A: Yes

2) Q: Have you had any suitors?
   A: Yes. Great personality, fun to be with, hardworking person, but i can't accept them because i am just now physically attracted to them

3) Q: So you only go for good looking people?
  A: No. They can be good looking but that doesn't mean i like them in that way.

4) Q: If your suitor is good looking, even if there was no feelings initially, will you give the person a chance?
  A: Yes, most likely. But that is just to try it out initially to see whether both of us have chemistry. Because since i am physically attracted to them and the looks factor don't bother me, they pass the first stage for us to date and progress further if possible.

5) Q: Have anyone that isn't that attractive caught your attention because of their personality?
  A: Yes. Some of them are really confident that made me feel that their personality outweighs their looks. 

6) Q: Didn't you say that if the person is not attractive, usually you won't give them chance?
  A: It varies from one person to another. Someone might find them ideal but not me. But in my opinion, if i really , just really, doesn't find him physically attractive enough, i am guilty of casting him aside as potential partner regardless of how great his personality is , or how hard he tried. It is just how my heart feels.

Evergreen dude here. I have been looking out for a girlfriend since forever, but haven't had any luck so far because I simply don't know how to express interest the right way, nor do I know how to gauge a girls interest in me. 
Now my social circle is getting smaller, since I am already graduating and my female friends are either attached or engaged, and I often hang out with only guys now, so I have absolutely no female friends to ask out at all.

I am also shy, so randomly approaching strangers for dates is close to impossible for me. I have also tried apps like tinder, but most girls on there are just to validate themselves with likes and just ignore all of my messages.

Some of you might say go volunteer, go join some activities outside, go to church to meet girls. But often times the duration that you can interact with them is very little, and being the shy guy like me, to interact and converse properly with a stranger is hard enough, let alone an attractive girl, who is most probably attached anyway. Also, they are always with friends, so when I go this events I will just be a loner at the corner anyway..

I think I really need a step by step approach on how to get girls out to date without being desperate. Any ladies men willing to give advice?

Social life's a trade-off, and sometimes I learn it the hard way. 

I go to all my lessons/meals alone, and am expecting to do so for the next 3 years. I admit it gets lonely sometimes. But that's not what I'm ranting about.

Whatever social life I've prior to NUS just doesn't glue.
4 of us (Me and 3 other girls) signed up for an event. Long story short, the event details were finalised after we signed up, and it included some height elements. The 4 of us have this group chat. And when Girl A said she was scared of heights, and suggested that we withdraw from the event, Girl B echoed the same thing. 

Tbh, I got a little irritated as I'd pushed away another event to make it for this.
Girl B took it one step further and msged me privately about really not wanting to go, and start persuading me to echo that we withdraw, even after I'd told her I already made sacrifice to make it for this. After a while, I ignored her msges. 

As Girl B stayed silent in the group chat for the whole week, girl C suggested we can opt out of the height elements that day. And now a day before the event, Girl B broke out to the whole group that we can go without her.

Why are relationships so hard to maintain? Why do I not want to do anything to repair these relationships? I feel so callous and yet too tired to do anything. I can't talk on an emotional level. I feel like a freaking sociopath. 

Even when a friend confided in me about his emotional health, I feel awkward sympathising, and would end up trying to change the topic. This s*cks. I can't do social, it's tiring as h*ll.    
-
 
 This is general given that you didn't provide specific details. If you can manage on your own, then that's fine. If you can't, you simply can't. You can't change that fact now. Don't push it. Know when it's time to seek help, and everyone needs help from others from time to time, even the strongest or smartest people.

1 - If you can't help yourself, simply seek proper help. What is to be considered proper help might not be the best help you can really get, but you have no choice but to make do. Find friends? Talk to your professor? Seek a counsellor?
2 - Know that help from others is limited, especially when you don't cooperate, don't help yourself, or the like.
3 - Reflect and work on being able to handle similar situations better in the future.

Sometimes I feel so lonely that all I really want is a big warm hug. :( When I was young, I remember I tried to hug my mum on a few occasions but she pushed me away and hugged my younger sister instead. I remember feeling jealous, angry and hurt at that time and after that I gave up trying. I couldn't understand why she would do that. 
Recently this feeling of wanting physical affection keeps getting stronger and I even daydream of the my sweet guy friend (whom I think I have a crush on) embracing me warmly. Just the thought of it makes me feel warm inside. He is the kindest, most genuine soul that I have met in uni and I value him as more than a friend. 
However, I can't ask him or any of my other friends directly for a hug as it will be weird to do so without proper reason. (And I am not the touchy-with-friends type of girl) But on the other hand, I don't know how much longer I can withstand this craving for physical affection. I also think I might be looking for a relationship mainly for the physical affection. Anyone felt this way before?
-
 
 Continue conversations in real life or WhatsApp? What if he/she also thinks she/he is not good enough for you? 
-
 
Why do I suddenly lose all my funny nature and cool persona in front of the girl I like?

I think I'm above average looking person with a likeable personal character. I know there are girls who kind of like me... but why God why, my mind goes complete blank when I'm on freaking first date with her?

Now I so wanna cry every day.

GUY X - THE BUSINESSMAN
Just when I thought I have finally met the "right" one, who matches up in terms of personality, frequency in humour, maturity level, physical attraction, social skills, ie. someone whom I can see a future with, recess week kinda spoiled it all since we are both in different courses and we got really busy and didn't get to see each other that much. Admittedly I have been really busy with my projects and I didn't even get to see my family at all, and conversely he must have been really occupied with studying for his midterms. Surprising how much a week of non-contact can do :/ We were progressing really well prior to recess week, IMO. Additionally he is not good with texting, thus making non-face-to-face communication difficult. Sometimes I do feel neglected and recently I do feel as though he doesn't care about anyone else other than his school work. But other than that, he has everything which I look for in a partner.

GUY Z - THE LAWYER
And then there comes the tricky part, when I feel as though I am starting to develop feelings for GUY Z. He is really good at what he does, and has been someone whom I deeply admire (but not attracted till recently) ever since we got to be in the same class for one semester last year. (His passion for the course and intelligence are really sexy) He is a really nice and humble guy, but his affluent family background (he has expensive hobbies & owns a sports car) is unfortunately a major turn-off for me. 

Unlike Guy X, who has this habit of ignoring texts as he gets really preoccupied with his own work, Guy Z gives me lots of attention. He will take initiatives to look for me, and responds within minutes to my texts despite his heavy personal commitments. He will also attempt to make me laugh and entertain me whenever. ]And of course, I find that we have more common topics to talk about since we are in the same course, yet I find our conversations do not go into deeper levels, like those that I can have easily with Guy X.

Guys X and Z have shown signs which assure me that they are sufficiently interested, and are both inspiring to me in their own ways (something which I look for in a r/s). If only Guy X can afford more time to spend with me :( And now I'm getting increasingly attracted to Guy Z. Sigh.

But I have a bad feeling about all these, that nothing will work out with either of them, just like my previous almost-lovers experiences.

Not sure if it's a problem with me. Destined to be alone forever.

If you were me, what would you do?

Can anyone share why do a large number of girls tend to avoid speaking to you face to face if they are unhappy with you over something? SOMETIMES, they rather do it over text. I mean some things are difficult to discuss about, yes, but some things could be resolved pretty quickly. Anyone care to explain?
P.S. I am referring to some, not all so dont judge or hate.
-
 
The reason why I don't continue conversations is not because I'm not interested but because although I really like you, I don't feel good enough for you. I'm not sure if you really know what you want.
-
 
Dear girls, if you are working would you find it 

a) annoying
b) cute
c) other - please explain

if a boy comes over asking to buy you coffee.

 I have faced this obstacle before in my very first relationship. I hope to get this to your boyfriend and all other confused guys out there facing a similar issue because it's the formula to a long lasting relationship (NOT all girls).

Back then, the picture was roughly this:
1. Don't show care and concern: X
(Proceed to 2.)
2. Show care and concern: X
(The man thinks to himself for instance: If 1. and 2. are both wrong, what exactly is wrong? Maybe the form of my expression of care and concern is wrong. But how exactly is asking how her day was any different from other forms of expression of care and concern? Okay, maybe I'm really wrong. Proceeds to 3.)
3. Show a particular way of care and concern: ✓?

That's the wrong model guys. X. Because she may simply say, as I've always heard from my ex back then: "Now I tell you then you do it?" Do you then continue to try to comprehend the situation? No. X. There's only one answer and one answer only, and that is, "I'm sorry."

Looks really don't matter. Looking at all these 'I can't find a gf' posts is really depressing. Groom yourself. I get that you need to go for someone with character, but you need to be attracted to a person first right? How you carry yourself in terms of the way you dress plays a huge part! I'm often attracted to men who dress really well and often at times, they are pretty average looking.  Fashion isn't that expensive too if money is a concern. TBH I find that men's clothing are more affordable then women's!

Haiz..how I wish someone confess to me and say she likes me. But too bad..I'm just the average looking nerd with no muscular body to attract girls.

Hi,

Just wondering why do friends slowly distance from u even though there haven't any arguments etc.. It's just like slowly lost contact with each other. I understand relationship works in both ways, perhaps it is my fault, but I just could not figure out what happened. 

I have decided to share my story here and hope others could help me figure out or give advice to my issue. Sorry, my story might be a little lengthy.

"So....I went for an overseas school trip. I went for this programme alone as none of my friends got into this programme. I guess I am an Ambivert girl, I tend to be shy and awkward with people at first but when I get comfortable with them, I will be talkative. I decided to go for this trip despite having no friends along as I feel it may be a good platform to boost my social skills, making new friends etc and also to gain the experience. 

It was a small group for this overseas programme. As there are seven girls, I had two roommates. Let's name them Roomie A & Roomie B. The three of us got along pretty well. However during the trip, there are a few incidents which I felt the other girls do not really like one of my roommates, Roomie A. I remained neutral as I do not like taking sides. Slowly, I felt that Roomie B does not like this Roomie A too. She would be hanging out more often with the other four girls instead of us (me & Roomie A ). Roomie A told me she knew that Roomie B has a WhatsApp group with the other girls but did not include her in.. which it kinda made her feel left out or something? (*I did not have WhatsApp then). There are times that Roomie A told me she can feel Roomie B are like distancing from us, and she also felt that the other girls do not like her. (*Ps just for info: The other four girls were already friends before this trip.)
I decided to stick with Roomie A more as I understand that being ostracised is not a good feeling. Roomie B and the other girls still get along with us well, it is just that sometimes they tend to hang out together, leaving me and roomie A alone. I guess the guys might be able to sense about this situation but they remained neutral. On the surface, everyone seems to get along well. I enjoyed myself during this trip, and I felt everyone (esp the other girls) are fine with me.

When we returned back to Singapore, as I did not have Whatsapp then, I felt I have missed out in some ways. However, it did not really bother me then as I felt that as long Roomie A and I are keeping in contact, I'm fine. Slowly I realised that Roomie A is actually quite close with some of the guys in the trip. She has been keeping contact with them. I did not really talked to the guys as I am pretty shy and awkward with guys... I guess I am more comfortable with being friends with girls?
Roomie A and I still kept in contact for quite a while. I did not really kept in touch with the other girls including Roomie B because partly I felt they are kinda obvious in not wanting Roomie A to "join" them (hence, unknowingly I guess I kinda choose to be with Roomie A. And thus, perhaps the other girls sort of treated me and her the same?). "

Ok to sum up. One day, Roomie A and I met up for some school event. While casually chatting, She told me that she went out with the few guys (our trip mates). I was quite surprised because I did not know about it and she did not ask me along etc. I understand perhaps maybe it was some impromptu outing... but the fact that  Roomie A did not even ask me if I wanna join them along makes me felt left out. At that moment, I can't help but felt a little "betrayed" (in a way). I mean, usually for girls, she will ask you to join her along especially if she is going out with a group of guys alone for the first time? (that's what I think for most girls...Sorry if I'm wrong).
Slowly, Roomie A and I distanced. However, I know Roomie A is still close with the guys and they are still keeping in touch. 

To end off, I felt a little upset that Roomie A chose to be close with the guys and neglected me once she is close with them. Perhaps she is those girls who prefer to mix around with guys, but the fact that she did not once asked me along to join them.. kinda convey a meaning to me. At times, I do have a thought that... "what if during the trip I have been closer with the other girls instead of Roomie A? Perhaps I would have gained true friends instead." 
I understand it is not right to think it that way but I couldn't help it. Through this incident, I feel that sometimes being a neutral person doesn't always seems to be a good thing. Or perhaps the problem lies with me? Maybe it is the way how I deal things.

Sorry for the lengthy post. Thanks for reading it.

The other day I saw a fat nerdy guy with a fairly pretty girl clutching his arm in Utown... It's depressing when I gym and club and join CCAs and talk to girls in my tutorial and everything else people suggest to find a girlfriend and still don't have one.
-
 
The last time I saw him was on Saturday. He said something hurtful that made me want to weep. I made my way home as quickly as possible; I laid down and gave myself over to sleep.

I woke up and the days flew by. It is Friday now and I have not felt a single thing since that night, except fatigue; everyday, after work, I head home and just lie on the bed and I fall asleep.

We have not had a proper conversation since Saturday. He had long given up on communicating with me and I don't blame him. There is simply nothing to say. Beyond my few pitiful and necessary attempts at work, I had not been able to engage anyone in conversation for the past week.

So, this is how the end of 4 years looks like. Why don't I feel a thing?
-
 
How would you know if it's sincere tho or if he just have nothing else to say/ask?

It has been so long, 8 months to be exact, and you may think that I have moved on. But I remember what we had like it was just yesterday. I don't know what brought you to send me a message at 3:30am a few months ago, apologising for everything. But I will never forgive you for taking everything away from me in an instant for no good reason. You can tell me that we were already drifting apart all you want. But we both know that you forced the drift to happen so it would be easier for you later on. I was so surprised when I found out that you had easily replaced me in a few months. How did you forget everything we had for 3 years in just 3 months and move on so easily? Because even after what you did to me, all the shit you put me through, and all this time, I am still not able to move on. I'm sorry, but I will never forgive you for taking yourself away from me.

It's ironic how that one funny guy you like so much could make you cry the most.

To  Some girls actually like skinny, nerdy (but tall) guys and often the one with humour. I do, so cheer up. And if only confessing to a guy is as simple as that. Girls fear rejection more.

How do you guys move on? No troll here. This hurts so badly everyday I don't even now when all these crap are going to cease

 Here's my understanding of people like you since I'm one myself.

Short version:
They don't get angry over small stuffs and they do have a high tolerance level. But sadly, there are instances where people can really push you pass the edge. At this point of time, there's definitely explosion but I would think the manner of explosion varies from individual to individual. Perhaps some would vent it out through screaming, abusing a punching bag or walls, or worst come to worst, start getting violent on the opposite party (really not a pushover kind).

Long version (w/ advice):
Stage 1: Either things are too petty for your concern or you're simply upset. In the latter case, things don't call for much concern and you're only pissed at that moment. Hold it in and you'll be fine the next day. I would think that's a sign of maturity so that's good.
Stage 2: People are starting to get on your nerves but well, you're already past stage 1 and it's best to settle things before any escalation. I would think here's the dilemma you mentioned where you don't want to ignite conflict (still want to maintain as friends, acquaintance, or you still need to look at the person's face from time to time), and the truth is that you still can tolerate. The right way to go here would definitely be to send signals. You definitely want them to be effective. The issue now is how many signals and how strong of a signal you want to send, and how you want to send that signal, either now or in the future. It really varies from here on and depends on the parties involved including yourself. You just need know that you can't possibly send no signal or full signal.
Stage 3: You are at the brim and either your signals were ineffective or that the other party/parties has/have serious issues, or both. But to reach to this point with your high threshold level, no matter how bad your signals were, (to put it in a very nice way) the problem has to lie elsewhere. It's best to stay away from the other party/parties less you explode. If it's not obvious, that's not good because at that stage, you can't control yourself and there's no return. You don't want to do anything reckless.
Stage 4: Things are beyond your control and you explode. Remember to clean up the mess and hopefully things aren't serious.

Few more things to note: For such people, best try to settle things at stage 1 and 2, and that should be easy considering your tolerance. There are many ways not mentioned here to do that and perhaps even prevent stage 1. Also if you're willing, you can always severe the ties at any stage and the problem is solved. But that also means that the other party/parties is/are to a certain extent not important to you. Also, as in all human relationships, there's bias. So some really do get special privileges and stay longer at each stage.

If your girlfriend starts talking to your good friend and they click off very well, talking all the way till midnight and stuff. On the other hand, she starts to be colder to you, talking to you only when there's assignment or homework to consult you, what will you do? 

Please help, thank you.

so there is a certain somebody in my major and we recognize each other after having taken a few similar modules and we'll smile at each other when we see each other! he has a very sweet cheery smile, seems like a sweet guy! but never actly had the chance to talk to him which is kinda sad. idk where i'm going with this post but I guess just trying to say that smiling can rly brighten somebody's day! so smile, people! especially you, kind-of-but-not-quite-a-stranger, keep smiling! (: hopefully we'll become proper friends someday!

Hi, I'm currently also facing the same situation as ... On top of that my girlfriend was also touchy with the guy during our overseas trip. She said this is nothing and she just treats him as a close friend. Is this acceptable? I really don't want to see this relationship goes up in smoke as I like her very much. What should I do?

Really need advice on this. Thanks!

In the midst of midterm revision and there's something weighing on my mind. 
What is the best way to resolve conflicts? I often try to tell myself that it is pretty useless to have a huge reaction over things that don't go your way, since 5 or 10 years down the road they probably wouldn't matter. And hence, whenever something upsets me, I try to play down my displeasure and tell myself "it's okay". This is especially so when it's someone you love saying something/doing something that resulted in that displeasure, and because you love that person, you tell them "it's fine" and just let it go. But sometimes, you start to wonder if letting it go too frequently makes you seem like someone who is okay with anything, and you become a pushover. And sometimes you actually do feel hurt but you just don't want to say you're hurt because you think this conflict won't matter 5 years later... Maybe it's healthier to just say you're hurt? But you don't want to ignite conflict...
Ah. So conflicted.

So I've only ever been in a relationship once that lasted for three years until the end of the first year of army. Since then, I've never committed myself again to asking girls out because I felt there was too much energy and time involved. I couldn't do the whole emotional rollercoaster and the ignoring you for days bullshit again. (I lost my ex to hall activities that took up her weekends which was the only time I was out of camp) I decided for myself that single life was better off and I remained cold emotionally for a long time. 

Until only recently, I met this girl who was able to stir my heart once more. Although we don't get to see each other much because of different timetables, I was really happy whenever she was around. Eventually I asked her out once. She was willing and very spontaneous. We sat for dinner and talked for about 4 hours straight before we left the place. She even said she'd like to take me out to dinner around the time of my birthday. I was over the moon. 

So about a week or so later, I asked if she wanted to catch a movie w me again, this time she said no. I wasn't sure if it was because of the movie choice or if she just wasn't interested and just wanted to stay as friends. I also get that she's a busy person. Usually I would text and reply within 10 mins of her messages. She on the other hand would take hours or even a whole day to reply. I don't really mind it at all, but sometimes I would just stare at my whatsapp chat with her especially when she's online, hoping that it'll suddenly go "typing..". 

Perhaps I'm thinking too much about it but nonetheless I'm still hopeful. There are so many things that I like about her and I hope she'll give me a chance to prove myself. Oh and if she's reading this, try not to sleep too late past 2. She has a really bad sleeping habit. 

Sorry for the long post and best of luck to those with the remaining mid terms! :)

Girl gives me her number, tells me to text her. I sms her. No reply. Wondering if she was expecting me to whatsapp her. I know she has whatsapp. Does she expect me to create a whatsapp account? What do I do next? I am so confused T.T

I don't know why but sometimes some guys assume that I am interested in them more than a friend. I actually find it very refreshing to meet new friends and peoples' personalities to be interesting. Also I find it easier to make friends with guys. But why is it that it is so hard for people to believe that platonic relationships do exist? Its like a I'm interested in you but im interested in how you tick and I enjoy your company. Not the romantic way. Sorry for the rant.

This guy keeps telling me about his knee and stomach problems. But, he can play badminton last week and captain ball this week, with his hall friends. He eats supper with them as well. If he can do all these, then he shouldn't keep emphasizing on those pain so much, everyday. I can understand if he is hurt here and there, but if he is not even taking care of his body till it recovers, then he shouldnt talk about it everyday. Sorry, i just could not take it anymore.

People always say, if you want something , go and do it. Try it. Risk it. You won't know if you don't try. But the thing here is, at some point in time, when you consider certain factors that pull the chances of your success down by a considerable amount and you have been through the same failure many times because of the very same factor that pulled your chances down, why really keep trying? Don't you guys agree that there is the entity inside our mind that tell us to mitigate the emotional trauma associated to failure but deep down inside we still hope that we can really succeed and desire what we really want and choose to ignore what is the truth? What i am talking about is the recipe for disasters, when non-good looking person like i am chase after someone who is above average looking. Yes, i admit i am superficial and that is true and others can be superficial too. Totally respect that. But this vicious cycle seems to keep going. I just really hope that the feelings won't come again though i know it is something i cannot control, because if it comes, there will be some happiness of liking someone and talking to them yet at the same time mostly sadness awaits. This, i believe, is mostly true for people like me who don't look good as compared to others.

I met a girl whose personality and character is really different from the girls I'm used to dating. She is down to earth, fun, fashionable and has a lot of sass. However, the downside is that she really lacks in the looks department. I don't know how long the emotional attraction can last without physical attraction or how long will it be before I give into peer pressure. Advice pls

We singles always live every day as it passes by. Some days it's good, some days it's bad. But everyday we should try to make a conscious choice to appreciate and live our day without letting our singlehood get into our eye and mope over it when we see everyone around us getting hitched. And even if we do have days that we feel crap because we hate the idea of being single and having nobody to share our lives with, hey it's ok, we're all humans, we're fallible. Every day is a small addition to our own personal history, our own story. And when the right person hopefully comes along when the Fates decide it to be so, I hope that girl likes my story, scars and happiness all.
Still recovering from a bad breakup here. But at least now I'm well on the road to recovery and rediscovery. :)

Sadness, a vast bleak ocean of melancholy is all I can feel.
Whenever I come across a post about loneliness, depression and the like, my heart breaks just a little. My heart goes out to everyone who is hurting. I am going through a very lonely period after lying to myself that everything was fine for a long time.
I wish I could find the strength and wisdom to pick myself up and mend my broken heart. Let me please catch sight of a little hope.

PS: This is not a post-break-up post. I have friendship issues.

Can someone explain to me why people read your messages, and then reply ranging from 1 hour to a whole day later with a whole barrage of texts? It makes me feel like, 'oh, I guess you don't care' to like 'omg you actually do care and you care a lot??' It's putting me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions because a) I'm someone who really cares about my friends and b) I know I'm overthinking. But I just wanted to know what goes on in their heads when they do this? Why? What's the reasoning and motive?
-
 
Just something that I really needed to get off my chest + ask for some advice :/
There's a guy in my clique that I really like, and he's really upz so I know for sure he wouldn't like an average girl like me. On days when he compliment random chiobus we see around school, I feel really depressed and just wallow in self-pity... I wish I could be pretty to so he can notice me. I mean, I know he isn't superficial; he's the kind who thinks about a relationship very deeply and very thoroughly before getting into one. But sometimes, I just wish I could be a little bit more attractive to him, so he could notice me more... 
But that's all in the past. Nowadays, I hang around him all the time because I want to stop getting all those butterflies in my stomach whenever I see him. Maybe if I kept seeing you I'll be "desensitised", and just see you as a bro. I really hope that day comes soon because I imagine that you'll be very disturbed by me liking you... I'm sure you will find it creepy that I hang around you while I like you. I'm sorry that I couldn't control my feelings better :(
Even after I have convinced myself that this is a good and right thing to do, on some nights like this, I stare into space and my heart is filled with sadness and regret. Why can't I be that pretty girl who makes your head turn? Why couldn't I have met you earlier and have more opportunities to impress you? Why can't I have a chance too...?
Sorry, in the end just kinda became ranting :/ I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is effective... Has anyone tried to forget your "liking" for someone like this? How long does it take? And if I'm really not his type, would he be very disgusted when he realises that I liked him? If that's the case, I'm find a way to convince myself to screw off far far away from him :'(
Thanks so much in advance everyone, thanks for reading my annoying rant and all the best for midterms :)

It is unfair that you will never grow older while I still will. You will always be remembered as the indomitable one, always too cool, always exciting. Your smile was radiant, and still is, because thats how I remember seeing it. That was 4 years before it decided to take a hiatus and I never saw you again. 
That is one of the regrets I have about skipping church for those 4 years.

 I became curious about what happened to you, how u did it, why u did it, where did u do it, maybe because no one told me anything. I don't blame them. You and I were hardly close friends and there wasn't a need for me to know. I never even attended your last party. Was there even one? I don't know.

I became curious ever more so, how your pretty face looked like, all shattered and brokn. Maybe because I couldn't accept that you had left time through mere words from friends. Seeing is believing afterall. Maybe you had shattered so completely upon impact that there wasn't much to bring back to Singapore. Or had ballooned up so much you would have stank up the airplane bringing you back, or that you were actually in Singapore all the long and I didn't know. 

You will always be remembered as the young cheerful girl, full of energy and hope, a spark in the river of lives. Everyone else will grow older except you. You have travelled forward in time. And now your younger sister will become older than you, and I see her every week. She is lovable and energetic and as lively as you were and I treasure that, but can't help imagining the loss inside her. Maybe one day she will of her own accord tell me your story, of the note you left behind and of the wonderful person you will be remembered as.

Till we meet in heaven, dear sister in Christ.

Because you've become something of an addiction. And I constantly long for any kind of interaction with you. Because you've set the standard so high that anyone else can't compare to your companion; I would rather be with you than with them. All the time. It's unhealthy.

Hi there, I am .

No, I am not looking for a cheatsheet. Rather, I am looking for examples. Like you guys said, what makes one girl tick cna make another turn off, so I just want to find out what makes the different girls tick and see how I can adapt them to my situation.

TL:DR, dont act smart and give me stupid answers. This is not a social science paper where everything is "it depends"

 Well, have you tried doing something nice for a lady? It is not as simple as it seems.

If you're sincere enough, though, you will be sensitive enough to consider others' feelings towards your actions.

If you're doing something "nice" and you mind it, take note of it, you're actually expecting something out of it. Isn't that a bit paradoxical?

Of course, more often than not, people do things with strings attached, but that does not necessarily mean that he/she is not a nice person. 

A lady can just flat out refuse the invitation, and the guy's (see how he handles it) just trying his luck. Nothing wrong with that, but you really cannot generalise such scenarios.

Many of us have done nice things for others, and people, in general, are actually very nice, if you know them better, instead of judging them and focusing on their character flaws from the sidelines.

Then again, there are people going around with that "I am a nice guy" attitude.

Very common, nothing wrong with that, but do you know the difference, between "aiya, ok one lah~", and "I sacrifice my effort for this, I am doing something nice, I am a nice guy, 我是好人"?

If you're a nice person, the first and foremost thing, that you must know, admit and accept, is that you're quite far away from being the nicest person on earth.
-
 
Whenever a boy says that girl is so pretty, others will say she already have a boyfriend.

Having a boyfriend and being pretty isn't mutually exclusive. In fact, it is usually in union

People assume that a guy like a girl just because he think he is pretty. This shows that male are superficial creature and can like a girl just because he find her pretty. This make sense because according to the YouTube video Why Sexy is Sexy, beauty is a language that convey health and fertility. It is a male's instinct to find a fertile woman to give birth to alot of offspring to  ensure the survival of homo sapien. 

Man cannot be friend with the woman he find attractive. Most people just assumed the guy wanted to be that girl's boyfriend instead of just friend.

If you want to do nice thing for a girl, do it unconditionally.

First of all, if you do "nice" thing for a girl with an agenda, you are actually a bad person. Imagine that you are a girl and is asking for donation when a guy walks up to you and offers to donate $10 on a condition. You have to give her your number, watch movie with him and date him, do you think the guy is a nice guy?

He is not a nice guy. He is emotionally black mailing the girl and expect the girl to prostitute herself over just $10.

Secondly, human tend to take kind act for grant. Don't be surprised if she doesn't remember your kind act.

How do you know if you are a "nice" guy or a good person?

Ask yourself these 2 questions
1) For those nice thing you are doing to a girl, would you do the same for a male friend you know for the same period of time?
2) Would you still do those nice act even if she doesn't remember it?

Just witnessed one of the most tragic things in NUS. Just sat at a seat in one of the shuttle buses which was in full view of this: a girl tripping in front of a group of people who not only refused to help, but also laughed at her situation as if it was the funniest thing in the world. I would have rushed to help if I wasn't in the bus. Imagine the physical and emotional trauma the girl had to go through from her fall which could have relieved if she was in front of a group of empathetic humans instead.
Nothing is more tragic than laughing at another's agony and pain on top of not lending the person a helping hand. To this group of unfeeling people, the 'friends' you laughed with just now could just do the very same thing to you. Even if they do not, you should be embarrassed hanging out with such people who lack the basic empathy they should have, no matter how educated they are.

 First of all, please don't say such things or take such words lightly, especially to the guy on the other side, whether or not he is your date/partner or otherwise. It's extremely hurtful and some words and actions once said or done, cannot be taken back. What I'm about to say doesn't represent the views of all guys nor am I intending to offend any girls. I'm not generalising either.

Personally, I dare say that I do such things unconditionally but even if the guy has an agenda other than wanting you to be happy, please don't expect us to treat you girls unconditionally, because frankly, we don't owe you girls that. It's the same the other way around. We don't expect you girls to date us given that we've asked you girls out or have done some nice things for you girls. If you are concerned about sincerity, you can observe that for yourself. Ask yourself if he really likes you, if you're really worth $10 to him, if he really expects you to prostitute yourself whatever that means. Regardless, what I've said still stands.

Here's the complication. It's a whole different story altogether if the girl has agreed to turn up but has intentionally disappeared with an excuse or otherwise, is late on purpose, or misleads the other party into thinking she is going to turn up but doesn't. Things are seriously wrong here on many levels. I've experienced this several times and whether or not that's who you are, please don't take it personally. Using your donation example, it's as if the girl has lied or has intentionally misled the guy into thinking that if he donates $10, she will give him her number, watch movie with him and date him, but when he donates, all of which don't occur. To worsen things, the girl may say that she doesn't owe him anything, or that he has only himself to blame for being so gullible, or that he ought to treat the girl unconditionally. If things are still not obviously wrong, try switching gender roles. Respect is key here and things are not wrong only on this level. Think about it.

In the current context, you've defined a "nice" guy or good person as one who would:
1) For those nice thing you are doing to a girl, would you do the same for a male friend you know for the same period of time?
2) Would you still do those nice act even if she doesn't remember it?
With respect to 1), when guys value each other, it's more of being loyal, helpful, sticking their guts out for one another and so on. And you can't define a "nice" guy or a good person that way. Even if there's a common measure, just because someone treats their romantic interest "better" than his bros (same known time or equal strength in bonds), that doesn't mean he's not a "nice" guy or a good person. Same applies in reverse. A person can be a "nice" guy or a good person but just value them differently. With respect to 2), it really depends. I would think most "nice" guys or good persons you have in mind would still do it as the girl would still be happier for that moment. But some guys may simply be more practical yet at the same time sincere. I don't see how he's not a "nice" guy or a good person in which case, and especially so if the girl is also practical and considerate, and doesn't want the guy to "waste" money.

Hello Ladies. 

I am in the midst of trying to win the heart of an evergreen girl. But I am not sure what to do. From my understanding, girls like the feeling of "being wooed". Please tell me, how do I evoke these feelings? And more importantly, how do I do it without being seen like a weirdo (i mean there has to be some pace or something to it right?)?

Thank you in advance.

 If she talk to you daily, then that is a good sign. If she is already hinting you to ask her out, then that is a really good sign.

小新post No 2: Besides his family, 小新's friends are really cute too. I actually shipped 正南and妮妮together when they grow up. The bromance between 小新and 风间 is soooo funny. And 阿呆is so reliable. Who do you like the most in the group? 
I think as we grow older, we will start to realize that what we want in life is just a few friends that will stay by our side to share moments of joy and sadness together.  #小新迷。

I'm a guy with little or no sexual attraction to females. That is, I simply cannot visualize myself having sex (when I think of it, it's in a 3rd party POV with black figures motionless on bed). However, I do have what I would call 'crushes' on females, and I wonder if it is 'normal' or could it possibly work out. I am more interesting in companionship, like having a close friend to hear my everyday grumbles and vice versa, meet to study/have fun/for a meal etc. In fact, I'm actually open to a guy 'friend', but considering I get along with my female friends better, it appears more likely that my 'friend' is female

I kinda believe a form of union/marriage that doesnt require sex at all, just emotional intimacy. Minor forms of physical intimacy (eg hugging, kissing) are probably fine with me (I haven't really thought so much about it yet). However, my friends whom I spoke to (including females) believe that it cannot sustain itself in the long run. They told me while marriage isn't just about sex, sex is necessary in such a relationship, and apparently a marriage can be annulled if no sex occurs. 

Just wanted the opinions of people. Do I actually need to learn and appreciate sex as an eventual part of a relationship? Or am I just fine? For avid readers, I kinda think "Breakfast at Tiffany's" sums up my view, but of course, I have no clear idea if I'm thinking too differently.

I'm not happy being single. 

But then again I'm too scared and scarred to contemplate about what direction I want to go in for a future relationship with anyone. No, scratch that. After my last disastrous breakup my whole life was irrevocably scarred. Try being an ISFJ type with life plans five to ten years into the future, and you really thought you found the right person and finally for once things are working out. And then get screwed over in a breakup so bad nobody has the right words to console you, and six months on now when someone asks you "what do you want to do in the future?" you can't even bloody answer the question anymore with any degree of self-confidence. It feels like someone yanked the rug out from under you and you're falling into an abyss with your whole world crumbling around you. And you're still falling and you don't know where the bottom is in sight.

I'm still me. But there is only so much scarring one can take, before he just simply gives up trying because like you said, dating time and time again is like insanity doing the same things over and over expecting different results. I might feel like deluding myself into having hope, that "I'm just growing up and finding myself again/the right person is still out there/good things come to those who wait". But at the end of the night, the only question I can ask of myself is "how can I even believe that there's someone out there for me whom I've never met yet?"

No reason is good enough to justify being single. And there's nothing more scary than being stuck in the middle, unable to consider a future relationship but loathing the feeling of singlehood emptiness when everyone around me is just running off getting hooked up every single goddamn night.

Hi, I'm an evergreen so pardon my basic question. 

Some guys asked me out, and among them I liked some. So we dated for a couple of weeks until our first date and I...fled cause I never felt liking them enough to actually commit to them (i.e. telling people he is my bf when asked) But before that, I really looked forward to their messages and we chatted quite often and that confused me because it made me think I liked them! 

Is it because I am a flirt who just want to be adored or is it normal reaction :( 
-
 
I am an evergreen shy girl. Whenever I am around the guy I like, I cannot act or talk like we do on text. I really want to talk to him but I cannot even talk properly. What do I do?
-
 
Of shy girls, locked doors, close friends...

I'm generally a shy person. I like someone but I think I am giving him mixed signals. As someone shy, I do not express myself readily to him. This will change if I know that he likes me too. I can't speak for every shy girl out there, but I tend to take things slowly. But I am in it for the long run. Why rush things? If he cannot be patient for a few weeks or months (I would like to get to know him better before jumping into anything), then we are probably not suited for each other. What's a few weeks/months compared to years ahead? As for meet-ups, as another confessor said, I will try to free up my time for him. When I say I am not free, I am really really not free. People interact differently. Some people enjoy writing as a means of expression. Others enjoy talking face to face. Given a chance, I would love to see him all the time. That's if and only if we are together. 

To you: if you are reading this and you think this is for you, I really really want to hug you. That is all there is. 

psily: You are the kindest guy I know.

Hi again, I am the OP of . Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the part pertaining to friends raking up the past. I understand where all of you are coming from, but I also feel that it differs from person to person, friendship to friendship.

I get that people who bring up the past aren't necessarily the people with small hearts (paiseh paiseh - I was too quick to generalise!), but like what one commenter mentioned, it is unhealthy when done repeatedly... Especially if the other party comes across as self-righteous and even starts comparing you (the 'best friend', in her words) with other friends, I don't think anyone would feel good yup? At first I thought it was the wine hahahaha I actually asked if my 'friend' was drunk but nope she was sober as hell, so.... Haha. And the convo went on for about three hours or so at the restaurant and the atmosphere turned rather tense because she was basically pointing out all my faults one by one and telling me that I shouldn't do this, shouldn't do that, so again... The waiters were looking at us because the other party looked like she was lecturing me... Yup. While I got really stressed, she actually felt so much better sharing everything. And the reason why she did that was because she was looking through Sec school photos on FB and she remembered everything?! Sigh. I do actually talk about issues from the past with other close friends, but I think that the tone matters a lot. Also, if all is well in the present, I tend to live and let live BUT if issues arise I try to address them as quickly as possible with tact. Not to keep quiet then drag on. And when to bring up the past, is important too. Not during a 'relaxing' dinner and then going on for a few hours haha right? 

While hearing her out I started to remember the tension in the early stages of our friendship but chose to filter a lot of it because the tension was already stressful and people were staring at us. I am not trying to justify myself but only stressing that friendship really is a two-way street. You need to be aware of yourself and your actions, and others' emotions. So sensitivity and self-awareness is crucial really. You can't possibly make me listen to you all the time when you have issues and call me out on what happened almost ten years ago in a restaurant. I am not a confrontational person so it took me aback and really made me pull away from the friendship. Spoke to my bf, older cousins and parents about it and they felt that while I was at the wrong for being immature and causing hurt in the past (girl clique issues), what she did was overboard... Anyway I was too tired emotionally after that. I was drained, 'squeezed dry' (so so sorry but don't know what metaphor (symbol????) to use) Plus, according to her comparison, she had other friends who were more "patient" and easy to talk to, so I just let it be. I Guess the hurt was too much, after all that I had done as a "best friend". So I decided to let it go. 

So I think that these opinions are specific to each friendship but in any case, whatever you do, do it in moderation and with tact. Yup. Anyway thanks for all your comments, I appreciate them. I will also share them with my younger cuzzies - it is good for them to have more perspectives on such issues. ^^

To the "evergreen" girls who were kept awake at night thinking: I have not dated anyone in my life etc ... Is there something wrong with me? Let me say this: if I were to ever write a dating guide for guys, I can't. Because women are so complex that there's no sequence of actions that can definitely hit all the button for any woman. 

But if I were to write a dating guide for girls, it would be one sentence. And one asterisk. It goes something like: "If you are a girl, or even just an effiminate guy, somewhere out there, there is a straight guy* who will f*ck (or date) you".

*quality is non-homogenous and might vary.

A bit more detailed though, so many guys are so desperate that all it takes is a bit of hint for him to jump all over you. Now typically they are not very attractive; not in the alpha male kind of way: the muscular, toned, talkative, confident, funny, humorous, etc ... If you do get in to a relationship, they might even appear to be clingly; which is not attractive as well. Also, men are generally stupid and they don't get the subtle clues and hints to women behaviour. The aforementioned alpha types read these very well and they enjoy it thusly.

I got a huge crush on my classmate. I knew he likes me too but I guess he just couldn't gather the courage to approach me. Other guys in the class came up and talked to me quite comfortably but not him. Think he's too shy. Talking is always the better way to get to know me but I guess other methods are fine right? I just hope he doesn't act like my previous suitors, and intrude too much into my private life (if you girls know what I mean), and doesn't jump to quick conclusions through all the stalking guys (or even we girls) do. I'm shy and not in a hurry as well, so I should just wait it out for now I guess.

I am from NTU. Not long ago, I have gotten to know a girl from NUS biz from some event. 
At first we started hitting off quite well. We texted each other everyday, from morning till night. And then we started going out for study date and movie date. She was very sweet to me, and i started telling her that i like her and stuffs, although she didnt reciprocate, she still continue texting me and going out with me.
However, being over stressful by my workload recently, i was not very understanding when she fell sick, and have multiple small arguments with her that i have regretted. And now she is starting to ignore and treating me very coldly. 
Guys, any advice how to 挽回 this relationship? And if you are reading this, please give me another chance..

I'm on a break recently with my gf due to some issues and met this girl whom I hit it off really well with. But I wonder if it's a real attraction or am I just using her as a distraction. How can I tell which case is it?

I have been hiding from my parents whenever im going out with this guy friend of mine. They somewhat know of it and disapproves but i still lie to them whenever i'm going out with him. Im very guilty from lying previously and currently. But i want to continue going out with him. Was anyone in the same situation before? sigh....
-
 
To  And do you ever know how frustrating it is for someone to keep on guessing if the person really likes her or just "appears" to be liking her? If you like me, just spill the beans already or give more obvious hints. Why flirting today and then the next day, act like normal friends agaim? Why la??There are too many wasted mutual affection because of fear of rejection. And too bad that (most) girls couldn't even make the first moves.

Dear NUSWhisperers,

I noticed recently that some of us have difficulty feeling up to things or just being happy. And as someone who came close to depression but is feeling much better now, I would like to share some practical tips to improve your life - these worked for me and I hope that they will work for you.

1. Jump out of bed, open your windows and curtains 
Getting up quickly in the morning makes you less lethargic and miserable for the rest of the day. I find that experiencing fresh air and sunlight in the morning gives me energy.

2. Exercise
It doesn't have to be a daily 5km run. Doing simple stretching exercises, chest stretches, pushups or even jumping jacks wakes me up and helps me prepare mentally for the day ahead. I find that steps 1 and 2 have improved my daily mood significantly, and I think my friends and family have noticed the difference.

3. Get out of the house/hall/residence
Home is where you are conditioned to rest and your mind to wander, and introverts may know that sometimes your thoughts are self-destructive or self-consuming. So go ANYWHERE outside, to school to study, go shopping, or just walk in the park. Spend as much time outside as possible so that you appreciate your home and come back to rest.

4. Find supportive friends
If you observe very carefully, some of your friends are more genuine than others. Find those that truly care about you, rather than "fair-weathered" or "fun" friends. If you need to get work done, find friends who are driven so that you guys can help and motivate each other. Finally, for those with relationship woes,

5. Spend more time on yourself
I used to be one of those people who preoccupied my time and thoughts about the person I liked, in hindsight, it wasn't a good experience. Now that the infatuation phase is over, I can now speak to her normally and have a genuine interest in her before deciding whether to make a move or not.

The saying goes, "spend so much time improving youself that you have no time to criticise others". Instead of changing yourself so others will like you, I suggest taking time to explore the real you and working towards improving yourself. Have the confidence that someone amazing will be drawn to that, and seize the opportunity when it comes.

Have a great week!! :)

At this age (I am approaching my mid-twenties), I have started to invest less in friendships, i.e. I tend to be less emotionally invested nowadays. Not saying that I advocate insincerity, but perhaps more discretion when it comes to determining who stays in one's social circle of trustworthy and dependable friends. And in some cases, the duration which you have known someone does not matter. Someone you have known for a twelve years may turn out to be a friendship vampire/frenemy while another person whom you have known for three years may actually be a kindred spirit. So keep an open heart yup and be rational. It's quite contradictory  but I don't know how to better describe it. 

I have had bad experiences in the past where close friends treated me like a venting outlet, going on and on their problems whenever we met up. Usually such things went on for hours at a time. And they would go on and on about the same issues quite unapologetically like a broken record. I was unaffected at first, thinking that it was my responsibility to lend a listening ear but over an extended period of time, I found myself drained and weary while the other party felt better after each 'conversation'. I felt like a sponge sopping up all the negative energy in their life and those 'friendship vampires' were taking up my time and energy which I could have set aside for more productive endeavours so to speak... Even when I needed a listening ear, the conversation would somehow end up about them -- yes they did hear me out and gave me advice and stuff, but it seemed as though their issues always took precedence and had to be dealt with first. In the end I really couldn't take it any longer and decided to distance myself away from them. We are all still on good terms but I have put them on the back-burner. They are no longer the people I would think of first when I want to hang out with friends. 

I have far fewer friends now but at least I do not have that negativity in my life and I have more time for the people who truly care for me (my family and relatives, my bf and a couple of close friends). I find myself more positive too, and a reason why I have more time is because I do not have to deal with their texts any longer. Their rants used to continue on WA even after our meet-ups for hours straight and I would have to respond to them lest they question me and I end up feeling guilty for doing otherwise. I actually prefer having acquaintances now because it is just so much easier to handle how much you invest in the relationship. There is more freedom in how much you wanna divulge and keep to yourself. Those 'friends' of mine expected me to share details of my personal life with them because 'we [had] known each other for so long' and they would make me feel guilty for not keeping them updated. Even when I got to know my Bf, they expected me to fill them in with all the details. And they probed when I refused and induced guilt in me. So. I could have handled it more firmly but I didn't have the maturity back then. In retrospect I should have been more outspoken but now I know better. 

Yeah I know this post is pretty circular but hopefully it provides some kind of relatability for the people out there who are experiencing the same thing? Adulthood is a very transitionary period of our lives and many things change, including our relationships with friends. People who used to be 'best friends' realise that they are actually drifting apart (and sometimes for the better really) and acquaintances start to establish strong friendship bonds. And to be honest.... I honestly don't think that there is a need to verbally state who are your 'best friends' -- I mean, we are adults and most of the time, we just know, by intuition, and the thing is, usually the other party gets it too. If there is a need to verbally reaffirm your status, then perhaps there are issues to be dealt with, issues which have been overlooked for a long time. But please - don't 旧事重提(bring up old issues from the past - sometimes it is the breaking point of a friendship. Bringing up bad things which happened NINE years ago in SEC 3 (?!?!?!) when we were immature and impulsive in the midst of a dinner with good food and wine on a weekend isn't exactly the best way to 'clarify' things with your friends-- not even to your 'best friend'!!! (Ehhh.... Best Friend doesn't mean you can just shoot your mouth like that right hahaha) To me it just shows how much that person harbours grudges (记仇) and it really pisses off the other party. It really dampens the mood so even if you MUST do it, do it with discretion and gentleness? Perhaps you could share your thoughts here :)

Hmmm lastly, these issues are inevitable so take it easy yup? We grow up, our personalities change and so do our friends. A few younger cousins shared with me their friendship woes last weekend so I thought I should share my experiences just in case some people are struggling win similar issues. It may be difficult for a while but honestly, it works out well in the end as Long as you treat people the way you want to be treated. :) jiayou everyone!! :D

I have never been in a relationship before but I did progress to the 'almost lover' stage with a few guys in my life. Time and again, I am able to hit it off very well with the guy, communicating very single day and I am quite sure that there were mutual feelings involved. However,  the conversation always die down and we gradually drifted apart, leaving me thinking if I am the one with an issue since this always happens to me. 

Anyone with the same encounter and thoughts on this?
-
 
Does anyone else occasionally realize that they have been so selfish and self-centered their entire life? 

When you realize that almost all our time is spent thinking about ourselves - obsessing over a stupid interview mistake, replaying events in your head over and over again, having imaginary conversations with people where you argue and win, thinking about what others think of you, and thinking of ways to sound smart and of ideas to impress people.  

It is quite sickening when I realize how pointless and useless it all is. What good does all that selfish thoughts do? It is painful to acknowledge against the belief that I'm a caring and kind individual. Do normal people get over this? Is this why I have so few friends?

Well, to satisfy my curiosity and perhaps establish a baseline to compare (note my selfish intent here), how many seconds a day do you spend thinking about other people - friends, family or stranger? What do you think about for them? How much of what you do daily is done with the thought of others? 

As I wrote this, I remembered this saying from years ago " At 20, you care about what others think about you. When you're 40, you stopped caring about what others think. When you finally hit 60, you realize no one was thinking about you at all."

to 
A shy girl will be even quieter near you if she is interested as she just too scared to speak up and say the wrong things around you.
If you happen to be hanging out in a group, don't expect her to give you attention because she is too worried about the rest of the group noticing that she is interested in you. 

Maybe you can try looking out for body language (blushing, nervousness etc...) since it is quite difficult to tell from the things she says because it is unlikely for her to express her interest for you. Perhaps texting her in a private chat will be good as it is easier for shy people to reply when they don't see you.

I'm a normal 'office girl' and over time has developed a huge liking to my senior. I sense that he likes me too but cannot be really sure since maybe he's just treating me nicely as a junior. I don't know how to express my feelings since I'm just you know, his 'inferior'/assistant whatsoever. I just wish I'm a bit prettier for him to notice me in a crowd of other beautiful, skinnier girl colleagues. Unrequited love really does hurt. But if he does reciprocate, I don't know how to ever control my love for him. 
-
 
if my bf tells me he doesn't know if we can last, it's perfectly fine of me to be concerned right?

i have no idea what to do about this.

To , nice try trolling me by pretending to be my ex when your written English level is so much better than hers. 

And to everyone else doubting whether it's all a one man show here, rest assured I have no time to do that sort of entertainment here. But hey, thanks troll for painting me as a typical nice guy.

In my 23 years of life on this planet earth I have never dated anyone. I'm about to gradurate soon and the thought of not being attached makes me wonder how will I be able to find my other half. I'm not into dating someone who is in the same job as me. I'm not a very happening person. Dun drink or go clubbing, have very few friends,  rarely go out. So the other day a schoolmate told me she met her currently boyfriend online, which makes me wonder if I should try it out since I dun have much of a social circle. Met someone and was asked if I was open to being FWB. That makes me wonder why people even want to get into such a status where no commitment is involve. I mean is one truly able to have the pleasure without having any intimacy or love for the other person? And if you have more than 1 FWB how is that different from hiring a social escort? Maybe because female are more emotional being and look for lasting relationship. But I truly dun understand how someone can just get sexually involve with someone without getting to know the person. If someone is not ready for commitment then he shouldn't even be dating. There is a different between dating a boy and a man. Even though I'm not fully a woman yet, I willing to make sacrifices. It will be scary but I'm willing to take the risk 
-
 
What kind of hints will a shy girl give if she's interested?
-
 
Guys out there, will you date someone whom your friends didnt find attractive? Like will peer pressure get to you eventually when they keep telling you to go for someone better and that she is too ugly or so? Curious. 
-
 
To  I'm a shy girl and usually when I sense that he's looking at me, I tuck my hair behind my ear, also occasionally I give a sweet smile that is almost mysterious. My friend who knows my crush also noticed that my voice also tend to get more soft when speaking to him compared to my normal tone. 
-
 
if I had a Boyfriend now, I would let him squeeze my boobs all the time. I really love that feeling. I would give hand jobs and blow jobs anytime too. 
Where can I find a Boyfriend? sighhhh

Calling all guys. Can you list here signs you like a girl? Because I'm really confused right now about this colleague I'm close with but I'm not really sure if he's dropping hints or just being nice. HEEELLLPP

与你相遇 好幸运 (so fortunate to have met you)

I am so fortunate to have met you, even though we might not end up together. The way you laugh, the fact of how easy it is for me to make you laugh, your personality; just being able to find someone like you is enough for me, even though I do not sense that you like me. 

I really really like you.

与你相遇 好幸运

When you are looking for a mate, which is better: look for someone (classmates, friends) who shares common experience with you OR someone (random stranger) who have very different experiences from you?
-
 
 and  As a person whom has such thoughts before, please don't be reckless and please think twice. Such decisions shouldn't be taken lightly. Our moods are very erratic at times and it's best to first try to get ourselves motivated and going. Grab some friends to study together or do whatever is necessary that livens up your mood like watching dramas. Just remember to get back to work. Best is to solve or be working towards solving the issues that are upsetting you guys including past grades. If there is a unresolvable knot, push it aside for the moment but remember to deal with it later. This is especially more so the case if you guys have been working hard till now, and we have already went past half of the semester! FIGHTING!!

To  if everytime you ask her to spend time with you she says yes, there's a high chance it's not one-sided

Four lessons for everyone. I was really clueless when it comes to relationships. A few years back, I met a guy who expressed interest in me. He was very kind, smart ... basically, he's your typical nice guy. He was a little odd, but I found his oddity a little cute and I was especially flattered when he admitted that he liked me. However, I was unsure if I really liked him as a person, or whether I am just reciprocating because I feel like I owed him a favour.

Over time, I discovered that he was really 'sticky'. In my view, we were only dating but he's moving too fast for my liking. It's his first relationship, so I guess that might have contributed to his behaviour. But he was just SO weird. My parents warned me not to hang out with him and told me that we have no future together. I was also ashamed of introducing him as my boyfriend. In fact, I often hesitated in saying that he was my boyfriend. We are, after all, merely dating (for three months!). So when he introduced himself to my friends as my 'boyfriend' and placed his arm around me, I felt very embarrassed (but I was too shy to correct him).

One thing led to another and we had sex. I didn't know what I was doing. I felt conflicted - I liked him but I was not sure that he was the one. He's terribly awkward, not exactly the best looking, and my parents/friends did not like him.

We dated for only 4 months before he had to go to Hull for further education. I thought it's a good time to end the relationship. I would rather choose my parents and my friends over someone I was not even sure I want to go on a long-term relationship with. It is also easier for me to end the relationship over long distance (bad mistake). Anyway, I decided to ignore him hoping that he would get the hint and move on.

Unfortunately, he did not get the hint and he messaged me persistently. In the end, I told him point blank that I want to break up with him (although technically in my view, it wasn't a break-up because we weren't together to begin with). My parents were delighted that I agreed to stop dating him. However, nobody expected him to fly back to Singapore to find me. I was very afraid of what he might do since he's a bit unpredictable, but since the breakup was my parents' idea, they helped me to shoo him off in a nice way.

I am glad I have him off my life, but I did feel very bad for some time. So dear NUS friends, three valuable lessons: 1) always communicate and be clear as to your relationship status, and 2) don't 'ignore' and hope that everything will be fine, 3) don't break up online and, most importantly, 4) don't date weirdos.

It is so sad how many men I know say that looks do not matter when it comes to a girlfriend or a relationship, but yet their girlfriends are all somehow really attractive people and they sometimes poke fun at less attractive girls. Losing hope of ever finding a relationship since most these days just go for what's on the surface. No looks, no talk. 
-
 
I have a crush on my best friend. The problem is how can I tell if this feeling is romantic or not, or if it's just a one-sided crush? I don't want to risk our friendship over this, because for now I'm content with just being friends and spending time with her.  Yet at the same time I do not want to look back later and regret my decision of not asking her out. Can someone advice me on how to confront these feelings of mine? 
-
 
Reading through some of the posts here and was wondering, why so much hate for people who go for a girl/guy because of looks? As much as I agree that personality is important, are you able to take a first look at someone and go, "Wah, that girl/guy's personality sibei chio/hansum sia!". Don't bs and tell me can la, the answer is obviously no. One cannot deny that having good looks give one the advantage of the initial attraction, which may lead to further interaction and perhaps something more given the "right" personality.  So instead of whining "why no love for ugly guys/girls" or "why can't he/she love me for my personality instead of picking on my looks", why not spend the time to make yourself look better, be it proper grooming, learning to dress up or what not. At least with better "packaging", you stand a better chance, with the added bonus of appearing as someone who puts in the effort to look presentable. As a chinese saying goes, "there are no ugly women (and perhaps men), only lazy women (or men)". So stop being salty and just work on it.

I got to know this girl early this year through a friend of mine.  From the initial small talk  with her, i found that i really liked her, so naturally i asked my friend for her number and after that we began texting quite often. Problem is she's giving off rather mixed signals. Since she's the more introverted and shy kind, she's much more chatty on whatsapp than in real life. She replies to my text quite fast and sometimes we even text late into the night. But on the other hand i'm finding it quite difficult to meet up with her on a 1-1 basis, like perhaps for lunch in school (only managed to do it once). She always says that she has something on like other plans and stuff, and to be honest i'm not convinced she's telling the truth. But i always go with the flow and say something like "okay maybe some other time then". I've not asked her out yet as it's currently school time and i think she's pretty stressed. 
I mean, texting her is great and all, but the lack of face to face interaction is really bothering me. At times i feel that she's trying to avoid me or whatnot (but then again i could be thinking too much..) What do you think i should do? I don't want to continue to pursue her if she's not interested.

today i saw my crush i think he siam me cos i creeped him out w my gift. sighhh

I don't like camps and orientations, but still went for them because of what many people say. Oh if don't go for camps you won't have friends you'll be lonely. So there I was so many times, being the very average looking guy I am. And everytime will kena games that need to pair up with girls or guys. 

And everytime will always kena "ostracised" and neglected because girls will go to better looking guys and even guys will team up with better looking guys. That leaves me and some other poor guy or girl that is also average. I'm perfectly ok either partnering with other average people. I feel happier too. But I don't like the process of the "better" people sieving and screening through the list of guys and girls and pick those that they want. Like what? I'm a fair price item meh? 

Next time I'll choose instead and go straight to another average guy or girl. Cos I'm not there for the other's entertainment.

I am two years into this relationship with my second gf. We both had one relationship before, and both of us had sex with our previous partners.

Honestly, I guess both of us are regretful over what we did. And certainly, both of us are pretty uncomfortable with each other previous sexual encounters.... 

Although we already queued for bto (she's in final sem), we now don't intend to be intimate before we get married... It's not that we don't want, it is simply something we want to reserve for later. 

Girls and boys, I am not sure how many posts about having FwBs here are troll or sincere. While I do know and respect my friends who venture around, they are all cool, you should never have sex with random friends simply because it seems common on this portal. There can be fake posts from people who wish to spread the misconception.

Hi OP of 
I'm a 21 years old guy and here are my personal responses for your questions! 
Not all guys masturbate. Personally, I Have not done it. And i strongly believe that out there, there are guys who have not done it too! And pretty much yes, if you have goals to chase after in life, its pretty hard to think about this kind of sexual stuff. So yeah! :)
And probably, some guys do fantasize i suppose! But once again, not all ya! 

-From an evergreen dude. Heh

Im a evergreen guy. I really really want a gf but only girls whom I am not attracted to show interests in me. Haiz. Why is it so hard to find a girl whom I like and like me back? I really don't think I have high standards:( cos I know I am just a average guy:/ 
-
 
Hello !
Don't give up! You are just in the wrong crowd!
I don't think that I have more material wealth as you or in anywhere near you (above average) but the point is... if you are in a circle of friends where everyone is roughly in the same socioeconomic 
status... everything is good!

Looking forward to your next post and see you progress!

Signing off!

Seriously need some advice here. 
I fell in love with someone who has a gf 
The problem is his gf doesnot know how to cherish him and its sad to see him like this. 
I know its wrong and i tried to forget about him but i just cannot let go...

I'm in love with my 1-year girlfriend but not physically attracted to her. Meanwhile there are prettier girls who are showing some interest in me. I'm thinking about the likelihood of regret if I marry my girlfriend and when love finally fades. She has a great personality and treats me extremely well. But marriage is a life long decision...

I don't know how common it is for girls to masturbate. Personally I have been doing it since before I knew what I was even doing.

It started with finding some risque romance novels when I was young. They weren't explicit, but reading them got me aroused. I was probably 9 or so. 

I heard somewhere that water jets were pleasurable and experimented with them at public pools.

After lots of success with water jets, I found out that the bathtub faucet was also quite nice, if difficult to hit the right spots.

I received an electric toothbrush when I was 12 and quickly found a better use for it. 

When I was 15 the bathroom was renovated and got a new detachable shower head. 

I don't need to watch porn or anything to have fun, although it does help me get into the mood. I don't have any sex toys (because, as you can see, I make do with whatever I have on hand). I have done it up to 5 times in one day, and as infrequently as once every few months. On average it's 1-2 times a week, dependent on time of the month. 

You would never guess how sexually awakened I am, since I am just an average, shy girl. I've never even had sex before, and I don't intend to for a long time. Masturbation, to me, is just a natural part of my life that I don't even think about it. I guess people just don't talk about it much. Girls, don't be afraid to explore yourself and get to know your body and what you like.

Very soon, I will be receiving a gift from my parents. My dream car: faster, bigger and definitely more gorgeous than my current one. A gift for a special day, a meaningful one. Princess...  Spoilt brat... High maintenance... Go join people your league... Why are you here in NUS, you dont even need the degree to look for a job... Why are you doing volunteering work, you are so fake...  Comments I am ready to hear, all over again.

I am always grateful and consider myself extremely lucky to be born into a well to do family with parents really generous to me and my siblings. While most people work really hard to achieve their material dreams, i am gift with such.  Even so, I have been brought up to be respectful, and kind towards others. I know I am really blessed, so I hope to give back to society by doing volunteering work. I always believe in being humble around people and putting others before me. Never once i told any of my school mates about my estate and apartment that my parents gifted me, for my 21st and 19th birthday. My 20th birthday gift was a car, that I cannot hide since I drive to school everyday. 

Friends I met for over a year, friends who are so interesting and enjoyable to hang out with, suddenly start to judge and distant away from me almost immediately after they see my car. Almost instantly, female friends start to gossip behind my back, while guy friends start to feel 'inferior'. I could only imagine worst if they learn about my properties. But hey, strip away all that I own, I am the same girl whom you think of as humourous, unpretentious and sincere. Isnt that what you think of me as a person before you see what I possess? Sometimes I wonder if my female 'friends' will treat me differently if I were a guy instead. But that being said, I am still grateful to have a couple of genuine friends. 

Today, was supposed to be another happy 'date' with someone whom I thought of as different from the rest. But, today was also the most disheartening day. I heard the most hurtful words. His words hurt me more than those of my 'friends', because I thought his soul was kinder than anyone. Take a step back. Learn about me, as a person, not judge me from what I own. Don't feel intimidated. But come forward and be protective of me, not doubtful of me. And I will become your best buddy, sweetest partner and more importantly, a person who will cherish you for being true. But, will that day ever come? Where I could meet someone who will cherish me as a person, and not cherish materials that I possess?

I confessed to a guy, without reaffirming his feelings for me. He dragged on for a few months (we talked on n off) before rejecting me officially. 

Never knew that I could cry this much. It's painful. 

Can we still stay friends? We have many mutual friends and they have no idea what has happened between us. Guess it will be an awkward semester ahead. 

Girls.. It's good to chase after what you want. But many a times, being love is still better than loving someone that doesn't reciprocate your feelings.

It's hard to give advice on such a grey area. On one hand this guy is attached but on the other hand, you like him a lot and feel that he deserves better because his girlfriend doesn't appear to cherish him. If you go after him, you are seen as a third party, if you let it go, you will never know if the two of you could ever be something more. In fact something similar like this happened to me, except I'm in the guy's shoes in this case. 

I was dating a guy years ago and had been in that relationship for 2 years. It was a pretty ok relationship. 

And then one day I got to know another guy through work. Somehow both of us clicked really well, we had many things in common and could never seem to run out of topics to talk about. We hung out together but back then I had always seen him as a friend and nothing more. Overtime, we became close and yes this guy was aware that I had a boyfriend then. I guess you can say we were both attracted to each other but because of the boyfriend, neither is us acted on it because it felt like the 'right thing to do'. 

That is until one day, the guy confessed to me. It was difficult for him and believe me he felt like a here for doing it but he decided to tell me because he could not stand not knowing if we could be something more. I can tell you it is the happiest and yet at the same time, most heart wrenchingly guilty feeling. I felt guilty because here I was, feeling all these things I had never felt when I was with my ex and it felt wrong because it was with someone else. It felt like cheating and yet not cheating at the same time. Somewhere somehow but I don't know how, I had fallen out of love with my ex and in love with someone else. Someone whom I appeared to share so many affinities with. And so after that, I formally broke up with my ex before getting together with the new guy. 

There were moments where I felt like a horrible person, and that people would judge me for doing 'the wrong thing'. I never wanted to be a bad person and I never asked to fall in love with someone else whilst still in a relationship. The only thing I could do was to own up to having a change of heart and initiate a clean break immediately before anything could get out of hand. It felt like the right thing to do. 
It has been 3 years since the new guy and I got together and we will be getting married in a few months. Though our relationship is a path less taken, or perhaps spoken about, I have never once regretted my decision to be with him. I know that I am now with the right person for me, someone who gets me and loves me wholly. 

I cannot garentee that what happened to me can also happen to you but if the both of you are truly meant for each other, somehow,  you'll find a way. Just be true to yourself and your heart. It is easy for others to judge but as far as relationships go, there is no right or wrong, only consequences to your actions.

When you complimented my high D last year, I felt like my entire choral experience had been validated. This semester we have not even spoken. 

Aaron-senpai, notice me!

Hardcore? I have that fetish too. I only hope that one day I can find someone who is into that as well. The idea of subjugating, or being subjugated is so enticing :) 
-
 
Just like how some others have shared their online dating story. Am going to share mine. 
Chatted with a guy (totally a random add up) and manage to click well. The chats were all decent and we respected each other feelings. He initiated to meet up. Me - being too shy and introvert, didn't wanted too. He tried a few times and finally see that I'm not going to meet him. And he left. (This happened a few years back) and I'm not able to get over this. I can't understand why I didn't meet him. I wished I had. I was just too scared. I just hope if it is destined for us to talk again, let time show us the way.

Hey, I have a legit question that me and my bro are debating about, hope someone can help me out

1) do girls wear bra at home?

I know of some girls that do and some that dont, i would just like to hear everyone's views

In response to 17225:

I am in your position once and i can understand your fears. Personally, coming out to the first person was definitely the most difficult as i had no idea how he would respond and i had imagined that my friends would treat me differently. However, that is untrue as my friends still treat me the same as before. 
Granted there might be some people who might reject you but i think most people now are tolerant or even accepting. 

I also understand the fear if someone,who identifies as hetero, finds out that you are interested in him. I personally have told some of my friends i would date them,only because they asked, and it turned out fine since i draw the line clearly. I do not hit on them or make advances so i am sure if you do the same there is no reason for your friends to feel weirded out. Further, they probably wouldnt find out you are interested unless you said so. 

Finding a partner is pretty tough, but if you choose to be open about yourself, it might help though this is obviously not easy. Other ways include the apps which granted isnt the best but can work occasionally. or through mutual friends which i find is ideal. 

Have faith in the goodness of people!

I really really want to hug you right now. Why aren't you mine already?

It's hard to be yourself, especially when you know that you're gay. You live in fear that your friends may reject you, and that this may result in difficulties in finding people to work with on projects and stuff. You may have spotted someone who had been friendly with you, but you fear that if he knew you had some feelings for him he might just treat you like a weirdo and avoid you. Yet temptation had its way of baiting you, as you are in a faculty that is traditionally male-dominated...

You try to suppress these by masturbating regularly, keeping a busy schedule and even tried getting a religion to find peace, but you realise that at the end of the day you want a partner who can be there for you. It doesn't help that your ex-boyfriend took you so long to find, but still left you in the end because you didn't know how to love. And thinking on how your looks are so average (or even on the ugly side) as compared to the muscular hunks, you wonder just how will you even get the one you hoped for?

What will you do?
-
 
I have this problem of appearing like I like someone or am flirting with someone despite it not being my intention (it's very rare for me to like someone like that). How do I stop? I would provide more details, but I don't quite understand it myself. I'm evergreen, dress modestly (if that even matters). 
-
 
What do you call friendships similar to FwB, but without the sex? What are your thoughts on such relationships?
-
 
I have a confession to make... While I may look like a goody-two-shoes on the outside, I am sexually curious and secretly desire to have casual sex. The things holding me back are my parents and what they have taught me, really. I have been going on Omegle, playing with myself in front of strangers and it really pleases me to see them excited...  I feel very torn between what I have been taught and what I desire. Sigh. And yes I am female and the strangers are male and I always make sure that my face is covered. 
-
 
To , and anyone else trying to woo someone, just ask them out. Couple dates should be larger in proportion to group dates. A girl constantly being asked out alone would probably suspect you like her. 
To make it more obvious, always make time for her and spend as much time as you can together. Take every opportunity to let her know what you like about her.
Otherwise just TELL HER YOU LIKE HER. If you fail to do this, be prepared to enter the friendzone.

I am not a gamer guy. I don't play any pc games (lol dota2 csgo etc) and everytime my friends/bros/gf talk about games, i have no idea what is going on. I am not a technology screw up; i know alot about building pcs, pc parts and troubleshooting pcs but i suck at pc games. If i knew the mechanics of the games i'm sure i would be a better player but i am not. I always think of getting into league for a start but i lack the motivation and time to do so. What should i do? 
-
 
I've always felt repulsed by a girl I just had sex with, no matter how attracted to them i might've been before that.

To qualify, I haven't had sex with someone I truly, madly, and deeply loved before, partly because those have been really hard to come by, and partly cuz I've always wanted to save it. Savour the best for last, y'know. So I don't know if I'd feel that way for those people too.

But other than that, I really just wanna get out of there without saying a word after sex. I just usually cuddle and pretend to sleep just to be polite, avoiding the pillow talk by closing my eyes and responding with noncommittal grunts.

Anyone feel like this too, or can explain why?

Each individual has their own private space and guarding that space is a door locked from the inside, some locked much more tightly than others. Most of the time, the door is there to keep unwanted people from entering but once in a while, it too allows people to enter. To establish a romantic or platonic relationship with another party is not just required that you be willing to open your own door but also for the other party to be willing to enter. But willingness of both parties is not all that is required. Some fate is required as well. Not everyone can find your door in their lifetime, even if it's a locked one. Even if one can find it, the time has to be right such that at that point in time, you are willing to open your door for him or her and he or she is willing to enter.

But things don't get any simpler from here as all of the above just take into consideration the perspective of just one person while relationships are hardly one-way. What we also need is for the other party to be willing to have his or her door open and at the same time you be willing to enter. So what we need in sum is two parties who are willing to have their doors open for each other and each willing to enter one another's private space. Even more willingness and fate. And all these is just the start because we still need to sustain this.

There seems to be at least another layer of complexity to be added which is this. Sometimes it's just not so straightforward that if you want someone to enter, you simply open the door for them. And if you don't want them to do so, you simply close those doors. Sometimes, it's the reverse. Many times, we close those doors only to want them to return at a later time. This is as what we have in our own private space, amongst many other things, are our very own vulnerable hearts. We want to first make sure that we really know who they are and that they know what they really want before we let them in. On other occasions, we open those doors for them only to close them later on. This is so as we want to first make sure that they know how to handle things right before we let them in again. All of which are done just so that they won't wreck havoc when we let them in or when we let them in again.

 What if the girl is not sure if the guy is interested in her? It happens to me before... I only knew that the guy used to like me after the guy has got over me. The sad part is that I liked him too. :(

Is it a good idea to unfriend someone on facebook? Guy AK has been posting non-stop about how pretty his new girlfriend for about a month now. Furthermore now he even posts about staying faithful to her and how she means the world to him and would never break her heart. I mean c'mon dude, these things are quite obvious in a relationship and should be just between her and you. If you always need to reassure her that you are a one woman's man, then probably you sort out these trust issues with her. Guys and girls, am I wrong to say this and shld i just confront the guy about his stupid lovey-dovey posts and then probably unfriend him if he is still reluctant?
-
 
I'm surrounded by people I talk to a decent amount of people but I feel lonely. What is wrong with me?

What does it mean when a guy:
1. Says he likes you
2. Wants to kiss you
3. Blows you off 2 dates in a row after promising you (1st was to play mahjong with friends, 2nd was just "he couldn't make it and was busy")

I thought liking someone meant that you wanted to spend as much time as possible with him/her. I'm not saying I should be top priority at all times but saying you can't make it after promising someone (twice) just makes me abit pissed. I don't even do that with friends. Am i missing something here?

I'm on one of those shy/awkward and/or introverted guys. All my life I've had difficulties interacting with females especially, so as you can expect I have very few female friends. Whenever I start getting to know a new lady, and I find that she's being really nice to me or her texts have a positive vibe (all as perceived by me of course), my mind goes into overdrive and I start imagining her as a potential partner. Needless to say this makes me even more shy and awkward around her and god knows how many potential good friendships this self-destructiveness has jeopardised. I know this is all in my head, but with my lack of experience in interaction, how do I tell apart friendliness from attraction? Anyone experience this too?

I'm a freshman, and I'm the only one among my group of friends who have never gotten attached. Some of my friends didn't believe me at first (they thought I must surely have had one or a few). I don't know what's wrong with me. I want to get a girlfriend, but I don't know how to. They say "be yourself", but I don't know who I am. And when I am what I think is myself, I don't think that "me" is very attractive either. And it doesn't help that I'm not very attractive physically either (I'm not tall, nor buff, nor sexy). Halp...
-
 
I got to know this really cool girl through an online dating app and we've been texting for about a month now. We have a lot of common interests and seem to click really well - at least online anyway - and as such I would like to meet up with her. 

However, I figured there's a problem: Having texted so frequently for some time now, it's like we know a lot about each other's lives already. I'm afraid that if we meet in real life we might run out of things to talk about. 

Any seasoned daters or even players can share some advice? I really don't want to screw this up; I feel that we could at least be very good friends.
-
 
How do you stop from feeling unwanted by the world? I never get the things I truly want. Lol I sound so self-pitying but just allow me this one moment, k?
-
 
Just wanna ask, what stuff do girls consider as a guy as "dropping hints". I am evergreen and I really like this female friend of mine. P.s, I gave her a little gift and said Happy Valentine's Day though :)
-
 
To 

I am a 24yo guy. And I honestly do not masturbate, I await wet dreams though, and I serve porn.
Maybe it is just me? I .... sort of don't know how to do it, and I feel that it is quite dumb to touch myself. But I still do google my guilty pleasure and indulgences at porn websites.
Guess that answers 1- 3? (i am a quiet guy. People seldom notice me absent coz even when present, I have a lack of presence )

And yes I am guilty of sexual fantasies of my crushes and attractive female friends.

Maybe it is really just me and I am just a loser lol.

I have dated local asian guys before, but now that I'm dating a white guy, people give me raised eyebrows, smirk and go "huh", or call me an SPG or think I'm only in it because he's white (implying good looks etc), which is simply not true. 

It feels as though people here subconsciously have an inferiority complex about themselves or are easily "threatened". I don't know lah, nor do I care anymore really. 

I'm just so annoyed and tired from having to jump in and defend myself and him every time people find out he's white that sometimes I almost just wish he weren't. 

People suck. 
-
 
I was the one who submitted  "If my boyfriend lied to me about talking to a girl, is it dumping worthy?". I guess I should elaborate on my situation. Because I don't think I'm "paranoid".

What I found out was my boyfriend was talking to this girl from his work and suggesting they meet up. Sometimes she wouldn't reply and he would text her again to initiate conversations. Before finding this out I had a bad feeling about their friendship so I asked him about it, but he said they weren't close and they didn't talk or text at all. Then I found out.

So.

How do i convince my parents to let me go for ocip? 
My mum is quite protective and doesnt like me to go overseas, what more doing an ocip. She does not see the point of doing good overseas, when there are many opportunities for me to do so in Sg. She says that there will be no one in the team who will be matured enough to look after us since everyone would mostly be around my age. Also, since the living conditions will not be very good, she is scared that i would get sick after eating their food, etcetc. AND she fears we might step onto a land mine area or do high risk activities. yeah. I understand why she worries so much is because she cares for me, but I'm already an adult and i fully know what i am getting into. Any advice on how to go around this situation? :/
-
 
answering ,
1) not all, but quite a large proportion (sampling local chinese male friends in uni);
2) yes, looks are deceiving;
3) maybe. honestly, masturbation and relationship are unrelated needs. (personally, if life gets really busy, there's not much time and urge for masturbation);
4) can't generalize, i don't; my close group of male friends neither.
-
 
So I am a girl, and I will get straight to my point:
I find sex disgusting and I am fearful of it.
Naturally I am a virgin.

I have a bf and he shares my concern too. While he has his lusts, he rarely masturbates. (not the do-it-once-i-have-oppurtunity-or-follow-weekly-masturbate-schedule that I always hear my male friends joking about) He finds it disgusting. (Both of us aren't Christians btw ) But if we are going to take our rs to the next level, and have a family soon, we will have to do it sooner or later, That i understand. (we got real naughty once but never ended up having intercourse. I fantacise about sexual happenings but no, never masturbated b4.)
we watched porn videos together once and I told him that I find the idea of a [male reproductive organ] sticking into me intriguing and frightful. (he said he was afraid his [male reproductive organ] would break after he watch the video. the gurl was on top of the guy jumping up and down lolx"
I wrote to sex forums, couple therapy websites, and now since we have soooo many posts of FwB, there seems to be very experienced readers on this page. So I thought, why not?
[No i don't have parents or siblings , i ran away from home, that's my screwed up life story for another time.]

Or is my love for him just too platonic? that i just don't..... feel the urge to do IT. #whattodo

Any females with tips on how to cope with hair loss? :\ I've been shedding A LOT recently and my scalp has thinned noticeably... there are no obvious bald spots yet but I'm getting quite worried.

What are the causes? Please share your experiences in dealing with it. Am I not eating enough of a certain nutrient? My lifestyle and eating habits have not changed much so I'm quite puzzled.

Sometimes it gets really lonely. I've long come to terms with the ambiguous feeling of weight in my heart. I long to 'open' up, to be the funny guy I used to be. Back then, I was sociable and good with jokes. I miss the old me, and occasionally take up that persona with birthday gatherings and outings with secondary school classmates. However, the bubbly me was draining. I start to close up after several instances of social rejections. Most were not explicit, but rather feelings disappointment and regret would hit me. 

After the 2 years in NS, everything is no longer the same. Time seemed to froze and I can't communicate on the same level anymore. The quiet me is now associated with always having something on my mind and being perceived as having matured. I hated this extreme. I would act like the 13yo me in front of my family. It feels as if I'm trying to find a balance in all these dispositions. Everything was ok until my mum chided me for being so childish on one occasion. It hurts only after I realized the inner me has literally no where to go. The rest stops seem to be at polarized locations, and my personality just tries to fit in. 

Now I just feel like stop trying. I would avoid emotional conversations with close friends by changing the topic or appear immature to annoy the h*ll out of them. I wear dark clothing on a daily basis, and cut my hair only when someone comments on how untidy I look. I try to avoid social gatherings with people I'm not close with, and freak out in a group of people whom I don't even know the names of. It's like a part of me just shuts down, leaving the rest to deal with the mess.  

Even in group projects with allocated members, I would always appear very enthusiastic at the start. Then I would realize how pointless it would be since everyone else has their priorities, and I appear to have none. All it takes is a trigger, like the Prof rejecting our chosen article to base our project on. I take every setback as a sign that I should stop trying. Every time I try to step out, I just sink lower.

I'm evergreen. Stopped trying after one bad experience when I was 16. I can no longer initiate conversations without any purpose. No more "How's your day?", no more "ah so stress". I'm becoming a recluse, an emotional deviant.

I wonder what has changed. I know I've to come to terms with it. It gets so tiring I would sleep for half the day. I hate it but I've to appear strong in front of people I love. I hate to have so much time on my hands. I hate myself for not trying harder, and I know I've myself to blame. Talking to people on an emotional level creeps me out, because I know I'm an emotional wreck. I don't want to hurt anyone when I implode. Sorry to waste your time.

I am forever seeing posts by guys looking for relationships which say things like "I'm her friend and I want to drop hints but I'm not sure if it will be weird". I have had one serious relationship before and it just sorta... happened. I didn't have to try to drop hints, there was just that spark. I think if you have to force yourself to drop hints you have the wrong girl.

Why do you talk to me, then leave me hanging after I've replied?

Am I the only girl who finds some nerdy guys cute?

I met this gorgeous lady online through a non Tinder dating appand she asked me out first. I told her I was impressed by her gutsiness and then replied using a song's lyrics. Unfortunately, she didn't get the reference. 

I then told her the name of the song and jokingly said that I had to reconsider having coffee with her since she didnt get the reference. After that it was just radio silence...... Did I do anything wrong, or are ladies just unpredictable?

If you wanna know for sure who a genuine person is, find someone who doesnt dress up or put makeup. These people dont need physical adornments or alterations to make them feel better about themselves. 

Also cos theyre lazy and they are not hiding that. Therefore genuine af. 
-
 
 yes. My ex lied to me about talking to a girl. I forgave him, but the problem escalated. He never learn. He talked to even more girls, join those dating apps, asking strangers on the street for numbers and the list goes on. I forgive him again and again but he just think that I will never leave him. So he keeps making the same mistake. So, in my opinion, if he never learn, then just dump him. If not you will be the one hurting in the end.

I met this guy in year 1 and he was the sweetest guy I ever knew. A true gentleman which is pretty rare if you ask me and we were pretty close. But then he left for exchange in year 2 and we didn't really keep in touch. Now that he's back (we're year 3 now) I bump into him quite often but we are nowhere close to what we had and I no longer feel I can share things with him. I guess all I wanted to say was keep your friends close guys. The pain of being able to see but not connect with someone is very real. 
-
 
I like this girl. I've expressed my interest and she has mentioned that she wants us to get to know each other a little better before trying anything.

But my fwb has been asking me out recently, tempting me with sexts. I have not told her about this new girl yet and we have agreed to stop once we are attached.

It seems morally wrong to go out with my fwb now that i am trying to woo someone. Ladies and gentlemen, what would you do.

You’re the only person I’d be okay with for calling me at 3 am for no reason and I just wanna hold your little hand, make you laugh, kiss you a lot, talk and eat junk food until the sun rises. But the thing is, you ain't mine (or rather you'll never be mine)... ):

I just got involved with a new FB. Unlike my previous ones, this guy is really doting of me and he makes me miss having a boyfriend.  

And I have to say, it feels good to know that I can just look into someone's eyes and give a kiss I enjoy for someone to do things for me - not related to sex. 

Speaking of the prevalence of people with FB, I do have a few friends who have / have had FBs. Some of whom are  younger, some overseas, some of another race. Perhaps birds of the same feathers do flock together.

I love my mom and sister very much that I want to live with them for the rest of my life. I am a career woman, don't mind have sexual relationships, but I don't think I am fit to be married as I cannot ever imagine living happily and comfortably with anybody else by my family. Anyone another girls feel the same way?

I enjoy singing 3h of karaoke alone way more than with friends. :/

Am I too weird?

Saw a group of people, looks like they are going to a party or something. And me? Just going home after a long day of studying in school. Sometimes I do hope that I can be part of it or have friends who would jio me. The thing is I am not really a party type of person but I can't help but to feel envious of them. Maybe I just wanted something out of my monotonous life.

This dude just broke up with his ex a year ago. The ex was pretty average in looks but had really big breasts. The reason was that this dude was just too fat and he got really annoyed by her constant teasing of being a "cute chubby boy". One day, out of anger, he slapped her and she took the slap as utter humiliation in front of a big crowd. Even after the dude apologized and begged her for an apology, she simply refused to soften her heart and told him it was all over. As his close friend, I found him really pitiful and idiotic at the same time.

Three months later, the dude became an alcoholic and started visiting prostitutes in Thai brothels. There, he met a really beautiful Thai girl nicknamed Soda and asked her to become his regular escort. Soon after, both fell in love and she left the business to be together with him. Fast forward to the present, both of them have gotten engaged and are getting married next month. 

But the thing is Soda has had been intimate with me as well since I visited her before introducing her to my friend. Furthermore even after they got engaged, I did it with her twice in her apartment. But now she has gotten distant from me and she is now seeing another man. I now also  know that her only motive behind marrying my friend is to take his money and elope with this man. I told my friend about her relationship with me and now he doesn't believe my words and told me f*** off. I really want to help my friend before this wretch scoots off with his money. Can someone give me any suggestions??

I am an evergreen guy in Year 2. I started liking this girl last year and made efforts to get to know her better. She's introverted, so it took her a while to open up. I think I am her only male friend.

She enjoys my company and trusts me, but because I haven't dropped any hints, she treats me as a normal friend.

I know that I'm supposed to be brave and all, but the fear of rejection seems too big for my ego to handle. 

I'm afraid that things will get awkward if she rejects me (she's in some of my classes), but yet I know that attraction has an "expiry period" too.. What should I do?

Hi! Just curious... I know a few guys who look really innocent/you can't imagine them intimately. A few weeks back, I saw that one of these guys had a wallpaper of a female idol with her dress exposing the back clasp of her bra band. I had to mask my shock and pretend that I didn't see.

So I have a few questions:
1) So do all guys do that? Like... masturbate?
2) Even the innocent-looking ones?
3) What if they say they have no interest in finding a r/s or hook-ups etc. and rather focus on other aspects of life? Do they still do that? Since I guess if they are not interested they won't have the urge?
4) Do guys fantasise about their female friends in that way?
-
 
Do you all think a person got a problem if he / she is evergreen at age 25? Personality problem. Weakness of will. Psychological problem. Health problem. Physical Looks ptoblem. Confidence problem. Egoistic problem?

sometimes I believe it's quite rude to say "I know lahh" when someone is taking time to explain things to you sincerely. when you say "I know lahh", you're implying that what I'm saying is redundant, if it is, why did u bother asking me in the first place?
-
 
 here. Thank you to those who replied; really means a lot.
, thank you for your detailed response too and taking time to share what you know...reading it really made me feel better ^^ It was my first time talking (if that counts) about it much to anyone...all of a sudden I feel drained of words. Hope things are well on your end.. :)

Recently I've been noticing my friend keeps hanging out with this guy from her course. The thing is that she's attached to another mutual friend of mine and I feel as though she is too close and touchy with this new guy. I'm a girl by the way and no I do not like her boyfriend. He is just a close friend of mine whom I do not want to see hurt. What should I do?
-
 
 Good job. I am not against having fwb and I did have a few too. However, I sincerely urge you to reconsider your choice and limit them to single women, unless you admit that your game is weak. 

One of these days, someone just like you will appear and fck the hell out of your girlfriend, wife, sister or daughter. Yup, they will be great in bed too, thanks to you.  #karma

 Wow, that's a petty way to dump your boyfriend. If he dumps you it's more than likely and well-deserved.

How common is it for guys to check out girls' butts? Since the beginning of this semester I have noticed out of the corner of my eye (and I could sort of feel the gaze) thrice already guys checking my butt out briefly. Does it happen to a lot of girls and are some like me just more aware of it? 
While that does not really concern me so much actually since they were attempting to be discreet, there was something that has been nagging at the back of my mind since a previous incident. During a previous semester, two guys together very obviously looked down at my private part area and smirked at me. I felt very uncomfortable but I did not dare do anything and continued walking. Should I have slapped them? Perhaps I should have...
I wish I would have more positive experiences with guys focusing on me instead. I wish I had a boyfriend to study with this recess week. It has been indescribably lonely studying on my own this time and I'm not sure why when I have always been fine. Maybe if I had one all this weird attention wouldn't matter anymore too. 
-
 
I fell for him but he will never know. I've never felt good enough for him, so I keep pretending that I have no feelings for him, and even telling him that my heart is already with someone else. Seeing him drift away hurts but I know it is inevitable because in my heart I know we won't last in a relationship.

Thanks for listening.
-
 


i don't think you are my friend, but you sure do explain for him well enough.

i don't know though... because this only began to happen recently. or maybe i feel it more starkly recently.

it does affect me even tho you explained it in a "it's not you, it's me" way. well what do you want us to do? can we still text you? if you're not going to reply... what is the point... & will it stress you out even more?

maybe it's just a balance of expectations. but i was just hoping... that you'd text me a huge chunk of encouragements just like last time. lol. 

i really don't know how else to reach you... & all the replies i get from you now are just... i don't really know how to reply sigh.

I'm a chronic ghoster -- I recognise my fault and I'm sorry that people have to deal with this treatment of mine. I don't reply to messages on time. I avoid taking calls. I take hours, sometimes even days, to respond. I don't always check Whatsapp, neither am I active on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Snapchat. (In fact, I've "quit" social media and I feel so. much. freer.) I'm curiously fine with emails though.

Yes, I've received your message (double ticks), but I do not intend to open it (blue ticks). I'll swipe down my status bar and do a quick check -- if it's not a life-or-death matter, I'll leave it as it is. 

Sorry to all those whom I've ignored. It's nothing personal. I'm not angry at you nor am I anti-social. I like interacting with people and in fact, I'm a pretty good conversationalist -- that is, if we're having one face-to-face.

"It's not you, it's me".

What is love? Am evergreen and have been talking to this guy. Got to know him through a mutual friend. He's a nice person and all but I don't know what I feel. Have been pursued by some guys and I know when I don't like them romantically or like they are not my type. However, I am more like neutral to this guy.Not really attracted to how he looks also. Dont get me wrong. I dont just go for those good looking people and my friends have been surprised at the looks of those guys i actually feel attracted to. So the question here is: does love always stary from attraction?

Just some thoughts about having FWBs since we are on this topic. Having fwbs can be compared to smoking in Singapore, which is deemed socially unacceptable. You get judged for puffing, you get condemned for banging around but at the end of the day, you still get pleasure in life. So why do we care about judgement when we are enjoying life. Personally, I have a few fwbs, some of them are really great in bed and most are attached. It is really thrilling experience and I won't mind having more ^^

I was in love with her forever. I just didn't know it until third year.

The first time I laid eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Her freckles, her scarlet hair, the way she carried herself.

Too bad she chose to consort with my mortal enemy.

Our feud went back generations; it was only natural I despised him. And I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why she would befriend  him - by all accounts, she was everything he could never be. Popular. Brilliant. Radiant.

And so I squashed down my feelings for her. For even though I fell, bewitched, every time I looked deep into those blazing eyes, my rivalry with him was more important than a stupid crush, right?

And then, years later, I understood.

It was love.

She rejected me at first, and, looking back, it makes sense. Obviously. I kinda let my 'jock' status run to my head a little, and that bothered her. So I cleaned up my act (cleaner than HE could possibly get) and she finally let me be with her, in all her glory.

And we made love.

And we made a baby.

And here's the best part: my little boy has her eyes. Her gorgeous green eyes.

I hate people who say they don't have friends but in reality, have different groups of friends who they hang out with all the time, when people like me who really don't have any friends have to act like we are busy on the phone, talking to multiple groups of friends to avoid being perceived as losers. #fml

Dated this girl a couple of weeks. From the start, she said she didn't want a boyfriend, and this relationship should just be without strings attached. We held hands, kissed, cuddled and even had sex. Today, I found out she has a boyfriend that she's been hiding from me. Still, she wants me to continue dating her while not leaving her boyfriend. I'm not sure if I'm in love with her. What do I do?

Hi, the inner kaypo in me is popping out. What are the guys' impressions of girls from different faculties? Not to do a comparison, but just curious about what the general crowd thinks. Hope my post does not get filtered through.

I really want to tell my friend to stop talking and wasting time on useless things and go and do your thesis! Year 4 liao but still like that. And now start complaining how you think you won't do well for FYP. Just get you sh*t together and do what you're suppose to do please. Stop talking as if you have no time. I don't have time for this either. 
-
 
the feeling sucks when many other girls like my crush as well. it doesn't help at all when i am so ugly and introverted. i see people making bold moves to get him and yet i cant do anything because im just too scared. I simply wish for more guys like my crush to exist because i cant compete with any of those girls. i am certainly going to be eliminated by natural selection. 
-
 
 hey op, just want to let you know that you are not alone too. Little friends, average results and dread loneliness at times. Now, I am going to graduate soon and I still don't have a goal in mind. Sometimes, I do hope for someone who can lend me a hand in searching for my goals but I know it's not possible given that I am not sociable and don't have any close friends. It's good that you are being helpful whenever you can, the gratitude from a stranger does help :-). Maybe you could start small or maybe learn a skill or something. Cheer up and all the best!
-
 
Don't be silly. If you're seeing lots of your friends having FWBs, it probably just reflects the type of social circle you have. Def not common for me.

Do guys have more than one fwb at a time? I am fwb with someone but I don't know how to ask him if we are sleeping with each other exclusively or he is sleeping with other girls too. I don't want him to think I want relationship or anything more from him because I don't. I just want to be safe.

Are most Muslims male circumcised in Singapore? I tried to look it up the net, and got something along the lines of: Those born in the 1990s are circumcised. After 2000, lesser statistics of circumcision. I even found out that female circumcision is prevalent in Singapore! 

Genuinely curious but awkward to ask my friends. Anyone knows?

Dear guys,

If you want fwbs, be attractive. We don't really care how high is your cap before we have sex with you.

Sincerely,
Girls

do people really post real confessions on confession pages? or are they just trolls by your friends? i posted some confessions in the past, some are real (but i dont like them enough to approach in real life) and some are purely just for fun. 
lately there have been quite a few confessions on another page about me which i do not know to believe or not. Someone saying that she (hopefully not a he) will approach me soon. I dont know whether to feel excited, maybe she is hot?  or apprehensive, as she may be creepy? or maybe the person dont even exist and it is just my friend's cruel joke. 
This must be karma i need to stop posting confessions.

To be honest if someone can rebound in weeks or months even after years of being in a relationship; it just goes to show how easy it is for two people to fall in love, or perhaps how some of us desire companionship. 

(Perhaps some of us find it easier to break off; place less sentimental attachments in our relationships; are more objective with our emotions.) 

To sustain that connection is a different story, requires effort, communication and compromise.It really takes two mature souls (in terms of understanding/empathy, not in every sense of the word maturity)

 I've seen incompatible characters work shit out and I've seen the opposite fall apart. 
-
 
to , I was in the exact situation as you a while ago. and eventually, I decided to let it go. We have talked it over many many times, but at the end of the day we decided that maybe we will be happier without trying to change each other. It was a long relationship, and we were together for more than 8 years. We thought we were each other's 'happily-ever-after', but it didn't work out in the end. You will feel that it's a pity to give up, but maybe... it's the only way that both of you will feel happier... 
Nevertheless, please talk it through. Take separation as a last resort. The world needs more love.

I think I saw you a few times this week with the latest time being just this Thursday evening at KR station and you looked really familiar.

Do you happen to stay in pgp residence 5? Was thinking if we could be friends. 
-
 


If only you were the person I hoped to reach and I was the person you hoped to find, then the relationship we both sought can end in a field of yellow daffodils and blissful passion, but this is a cruel unfair world, the very person whom we want to speak to are no longer within our reach. 

I have in fact used a word in my previous confession that was an inside joke, but like what my inner fears have tried to warn me, you are not the person who I have lost. 

And therefore I can not give you the sign that I am the person you want me to be. I'm sorry D,
I do however wish you the very best in finding the best solution for your heartache as I will too try to patch up my wounds in the best way I could. 

My hopes were up for a minute that perhaps you were the person who left me in the dark, nevertheless it was an enjoyable journey, to the op of , farewell and stay Gucci.

How do you tell someone you want to stop being FwB without ruining a frienship? I care for him as a friend and want to still be friends after but sex is the main reason why we hang out.

Need your advice guys. There is this girl that I am very close with the previous semester. However, due to varying workload ( as we are in a different course ) we drifted apart and see each other lesser this semester.  During the Valentine's Day period, she presented me with a flower, so what do you think her main intention was?  

P.S She joins one of the organisation I conduct as well and we are close friends btw.  #Dazedandconfused
-
 
 Please take my advice seriously. Do not under any circumstances make any further contact with that prof. Of course I figure out that you would most likely ignore my advice and do it anyway. Remember this: you will not be his last, and you are most certainly not his first. 
-
 


I have been in your shoes, I know clearly how you feel the only diff is my ex wasn't the best, or so I thought. He would never take my side, to him, his parents are always right. 

I can't bring myself to initiate the breakup cause it hurts me a million times more than the hurt that would ever caused him. 

So I guess for your case, the only way is to wait for something really to happen that leave him with no other choice but to dump u.

I feel so powerless over my crappy performance. Little friends, mediocre results, pangs of loneliness every single day.

I have this feeling that I can't help myself so I choose to help others whenever I can, wherever I can. It has given me a purpose I so longed for and puts a smile on my face.

But the uncertainty of the future, just froze me on my tracks and I have no drive or desire to do well in school ever since I stepped in last August. The lack of goals is disturbing..

Hi, i am a year 3 student and this sem would mostly likely be my last. I always have this crush on my professor (since year 1) who is at least 10 years older than me. I suspect that he has a fetish for "simulating questions". And I have been asking that kind of question ever since. Should i make a move?

Have been talking to a girl online. I have asked her out on a date because I like talking to her. She agreed. However after looking at her photos, I am having second thoughts. I know its super jerk of me but she just isn't physically attractive to me. I have a feeling she likes me. Do I owe her this date or should I pull a slow fade?

Fk man she would feel so hurt knowing that I am not as enthusiastic as before after looking through her photos. FML. Advices please.

I have a friend who broke up with her boyfriend a few months ago, and our youth pastor from church banned her from relationships for half a year for her protection and ensuring she doesn't rebound. But recently she started liking this other guy, and it seems like he likes her too. They've been talking a lot and going out together (1 on 1) frequently, and I'm really scared for her because she could really be rebounding and the result may not be good. Our youth pastor is also someone not to be trifled with.

I've talked to her and she says there's nothing going on. But things have developed to a stage where everyone can see that there's obviously something. What should I do as her friend?
-
 
I'm slowly coming to realize that there are some distances that can't be transcended.

Earlier, on the way home, i was on the train, and I was with her in the same train carriage. Once, we tried going out, but that didn't work out, and all that really remained was this chilly silence between the both of us.

We were just.. centimeters apart, you know? I wished that I could have been able to break through that invisible wall seperating both of us, and perhaps laugh and talk to her like I did in the past. I couldn't break past that wall, though. I couldn't surmount it. I tried making light conversation, but that led nowhere - maybe we were both tired, maybe we were both just enjoying a little bit of alone-time, but there was this... sense of distance between us.

God. I'm tired. Never knew that things would turn out this way.

So recently I heard that if in chat people just reply with one emoticon, they are telling you to shut up. I recall all those icon that my friends type in chat. I think some are funny, some very encouraging, some cheering me up a lot. It turns out all of them are trying to tell me to stfu? :(

I am an evergreen girl who has never had a crush before (maybe eyecandy but not a legit crush). However, during a camp last year, I started developing feelings for this guy. Even though I am quite sociable, he was the only person who I had a problem talking to because my mind always goes blank whenever I see him. When school started, I always hoped to bump into him but I hardly ever see him other than our common lecture together. 
Then came the news of him turning amber which made me give up my feelings for him. 
Somehow his relationship with the girl did not work out and he is back to being single again. By then, I have already gotten over him but the funny thing is that I keep bumping into him in school???  I don’t know how to say this but I find it really ironic how whenever you want something to happen but it does not happen and when you finally give up, it keeps happening?????  

-
 
In response to  I would like to share my personal experience.

I think having fwbs is actually quite common as I had a few before and some of my friends had theirs too. 

My fwbs were not planned.  I didn't set out looking for one but somehow things just happened and for some,  it became 'long-term' and we just continued with it while continuing to be normal friends. 

At first I found such relationships awkward but as my fwbs all were the type who pretended there was nothing between us in normal situations,  I gradually also forgot about it when we were in the 'normal mode'  and I find it exciting to know them on these different levels. 

Generally I think having fwbs are acceptable but I do regret some of them.  When I was younger I had some who already were attached and one even married.  Those I definitely do think that I did wrong but I guess it is too late to make amendments.  I have just stopped my escapades,  especially since I am attached now and do not wish to cheat :)

The importance of a hug. You taught me that. I really appreciated every hug that I had from you. It was a small gift but it was so rare in my life.

I came from a family that takes hugging as a form of problem. If I needed a hug, it means I have problems. And if I had problems, I would not share because no one in my family can be trusted not to share. Share with any of them a problem, the loudspeaker blares and the next thing you know, everyone knows. If I told them I have depression, they all would worry and also keep asking me why am I still unhappy with what I have. 

But you were different. You went through depression, you understood me. I can tell you everything, you would never even dream of sharing with anyone my problems. You hugged me whenever we met. Your hugs were my comfort and solace, a heaven I never knew existed. I forgot even what depression was like.

Alas, you were a drug that I could not let go. We had to go separate ways because I did not wish to ruin your life.

I drowned further in depression. From the day you left, no one hugged me. I always had family problems but no one to tell to. I tried confiding in my friends but they were not like you. I needed your familiarity and warmth. I need to say out things I have bottled up for a long time. Most importantly I needed someone who understood me. 

I avoided my friends and only remained in contact with my closest friends. I quit my CCA. I lost my motivation in life. In fact, I think I kind of quit life too. I have became a robot, struggling to graduate as soon as possible. I wish I can tell you but now that you are married, I shouldn't. Your wife certainly would not want you to keep texting this crazy woman. I'm closer to death than you can imagine. 

In fact, I often had to suppress my suicidal thoughts because I know you exist. I don't wish to see you feel sorry or sad for me. You were the only reason I still exist today. I know you would not read this but I just need an outlet to vent it out. I still miss you and love you so much.  
-
 
If you do like me, I need clearer signs. Thing is you're a really nice guy so I cannot tell if you're just being nice or dropping hints
-
 
I am hurting so much because I think I'm about to hurt my boyfriend... He loves me very very much and I love him too, but our personalities are too different and I don't see me being happy with him in the long run. To me, he is the best and sweetest guy out there but I can't go on like this... We've talked about it a lot but at the end of the day, I can't make him change who he is and he can't make me change who I am.. Not really seeking advice cos I'm not sure if there's any useful advice for me anyway, just wanted to get it off my chest 
-
 
 Dear OP, people tend to trust me for advice, so take me very seriously when I say that not just communication, but effective communication is very important in a relationship, for your future relationships. The problem might lie somewhere else but the aforementioned point still stands.

I too had a great boyfriend but at that point in time while we were still together, we didn't really communicate effectively at all. It then went to a point where there were many miscommunications and misunderstandings, and they piled up as they weren't resolved. Thinking back on it now, it was extremely unhealthy. He wanted to talk, but I didn't. It also didn't help that I was impulsive. Despite all these, he still sticked around. Things then went way out of hand one day and he really had to leave, and cut off all contacts he had with me. His very final message was something like he doesn't blame me at all but leaving was just something he had to do and hoped I understood his situation from his POV. That was my story. I'm unsure how you've hurt your boyfriend, but I'm sure if he loves you as you say he does, as much as my boyfriend loved me back then, he doesn't want you to be too hard on yourself. Pick yourself up again and move on. Life goes on for both of you.

i got friends that will only like the photo or post if more than 20 people likes it. so whatever i post will be ignored by them since at most i can get is 5 likes. i did like their posts but they will never like them, even if me and the other popz person shared the same post. this really sucks :/

To the girl that walked into the lecture at approximately 1134 today, I just want to say that I can totally see your unbuttoned 2nd button on your blouse and the cute mole you have between your 'pears' when you walked to your seat.

I wanted to tell you in person but I was too much of a coward cos you are a beauty and I am just an unattractive otaku. You would probably have screamed pervert or even question how I knew in the first place. (possibily accusing me of staring at your chest)

Sooooo.... ladies, what should I do if I meet another situation like this again? No, horny guys out there. I was not lucky. I was struggling with my inner demons on whether to tell her for the entire rest of the lesson.
-
 
 Based on my past dating experiences, I think a lot depends on the context. Disregarding contexts that are to be considered promises or assurances, especially made when the guy is extremely angry and/or sad,
If a guy can't keep to his words when he says not to find him again; or
If a guy can't keep to his words when he says he's really already had enough; or
If a guy can't keep to his words when he says he would throw away some of the memories he's had of you,
He probably likes you a lot.

Now that you've brought this up, guys know what to do now. :(
The idea for them is not to stop making promises but make them elsewhere where evidence is more controversial, like hooking pinkies. You just spoiled the market!!
-
 
Wow why is it whenever I told my friends I have a crush. The first question they ask is does she have a bf? Gosh do you all really think that I'm the sort that snatches people's gf? Or do you all think that I'm fated to get unrequited love?  
-
 
I have not gone out with many girls in my life so far. Among these girls, I have two whom I still feel that I have let them down. (This is going to be a long post with no TL;DR)

Girl 1 - my ex.

1. We were each other's first gf/bf. I did not admit it at that time but it was really a case of she loving me more than I loved her. She was not top-of-the-range in terms of looks (neither am I), but she treated me really well. I took her for granted and it got to a point when I would message her once every few days, claiming that I was busy with different events in school. The last straw that broke the camel's back was when I let slip that my parents did not think we were compatible in terms of character, future earnings etc. She initiated the breakup soon after, not because of these, but because she felt I was unwilling to fight for a mutual future together.

2. To make things worse, we were (are?) each other's first sexual partner, having started during our relationship. After the breakup, we continued sleeping together for a few months. Even though I made it clear that we are never ever going to get back together and she ostensibly understanding that, it felt like she harboured a hope that we would get back together and therefore she agreed to our continued sexual liaisons.

3. Alas, things did not last. Shortly before Christmas Day one year, I was overseas and dropped her a message asking whether we wanted to have a short staycation so that we could have an extended session together. She refused despite my attempts to persuade otherwise. Finally, I said, "Fine" and ignored her. Even when she changed her stance and claimed that she felt that she needed "to do it", I continued ignoring her out of spite. After that Christmas Day, our messages stopped and a few months later I heard she got attached.

4. Over these years, we re-established contact and today we are friends, or at least acquaintances. She is still happily attached to that same person while I am also happily attached to another girl. We do not speak about our past, except for the one time she said something about it being disgusting to imagine me naked and I retorted with a "Haven't you seen every part of me, and vice-versa?"

5. Yet, under this seemingly normal acquaintanceship, I still feel that, in a way, I used her soft spots towards me to continue sleeping with her even outside of a relationship. I am glad, on hindsight, that the sexual liaisons stopped, because continuing them would have hindered both of us from truly moving on.

Girl 2 - my fling

6. I knew her from attending this particular event and got her contact soon after. The reason for getting her contact, however, was to persuade her to join a certain committee. After many nights of persuasion, she finally relented, but not before confiding to me that she has a clinical condition which may hinder her time in the committee. I assured her that it was fine and agreed to keep it a secret for her.

7. Subsequently, I started going with another girl while maintaining a platonic friendship with Girl 2. My dates with the other girl ended up in failure when she decided that I was not the right person she was looking for. I was devastated. I felt that I truly liked the other girl, even to the extent of liking more strongly compared to my ex, Girl 1 (ironic how karma works).

8. During my post "breakup" phase, I started to communicate with Girl 2 more frequently. The communication grew in both frequency and intimacy. Soon, it escalated into meetups, study sessions etc. The sexual tension between us grew. It all culminated in one day when we were about to leave a tutorial room after studying for the whole day, she happened to stand very close to me when I was about to open the door. Looking into her eyes, I leaned forward to kiss her and the sexual tension was released as we literally dropped our bags at the door and went to a corner to make out (luckily it was a weekend).

9. On the MRT home after that, she asked me if we had a future together. I said I was unable to give her an answer. At that point in time, I felt that she was willing to commit if I said yes, but I wussed out, leaving two hearts separate.

10. After that, we ignored each other for a few months, until I required her help in some project. This time round, she told me she was attached already. The date she got attached? That very night after we made out, she went home and her boyfriend confessed to her. Feeling that he can promise a more secure future, she agreed. Then, as if to rub it in further, she said she offered her boyfriend oral sex that night because she had to offer him something more than what she offered me during the make out session.

11. We remained platonic, but like peat fires, the flames are unseen but lay un-extinguished underground. It took a dinner, after her tiff with her boyfriend, and a walk in the park for the flames to reignite. From then on, we started a fling - we would do everything except the full course while she remained attached to her boyfriend. I justified to myself morally that she was the attached, and therefore the cheating, one, not me (who was unattached).

12. Obviously, such fling is not sustainable. Passionate? Yes. Torrid? Yes. Sustainable? No. Things came to a head when she confessed to her boyfriend about the fling, which in turn triggered his own clinical condition. When I stupidly asked her if she was willing to leave her boyfriend to be with me, she said she could not decide. It was then I told her that if she could not choose, I would choose for her and that is to leave. Cynically speaking, the barrier to me leaving was lower since I was not getting any full course sex anyway. She offered as a desperate attempt to keep me, but I declined out of fear that it was her ploy for me to impregnate her and complicate matters.

13. After these years, I am glad to have ended that toxic fling. Similar to my ex, the ending was acrimonious. Dissimilarly, we never reconnected after that and I saw no reason to. On hindsight, it was quite obvious that I personally treated her as a substitute for the girl whom I did not work out with. Girl 2 is an intelligent and above-average looking girl herself and I should have done better than to treat her that way.

14. Am I b*stard in treating her the way I treated her? Certainly yes. Should I have treasured her more? I am not so sure because she was attached at that point in time. Besides, the raison d'etre of our "relationship" is on a sexual/physical basis, not on an emotional basis. We let emotions come into play when we should have known better. This is also why I firmly believe that separating physical and emotional needs is very difficult, if not impossible, because of the way we are wired.

Conclusion (finally!)

15. To Girl 1, thanks for teaching me what *not* to do as a boyfriend and sorry for having continued to sleep with you after our breakup. I really wish you all the best in your relationship and, should you invite me to your wedding, I will certainly turn up with a fat angbao.

16. To Girl 2, I am sorry for causing you all the hurt and for letting my emotions destroy the safeguards I had built into our brief time together. Please let it be known that I have absolutely no intention of contacting nor disturbing you. As I heard you are still together with the same guy, I sincerely wish you all the best in your relationship as well as your future.

P.S. My only purpose of writing this is to revisit, albeit mentally, my emotional journey. It was cathartic writing this. Thank you for reading if you made it here.

is it weird if I never had sex with my first boyfriend (not even a HJ or BJ), but I have been sleeping with a couple of FB after the break up? 
-
 
I have been talking to this girl online and we seem to hit it off pretty well. We text each other late into the night and she's really proactive in asking me questions etc etc (its almost like a interview for prospective bf/husband). I do feel that she drop hints abit like she wants a stable R/S and indirectly ask me if I have a gf. Yesterday we were on the topic of friendzone and I just asked the question "so am I in your frenzone and would there be something more" she just told me that is for me to find out with a cheeky smile.

So what does that mean? We have been talking for like 5 days lol and haven't even met:D

You want confessions? Here are some:
-I have been to confession here more times than in real life
-Whoever who walked slowly in front of me, I've fantasized about killing you
-I no longer bother to spread nutella on anything other than my tongue
-Sometimes i wonder if God loves me because he actually likes me, or because he has to because he is God
-I've fantasized about having a serious disease so people would feel bad for me, but is also easily cured when I've soaked up enough pity
-When i'm at karaoke and someone sings 'Don't stop believing', I stop believing
-Sometimes on my cheat day, i order a whole plate of french fries... and then have sex with it
-I buy kale and put it in the fridge and never eat it. Then i start resenting it, and enjoy watching it die
-One time i test drove a car so i can use the dealership's bathroom
-Sometimes at recital, i just applaud at random intervals to make it seem i appreciate something no one else got
-When i rescue a shelter dog, i would name it 'shelter dog' so everyone would know that i rescued it
-If i got two cats, i would name them 'cat 1' and 'cat 3' so everyone would feel sorry for me

-
 
I have a friend who is a really unhappy person even though she always puts on a front and pretends to be happy. Even though I do not know what her problems are, I would like to help her on some ways. Any idea how I can help?

I just really want to know how common a friends with benefits situation in our society really is? I've always thought our society was a conservative one, also cause since many of my friends have traditional mindsets.
However, in the past year, something happened between two of my friends and I (not a threesome! each were separate events), and I ended up being intimate with two people that have been friends with me for almost ten years.  It was a sudden and one-off kinda thing and we were never ever attracted to each other prior to it happening. We still remained good friends and talk as per normal so I'm not here to whine about losing a friend or things being different etc. I'm just genuinely curious about the frequency about this "friends with benefits" phenomena. Please feel free to provide answers to this post via another confession. 

Thanks everybody!

How do girls actually find guys for casual sex? ):

I'll do anything to turn back time, 
back to the days where everything is going right. 
I'll never run away again, 
not from the one i love the most. 
I promise to never leave you in the dark because you are where my light is.
I want to be your side through the highs and lows, to share the joys and tears. 
Every little step I make, 
We'll be together.
I promise to never leave you, 
so don't leave me too.

Give me a chance, we'll make things right. 

Do second chance really exists in life? The sad thing is that the message is probably not intended for me, but let me deceive myself for a final time. Give me a sign if it's you - love, D

I sent my boyfriend off for exchange a few days ago and I was/still am secretly happy...

Sometimes I feel that I made the wrong decision. We knew each other since year 1 and have been good friends. he later on found a girlfriend and I liked someone else in between, but my feelings for him were still there. I constantly talked to him over whatsapp, and had all the midnight whatsapp chats, and met up once in a while, and when he finally broke off with his girlfriend, I subtly made my move, being there for him and we quickly started dating after that.

The satisfaction of getting into this relationship is slowly disappearing (less than a year), and I can't help but wish we could just be good friends again or ....

To the OP of confession ,

You might not know me, or you might do. I am one of the regular contributors of comments on NUSWhispers, and coming across your confession post my heart broke a little more inside for you. Your mental strength to even compose yourself enough to write what you wrote, without malice of exposing the architects of your betrayal is something I both admire, and yet at the same time add rage towards your friend and now-ex that had wronged you in the most heinous manner possible. 

I have only dated once in my life. Wasn't as long as yours, heck it wasn't even as long as what most people would have dated on average. I was with my ex for the three to four months before I left Singapore for university overseas. For someone who admittedly was not blessed with luck in love, she meant everything to me back when I was a more turbulent and tempestuous being. For someone who had been planning to leave Singapore, study overseas and never return, she gave me reason once again to hope for a future with someone here in Singapore, someone whom I could share my life and heart and love with. 

Slightly more than a week after I arrived at my university, what had started out auspiciously as our budding LDR suddenly went sour. For no reason my ex ghosted me on all communication channels. Whatsapp, Facebook, phone calls, everything. My mind went into overdrive and I nearly went mad with worry over her safety and our relationship. I still remember vividly the afternoon that I was in university attending events for Freshers' Week when her Whatsapp message came through. She said that she had found out right after I left Singapore than she was pregnant with my child, from our last night spent together in the same bed. We had done it only twice in our relationship, and according to her words against all protection we both took she still struck the biological jackpot and got pregnant. I was shellshocked to read next that she ghosted me the entire week because she was pondering her decision to make, and that the very morning she Whatsapped me she had just come back from the clinic where she had induced the abortion, and with that she broke up with me. 

Two hours after I received the message I had booked the first flight back home that I could. Five hours after the message was read I was on the train to the airport. No phone calls went through. No messages went answered or even read. I called my parents and broke down on the phone to my dad, and to his credit he did not tell my mother the terrible incident, and fully supported me to fly back home to see what support I could give for my ex, or failing that how best to end the relationship on a proper footing. My train got delayed, and my flight left early, so I ended up staying overnight at the airport hotel before catching the first flight back the next morning. I had fallen badly ill throughout this time, and my family doctor whom I subsequently visited when I returned home said he would have grounded me from flying had he seen to me in the country from which I flew from.

When I arrived back at Changi Airport I tried to contact my ex again, and when I failed I did the only thing I thought an honourable man should do. I called her mother and tried to find out where her daughter was. She was surprised that I was suddenly back in Singapore until I confessed to her everything my ex told me. I guess you could call it foolish honour on my part, I genuinely thought that I'd offer myself up, physically and mentally and emotionally for whatever punishment that was to await me from her parents, if it meant that I could somehow see my ex again and find out the truth of the matter. But it was not to be. 

My ex sending me off at the airport proved to be the last time I'd ever see her face again. After their own personal discussions both my ex's parents called me back. Far from the anger I  expected to receive from them, their responses were very much the opposite. They thanked me for being an honourable man who would fly back from two continents away to attempt taking responsibility for their daughter, but that they couldn't persuade their daughter to see me one last time and end things right. In the mother's words "our family does not want anything more to do with you, so I thank you for being a good partner to my daughter for the past few months, and that you fly back and complete your education. Leave my daughter and this relationship behind, forget that we ever existed." And promptly after I returned back to university, my ex's family and friends all blocked and deleted me off every single avenue of contact, online or through the phone. 

The clincher of all this was that when I returned back to visit last summer, I got into contact once more with a mutual friend of me and my ex. And she finally told me what I had suspected all along as I dealt with the emotional turmoil of a breakup so bad alone in a foreign country. My ex had never been pregnant, the friend told me. She thought I would be like most guys who would be scared off with talks of pregnancy by their hands, and that fundamentally she decided to break up after we started our LDR because she was paranoid that I would not be able to resist the temptation of foreign girls compared to her waiting for me back home. So I lost my first proper relationship and the girl I loved, to her paranoia and a lousy lie of a reason that left me emotionally wrecked for the rest of the year to come. 

So, OP of confession , I thought that with your courage of sharing your breakup on NUSWhispers that I'd share mine as well. Might not be comparable to yours in terms of magnitude (god knows I didn't even get to a first anniversary, much less BTO talk), but I believe our stories though different share a similar trauma. The rage and despair you feel now must be unimaginable and almost unsurvivable. No words will comfort you, no gestures will warm you. You will be playing over everything in the past you shared with your cheating ex and castigating yourself on what you did wrong, and what you could have changed. But as someone who took almost a year to move on significantly (and not even fully) I can tell you this. Time will heal you, whether you believe it does or not. Do not blame yourself, because the last thing you need now is to bring yourself down when others have given you such a crushing blow that few will ever receive in similar fashion. I hope you will have better fortune and mental fortitude to deal with the emotional scars you must bear with such pain now, than I had with my own wounds. I'm still fighting every day to move on, to live on and love and feel again after all the trauma that I had gone through. We all will have to, you and I both and others out there who have similar stories to share. But know that you are not alone, you will never be alone, and that what support I did not receive back in my darkest hours I am offering mine to you when you need it most now. I do not want you to come out of everything as badly or worse than how I came out of my own breakup. There are enough people in the world who are irreparably hurt emotionally, you deserve so much better than the cheating ex and traitorous friend of yours. 

Keep breathing, keep fighting, keep living, don't stop hoping. We are the ones who have to go through hell and high water because of our love for the wrong people in our lives, but I believe that Fate will ultimately prove kind to us and give us back what we've lost. If you're still wondering who I am after reading all this that I've written, I'm the only comment contributor on NUSWhispers who is currently studying in the UK. Talk to me, message me, I will always have time for you and I will always have your back. 

Never forget, never regret. Stay strong brother.

Some of the guys here who post about their girls problems are really salty af. Seriously, girls do not owe you a date just because you're nice to them, or because you get good grades, or because you've been a good boy in general. If you really want to attract the opposite sex, get a personality, be interesting and try to get in good shape. It's really that simple. Whining about being perpetually friendzoned won't do you any good--in fact it's the fastest way for you to get friendzoned.

So I have this very close female friend. Typical story. Boy and girl. Childhood friends. 

But we never dated. We never fell in love. Or at least, the very least, we never confessed to each other.

Recently, one mutual friend disclosed to me a secret. That my childhood friend actually had a crush on me before. 4 years ago. But she never spoke of this crush ever again since. 
And now i think back, her actions back then really did seem so. Small things, minor things like asking me out, calling me more than often.

We shared many "first times". We had many memories together, went out together (though those weren't official dates) and we talked almost everything. Very naturally, carefree. Mostly on the phone. I find that a feat cos i cant really engage in a non awkward convo with others on the phone except for her.

The thing is, I love her. I truly do. But i dun know as what:
I care for her. But our r/s, as corny as it sounds, is akin to a brother/sister relationship.
While I feel that I can spend the rest of my life with her, married, cos she knows me before, I dont have other romantic feelings for her.

I dont fantacise about us having intercourse, yet i always picture us having a family. I dont feel the urge to kiss, hug her, yet I want told hold her hand, to never let her go.

Recently, i felt that she is slowly leaving my grasp. She is having her own life. Own friends. Friends whom we didnt share. Her own new social circle. We shared schools, classes (from pri sch to JC ) for so long that i barely remembered what was it like without her . We studied together,  shared notes, copied each other's notes. We meet up lesser, and i don't blame her. 

I never dated.
She is in her 3rd year. I barely completed my 1st. (Cos ns ).
They say it is never too late. And i am ready to confess. To make a change. But before that, i really need to know:
Should I? Do I love her enough to be with her? Or is my love for her too platonic? Is it normal to have such a platonic love for my best friend? Are we indifferent from parallel lines - so close together but we will never meet?  If so, will it be fair for her? Will I hurt her if she knows that, I dont harbour the most romantic feelings for her.

Please help. ;'(

Why are people always saying " the right person will come into your life". This don't seems to be applicable for guys. The right person will never come into our life unless we do something. 
-
 
All a sudden, he disappeared. 
The smell of him, the sound of his laugh, the sight of him were removed from your world. Too fast. Too sudden. 
You did not get a proper farewell. 
How did things turn like this? 

Sigh today was a horrible day because you aren't here. I was watching a drama where one of the character was struggling to keep his unrequited feelings at bay and I honestly felt every single throbbing pain and wisps of grief that the character felt. 

Unrequited feelings suck! And you know what sucks?! When you can't do much about it but suck it up and wait for time to dampen the god damn feelings. 

Ffs, why can't everybody have a destined partner where they both like each other and can stay together forever geez
No more broken hearts, no more messy breakups/ divorce. 
-
 
 It might just be me but I would honestly find it hard to accept if my boyfriend wasn't one. Individual preferences I guess.
-
 
Still cant get over after 2 years of relationship with my bf as we are in a LDR. Its been affecting me quite badly as I cannot concentrate on my studies at all. Anyone can tell me how to get over it? (ps I am a guy)

I shared a pic of Jeff Seid to my female friends and was surprised that they found his body disgusting and overly ripped. That left me puzzled cos' I thought he'd totally be perceived as hot to girls :/
-
 
I'm too shy to ever admit this to my girlfriend, but the one reason why I've held tightly on to her for all these years is because of the calm and peacefulness I get whenever I'm with her. As a person who is very quick to anger despite being a job that demands the exact opposite, the mental support just knowing she's there for me has been immeasurable. I promise to get that ring come year end once my career stabilizes..
-
 
Sometimes friendships end unexpectedly, and for the most unimaginable reasons. Its better to walk away from broken relationships that cannot be saved anymore.
-
 
Girl you promised to stay thru thick&thin with me. Did 4 years of dates mean nothing to you?
Friend, you saw me at my lowest. We knew each other for 7 years.

And today I lost them both.
ladies and gentleman, I just found out that my girlfriend has secretly been in love with my best friend for- (wait for it) - the entire length of our relationship.
Getting together with me was , i quote " in a bid to get closer to [best friend's name] "

It gets better:
They were together and she has been cheating on me for a year now.

And here is the climax:
I didn't find out.
She finally confessed, when I proposed.

Yes 
Proposed. 
Not with a ring, but the singaporean way of introducing the idea of applying for a BTO.

And now you two don't return my calls, texts and avoid me when I see you down the hall.

I don't even have the time to be mad. I barely just digested all this shit.
Like the times when you said you were sick but your friends said they saw you outside. 
I thought that was just a white lie.
Or the times when you said you were at home and I was at your doorstep surprising you but turns out you were outside (with him?) and you just settled me down with a jkjk (;

I am a guy. I have lust. I have urges.
But more than that, I had respect for you. for you and your wishes.
Abstinence you said. 
Not ready you said.
Fine, I said.

And then you went on to tell me that day (dear readers, did i mention she broke up with me over the phone?)
(no it wasn't a call, it was whatssap. Then she blocked me), THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IT WITH HIM FOR - I quote yet again - "quite a number of times" !?!?!

Dear audience, ain't this wonderful?

I have had it. 
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't wanna call you out.
I gave you face which is why I didn't wanna make a fuss in the canteen the other day when I confronted you.
But you can't avoid me forever.

And up until now, all I wanna know, and all I was ever thinking,  is why....

p.s. considered placing a screenshot of the long long message but
1) it is too long and the screenshot of the entire message is 5 pictures
2) she uses unique spellings that would have been a dead giveaway to her identity.

I am not a nice guy.

I am impatient. I don't have the ability to communicate with naive children. I don't see the need to waste my time justifying my actions to people who don't matter, such as mere acquaintances or classmates.

I don't see the point of sugarcoating or beating around the bush. I say things to people straight to their face.

Cause of that, some people say that I am rude.

I am pragmatic. I weigh options, I prioritise. I choose the option that would make the most out of my time. 

I am simple and boring. I eat simple meals. I eat the cheapest meals. I don't instagram my meals. I don't tweet. I don't update my facebook. I just read up about scientific discovery, I don't follow celebrity news or gossips.

I am self-centered. I do not respond to obligatory group meals, class gatherings if I won't be happy going. Even if my friend(s) are involved.

The kinder people say I am introverted. The others use the word @$$. I deny neither accusations.

And from you can read from above, I probably don't have a lot of friends either. I have less than 10. That's probably cause I highly regard the word 'friend' , not just as a status, but as a title, referring to someone I treasure a lot to be , and for me to keep, in my life.
Guess before I lose your interest, let me state this:

This isn't about me, This isn't a self introduction post, a john cena joke or a post looking for a girlfriend.

This is about me wanting to change.

I am a Singaporean guy. 21 this year I just ORD-ed from NS not long ago and I am enrolling into NUS Engineering School this coming new semester.

It is a fresh experience for me. I was a JC student, so I never got to experience the university/poly lifestyle.

While I am eager to start my uni life, eager to learn and move onto the next stage of my life, there is something bothering me.

I hate orientation camps. I don't see the point of doing forfeits or shameful things together to forge new bonds or meet new people.

More than that I actually hate making new friends or meeting new people.

It is bothersome, tiring and to me, a waste of time.

Call me old fashion but I would much rather be on a speed-dating process talking to a stranger over a table and making friends via introduction. And if I don't like him/her , I will just shout: NEXT!

I believe that making friends is no different from dating.

You get to know someone. You evaluate the person's character and you determine if you still want someone like him/her in your life.

That is my opinion. Like I mentioned before, I am pragmatic. And from you would have gathered by now, pessimistic. 

To me, if someone is of a character I don't like, that doesn't make either of us 'bad friends' or 'bad people'.

It is just that since our characters don't match, why bother continue being friendly or keeping in contact?

Sure, we aren't complete strangers, we can still be acquaintances, some would say.

But to me, someone who hates small talk, acquaintances is no different from strangers.

I wasn't always like that. 

Believe it or not, and even I find it hard to believe it myself, I wasn't always like this.

I used to have friends. Whoever talked to me once, that was my friend. That was me... last time.

Then shit happens.

It became so bothersome to hold onto friendship. onto bonds.

It started with a small thing. A birthday gathering. Some couldn't make it on Day 1, others had something on on Day 2.

I had to choose a date.

And I upset some friends.

First came the drama. Arguments, eye stares, hatred.

Then the picking of sides.

Then pettiness and blame kicks in. 

And after everything, I was left standing alone taking the blame from both ends.

"You were the reason the group broke apart." I remembered hearing.

That, and many other things, made me sick and tired of forging new relationships, making the effort to know people.

I still do, as previously mentioned, have friends. Some. They don't share the same personality as me. Some are even the polar opposite. 

And I am happy with having just them as friends.

I don't need new ones.

I don't need new drama, new picking of sides, and new petty people in my life.

I don't want to go through all the trouble, after putting in all the effort to forge relationships, only for someone else to destroy it. 

And I am the one ending up getting hurt.

To put it in a plain way, guess I was Spongebob, but I ended up being like Squidward
"I built the walls from the bridges that I burnt down."

People often say that you have to know influential people in life, or broaden your social network or the people you know.

"It is the political game" they say. "Office politics"

If that is so I would rather not play the game.

Guess after writing for so long (and thank you, anyone who bothers to read such a lengthy and boring post), I want to know:

What do you think of a person like me? Am I abnormal?
I want to change, but how?
Should I really join such introduction/orientation camps? Would it really change me?
And if it doesn't, I would have wasted money, time and effort, all over again.

Signed,
A Troubled Soul

 People do not dislike you for being introverted. It is more likely that they are put-off by you pretending to be what you are. Faking confidence is different from faking a whole new persona. I would probably wonder why you are sometimes so enthusiastic to interact with me and sometimes not. I would probably come to the conclusion that you aren't all that interested to know me. What you need to learn is to open up to people, not how to make yourself seem like what you are not.

To the writer of 

Will you allow me to rebuild the bridge between us two? 
Will you allow me to become closer to you once more? 
Will you promise that you will not run away from your fears but share them with me and take me in your hands and fight it together? 

Will you promise me to never leave me in the dark anymore? 
I want to be by your side through thick and thin, I want to go through everything you experience so please when things get hard don't leave me. 
I want to be with you. 
Every step of the way. 
Whether it is Gucci or not, I want to be by your side. 
I just want to stay with you, psycho. 

So please, promise to never leave me again?

Need advice from u guys.

I have a very fit & handsome roommate who does well in his studies and sports. Being in the same room as him, I seem to grow to like him. The uncontrollable part  is he sleep naked and i cannot control myself as he is really hot and sexy. Spotted him with erection a few times at night and I really feel like touching him. Feel like 'eating' him. But is wrong of me if i do that.

Hey buddy I feel you man. I am similar to you too, and personally I think I have Avoidant Personality Disorder, although I haven't gone for any diagnosis to confirm it. 

I can also talk superficially with lots of people that aren't my close friends, but I however just can't seem to get relationships to a deeper level. Recently, this superficial talk has become even more draining than usual because 1) I am an introvert as well, and 2) I realise it isn't getting me anywhere. I have absolutely zero close friends that I personally chose to get close to, if that makes any sense. The couple of close friends that I have are the ones who found me, who broke my superficial facade. And surprise, they are all guys, haha. It is kinda hard to find dates when all your friends are guys :(

I don't know why I have this disorder, but I think deep down within the reason is probably that I am afraid that people won't like me, and reject me. I understand that it is very illogical to think that way, but I just can't help it. I am afraid of going to dates because I fear that my date will judge me for being awkward/introverted/quiet etc, and I think they can sense it unfortunately.

May God help us both :/

Girl in love with someone much better than me. I find it hard to confess. Some help?

  "One thing I don't understand though, is why you would give up so easily when you claimed that you liked me that much?"

 "Maybe I should let you go, because of how much you're affecting me. I haven't told you, but I have two suitors currently after me. Maybe I'm hoping if I leave, if I go with someone else, you'll come chasing after me, but I'm just deceiving myself, like a fool. :("

There are two scenarios that could be playing out in each of these cases:
(1) You are extremely insecure. You do not love the opposing party. You are trying to seek self-validation through the attention and the pursuit from others.
Advice: Please learn to love yourself first and do yourself and others a favour.
(2) You are extremely insecure. You love the opposing party.
Advice: Is that how you ought to love someone?

In either case, either you are oblivious to the opposing party's feelings for you or you are just playing dumb. Please don't push the blame onto others and accuse them of not loving you.

If anyone has good advice, advice, or just perspectives to share, could you kindly do so? I have hardly ever felt this way before if I have ever done so previously. I felt that recently or since I've entered the university, I've made so many poor judgments, especially of people and I'm not quite sure how I should feel right now. I also can't seem to find a term to describe my feelings right now. Perhaps the closest would be "How could I have been so wrong." And I would think they weren't premature judgments at all.

To  I am not sure if that post was about me and I hope it is. If it is and you are reading this, I have deleted your number in my phone because it is too damn hard to stop texting you. Maybe drop me a text and we will see if we can work something out?

Well, sorry world I'm gonna be a bit grouchy for a time. Gimme some space.

(But you know what? Doesn't mean I want everyone to be as sad or grouchy as I. Life is as it is, everyone has it different, and happiness is not something I want spitefully taken away. I promise I won't be mean just because I'm grouchy. 

No one's the same. Someone is always better or worse. But a little bit of kindness never hurt.)

So, how may I help?

Feel super depressed and I want to cry. It's been 7 months since we broke up (been together for 3.5 years) but I seriously have not felt much joy ever since then. It's my last sem already and when I think about NUS, you will be in my memories and that sucks. How does one get over a stupid break up? Getting jobs and living life is hard enough as it is without such retarded emotions being at play. I really hate you for abandoning me and stealing away all our mutual friends when you cheated in the first place. Sometimes I really wish we'd never met. Can't really tell anyone because everyone's like saying I should have moved on already but it's so tough. Advice anyone? It would really help to know if anyone has ever felt this way :'(

We knew, right from the start, that we liked each other. We knew, at once, that we would get along. You felt that even if we were never in a relationship, we would be really good friends. 

It wasn't just that we had similar likes and dislikes, or that we enjoyed each other's company. We found that we shared the same values, and we communicate well. (Communication was never something I was good at, but you were always so patient, understanding, and kind, that I learned to open up to you.) It didn't take very long for us to develop feelings for each other. 

It has been many months since I last saw you. We are over 10000 miles apart, and I miss you so much. I only wish there was some way for us to be together, that we could chase promises of forever, without either of us having to uproot ourselves, leaving our friends, families, and our lives behind. 

I can hardly wait to see you again.

I'm a guy who had been evergreen until early last year, when I met my current girlfriend in a module I took. We didn't want to tell anyone about it as we were not sure if we were stable enough yet. Recently, at a cca event, I got acquainted with another girl whom I inadvertently fell for. During a htht session, I was asked about my traffic light status in front of her, and at a loss of what to do, I said I was single. I feel guilty about it up till now as I feel like I've deceived her, and at the same time emotionally cheated on my girlfriend. However, I feel like my relationship with my current girlfriend is built out of gratitude (as she is really nice towards me and I will never want to hurt her) rather than love. In fact, I'm not really sure if I love her..and have been fighting with myself internally. I'd never want to see her cry. On the other hand, I feel like the other girl has fallen for me and that I feel the same way too. I'm torn and I feel like I'm a monster lying to both parties, what should I do? 

[Most people would probably say love cannot be forced...but it's a tough decision....I really don't want to hurt my girlfriend]

Thinking about you again G. The past month has been terrible. I literally couldn't get you off my mind. Thoughts of you surface everywhere at any time; in the middle of a seminar; while I'm on the bus; the list goes on. I wished that you would text me. It's terrible. I miss you. I haven't been feeling so down for three weeks now, which is a good sign, but maybe because I'm getting busier and tried a lot harder to keep you out of my mind. 

I wonder if you are happy now? Have you rekindled that happiness that you ran away from? I wished I could ask about your life, 但是自从那一天开始，我已经失去了问侯你的权利。只要是我做的事，即使你不那么觉得，我自己也会觉得我做的都还是因为我喜欢你。妳大概也是这样觉得吧，因为我和妳都很少聊了，妳觉得我只是随便说喜欢你试一试罢了，其实根本都没有很喜欢妳。过后我表现得不是很在乎，没有被影响到，但都是我想装出一副不是很在意的态度，和往常一样。我选择不要发短讯给妳了，不是因为我根本不喜欢你，而是因为我觉得我在妳心目中没有很重要，就算是朋友也比不上妳那些很要好的朋友，所以不要耽误你的时间。回来的第一个月我从事情的来龙去脉就看得出这一点了。

现在说什么都没有用了。我只是希望妳能幸福快乐。你要和妳一起去寻找幸福快乐的人不是我，那没关系。我只希望你能找回那个可以给你幸福快乐的人。喜欢一个人不需要占有，只要她快乐，我就满足了。I want you to be happy more than anything in the world.

Just like to get an opinion from the ladies out there... Would you mind if your future date/boyfriend/husband is a virgin?

I stated with a long distance relationship with my bf who is in USA now. He is an American Chinese. We were very sweet for the past one month. But I think recently he is a bit annoyed by my lack of sense of security and paranoid thinking. Honestly, I really like he and I know he does love me as well. But I feel very upset that we can't he physically together and therefore I expressed my worries and concerns. At the beginning, he would always reasure me and give me a lot of confidence on our relationship. But he told me few days ago that I should live my life as I need and don't need him every second in my life. I m very sad after hearing that. I put him as my priority, but I feel he wants us to be independent. Isn't it the purpose of being in a relationship is having someone u can depend on? Idk whether this is a cultural difference. Western culture thinks couple should be independent and shouldn't always rely on each other? 
Also, I mentioned to him that I want to Skype more often. We are only Skype once a week for 10-30 mins. I can't stand this. He said he would try to skype more often, but so far no action is taken. I don't want to keep asking and pushing him. Also, his speed of replying messages is getting slower and slower. 
My fear and uncertainty over our relationship is getting worse, but I don't want to share with him as he thinks I m just being very paranoid. 
Last note, I really love him and I hope we can work out.

I have just came out from an important relationship, one that I thought might have lasted a lifetime. The break was unexpected, and it left me puzzled till today. I was told that her feelings have faded and she doesn't have the urge to tell me her things in life.  While it might be true that the initial feelings have faded, we have moved on to a phase where we were comfortable with each other during the relationship. We were able to hold talks about our future and connect with each other emotionally. It could be due to a transition period where we had less time for each other. However, I still feel that there were no signs or arguments along the way. I hope someone can enlighten me on whether if it is normal for a relationship to change drastically and the factors that might have led to this.

Hi guys sorry but I really would appreciate if anyone could help. 

So throughout semester I have been rather unhappy/stressed *inserts other similar adjectives*. Firstly, I have been overwhelmed by school work, committees I joined all around in school and also interpersonal relationship. Actually I don't know whats been bothering me the most but I generally feel quite anxious, stressed and have poor appetite. 

These days, I have been having nausea symptoms. It is so bad that I don't feel like stepping out of my room. I keep feeling that theres this tight feeling in my throat and I am about the throw up(though I don't). It makes me even more anxious when I'm outside. 

RN I am at my wits' end. I read that the symptoms may appear randomly and long after the stress period is over. Is this anxiety? And how do I overcome it? :(((  Anyone with similar experiences?

Yesterday while I was having dinner with my family and my sister's Boyfriend, I noticed something which really troubled me. 
At the dinner, we were seated as such so that the couple could be given as much privacy as possible without being conscious of our existence. 
However, once we were seated and orders were taken, both of them just whipped out their phones and did whatever they were doing on the phone before the food came. There were no words exchanged between my Sister and her Boyfriend throughout. My sister's eyes were glued to her phone, texting and visiting social media sites. Her Boyfriend was not much better. He was continually playing his game and not even once he bothered to look up at my sis. Even after the food came, they just went back to using their phones while eating the food. My parents were puzzled as it was the first time we went dinner with her Boyfriend tagging along, and they had assumed that they would want to be left alone to "lovey dovey". How wrong my dad was lol. 
The entire dinner took about 1.5 hours. My parents soon noticed that there was no conversation going on between the couple. Even after my parents initiated a conversation to get the couple to start talking, it was futile as it was evident that whatever they were doing on their phones took a greater priority. My Dad even commented after the dinner " even after 40 years of marriage with your Mother, I still can talk to her with more frequency than those 2 just now". 
I don't know whether it is me or what, but I have been seeing such incidents on a frequent basis nowadays. Whenever I go to cafes with my friends(I'm single), more often than not I see couples using their phones more than interacting with each other. I know social media sites can be attractive but you can always access it all the time when your SO is not around right?? Whereas one usually meets their Boyfriend/Girlfriend for 3-4 hours for a date? So why can't one just put aside his/her phone for those 3-4 hours and spend it fully with their loved one? If 3-4 hours is too long, surely not using the phone during the course of a meal (which is like 1.5 hours at most? ) at all is reasonable right? 
I feel that as a sign of respect for your SO, one should give him/her your full attention whenever they are out on a date. Maybe I'm wrong about this because I'm still single, but the thought of myself doing this with my future girlfriend...it doesn't feel right. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong...it's just my opinion! Cheers

In a couple more months, it would be a year since we broke up. She was my first girlfriend. It still feels like she will be my last. I believed so strongly that we could make things work, I really liked her. My heart still aches the familiar pain of regret whenever I think of her.

I will always remember the period of absolute bliss, when everything felt perfect and it was just the two of us, in this crazy world full of strange, unfamiliar people. I feel like I might have irreversibly romanticised that period of time, until I can no longer move on from it. I think of the sweet things she did for me that still puts a faint smile on my face. I think of the arguments that make me want to close my eyes, just for a moment, as I wallow in regret.

Since the breakup, I have had brief moments of positivity. There were days where I genuinely believed that it can only get better from here, and I feel happier. Now I feel like I have regressed back into this emotional maelstrom of pain, triggered by the smallest of hints of what we once had. A silly joke. A note you made for me. Dinner receipts. Thus is the life of a heartbroken student, still nursing my wounds and forcing myself to carry on 'living' according to schedule, like clockwork, when inside I am suffering in silence.

I have loved and I have lost. I do not know if I have experienced both ends of the emotional spectrum. I am inclined to think so, and that would only lead to the conclusion that there isn't anything better to look forward to in life. I know it's the wrong mindset, but I am still hanging on, by a thread, for someone to come along to convince me otherwise. That this broken soul is still capable of loving and being loved.

Went out with this girl i met online twice towards the end of last year and i did not feel sparks. 

Been wanting to ask her out recently, to be my valentine, and my heart sank when she said she was not free yet went out on another date. 

Dont understand why i suddenly feel for her so much, when i felt nothing last year, when we last met. Am i merely romanticising the idea of her? 

Now i dont know if i should try asking her out again, even as a friend (she was open to having dinner and drinks this week).
-
 
I've been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I feel as though I'm falling out of love with my SO. I don't know if I love him romantically, but I do know I love having someone to sleep beside at night, and someone to make happy. I feel as though he does not put in the effort anymore and I discovered certain things (not porn) in his phone that has resulted in this change. Sometimes I feel as though he is only using me for sex. I don't know what to do.

I think I suck ): things didn't happen as badly last semester but for this semester I get really irritated very easily. I think it is just me, with all that CCAs that I need to cope with for that period of time, everything just comes at the wrong time. And of course the heavy burden of my studies this semester made me even more stressed out. I tend to rant a lot instead of really solving things, I distanced myself from my friends because I don't want to offend them with my frustration, I showed my interest to my crush but I don't think he cared also. So now, I have no friends, a head filled with crap, and no hope for love lol
That's why I really think I suck cause I can't even deal with little things in life >< 
Sorry, another rant ):

I don't know if you follow this page but if you read this, I just want to say that I'm terribly sorry I didn't give you a chance. I really like you a lot as a person and maybe as a partner too but I didn't want to lead you on because I have commitment issues and at that point in time, I was still in love with someone else. I still want to thank you for calling me during your exam period even though you were supposed to be studying and I want to thank you for being my listening ear during that period of time. If I did agree to meeting you the other time, we could have spent Valentine's day this year together. But I guess you would have already found someone else by now. One thing I don't understand though, is why you would give up so easily when you claimed that you liked me that much? Anyways, my life is really messed up now and I really want to talk to you so please, if you read this, give me a call..

I got pregnant when I was barely 18 years old. Went for an abortion at 5 weeks. You know, that spare time you've got between JC and Uni. I rationalised that giving up baby would be sparing one life from settling a lesser life that I had. Also, I thought to myself, I probably won't be able to get an education if I have a child. Especially living the life that I was given. On very dark and lonely nights, I always wondered what it be like to have a 5-year old playing in my bedroom or sleeping my arms. On other days, I tell myself, I gave up the beautiful opportunity of motherhood for this- snooze-fest lecture, unproductive tutorials, professors who can barely teach, infuriating group mates who I gladly let me down so I do the work. Don't get me wrong. There are countless time where I am reassured that the option of giving up the baby was the right thing. But with the change in relationship status and an invincible family, being a single mum wouldn't be the worst thing. 

It be very selfish of me.
-
 
I have no idea if what I am going through is normal.
My Dad only knows how to laugh and does nothing every time my Mum scolds me.
My Mum scolds me all the time and makes (in my view) unreasonable requests of me that I cannot live up to no matter how much I try.
So I end up feeling absolutely pathetic and useless, crying a lot.
My mum always say if I am unhappy with this family, I am free to leave.
Frankly speaking, if I have the financial means and ability to live independently on my own, I would have done so long ago.
I was taught from a young age that family means love and support but I don't know why I can't feel it at all :(

Why do I always have the feeling that girls like me but are not willing to confess?

If only the feeling was mutual, they wouldn't have to wait in vain

I was always an excitable and bubbly person, and other times I'm just calm. But then I met you and for some reason you're the only one that could shake my calm heart and make me become so emotional and worried. I know you see me as someone who needs to control my emotions, but truth is I'm already calm, and it's only around you that I suddenly become doubtful of everything. It's because I care for you. But now I feel like a fool, in-front of you. Maybe I should let you go, because of how much you're affecting me. I haven't told you, but I have two suitors currently after me. Maybe I'm hoping if I leave, if I go with someone else, you'll come chasing after me, but I'm just deceiving myself, like a fool. :(
-
 
I stayed away from you not because I was angry at you or I hated the sight of you. I stayed away from you hoping that you will feel happier without me around. You always looked either troubled or angry when you see me. I don't even understand why you would sometimes mumble your words when you talk to me. A long time ago, when I held that door for you, you were trying to tell me something but you mumbled to yourself again. I regretted not asking you what you were trying to say. That was the last time you talked to me. I really wanted you to know this but I guess you probably wouldn't have heard me out anyway.

She already graduated a couple of semesters ago (so have i) so i doubt she would read the confessions on this page, so here goes

I was so deep in the friendzone that she wouldn't mind me crashing (multiple times) and sleeping on the floor of her room in Tembusu when i had 8am lectures the next day. In the morning of the following day, she would even change clothes in her room in my presence, all the while letting her bare back face me. There was also several instances where she would face the wall, unwrap her white bath towel and with her back facing me, ask me for help in hooking her bra...

I was so deep in the friendzone that i doubt she mentions me to her boyfriend because there was once i bumped into him at a queue in Kinokuniya, and he doesn't even bat an eyelid when he saw me. Like i was just another stranger, like another patron there, queuing behind him to pay for my books. And i saw him getting frustrated trying to call you (i assume?) but she didnt pick up because i was texting you at that moment to meet for lunch afterwards in ION.

I am so deep in the friendzone that i'm writing this post, late at night, with your wedding invite, which you gave a couple of weeks ago, beside my laptop thinking whether it would be a good idea to attend it later this August. I doubt you would even tell and be open (like the way you are to me) to your current fiancé (that same guy) about the other countless things we did together because you were more comfortable with me than him. 

I am so deep in the friendzone.

Sometimes we have to accept that things don't always go the way we wanted despite the best of efforts. Let go and embrace the air of freedom. Free from worries and make-believe.

Just to say, I've always tried my best for the things and person that I care for. But it has come to a point where I can no longer do anything to make things work...

I found out a week ago that my crush got attached over the last valentines. I thought I could forget by now, but I just can't stop thinking about her. I can't even begin questioning what I am doing wrong to lose her, because I already know the answer. I am just way too passive.

And it is biting at my heart not because I failed to obtain her, but rather for my lack of trying, because I have absolutely no idea how to properly chase a girl, because I am an evergreen at the age of 25, and because I should be happy for her and yet I can't because I can't even muster the courage to ask her out and let my intentions known. I am angry at myself for being so helpless in this arena of romance, and I am angry at myself for not knowing what to do to even save myself. Heck, I can't even like myself.

After reading sites after sites of dating advice, there is one common advice that is given to men. And that is confidence. But the thing is, how do you have confidence when you don't even have the experience to begin with. How do you have confidence when you are the introverted shy guy always in the corner stumbling over words when you are trying to talk to anyone. How do you have confidence if whenever you hang out with a friend on a one to one basis, you always run out of words to continue the conversation so the other party thinks that you are so very awkward? How do you have confidence when you are not rich or popular or able enough to compete with the other suitors that your crush have?

To the people that say the classic advice: "Fake it until you make it", yes I have done that, at least the first part of the quote. I have done that for at least 5 years. People always love me when I suddenly have the burst of energy to socialize, having a smile on my face, talking and chatting with people I know. But as an introvert, this is a facade that I simply cannot sustain forever. Whenever I start to show my introverted and quiet true self, the people I attracted based on first impression, start to drift off from me. And as a guy that doesn't like to intrude into peoples lives, it is hard to make friends with girls due to the very fact that girls don't normally make the first move to make friends with you. And also after so many years of social rejections, I also lost confidence in myself. I have been trying to tell myself, it is okay to be me, it is okay to be quiet and introverted, "people will eventually like you for who you are". But my past experiences just prove otherwise... People always like guys with lots of energy, sporty, and talkative. I have tried on that persona, but I can never sustain it, because that its not me. And that's why I keep people at an arms length and not see anyone for weeks at times, because I have no idea what to do to sustain relationships with people. I want to change this, because I am graduating this year already and everyones already getting engaged or already married at my age, and I don't want to stay single for life, it is just too sad.

I realise that I am a mess, I am typing all these right now because I can't keep my mind off her. If anyone identifies with my past midnight incoherent writing and have any advice to give, I would greatly appreciate it.
-
 
I have no idea what to do with my relationship. Guess, i shall just drown myself in work. I envy those who are able to pursue their dreams...I will probably be advised to pursue mine as well, but for those who do, do ask yourself whether have you actually succeeded in attaining them, or did you just simply alter them along the way.

I know I'm not supposed to feel like that given what I have... 

I have a comfortable house with great parents who give me lots of freedom, I'm in a course I enjoy, I'm not in need of money. I'm very satisfied with what I have currently. I don't chase branded goods or spend unnecessarily. 

but, somehow, I'm not happy. I don't know why but I feel really hollow inside and this has been happening for quite a while already.  A couple of months ago I'll just feel upset out of nowhere and have the urge to tear, even in public, yes. but it's gotten much better now. being an INFP-T, I tend to be really sensitive, think a lot, and spend a lot of time alone. People would call me someone who's very "chill"; emotionless/ lack of intense emotions. Whenever I'm feeling these negative emotions like what is happening now, I'll sit down, think hard, and question the source of my negative feelings but often to no avail. It'll just end up with me feeling really bad about feeling like that for no reason considering that there are many people who have more legit reasons to be unhappy - financial/family reasons etc... 

 I've tried to do things that make me happy - to bake/ cook, to get my favorite food etc, but after that wave of little happiness rides over, that hollow/empty feeling comes back. I've tried to keep myself busy by signing up for many things/commitments so that I won't be left alone with my thoughts, but that didn't help too. I'm a really private person, and none of my friends or family know the struggle I'm feeling. Besides, I tend to put on a happy/jovial front in front of them. I yearn for that pure, simple feeling of happiness I remember from years ago...

I don't know what to do... any advice guys? :( ( I have a history of ED and years later, I am still working on my self-image, esteem and confidence, if this information is of help)

I am really thankful that my ex cheated on me and is seeing someone new. She has a chronic heart illness and couldn't even give me a family. Good riddance. 

To the new guy: Every time you kiss her remember this; she used to suck my dick with that same mouth

 those people who ask you to just 'unfriend'  people or to 'diam diam'  are a bunch of balless cowards. 

Never be afraid to stand up for what you think is right. If everyone diam diam,  you're just letting the bullies win. Stand up make your disagreement known. 

Worst case is your "friends"  unfriend u,  but whose loss is it?

Anyone in a current LDR, can you post about how you manage it and make it work? May potentially enter one, frankly a little unsure of what to expect, and would like some advice to make things work. Thanks.

I need some advice here.
If i think i aint good enough for this because of multiple issues and yet she continues to love me, what should i do?? I dont think that i deserve that much and i think she will be better off with someone else. Of course i do like her.

So I have just sent my girlfriend off to LA for a business trip, and I am feeling a tad chummy inside. 

We have gone through 2 full years together. And the 2 years are filled with countless excitements, sweetness, sorrows and disappointments.

We first met each other in college. Back then she was a studious typical-girl-next-door and I was a typical playful ah beng. We had little common interests. She disliked my carefree attitude; I hated her boring routine. Anyone would say it is impossible that this 2 kids will one day get together. 

But we did. 

Honestly the first few interactions were meh - no spark at all. Then one fine day, she threw a wink at me. And something magical happened. My impression of her just changed. I started to develop little good feelings for her. I found everything about her to be attractive. The way she talks, the way she walks; all seemed to be so cute. I felt as if I was blind and suddenly I could see! How could I have not noticed a girl so angelic close to me? And the good feelings for her grew stronger and stronger with every passing day.  

One day I woke up and said, "Okay. I am in love. I need her in my life." 

And I confessed to her. 

She was skeptical at first. I would too - how can someone who is as playful as me be a good partner in a relationship? But I did not give up at her initial rejection. I know I have to be a more responsible guy if I were to win her heart. It is about time to be serious about my life, and so I changed for the better.  

A few months later, we got attached. And now we are on the path to our happily-ever-after. We are really happy together! Quarrels are still common. Tantrums are frequently thrown. Cold wars are always fought. But below all the dramas, both of us know that our hearts belong to each other. 

I daresay that the confession is the best decision in my life. 

We will see each other in 3 months time. And I miss her already. I hope she enjoys her business trip and stays safe. 

On serious note: I really hope she does not accidentally dropped a wink at some other random ang moh guy. That wink, is dangerous. 

;)

 It would help to understand the person better, and place him/her in less stressful environments. The outbursts (or at least, in my case) happen impulsively, when we are stressed and cannot think properly (something like a short-circuit). 

So, it would really help if you're a person we actually open up to and accept, and we are in an environment where we can feel cam, and more in control.

Saying this, it adversely impacts us a lot (or anyone for that matter) if someone tries to change our behaviour. However, the person in question must also have hope, and make an effort as well.

* The keyword here is UNDERSTAND. Conventional methods will not work, because you're doing it from your point of view, from your perspective. It will not help, rather, it will raise our guard against you even more, because we're insecure enough, and yet you're still approaching us with methods that we find a bit difficult to trust - because typically, we are left alone for very good reasons that we cannot fault you for, but we can feel bitter about. 

That, and what  said.

Just gonna come out and say this first: I'm not pushing for any ideas or whatnot, just here to say something to whoever wants to read it, after seeing all the posts on NS. 

Additional spoiler alert - Do not read this if you are:
1. Someone who liked NS or feels the need to tell everyone how much they loved it/ why this country needs it.
2. Someone who feel NS  or the govt has wronged them in some way.

To the above: Don't read this, my views are my own and there is no need for you to take time out of your life to read, comment and construct an intellectually-sounding, fact-quoting wall of words to justify your stand to me. I am but a random confessor. Honestly. Don't read and don't comment. I'm not going to read the reactions to this post anyway. I just wanted to say something that I have kept within my heart for some time. And don't hijack this post to tell everyone how patriotic/honorable you are or how whatever I am doing is bad/ pressing for anti-/pro- govt propaganda. Probably no one cares much for what you, or I, have to say within minutes of reading.  

So I bid you, scroll past this, all ye who art honorable, all ye who within doth dwell bitterness. These words are for my catharsis and mine alone. There is no place for you here. Reading this will just get you worked up for naught, they are not worth your time. Your energies are better focused elsewhere. 

And so, on to what I would like to say:

Truth: 2 years is 2 years. I will never get it back again. I did/do my best to make the most of it, but I will never get it back again. Were there things I wish I had done better? No. I like to think i did my best in those 2 years. There were good and bad times, but nonetheless, it was time i can never get back again. 

So, to those who felt it was not wasted and still stubbornly read on, good on you. Move along. Same to those who will spout anti-NS rhetoric. You and I, we will not meet, either in a clash of words or in a verbal battle. I have said my part and I will move on from hence forth. Wasted/not wasted, they are both subjective. I won't judge you for whatever reason you felt that it was either. You have the right to feel the way you feel. Just as I do not have the right to tell you if you are right or wrong, you have no right to do so here. Just as my thoughts are my own, your thoughts are your own. 

To those like me, who simply felt that part of their lives were wasted, I can empathize. Don't let it eat you up. Just keep it inside as a reminder/motivation for whatever you are working towards. And know that you are not alone. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise and don't let anyone fan the bitterness into something that will continue to burn us inside till the day we die. 

Hold this like a silent whisper of affirmation, close to your heart. And rest easy, knowing you are not alone. 

That is all. Thank you for listening to the words I have been wanting to say for a long time.

has been 4 months since you rejected me but I still find myself thinking about you. I told you I would distance myself but I really can't wait to hang out with you again. The more I want to be with friends with you again the harder it is to forget about you. I am scare I would fall in love with you again. 

why is this happening. 
-
 
what does it mean if a guy keeps to his texts but not words that he says?? :(

To , since you feel secure about your boyfriend, perhaps you shouldn't think so much and should think of how better you can treasure your relationship instead of thinking of hypothetical situations.

Does anyone have the mental fear that something might happen to your parent whom is a smoker. And they smoke so frequently and cough their lungs out? It totally makes me stressed out all the time..every single time.

 to each his own. Personally I would prefer a boy/girl to mature together with me. It is fine if both of us do not know how to handle some issues but the thing is that we work things out together. There will be a problem in the future if theres a big difference in maturity. Right now, you are still very focus on what he can provide to you but can you do the same to him?
-
 
Dear , it's fine and all to say NS is subjective. But how do I deal with those crazy bunch of people, whom I have no idea how I even became their friends on facebook, that is ready to shout anyone who thinks NS is a waste of time into submission?

I don't even dare putting forth my view openly against their comments on facebook, because they are so eager to tear apart anyone who doesn't think their way

It's sad that I always get A+ for modules but F for relationships. On my way to get the Highest Disntiction and various PhD scholarships soon. Sometimes friends compare me to superheroes like Batman and Spider-Man. They're single. I just feel jealous of those who may not do well academically but gets happily attached. Thanks for reading! I just want to write something to make myself feel better somehow. All the best for midterms

CACTUS is over, we will never dance together again. 
My memories with you are like dreams. I don't things to end, but once the music stops, I know things will never be the same.
You like your other partner better, I can tell. 
Every time I see you with her, my heart breaks. 
Every time you dance with her, I start thinking:  Do your hands linger on her longer? Do you smile more to her? Do you dance with more gusto? ARE YOU HAPPIER WITH HER? 
It's time to kill my heart, before things get worse and I end up really falling hard.

I recently found out that a friend of mine cheated on her boyfriend. Is it overreacting if I absolutely don't want anything to do with her now? I mean, I'm supposedly not involved in or affected by her relationship but I think it's super messed up for anyone to cheat?? My opinion of her has completely changed. I can't even look at her now. She seems repentant, but still?? :/
-
 
to that guy who never gave me a straight answer:

tell me the truth
don't make me wait too long
you have to prove
that i shouldn't move on

because seriously, it sucks to be waiting on the other line. and i'm pretty sure you're familiar with the feeling too.

this is to  the thing about people with BPD is that when they do have their outbursts, it's really all about them. i don't suppose they can help it to stop and think before they react, so very often it's the people around them who suffer just as much emotional damage as them. that being said, people who have BPD are definitely not trying to inflict pain or casually unload their own problems onto just anyone. i would think that if you have to see them at their worsts, they probably trust you a plenty lot. i get that it is incredibly hard to be on the receiving end, especially when you don't know what's going on half the time. but if you really do want to help people with BPD (or if you think they do), you've got to ask yourself first "why". why is it that you want to help them? i think that's where you're going to find perseverance for sticking it through with them. but if you think you might end up leaving them because you can't take it some day down the road, please leave them gently or let them know that you're there for them as long as they reach out to you. i mean, a few google searches and you'll get to see things like BPD, along with the Narcissistic personality disorder, is one of the hardest and thankless traits you'd have to live with for someone else (close to you) possessing them. but to make the relationship work in the end, it still takes effort from both sides. toughen yourself up for this person, and let them know you ain't going anywhere but if they don't want you to leave as well, they have to work for you to stay as well. i'm almost certain after their outbursts, they know more than anyone else they're in the wrong too. more than anything, they just want to know that they'll have support as they proceed to change themselves for the better and overcome the inhibitions BPD imposes upon them.

You don't know how much you love something until you lose it or in my case, know that I will lose it in the future. It actually feels worse when you know when you will lose it. From now onward, it's a slow painful wait till that faithful day. 
Goodbye, I'll miss you dearly.

Dear Tinder girls. With one picture of your face and a blank profile why would I swipe right? Give me something to go on please!

I look like your typical girl next door. Guys are attracted to me but i have never been in a proper relationship. When i am attracted to a guy, i masturbate to thoughts of him. is there anything i can do to curb this? Or is it natural? friends with benefits are against my conscience.. don't ask me why those guys and I never got together. i wish I knew the answer too.

Hi 

Yes it's normal. Women have sexual desires too. When I was single, I settled my needs by having a lot of casual sex. Now I am in a relationship and having regular sex but I sometimes crave sex with other people, either for variety or just because it's not enough.
-
 
to OP , I am in the position of person B you've described. i can give you my perspective and hope it makes you feel less conflicted.
1) there is a reason why A and B remained separated even if A still loves B. in my case as a B, it was a mismatched of personalities and expectations. We both wanted different things in our lives, and it was best remain separated.
2) depending on the personality of B, it is not a bad idea to reach out to her. in my case as a B, i would rather not talk about it as the breakup went through a series of very, very bad arguments, and it even affected my personal life. As a person who would prefer to hide my pasts, I'd rather not share it with friends, so questions like these by strangers would not be appreciated too. if the B is someone otherwise, you can approach her, but bear in mind of the scars she already had from the bad arguments, and that no matter how long time has passed, she still remained hurt.

How can possibly hate you or find you irritating? Yes i do get irritated but it would have applied to anyone as well so its not you. The real reason was that your words made me realise what a letdown i have been to you. 
I had to go.

After my first boyfriend of many years, i have been in the dating scene for a couple of years. In these few years, i was not able to find anybody better than my ex. I thought i made the wrong choice parting ways with my ex and i have lost faith in most man. It's only when i start dating this new guy i realise the reason i have not been able to get into a proper relationship is because i have been dating boys rather than man. Dating a man feels different. He makes me feel caim when i am faced with tough situation. He find solutions and get things fix rather than worrying with me. He gives good advice on life. Conversations are more meaningful, often about ideas rather than just gossips or school. And so much more... the point is, i believe there are many guys with good qualities. But i guess maturity (nothing to do with age) really does matter. At least to me. X

To , as someone who's partner is also into relatively weird kinky fetishes, just be forewarned that the problem may get worse. My bf used to start complimenting me on my butt, which honestly felt good. But over time he slowly escalated and "hinted" for us to do more things, like pressuring me to fart in his face or watching me poo. For your case, he may even progress to nude peeing in public or something? Indulging him is good, but know where to draw the line.

After being in a few relationships, I've come to the conclusion that people often break up over compatibility issues. But the truth is, compatibility is overhyped. Why do I say so? I think the real underlying reason is respect. There can be a couple as different as day and night or introvert/extrovert,  but as long as they respect their differences for eg the extrovert respecting the introvert's wish of not wanting to go for a party. And being able to communicate that understanding well. We can have couples that are "not compatible" thriving. It's a pity that I only realised this after a few failed relationship. Looking back, although there might be varying levels of "compatibility" if one would just have respect for their partners, there wouldn't be breakup everywhere. Anybody here agrees??

I'm a girl and single for some time now. I have a problem and wishes for some advice. I'm not sure if it is normal to keep thinking about guys wanting to have sex with me. I would always think of several scenarios about any guys I would see... And I enjoy the expressions guys would give if I touch their private parts...

What could one do if the person they are interested in is probably not interested in getting into a relationship?

I'm feeling miserable having just gotten out of a relationship. I feel like going to UHC for counselling just to talk it out a little. Problem is will there be a record and affect my chances for NOC/exchange? Would counselling help a little? I understand that for break ups, counselling does not really work. But I just need to talk about it to get through it. And yes I do have friends to talk about it but I thought maybe seeking some professional help could help a little.

Need some opinions or advice from other girls here..

I've been together with my boyfriend for 1 year now and it's been pretty good. I would say our honeymoon period ended long ago, or maybe didn't really start at all? There wasn't overwhelming sense of elation or whatsoever, but just a sort of peaceful, extremely comfortable feeling whenever I'm with him. Of course we have our fair share of arguments over things, but those don't last very long as we usually manage to sort it out/compromise within a short period of time.

Here's my issue, it's not really a problem as we don't argue about it and I can generally accept it. He has a tonne of female friends - close female friends that he has known ranging from 2 to 15 years or so. As he is a rather sensitive person, I feel that it's fine that he has that many female friends, whom he keeps in regular contact with and they do meet up regularly, but he also makes sure that we meet up at least twice a week.

I mentioned that it's an issue and not a problem, because I'm not quite sure how I SHOULD be feeling about it? My female clique are generally uncomfortable that my boyfriend has so many female friends, which he keeps in regular contact with. I feel, perhaps 90% okay with it? As an average-looking girl, I do have my insecurities too, and some of the female friends are quite good-looking. He's done enough to assure me and I trust him not to stray away. But is it normal for me to feel this way? I've heard of some friends being the jealous or possessive type and it seems like that's the associated norm for girls? So... Am I out of my mind?

Also, hypothetically, if a girl likes my boyfriend and everybody knows she does, is it fine for her to ask him out, and for him to go along? Hasn't happened yet, but given my looks and his looks, I think it definitely may arise in the future..

With all these NS talk, I am wondering how many guys lost their virginity during NS? Especially with reference to . I heard from my guy friends that they are always given out condoms for overseas exercise and they can take any number they want, even if they dont take, they will be passed 2 of it. Then, a bunch of guys will gather to find those dirty "massage parlour" together. Is it true that many guys go for them? Or probably more of regulars?
-
 
I like you, but probably not enough to want to pursue you. Yet, I'm really curious what you've been up to and how you've been, and so I text you every now and then. Am I leading the person on? Am I considered a jerk?

@16748 
Well...you'll never be "friends" again if that's what you're asking. But here's my story, I've known this girl for a good 8 years, I've been together for 4 years and I was best friends with her for the other 4.
One thing is, if you were friends before, it's not that hard to stay "friends" after an amicable breakup. But the both of you would still have feelings for each other. Maybe it's buried so far down that neither of you realise it but let me just tell you that it's there.
For me, we know each other inside out and are almost idiosyncratic at times so it's easy to connect and start resorting to the old couple habits. "bae" and " I love you" would slip during calls and I'd start missing her when we stop talking for a while. 
So...friends? Possible. But both of you need to awknowlege that feelings are still there and not freak out when old habits back

Does anyone have experiences living with someone who is diagnosed (I think) with borderline personality disorder, and/or thoughts about how to cope when the outbursts occur? I'm so afraid sometimes...afraid for the people around me; afraid that things will get worse after each time, ashamed that I don't know how (or am unable) to make the situation better...I really don't know

I'm not looking for advice like 'get them psychiatric help' and all.. as far as I know we have tried it but I'm not in a good position to know about the progress...and I don't want to identify myself by PM-ing anyone? just in case there are any offers:'(

If you feel uncomfortable commenting could you perhaps post another Whisper in response?

Thank you so much

To  if that is what you have taken away from NS I feel really sorry for you. Was my time during NS smooth-sailing? No. I was given extras, getting scolded by superior for my poor performance and not given the due respect I deserved as a sergeant. I cried at times in the toilet because I just feel that I am not up to the job and felt that my friends looked down and pass saikang to me because I was incapable and was a very soft person.  

However, I knew I was punished for the right reasons and that my superior had my welfare at heart. He often told me "xx you are too soft. When you go out next time do not let other people step over you". After 4 years out of the army I still remember what he said and I was glad he was strict on me and taught me all the important lessons. Was it enjoyable at that time? Absolutely not. But was the insecurities/pain worth it? Yes. 

I would think I am a much more confident person now and is not afraid of saying no. I think you just need to have the right attitude brother.

My girlfriend caught me screenshotting pictures of girls in bikini @ instagram to send to my friend. Now she's angry at me? Surely she should have expected this, since 70% of who i'm following @ insta are hot girls. I'm not even cheating on her, how can i convince her to not be so sensitive?
-
 
I just wanna rant because i have no other outlet to do so. I am too proud to confide in my friends and i hate that look of pity. It is really hard to find someone to relate to and i just feel like i am going to burst with all that is going on. I have been instilled with this mentality that emotions are nothing but a mere display of weakness. I have been trying to be void of that weakness but it has only made me constantly feeling anger. Wth am i supposed to do..

Do ladies find this familiar when you are talking with your female friends?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gcp : let's go out tonight 

Lady B : I can't, I need to study for exam and my bf waiting me at bus stop to go home together 

Gcp : why you work so hard? Day time study full time, night time go study? 

Lady B : I and my bf promise to work hard for our future 

Gcp: huh? Such useless Boyfriend you have! You are so pretty, go get a rich bf lah, no need to worry your future anymore

Lady B: hmm, you are right? Why do I need to study and work so hard? I can just go find a rich bf to marry and I won't need to work anymore. Still study for what? Stay at home be taitai better

Gcp: my bf coming, I ask him fetch you home

-----------------------------------------------

Lady A, "See! My bf gave me a diamond necklace for my birthday! His business is doing great! He is so full of drive!"

Lady B, "U good life lor! My bf only treat me to a meal at the hawker centre. He always nua at home....."

Lady A, "Wah......why he sho 沒出息"

Lady B, "Sob Sob....."

I know of a couple who broke up after having a big argument. It may not be my place to meddle in their affairs, especially since I don't have the details, but I know for certain that A is incredibly heartbroken and regretful about the breakup and has wished ever since, probably more than anything in the world, to have B in her life again. I cannot ask her about it nor comfort her because A seems to not want to speak to me about it, and neither do the other people who know about the breakup. 

Is there anything you think I can do to make things better? I really would like to see A and B together again because I think they were happy then...but I don't really know exactly what went on between them so I can't say whether that would be best for them. If I'm not wrong, their problems may surface again even if they makeup. All things considered, would it be ill-advised for me to try and contact B (who I don't really know at all and have limited means of contacting, to be honest) to find out what happened/whether there is any chance of them getting back together? 
-
 
Girls how will you react if a short guy confesses? will you give him a chance and treat him equally?

Before I enlisted into NS, I thought I will lose my virginity for all sorts of reasons. so happy I am still a virgin even till now.

Hi guys, i am a girl in a relation for 4+yrs.. im in a bit of dilemma recently about my relationship :( 

I know ppl around me have been telling me that i deserve a better bf (because of family background and stuff) but i had never thought much until my new project group guys started calling me pretty.. it made me feel like i have been underrated by my bf (he doesnt really shower me with such things) and i guess i got a little greedy.. 

There is a guy from the group who said he would be interested in me if i werent attached and well.. i hate to admit but i think we have been hitting it off well.. And i have no idea why i actually confessed to my bf about talking to him cause i felt like i was flirting..? So he forgave me and now we are still together.

But the thing is.. i really dont know if i can just forget about that guy and everytime i meet my bf i feel guilty about what i have done. What should I do, pease advice! :(

I have this tickling fetish.
I have the urge to tickle girls, or at least imagine tickling them.  I enjoy seeing them laugh and squirm, and sometimes beg or cry.
it is like a guilty pleasure and sexual indulgence for me.
That's why my ex left me. Can't blame her. I tickled her til she peed in public once and she got real pissed.

Guys out there, Is it normal?
Girls out there, anyone that likes getting tickled?
(any girls wanna meet me? ;))

-
 
Why does a guy stare at you and not turn away when you've 'caught' him? Is it supposed to mean something other than it being kinda awkward? I always end up looking away first. It's happened a few times with the same guy... There's no expression on his face either. 
-
 
Many of my friends have started having a relationship since around sec3-4. Around JC, it was common to see couples around every corner and people start going for dates. As someone who has only just started to have these tingling feelings right now, I must say, I'm fairly late into the game now, aren't I? The sad part about being late is that most people are either already in a relationship or don't want a relationship and it's really hard to find someone to be in a relationship in these conditions. Yup, she's taken... Time to find someone else..
-
 
OP of  here... Thanks for all the comments.. I just want to be clear here that as I have said, although I am not into this fetish, I would not mind doing it at home as we do get a chance to be intimate after that. So basically, what he did was totally a mood killer. I have spoken to him and he thought that I had the fetish as well saying, "why did you do it at home then". I did not know what to say and just hung up. I have sent him a message and gave a time out. Should I really continue? I can't let him go. But what if he does this again? Certain things are meant to be done in private and kept there. 
-
 
happen to overhear a small quarrel between my older brother and his girlfriend of 7+ years. long story short I guess it's something about her being jealous about him always putting me first instead of her.. idk but I feel bad for being the reason for their quarrel(s)..

she's a really nice person, patient and considerate actually, but gets jealous easily cos she really loves my brother alot  
-
 
Hi guys! Just wanted to ask... Like is it possible to have an amicable breakup? Read somewhere that friends after being lovers isn't really possible...? I mean considering that there wasn't 3rd parties involved and stuff, and none of those screwed up things like abuse or addiction etc.
-
 
I would describe myself as someone who is rather horny. I am currently on SEP and I hit off really well with this friend of opposite gender. Both of us have a relationship of our own but we are thinking if we should be friends with benefits. We have done it with our other halves before and plan to have a future with them. But we have our sexual desires that we need to satisfy and don't you think we should try and experience a few other different styles on bed (at least just one more). We will do it safely with protection and nobody will know about it once I head back after exchange. I might also want to explore ideas like threesome or sex parties maybe? I mean it is the last time I can experience these with someone else before I settle down and I will make sure it is safe and no one knows about it. Should I give it a try? After all we know we all have this secret desire in us, waiting to be released. 
-
 
I have a confession here. 

My girlfriend and I like to go for buffet. 

However she always take way too many food for her stomach. When she couldn't finish, she will ask me to eat in a passive-aggressive manner.

I get stressed whenever she does that. And due to the forced eating, I have developed gastric problems. I feel terrible.

How should I let her know that she has to take food from buffet line responsibly? I love her very much and do not want our relationship to sour. But I cannot remain in this "abusive" relationship.

Any advice?

Before you deride this as someone being stuck up...

How far are friendships like business? You make friends with people whom you think will help you. Either emotionally (when you're down), physically (to safeguard), or for connections (jobs, raising money).

Sometimes you want to make friends with someone not so much for him/her, but his/her friends. This is using someone as a connection hub. At some point in time you hope to decouple this hub person and directly be friends with the real targets of interest in his/her group if you can sustain it.

Sometimes you also make friends with someone who is not that promising because he or she could be great in the future. You help him/her be great in return for help.

But sometimes, we also cut loss-making friendships. Friends who cannot serve any interest because they are really of no value get cut. For instance, if a "friend" is so down and out and cannot help himself or herself, what is the point in helping him/her if he or she cannot even be self-secure?

Sometimes you can even just hold onto a friendship not because he or she is likeable, but you would rather have a semi-cordial relationship and figure out what his/her intentions are before he/she turns against you.

Eventually I hope to have a hub of very high-yield friends. :)

It was painful for me to have said those things while watching you cry your heart out. But i had to do what i must do and with that it means that i have to appear heartless. I do not want to leave, but i think you will be happier without me in the future. I cannot give you the future that you envisioned because i was not created the way you wanted. Change doesn't come easy when you continue to experience the same bullshit that you had been undergoing. For those who say that social status doesn't matter in relationships probably hasn't really faced that dilemma in your life before. In a conservative society like ours, marriage is not simply a choice between two like-minded people, but involves everyone within each's social circle. And probably that difference in social status could result in different perceptions of what a relationship should be about.

to  lol i also masturbate on my bed when I feel that my sister is asleep. But I will make little to no sound so I don't think she ever notice. I think you better change room. Sometimes when I finish my job and with the residue on my hand, I will wipe it on my sister's bed (when she's not around) because I don't want to dirty my own bed. I don't know if your brother does the same thing...yea i feel a little bad...

OMG, I WANNA TRAVEL. I WANNA FLY!

I miss my ex... the only pity in my exchange to London was that I lost a girlfriend. Then again, if only she could wait for me, I would have brought her on SQ's first-class.

You were the first guy I've ever properly liked. 

But do you know how much emotional pain you brought me? When I found out you actually text many girls, the same way you texted me, I cried that night. I thought I was special. But you reassured me that they are friends. I was insecure but I respect your freedom.

But now I'm feeling absolutely shi*** because you are too busy for me and all(I know i didn't make much effort as well) and..you are just not the same person anymore. It pains me so much to think about you and us.
-
 
to  its normal for guys to have fetish. I think he still love you very much. For example, I will slap my gf in front of her friends and we all know its just for fun. But does that mean I do not love her? No, I love her very much. Your boyfriend is normal.

When the wedding query appeared, I scrambled to check the date, hoping I would be busy on the day in order to stanch the bleeding of my anaemic wallet. I feel so ashamed, like what am I? Is my friendship not worth a $100+, if it can even be measured in monetary terms?

As fate would have it, I have indeed already planned to help out at another event on that same day, but due to procrastination I've not told the organiser yet. Hence, it may seem like it's the new information that's pushing me to commit to this event instead. I would like to think that it's not, and that without this invitation, I would have helped out at this event anyway. But who's to know what the future holds. We can only do things in good faith, one moment at a time. Ah, the mind tricks of a non-jedi. Always doubting and second-guessing.

Checking the date again, I felt a tinge of disappointment. A little slighted, even - it's just a little over two weeks from now. The deal is sealed. I know exactly what to do. I still feel ashamed at my initial miserly thoughts, but I'm more sad that I'm even called at all, if it was to be this late.

Perhaps I will always remain an acquaintance to my friends. Nonetheless here's a wish to all that may you be a friend to your friend.
-
 
Can I ask, if you met someone new and their friend mentions in passing about their eyecandy, would you give up pursuing them? Feel like I've been screwed over by my friends who always bring up my eye candies when I meet someone of the opposite gender and they so happen to be there

I know it's weird for me to be here on this platform, but I've always heard about how boys from a certain school in Dover Road are charming, kind and gentlemanly etc.
As a girl from a certain school in Yio Chu Kang who has been together/complicated with a few boys from that school, I won't deny that they have those traits. But they're also very manipulative and gossipy, and can be real f-boys. My ex was a really sweet guy, but after we broke up, he spread rumours about me being with another guy from my school. What a jerk.

I have a girlfriend, but sometimes when I look at other girls, I just wonder what it's like dating someone else. Is that like a guy thing?

To poster of ,
I also have gone through a period of time where I was excessively worried abput my future and depressed over the apparent meaninglessness of life. I believe it is a form of existential crisis / anxiety.

What is important is for you to realise that feeling lost is the start of understanding yourself and what you value in life. There is no need for you to worry. You are still young and there is no urgency for you to make any big change to your life. There are people who experience something similar in their fourties in what is known as a midlife crisis. So, instead of being worried, you should be happy that you are reflecting on your life at this age.

You say you used to live a life with meaning but now you have nothing to live for. Try to remember the things you enjoyed doing and you will realise that these are the things that make your life meaningful. You are right that there is no ideal path or purpose that applies to everyone. Instead of being afraid and worried, take it as an oppurtunity for you to explore and try new things. There is no such thing as taking a wrong path and living your life in regret. You can also talk to your friends as they might understand you in ways that you don't know yourself.

Also, don't let one relationship make you give up on everything. Not everyone is superficial as you believe. Even if you insist that romantic love is superficial, there are still a million other things that can make life meaningful.

As for your question about romantic love, it is true that romantic love is a form of attachment in the sense that one desires reciprocation and fear the loss of the other person. But it can also be a form of altruism and compassion when you care for someone. In Buddhism (though I might be wrong), I think the view is that attachment is a double edge sword in that it leads both to happiness and suffering. That said, I don't believe that we must lead an ascetic life and free ourselves from all attachment. In fact, the Buddhist view of romantic love is different depending on the school of thought you subscribe to with some accepting it as a natural part of life. While I am not a Christian, I see no conflict between the buddhist view of attachment and the view that love is a gift from god. It may be the case that both are focusing on different aspects of  romantic love, buddhism on attachment and desire, while Christians on the compassion and altruism that love entails. I think what is important is not to judge prematurely based on limited observations and to always experience things with an open heart. Many things can only be learnt through personal experience.

That's all. Don't worry too much and take things slowly. All the best!

A few semesters ago, in one of the modules that I took, I had the worst groupmates and that was probably the most traumatic semester I've ever had. But the TA was such an awesome guy that I had a little crush on him. After that semester, I never see him in school anymore, so I guess he graduated already.

However, recently, I saw him in school. And I was happy to be able to see him again even after all this time.. but somehow, the trauma of that group project was more overwhelming. So even though seeing him made me happy for those few seconds, I was depressed for the rest of the day. I thought I was over it because I no longer see those groupmates anymore and never done another project with them at all. But I guess the pain of getting backstabbed and betrayed will never go away..

My boyfriend has this weird fetish. He keeps asking his dog to lick my boobs. Anybody has this problem?

Guys can have fetish so do girls! We have a friend who kicks and punches her boyfriend in the nuts in front of his friends. She loves him as much as he does.

Just wanted to post here so that maybe I can sort out my feelings. :\

I'm not really sure about my feelings for this girl. She isn't the first thing on my mind when I wake up, not the last person on my mind when I go to sleep, and I don't particularly think of her throughout the day. However, I become really happy when I see her smile, and I really want to be the one who makes her smile.

It doesn't help that even though we've known each other for a year plus, we hardly have opportunities for interaction and to talk to each other because we're from different majors. So, even though I think I like her, there is a nagging feeling that I don't know her well enough. I'd want to say it's infatuation, but again, I don't think of her constantly, so I'm quite unsure what I am feeling.

I thought that maybe what I have been feeling is a sense of gratefulness; that she has helped made my life a lot happier ever since I've met her. I really want her to stay in my life, and I want to stay in her life and make her happy as well. 

All in all, I'm just scared that I'm in love with the idea of being in love with her, rather than being genuinely interested in her. Or maybe it's just a strong sense of gratefulness for all the friendship she has provided.

Has anyone ever felt this way before? :(
-
 
If you feel like you need to do something for your crush then go for it! Don't bother asking anyone for advice because everyone is different and their advice isn't likely to work for you.

If your friend tells you shit like he/she isn't into you/want to reject you, please don't believe it, it will make you lose confidence and not strive for something that is potentially there. Because your friend isn't him/her and only him/her will know the answer.

If your friend tells you to give up/move on/there are many fishes out there, don't believe it either! You are the one who knows who you want. You know the person you want is irreplaceable. 

Ultimately you want your crush to fall for you because of who you are and what you do. You wouldn't want him/her to fall for a stupid puppet acting on people's order.

One of the guy in my group keep sending me messages with smiley faces. Is he just being friendly or am I thinking too much? I am a straight guy by the way.

I'm 22 this year and I am really worried about my future. I keep questioning the way I live my life like everyday and it gets exhausting.

I used to subscribe to religious beliefs (Christianity, Buddhism, etc) so it feels like I am actually living a life with meaning.

The fact is that I am afraid of feeling empty in life, feeling like there's nothing to live for.
 
I've never been in a relationship, I've dated before and the last time I dated I ended up falling for this guy who wasn't interested eventually. i've been disillusioned about romantic love between opposite sexes ever since. All (most) guys are superficial and only go for girls who're good looking - how can that be love? maybe it's just me. I don't know.

Then again, I ask myself if I wanna lead a typical SG life - graduate, get a job, fall in love, get married have kids, fall out of love, save up for kids, retire, die.

It's so depressing thinking about the possible routes that my life can go.

I guess life's just like that, there's no ideal path and I guess i'll just learn to be content with everything in my life right now. 

Life is really scary but I guess it'll be a wonderful journey after all.

I don't know. anyway, I would like to ask what do you think of romantic love? do you think it's just a societal concept or do you think it really exists? is it true that in Buddhism, romantic love is merely a form of attachment? Do Christians believe that romantic love exists and it is a gift from god? it's so scary how there's such a huge difference in perspectives.

But it's okay. I guess there cannot be a definite answer to some things and that's just life.

Okay rant is over time for sleep.

 Not to be narcissistic, but I always believed that for a relationship to be sustainable, both of them need to be equal on all grounds. If you feel he doesn't understand half the things you are talking about, and you feel half the things he says is nonsense, I would see it as something that can go on forever. For example, 5 years later when you have a work problem or are stressed and want to vent about it, and he just doesn't get it. This isn't the only problem, but you get the idea I suppose. I am not saying such relationships can never work - then can. But it sounds like you are already confused. Feels like you love him for what he could be if he changed, and that is an idealist view to have. Just my two cents from my personal experience.

I'm extremely annoyed with this friend of mine. We take all the same modules, so we go for lectures and tutorials together. I see him every single day, especially since we live in the same hall, and he texts me all the time. Sometimes he asks for help with academic work as well.

In front of his friends, he behaves as if he doesn't even know me and avoids speaking to me. A few of our mutual friends have tried introducing us before, thinking that we're strangers. A few weeks ago, we were going to lectures when he saw another female friend of his and ran towards her though we were in conversation mid-way. He then proceeded to ignore me completely. When I bump into my friends, I always introduce him to them. But he always tries to engage in conversation with them and push me out. When other people leave, it's like he suddenly realises I exist and speaks to me again.

What should I do? I'm frustrated with being friends with such a person. I feel like I'm just being used. I'm so obviously a last choice friend. But I don't know how I can avoid him while I'm in school.

Just wondering if there's anyone who might be interested in doing covers or jamming for fun? Mostly Chinese pop but open to English pop as well! Would really love to get to know people who love singing! Do leave a comment and I'll contact you!
P.S. Tried for Voices before but was pretty nervous and didn't get in :(

to  
alot of people may be slamming you but i really think you have valid insecurities and concerns! honestly, those who are slamming her, how many of you would feel secure entrusting your lifetime happiness with a man you deem to be unreliable? slamming her just makes OP feel like she should take any crap her bf throws at her. 
although no man is perfect and no man is completely bad, he definitely will have his good points, eg he may not cheat, he may be sweet, etc. But i think ultimately OP must really decide for herself if she will be happy entrusting and spending the rest of her life with him. different people have different needs in a relationship. some power-hungry guys like a more submissive female partner. some successful and powerful women (in their career) long for a simple man who will see beyond her hard facade, just to list a few examples. so why slam OP if all she is looking for is a driven man who plans for the future? it's her choice! 
love is blind is a myth, blind love doesn't last long. love is a logical choice to love that person each and every day, even when you don't feel like it

As someone with autism, I lack the theory of mind. So I find it difficult to understand the body language of girls. When she made eye to eye contact with you for 4 times over a period of 2 hours, does it mean that she is interested in you and is waiting for you to leave your contact with her? I left because I don't understand what is going on.

After reading countless of nus whispers, posts of regrets, girls , boys , sexual history , dilemmas and whats not , i decided to share my advice on basic relationship issues.This benefit both gender so please read with an open mind. if you disagree, i openly accept any criticism in the comments. i am doing this to educate YOU so that you can protect yourself from playboys or playgirls. 

Rule of thumb in BGR. A VERY SHORT GUIDE
* ALWAYS TRUST YOUR GUT FEELING - COMMON RULE

Girls- this would benefit you more , your body is precious.. please dont let any guys take advantage of you, always think it through
1. First dates, please do not agree to go drinking or clubbing! obviously if you are looking for a boyfriend/husband material.. even if the guy is extremely good looking, it sounds too good to be true no? obvious trap is obvious? even if it worked out, do you foresee yourself getting heartbreaks from his night activities? 
2. Never date a bad boy hope to change him into a good boy .. unless of course he is WILLING to do it for you by himself. lets face the truth , nothing goes well when its forceful. what do you get in the long run?
3. If he never ask you to be his Girlfriend, you are not! DONT ASSUME! Ask and clear the cloud before it escalates further *ahem sexual activities* just because you kiss and hold hands does't mean your TOGETHER. He might even have the idea that you are willingly agreeing to satisfied his sexual needs if you do not clear the situation. boohoo at the end of the road, who's to lose? NOT HIM!!!!
4. He asks you to go to his house already within the first few dates . come on , 21st century, you expect this to be a clean night with u sleeping on the bed and him on the floor? if he asks you to go back to his place , HIGH CHANCES he just want your body. Again , who is at the losing end? make a guess :)
Unspoken Playboy Moves - Fuck,Throw,Repeat . Come on girls, youre not that DUMB!
5. Engaging in unprotected sexual activities. This is a no brainer. Here's the ugly truth , there are MANY boys/men in your school who visited red light districts *prostitutes* and mind you , some of them may look like the average nerd or the ridiculously good looking guy beside your table. this is awfully true as i have heard and personally knew people who had sexual history with prostitutes and yet their girlfriends have no knowledge of it at all! Poor girls!
it could be anyone, does't matter if its students in NUS or NTU or even SIM. so please play safe and use a CONDOM if you really really really really want to do it. Most of them commonly break their "virgin experience" during their national service period . so unless you want some of the disease in your body.. please talk about it with your partner first about the sexual history if necessary. Communication is the key to a healthy relationship ! 
6. He broke up with you and you feel like you have to distress and get rid of sadness.. you go clubbing and drinking sessions hoping to make yourself feel better.. feel cheap. NO! how are you going to explain to your future boyfriend/husbands your actions? if he broke up with you , its his loss for losing a great girlfriend! whats your loss? NOTHING! you stand to gain because you got yourself another chance at finding that great guy u always wanted! you should be celebrating with a good dinner with your girlfriends instead of going to the MEAT MARKET. (CLUBBING AKA MEAT MARKET). its more fresh than your local grocery stores where guys would go there to grope girls who dress sexy for free. Yummy :) FREE AND EASY, WHERE TO GET THIS KIND OF GOOD DEAL?
And if you hoping to get his attention by going heavy clubbing (your exbf) , you watched too much korean dramas. Hes enjoying his time with his new girl and care nothing about you. who is to lose? :)
2 type of girls - Smart (do things with thinking , self love) / Stupid ( do things without rational thinking , like to make herself look cheap.. which are you ?

Guys-  Dating and wooing
1. Know when to give up - If the girl you like does't like you and no matter how hard you try to impress her and she isnt.. give up and go to the next.
2. Girls love having people giving her attention (makes her feel wanted ) - dont get this in a wrong way. if subconsciously, you knew she already rejected you countless time,aka no to your invitation and always busy , but still maintaining daily contact through texts..asking you to entertain her. Dude your not getting anywhere, the only place your going is into the TEXT BUDDY ZONE and guess who becomes her lover in the end ? not you ! unless you got will of steel to keep this up for a few more years
3. Get some balls and make the first move. Please , you will not exist here reading my post if your father is like you sitting around and expect a girl to drop out of the sky into his arms. Be like your old man and get some confidence! what you will get if you get rejected? a temporary pain.
what will you get if you dont try? a lifetime of regret !
go think about it , pfff
4. Dont be desperate, girls can sense your desperation from miles away. so try but dont TRY HARD. dont act like jerk or smarty pants to impress her, you will probably turn her off.. 

thats all , if you have any questions ,ask in the comments

I'm a girl with very few guy friends. And by "very few" I mean none whom I maintain close contact with or have spoken to in the past week(s). Recently I met this guy in my project group -- he's not from my faculty and I have no romantic interest in him. Should I ask him to perhaps introduce me to his guy friends aka play the role of a matchmaker? He seems "bro" enough... and assuming the topic of bgr comes up then I'll just very naturally and casually slip in a playful "hey you got a lot guy friends right got any that might be my type or not?? Intro leh" 

I'm graduating soon and still evergreen -- I'm not too optimistic about dating  prospects in the workplace and honestly I'm afraid that I won't ever find love... 

I know the usual "love will find you when you least expect it", "don't worry your time will come", "singlehood is great too" etc. But in all seriousness I just really wish I could find a man I love, who would love me more than anything.

Thanks for reading

From the OP of ,

After the unexpected success of my post about Power Rangers, I decided to write another post with reference to Power Rangers.

TL:DR You may find a girlfriend while you didn't expect it.

Many students from engineering school doesn't see much hope of finding a girlfriend. This is because the girls to boys ratio are very low in engineering school. After graduation, it will be hard to find a girlfriend in workplace due to workplace politics.

Nothing to worry about.

Remember how Tommy(MMPR green ranger) started out as just a new student in school? In an unexpected twist of fate, he became the legendary green ranger and get to know the other rangers including Kimberly(MMPR pink ranger) who Tommy eventually got into a relationship with.

Another example is Andros(Red space ranger). Andros was a loner who worked alone. He didn't even intend for the other 4 rangers to join him initially. After time, he learnt how to trust other and he eventually fell in love with Ashley(Yellow Turbo and space ranger) and the feeling is mutual. Who would expect that a loner would find a girlfriend?

You may think that these are just fictional story so I am going to share a real life story of my own.

I once met a girl trying to learn how to cycle so I offered to teach her how to cycle. While we didn't have any feeling for each other, this story proves that you may just know a girl in some unexpected place.

Basically, don't worry about not being able to find a girlfriend. You never know what your future life will be like or who you will meet. You may just meet your other half somewhere unexpected.

It's so heartwrenching when your loved one keeps walking in and out of your life unexpectedly. When they're gone, you just long for them to return because having them by your side is something you've grown so accustomed to; yet when they've returned, you just feel completely numb and void of emotions because you never know when they'd leave again.

When the multitude of thoughts that you'd hoped to share just disappears, when you don't have anything to say anymore, when you don't know whether to continue to hold on or just give it up completely, although giving up would crush you almost completely.

Dog life is sucks.

I'm in year 2, and my boyfriend is currently still in army. Back in school he was the very popular kind and had many other girls who were interested in him, and I was the kind who's quite shy and didn't really like attracting attention to myself. Despite his popularity, he was very faithful and politely rejected girls who were trying to 'get him'. He also doesn't crave for sex/my body and shows physical affection to me only with my approval. He also respects me very much and constantly encourages me when I'm facing confidence issues. I think that makes him a really great boyfriend.

However, he always makes me pay for things like his meals, our movie tickets and sometimes even groceries for his home, which really pisses me off. But when it comes to spending money for himself, he's never hesitant and splurges a lot. I'm quite frugal and I really cannot understand how he manages to spend all of his army allowance(1k+) every month and then expects me to pay for our dates knowing that I have quite some savings. Sometimes I get the feeling that he's using me to sustain his spending. Even during special occasions like my birthday/valentines/christmas, he doesn't put in any effort to prepare anything for me. And I'm saying this not because I expect expensive big gifts. All I hoped for was just something simple to show that he actually bothered to do up something for me. 

So that makes me very confused. Advice plz.

i asked my crush out on valentines day. she claims that she is busy so now we are meeting this friday. talk about priorities...

Im evergreen, recently met this guy and went out for drinks which ended up in clubbing with a few others. That was the 2nd time we met and we were already holding hands and he also brought me back to his place where we made out (i naively thought he really meant drinks). The next time we met,we were also holding hands and kissing. Im confused at our status as he has never mentioned if we are officially together and i dont feel so myself because the way we progress is too quick. Is it just im too outdated or traditional thinking that once we hold hands and kiss, it means we are a couple or are these actions normal? Also worried if he really is interested in me or just playing along

It has been a long time but I still haven't caught any couple in Tembusu making out in their room, viewing from Cinnamon...haiz it's so disappointing. Gay couples would be even better!
-
 
to , he is just playing out on you. a guy who truly love you wouldnt hold your hand and make out with you on the first- two meetup. my advice is just run away from him as far as possible. 
-
 
You fell sick. I took the effort to deliberately deliver your 'get well soon' pack to NUS. 
On the very same night, you told me you can see what I'm trying to do for you. But you're at the stage where you're exploring out boys and girls. You told me that i could leave if i wanted to.
I decided not to leave. Afterall, I didnt really confess to you right! So no matter what happens, I still believe we can be friends.

Until recently, you just stopped replying me. And i'm not sure whats going on. Or maybe you've found an answer for yourself...

-Just a very confused person

Pardon me if this is weird, but I'm feeling awful because one of my old teammates is following all other teammates on insta but me :( The fact that she doesn't like me is not my problem. The problem is I feel so unlikeable and I hate myself for being affected by such a petty thing
-
 
A man expressed his feeling to a girl. She rejected him. He was not sad. His friends asked him why he did not feel sad. Why? Why should man be sad? Man has lost someone who did not love him. But girl has lost someone who loved her.

There's this pretty (in my eyes) girl doing the same few modules with me. How do I approach & get to know her better?
It doesn't help that I'm a person of low self esteem. I'm in year 2 semester 2 & have been with the same male friends most of the time since year 1. I find a lack of topics to talk to girls about due to the 2 year age gap. What should I do?

"If you love someone, you'll accept them the way they are." How true is this statement?

I've got a boyfriend, and we've been seeing each other for almost a year. He's not a smart man, gangster background and always talks nonsense. In fact, he doesn't understand most of the things I tell him. He doesn't have a good qualification too.

Recently, I met a few nice men from school and I started to notice the differences between my boyfriend and the people I meet in school. My mother says it's because he doesn't study, that's why he is not refined. Although I don't agree that it has a lot to do with education, but I really think that he is uncouth and not presentable. He introduces himself as my boyfriend, and sometimes I feel really embarrassed about it. 

He speaks and walks like a gangster, always making sexual reference about me in front of both our friends, zero knowledge on what is going on around the world and doesn't have a plan for the "future" he always promises me.

I talked to him about it and he didn't seemed like he wanted to change. All he said was, "I'll remember to shave." I didn't say anything else, just told him that I will pluck his moustache and I wanted to sleep (we were texting because he's in camp). Is it wrong for me to want to make him look better? Is it wrong for me to want to change him? Is it wrong for me to conscious of all these things even after we were together for one year? 

Please don't judge me, I'm really seeking advice here. Thank you!

I've a dilemma here. I'm a long-time user of a popular sex site in S'pore. Recently I saw someone on the forum posting (non-nude) photos of my buddy's ex-girlfriend, and talking about how he wants to get into her pants etc. To be frank, I used to join in when commenting about how I wanna bang girls whose photos have been posted. But realizing that it's someone whom I know made me guilty.

 It seems the forum user knows her personally and have been thinking of ways to get her drunk etc. Although my friend and his gf broke up some time ago, I know my friend still likes and cares for her. However, my friend is that kind who will judge people for surfing sex sites and porn. How can I warn him yet not reveal that I saw his gf's photos on the sex site?
-
 
to , i.e. the guy/girl who said "a guy who truly love you wouldnt hold your hand and make out with you on the first- two meetup"... wtf don't cock block leh. hahaha. btw, must be fun living in a square box huh

in all seriousness though, this is not a complete measure of "love". some people just tend to be a bit more passionate than others ;)

I like my friends a lot, but they are extremely safe. Sometimes, I just want friends who are crazier, wilder and more adventurous, no holds barred.

I envy people with early relationship woes. Or someone who seems to just can't say how they feel.

Kids, that part, is easy. Quantity > Quality. If you ask enough, someone will say yes. The hard part is after that.

I proposed, she said yes. A year ago.

My parents still don't accept her. Why? She's not that pretty (maybe, but her figure is really great), she's a year older than myself (some stellar conservatives there), her family is a lower class than mine (and up my parents bum for this shit. We aren't even that rich. I'm a penniless poor immigrant in Singapore. Back home, we are somewhat upper middle class. My fiancée family is back from where I was originally). And the fact that I constantly nags them about the wedding. Or just because of this girl, I am so constantly clashing with my parents.

And you know what's the hardest part? I have to argue with my mom. A woman. Arguing with a woman is so maddening. They can drag stuff years ago into the conversation. And she just won't let up.

Now, I know what you might say, I'm gonna argue like that with my fiancée later in life,anyway. Better not marrying someone, right? Well, let me put it this way, a biggest fight between lovers can be resolved with a (few) big orgasm(s) and some post-coitus heart-to-heart pillow talks. You can't do that with your mom, right?

Most parents whose son bring a girl who thinks "Holy shit, a) he's not gay, b) what a load of our chest, c) let's quickly get a load into a girl's business hole and get us some grandchildren.'

I need a drink. Or two. Or ten.

I'm feeling so upset :( This is our first Valentine's Day, but it seems that all my boyfriend interested in is just sex. We're still virgins but he has been wanting it for quite some time now. Is it wrong of me to feel sad if he didn't get me anything? I feel so jealous of my other attached friends.
-
 
I know you don't like me. But we are in the same project group. So when I decide to be the bad guy and initiate a conversation to start on something, don't ignore. We are all in this together. Like it or not. 
-
 
He was the first person I ever liked and he turned out to be a total f*boy

I liked him because he was such a witty soul. So, it started out with texting and all. We started talking late into the nights and hung out a few times. There were days he would put food outside my door or paste random little post sticks on my table when I am in class. 

So I thought maybe I should wait out for your next move, however, I found out from other people that he texts a lot of girls and does the same to them. Right now, he's attached when all these were happening just about longer than a month ago.

So yep, now I am a wreck and how do I even move on from liking someone that much.

-
 
Hello everyone, I'm really confused bout who should pay on a date. I've been on a couple dates and every time I offer to pay, the guy always says he'll pay. But then one day, I didn't offer to pay, and this guy asked me "Do all the guys you go out with pay for your food all the time?" So I was really shocked and embarrassed lol. So should I always offer to pay or what??

That feeling when people around you think that you have your shit together and ask you for help with their schoolwork...when in reality you're only slightly less lost than them and not sure if you should help them or not

Saw a couple of whispers about friends and decided to share mine. 

During my freshman year when all the squads are forming, I was stuck between two. I eventually chose one and stuck with them for the next few years. But I was never happy. I felt like they are judging my every move... what I wear etc. I became very self-conscious and always tried hard to fit in. 

Finally one day, I decided to just heck it. I had enough of being so self-conscious whenever I am with my group of  "close friends". I left the squad virtually (on whatsapp) and irl. I joined the other squad in the end and today, I'm feeling so much happier whenever I hang out with my friends in school. I stopped feeling like I'm being judge for my every action and words and I feel at ease. I found myself after years of being who I am not. 

TDLR: Find friends who accept you and not friends who make you want to feel accepted.

Scrolling through my crush's facebook page precariously, looking at pictures of a face I've not seen in person for maybe 7 years, (actually 3 when she attended a conference with her now ex-boyfriend, the buffet lunch I skipped to not let her see me), using only my right thumb at the right half of the screen to reduce the risk of accidentally clicking 'like', I realise how hopeless I am.

@  

You have 2 choices: 

1) confess to him, risk the friendship. He either accepts you or rejects you. Either way you get closure. 

2) keep your feelings and live forever with the regret of "what if i told him.." 

I chose the former and no doubt, it jeopardized the friendship a little. But at least, i was true to my feelings and made a move to try. Nobody can tell you whether to confess or not, it all boils down to weighing your options and deciding what matters the most to you: The friendship, or the "what ifs". 

Anything can happen. Stay strong! Fate is a rather peculiar thing. 
If its meant to be, you can not confess and you will end up with him. 
If its not meant to be, it does not matter how many times you confess or how much effort and feelings you put in to appear 'desirable'.. It just simply will not work out.

I am very curious as to why people refer sex education as birds and the bees. Birds and bees don't seems anything related to sexual education since one is avian and one is insect. Can someone clarify please?

Guys, should I tell my ex that i still have feelings for her? We are still texting each other now. I tried moving on, dating other people but none of them matches up to her. I can't seem to get the same kind of connections I had with her  with other people. I truly believe she was the one for me. It hasn't been too long since we broke up (less than a year) and I know she is still single. Any advices? :(

If you are uncertain about whether a girl have a boyfriend, do you first ask whether a girl have a boyfriend before wooing her? Or do you woo straight away?

Met this person during this elective mod I took last semester. Didn't really have the chance to talk to him but somehow I managed to add him on Facebook, which made me super happy. However, although I really have a massive interest in him and want to get to know him better, I can never summon the courage to speak to him as we are both male and he doesn't look gay at all. In the end, I did what has to be done as nothing will ever happen and that is to remove him as a friend. Deep inside me, if there's a chance, I would really wish to know him better and understand him more.

I'm a guy who's had relationships with other guys for close to 10 years and I'm thinking of going after girls now. I was wondering if I should be upright about this (if I ever find a girl for myself) or keep it to my grave. Do girls if your date/boyfriend has been with other guys before?

Thought Valentine's Day would just be another day for me. When I woke up, I received a text from my crush wishing me Happy Valentine's Day after a month plus of not talking to each other. Though I'm sure he doesn't have feelings for me, I can't help but feel that he made my Valentine's a tad special this year :)

There's this girl whom I've been crushing on for a while now. From our occasional interactions, we seem to have quite similar interests and personalities. The issue is that I don't really open up to people very easily - and as far as I can tell (which is not much) she doesn't either.

I've been wondering about how to proceed - how do I drop the right degree of hints? If it's too subtle, it might not work. On the other hand, it feels like she doesn't like people to come on too strong. Is there some perfect balance? I want to get to know her better, but the possibility of botching it all up is ever-present.

oh please stop being selfish. If you're "introverted" and dont like doing what your peers do for socialising, then you can hardly blame them when they dont get you. This is reality. Yes you may be a deep and charming and whatever, but if nobody knows you, nobody is going to care. 

You cant expect people to want to get to know you when you're so "boring" what.

I recently got close to this girl 8 years younger than me. I actually knew her from long ago but we'd never been close, not until we found out we actually worked in the same company, which was around 1 year ago?

I feel happy when I'm with her. I feel comfortable talking to her about issues, topics that usually wouldn't interest 22 year old girls, talking about plans for the future, sharing childhood memories and just exploring new places together. I felt pretty amazed that despite having this 8-year gap between us, we still managed to click so well. But my parents do not approve of this relationship, and neither do her parents. Just to set this straight, it's not a homosexual relationship but a heterosexual one.

Apart from the age gap, I sometimes wish that we weren't cousins.

 I'm not really sure what to say. Posts like these are extremely rare and it's heartening to read something like this. Not sure if it's useful, but here's something in return. :)

Fresh grad here. Being the antisocial introvert that I am, my relationship with my co-workers have never extended past that of casual acquaintances. I've not met a single person with whom I feel that I have some affinity, hence I'm not too bummed about the fact that all I do is show up, do my work and go home. I'm fine with the status quo, though I admit that it would be nice to have co-workers with whom I'd actually want to befriend and vice versa. Just wondering how common is it to have no friends from work, or is there something wrong with me?

I finally send a long message of closure. Guys, please don't waste the time of a girl whom you are not interested in or not going to meet ever. Let her go and let her find her happiness. She can spend her time knowing guys who are interested in her instead.

- A heartbroken girl who used to like a guy who has no interest in her. Even his friends are more interested in her than him. :(

We are in love with each other. But there is much conflict occurring on a frequent basis. I have cried more in these past 9 months of the relationship than I have in my entire life. In fact, we quarrel almost every week. Before we started, I was an optimistic and driven person, and mood swings were hardly present. I still am a driven person but I am no longer my past cheerful self. 

To sum it up, we have very different interests, very different values, and very different goals in life. It might have been better if we have a little more similarity in any of the one aspects. We have tried communicating extensively but we still cannot find a middle ground in all three aspects... On his side, he always wants to hold on to this relationship. For me, I cannot imagine how this relationship will ever work in the long term. Yet it hurts too much for me to say "It's over". If anyone has any advice, please share.

Does anyone have a gaming laptop that I can rent ? Mine broke down and I need one for temporary replacement just for one day only . Appreciate the help :/

Life is okay and I shouldn't be complaining, but I always feel empty and unfulfilled, especially when I see my friends around me excelling and making a difference in the lives of the people around them. I know this is probably an over-generalization but it seems like everyone has something they can do well in except for me - even things like gaming I can't do well. Just random thoughts that keep biting at me late in the night.

Guy in a dilemma here.

So I used to have this female friend. Our friendship, if there was any between us in the first place, deteriorated due to certain reason(s). Judging from her actions and speaking with her friends, I know that she dislike me. She would ignore me when we're with our friends. Though if I ask her for small favours, she would agree to help as she is a nice and helpful person. Anything other than that, she'll probably reject me. So our relationship now is sort of like that person you are acquainted to because you used to be in the same group of friends but you're not close to her anymore though both of you are still close with the same group of fiends. (Weird but I don't know how to phrase it.)

The problem is I began having feelings for her and I can't stop thinking about it. She's a great girl but sometimes I just couldn't tolerate her actions. There was a period of time the feeling went away and now it has come back to haunt me. I don't know what this feeling is or how to deal with it. Is it a crush or just a yearning to salvage our lost friendship? Maybe we weren't even friends in the first place and it was just me foolishly thinking we were friends. 

What should I do? Someone give me some advice and save me from this hell.

TLDR: guy had feeling for a girl who dislike him. Don't know what this feeling is and what to do. Asking for advice on nuswhisper.

Mom: honey how are you doing today??
me: uhh fine. got lots of assignments though so kinda stress
mom: oh honey I know it's hard
me: nah I can handle it. Thanks
mom: you can tell me
me: uhhhh?? what?
mom: It's VALENTINES DAY. you must miss him. All those memories. All the time you spent together. All those valentines days together. And this year you're alone. 
me: ohhhh. erm. Mom remember I did the breaking up? I'm happy I'm not spending Vday with him. 
mom: i know but i miss him....

Sometimes I think my mom isn't over my ex.

I am a 23 year old female in a serious relationship for the first time. I knew my boyfriend for 3 months and have seeing him seriously for 4 months now. The two of us are clear on no sex before marriage, but are physically intimate. I love to kiss him and cuddle up with him. But, when it comes to touching each other sexually, it feels good at that moment, but later thinking about it all alone makes me feel so guilty and ashamed of letting go of myself that I start crying uncontrollably. Initially I assumed that this must be because I have never been physically intimate with anyone before, but even after 4 months this guilt has not subsided. I am not religious or anything, but I have always wanted to be intimate only after being sure of the guy. I do love my boyfriend and he's sensitive and everything. I haven't spoken to him about this since I don't want him to feel he violated me in any way. Is there a way for me to get over this?

The thing about Facebook new initiative which celebrates Friendship Day and the X number of year of friendship with your FB friends. It is a constant reminder of how fragile friendships are.
Other than the usual nostalgia, I am wondering what in the world have I been doing. Yes, some friends in those photos may have drifted away from me due to time. But I always wonder - if last year, or 2 years ago, I made the effort to talk to them, will we still be as close as before?
Some friends drifted away due to misunderstandings. I wonder, if I have made even more effort into solving it, or even preventing them from the start, will we still be close friends? Will I still appear in their photos? 
Since it is impossible to mend the past, let's focus on the present. Instead of scrolling FB and wondering the many ifs, why not take the initiative to start a conversation again? 
This FB initiative is a constant reminder for me to put in more effort into all my relationships. 
Yes, Vday is just over, love is around the corner. Let's not forget our friends who were once/still with us before we meet our precious one.

I have everything in life, But somehow there's nothing in everything I have.

Crushes are indeed crushing... Confessing would spoil our friendship but my feelings for him has been growing stronger and stronger! Everyday I wish that he is beside me... There are moments when I get a strong urge to tell him directly and these moments have been getting more frequent these days. 

Doesn't help that he's a shy guy, I'm a shy girl and we're physically incompatible...
-
 
There's a guy I like, I want to confess though I am definitely sure that he doesn't like me that way. our conversations are quite one sided in text, with me trying to find a topic and hoping he replies. He says he doesn't like small talk. should I even try to confess? I'm starting to get along with his friends, so it's quite likely we would be doing projects together in the coming semesters. it would be awkward if he rejects me...  maybe just give up?
-
 
There is this guy who text me good morning often but there's where our texting stop because we don't have much to text about. I mean, we don't have to text each other what we're having for lunch and all the small talk/text thing. We go out together extremely rarely (like once a month) because we're both busy. Plus we like to study by ourselves so study dates are not even our options. I just feel very bothered by the good morning texts, because man, are you really thinking about me or just treating me like I'm an option? I don't ask him whether he is seeing other people also because it's not even my place to ask such a question. I'm just extremely confused by the situation and not sure whether it's too early to DTR.

Hi, Whisperers.

I'm a fresh grad. I've been single for way too long. I've been wanting to get into a long-term relationship and settle down for quite awhile, but I'm facing a huge problem: I can't seem to MEET enough people to get a good enough success rate for this.

Don't mention clubs and bars. I don't drink so that's out of the question. Plus, people there are not my type, and they're not looking for a LTR.

Tinder - been there, done that. Most interactions end up fizzling out or end up as hookups (I'm a guy BTW).

I'm running out of ideas. I know, I do have rather strict requirements for a mate, which doesn't help.....

I just wanna ask for some advice...

My bf and i have been together for quite a few years already. Recently, i feel like i dont know him as well as before and he each time he says he loves me, i dont feel the love and sincerity behind it. It could be because i think that i am not good enough for him to love. However, this feeling that i dont know if he still loves me lingers. Each time i ask him if he is happy with me, he says yes but his expression and actions say no... 

Am i being too sensitive or there is actually something going on that i dont know? 
-
 
Well you see we've been talking for a year. Went out for lunch and watched some movies together. But it seems he doesn't have the courage to make the move. My friends tell me he likes me, but it seems to me as if  he is sending me mixed messages and the confusion frustrates me. I guess i can say, this valentines will be the last i think of him as a potential soulmate. Its been fun getting to know you, but its time you know that being draggy when it comes to relationship brings you nowhere

Since today is Valentine's Day, I would like to share my crush story that is ongoing for about a year already.

I am a guy from Tembusu College, and I met this senior last year during NUS Open Day. He is this cute guy from Architecture who is very amiable and admirable. He is one of the reason why I decided to joined Tembusu, because he sets a very nice image for the college. Coincidentally during the interview process, he was there to tour me around the college. I was really excited then, to be able to see him again after so many months.

When I finally matriculated into NUS and Tembusu, I was over the moon to know that he is still around. However, I never had the courage to go up to know him. Whenever I see him around, I will hide behind a pillar or something to admire his suaveness. He dresses rather metrosexually, but I never knew his sexual orientation. He is a Christian/Catholic and thus I assume he should be straight. He is the first person that makes my heart palpitate whenever I see him. I thought the crush would taper away soon after, but it has been about 11 months already and I still have feelings for him.

Maybe if there's a chance, I would wish to know him better. Hope to see him in the dinning hall again. :)

When a guy wish to ask for a random girl's number (seeing that she is really attractive), do most of them

a) go up to her and ask outright

b) pretend find a topic to make small talk, see the girl's reponse first and whether can click, and if yes, then ask for number.

I know Valentine's is almost over but now that I've mustered the courage to, I want to try asking the girl who usually sits at the corner of the lecture room out... What should I do? Is a movie a good idea?

I am an attached guy. Recently saw this pretty girl at the bus stop and asked her for number. Gf found out and now keeps argueing with me. She doesnt believe my pure intention is to be friend with that girl. What should i do?

Reference to post. i tried pushing for it and asking her for an answer. she said that she refuse and cannot think about it, she just feel like escaping from it whenever shes being questioned. Eventually, she told me that maybe i should give up because its in her nature that she would automatically run away.

what should i really do now?

Dear Aunt Agony,

I'm so emo now.
I was planning to confess... soon... to this girl I'd been talking to and pursuing for awhile now. I'd been dropping hints along the way, small to medium, and we'd been talking more and more in the past month or so.

And we'd just had probably what was one of the most engaging conversations ever....only for her to let slip that there was this guy whom she was considering. Suffice to say it's not me.

I guess the only sensible step forward is to back off. I mean if she didn't tell me that someone else had confessed and that she was considering him that's probably not so bad, but I don't wanna add extra complication to her life. Well I guess, until this one runs its course (i.e. she rejects or breaks up with him), she doesn't need to know that I like her. Time to change targets for now, unfortunately.

Okay I am kinda in trouble now. 2 weeks ago a female friend of mine asked me if I want to watch Deadpool with her "Next, next Sunday" and I agreed. What I didn't realise was that "next, next Sunday" is actually Vanlentine's Day. Then 2 days ago, my crush asked me if I want to go for dinner on Valentine's Day and I have yet to reply her. What now??
-
 
What is valentine when you can open a can of coke, eat bak kwa, lie down on the sofa and watch tv? As an evergreen, no doubt I want to be in a relationship. But after a week of work and activities, all I want to do is to be in my own world.

Will he judge if he finds out that I masturbate? He thinks that I don't because of my innocent physical appearance. T.T And yes I'm a girl.

 Whatever you consider to be hints, the guy probably never saw them as such. Guys are really bad at this spotting hints thing, and since you described it as occasional subtle hints... sigh, you have better odds winning the lottery than the guy picking up on your hints.

I only started chatting with this girl on an online dating site 2 weeks ago and we click quite well. Will asking her out on valentines day be too sudden? Will not asking her out this valentines day make her feel that I am not interested in her?

I just met this amazing, intelligent girl at school. I really what to spend lots of time discuss business problems with her to increase my intelligence ( coz well, we are approx the average of five ppl we spend the most time with). I am a straight girl. Will the other girl think that I am a lesbian or be annoyed if I want to talk to her every week?

X is a student from another local uni. People usually see X as a driven, smart, rational, and hardworking student. But what they do not know is this. 

X is in a relationship with a guy over a decade older than her. It happened by chance. As he is her very first boyfriend, she fell madly in love with him. However, this guy is mentally unstable and he has admitted this. Although X loves him a lot, X is also very, very tired of the emotional drama.

Ready for the plot twist? He has a PhD.

What I am going to do on Valentine's Day: Gym in the morning, dota a few games in the afternoon, have a nice family dinner in the evening and use the rest of the time to complete my assignments

All you evergreen people out there, ENJOY YOUR SINGLEHOOD while it lasts, because you never know when it's going to be your last valentine's day alone.

Just curious, would it be right to say that no matter how pretty a girl is, it will only bring her to as far as more guys wishing to find chance to talk to her/more guys looking. But if she has very poor communication skills/appear not so friendly or doesn't like socialising, most of the guys' interest in her will somehow fade? 

Does it then mean that it's not exactly true that the pretty girls are always the popular ones because whether they are popular eventually depends on how she relates to other people as well? Which in other words means that being pretty helps more people to come to her wanting to be friends, but the rest is up to her socialising skills?

In response to , I'd say I'm in the same boat too, and since everyone is allowed to confess anonymously, let me talk about my lack of emotions on this platform. Let me breathe my heavy,dark,dangerous secret here since nobody knows who I am anyway. 

I came into this world with kind intentions in the beginning: I wanted to feel emotions and love like a normal person would. But due to how I'm raised by my parents, all forms of feelings are sucked out of me like a vacuum cleaner. 

1. When I was in secondary school, my peers were talking about the movie "a walk to remember", show touching it was and how it made them cry buckets. Curious, I went online that night to watch it on YouTube only to see my mum lurking up behind me, switching off the monitor, and coldly saying" no need to watch this,understand? Study! It's your topmost priority  now. Can you get hundred in your Maths? Look at your physics. I dunno what you're up to these days, not even studying. You're ruining your future if you don't score. Don't waste time watching stuff like this, study!" 

2. From then on I had no access to movies,so feeling touched by movies was out of the question. My mum supervises my every move like a hawk. She stands behind the screen,scrutinising every webpage. So I thought of another alternative: books. I borrowed some romance books from the library but just as I thought I could understand love from reading them, my mum RAIDED MY BAG and dug them out. 
Worse, the cold,snide remarks began again,"if only you can use all this energy into your studies. Can't you see that other people score better than you? Focus in your studies and don't read trash!" 
From then on, all the books I read are kept within the confines of science,technology,and history. Good for academics but not good for developing the heart. 

3. When others are immersing themselves in the touching atmosphere of Novels, movies and songs, I'm trapped in a strict world full of back to back tuition enrichment lessons, "parent-approved" books like einsteins discoveries, and classical music(because pop music does nothing to brain development). I soon became a studious robot, knowing only logical stuff but severely missing out on emotions. 

4. As a normal person in the past, I used to have a slight crush on a certain celebrity. I saved up my pocket money to buy the VCD and CD,only to have them confiscated by dad before I even listened. "Stop focusing on idiotic crushes, study! Understand? Why other people score better than you? Because when you're listening to his songs,they are studying!" Another try at love killed. 

5. When other people choose their lunches based on taste&  other emotional factors, I have learnt to be a completely rational and emotionless being: to choose based on vitamin and protein intake. I don't even know what is "like" as its not a word in my dictionary. 

6. But, there's a complication. I have a high level of intelligence and with that comes the dangerous thing: I learn to "fake" emotions to prevent anyone from finding out how inept I am. Yes, I do admit I'm academically smart as i was chosen for a science research Programme and another h3 subject in JC(as I kept studying ) So I learn to perfectly mimic feelings. 

7. Although movies and music  make everyone else cry but me, I blend in using cognitive skills. For example, when I hear about a breakup, I nod my head in understanding, saying things like I know how sad it is. Truth be told, as I have never immersed myself in a romance (from movies or otherwise), I'm clueless. But I know that's the "correct" thing to say to be a good girl,so I follow the script. 

8. When I slipped and had a nasty fall in school,  I saw that many people were looking on in horror at me. I quickly rearranged my facial features into "pain", deciphering that it must be the most appropriate expression on my face for a normal person who feels. I proceeded to groan even though I have no idea how "pain" must have been for normal people whose emotions aren't blunted. 

9.  Every attempt to feel emotions like a regular person is thwarted by my parents. Even if I want to go on a class outing, my mum will say," can't you see you've so many subjects that didn't get A? Don't waste your time understand?" Friendship and love are seen as inferior to studies. So repeated incidents like this shaped me into the insensitive, unfeeling beast I am now. 

10. Sometimes, my superficial cover drops on accident and people start suspecting I'm a psychopath. When my class was Organising an outing, only a handful turned up;me included). My friend was feeling really upset about it and she couldn't stop complaining about it. I merely listened and nodded but I failed to feel sad about it. Taken aback, she gingerly ventured,"errr....aren't you affected? You don't seem affected at all. " yes,whoever you are,if you're reading this. I'm not "affected" and I know it since young because every time I want to understand how getting emotionally "affected" feels like, my ears will burn with callous remarks like "STUDY! Study! Don't you know that studying is important?" 

11. Relax, I'm not a true psychopath with all senses of the word. I don't inflict harm on anyone, I treat everyone with courtesy, I even donate regularly to charity. I'm not the one who poisons lab mates, I'm not a school bully, I don't flare up at anyone. I have never done bad things. I just don't feel love instinctively in my heart, and I am overly rational. 

12. There's no way I can be a loving and sensitive girl who can open up. There's no way I can understand how crying over a touching story feels like. There's no way of understanding breakups, as I don't feel love. But I don't do bad things, and I don't think evil thoughts.

So i need some opinions about my situation now:

I have been talking to this guy everyday for awhile. He messages me good morning texts, asks me how's my day and what I am doing etc. However, he hasn't made any move to ask me out, and the mixed signals are making me very confused? So is he interested or not? I'm afraid he may just be a very friendly guy and I am thinking too much into things.

Which makes me a little annoyed cos guys, if you are not interested, why do you have to send such texts and lead the girls on? I mean, do guys tell their problems to every girl they meet? cos this guy does tell me his problems and I am starting to like him a little. For those who would say, why don't you make the move then? Well, its because I don't know what he is thinking and I am afraid to jeopardize this friendship because I know how awkward it can get later on.

I have a friend who is in a stable relationship, but recently got intimate with an older man. She says that they havent had sexual relations, since he only penetrated her for two seconds before pulling out. Convincing?
-
 
For the past one year, i have been chatting with this guy consistently over the phone, we went out for a few times. My friends think that he likes me based on our conversations. I have dropped occassional subtle hints to show my interest but up till now he has yet to make any further progressions. Should i give up after valentines? 
-
 
I met a guy sometime last year. We had goals to achieve by this Vday and we had some (kinda) plans. Unfortunately, we broke off (it's not even a break up since we haven't made it to the official stage) early this year due to our differences. Now that Vday is approaching, I start to think about the what ifs and feel slightly sad that it's gonna be yet another lonely Vday. 
And, hey, I hope you've been well :)

The pain is not being single, but wondering deep down do you really like the person, or whether you just do not want to feel lonely...

There is this guy whom got close to my girlfriend because his girlfriend is overseas for SEP for a year. I hate how close they are getting but i don't want to seem as being unreasonable about it. but i really hope he would just back off and leave her alone. what should i do? My gf thinks that there is nothing wrong with what she's doing and she's not cheating on me too but I just can't help but to feel really annoyed. Advice please!
-
 
I'm really jealous of how people are able to forge close friendships/ relationships easily. No matter how hard I try I always feel like I just don't fit in. I've tried to change the way I dress, the way I talk but I still feel alone. I also find it hard to sustain conversations with most people. All that said, I feel lucky to have a few close friends who I know will always be there if I need someone to talk to. 
-
 
I'm thinking of asking a guy friend (quite close and I think he likes me a little) of mine to do threesomes (1st time) with my bf (agreed to it) and I. 

Is it generally accepted among guys to do with girls who aren't their gf? Will you agree to it if you are my friend? Or should I ask a random stranger instead?

I don't want to be rejected if I ask my friend, if not it will be so awkwardzzz.

So I met this guy through the sp event during foc last year, and after that we've been texting everyday. From messaging everyday, it became lesser, but the messages got longer and longer. Usually he's the one to take a few days to reply, but when I say long messages, it's a few pages long. None of his friends know we're texting and there has been no attempt to talk f2f. Could there possibly be anything? Or am I just being delusional? 
-
 
I know I'm a bastard, but...I've managed to secure 2 dates for V-day. One will be a potential girlfriend. But I'm not sure which one to choose, and which one to reject. Hence I decided to crowdsource my dilemma:

Shall I go for the girl with:

a) hot and sexy i.e. C-cup boobs, great curves; or
b) not so hot and sexy, but very loving and kind?
-
 
I'm trans, though I don't look like it at all. It makes love difficult, cause even if they return my feelings it won't be the real me they love. Add on trust issues and my hopes for a relationship drop to almost zero.
Sucks to not be able to be true to others, but I'll survive I guess :\
-
 
the girl i like doesn't even know i exist. And she's attached. haiz.

Actually I am in the same situation as you. While everyone says not all can understand being alone or enjoying the me time, sometimes we do want to turn to our friends and share whatever we want to share. 

I wonder what happens if we introverts all gather together.... 

I don't mind making friend with you cos I am also not humorous and have low self esteem too.
-
 
Uh... I took a Less Peaceful route to solving my parental problems. I hope no one would do this, because it strains relations.

Any thing regarding family? 
Sorry, I don't have the time. I'm busy studying. Can you don't disturb me? Yeah, I am being your "good kid", being all "grown up", just as you wanted, right? I can cook for myself, provide for myself, live by myself (I actually do that, I don't stay with my family any more). STOP FUCKING COMING ANYWHERE NEAR ME.

Understand this: I was not exactly the most normal of children - I had ADHD. Somehow or rather, my mom decided that it was justified that "I would rather beat the fuck out of you, than let you take meds." 

That, and because of the large family I have, she tried putting as much things in my mind against my other family members, blaming me for any shit, reprimanding me for it. 

It was not really until my secondary school, when my ADHD went into something like a full-blown autism. Head banging onto the table, stabbing books, threatening to slice people with a wood planer (lol), etc..I didn't make it to the secondary school my mom wanted, you see, and she made sure I remembered, every other day, along the way of my secondary school life. 

Instead of making sure I got help, she just kept blaming me, saying that I "needed to grow up", "I am waiting for the day you grow up" "why must you be so childish? Can't you see others? Why can't you be more normal like them?" 

I got into JC. My GP teacher can poke at me for being in my "Lalaland", others can call me weird, call me names for running and jumping around, but hey, as long as life goes on, I can live another day, it's fine, right? I won't use my brain any more, I promise. If I use my brain, only bad, childish things will come out, right? I won't do it anymore. Just please, stop disturbing me.

You see, the thing about people like me, is that you can either whack us into submission as you hoped, or whack me into becoming a deadbeat, stubborn person. I turned out to be the latter.

I started showing signs of my other nature at home, randomly crying when I couldn't get an A, etc., and I don't remember being able to smile. This was when my family saw something wrong with me. After all, I was only worth something if I had gotten into a JC. I was anti-social. I refused to take part in anything social. I exhibited escalated violent tendencies, from when I was in secondary school. During PE Lessons, I would just run by myself, while others play games. They could ask me why I was like that, but they would just get shot instead.

It was around NS, that I actually moved out of that hellhole of a terrace house, into living alone in the HDB flat that she owns today. 

Peace and tranquility. It was something I sought after, but never really got. I quarreled with them, telling them outright to let me live in peace, that as a person who was going through NS (seriously man, NS, a very nice card to use), I should have the right to my independence. And I fought with them for it. 

Your grandson is at fault, you better fucking admit it. Yes, I am not afraid to talk back to you. Respect? Sorry arh, why the fuck must I respect you just because you're older? You've done a very good job having this kind of grandchildren eh?

Unfilial son? Been called that many times. "Someday, you will get struck by lightning for treating me this way" Yup. Someday, I will, but well I'm still standing here, am I? 

You can blame me, call me a monster, but has anyone apologised for turning me into one? I don't think an apology should be in place, nor should one be needed. I'm here today, ain't I?

Throughout these few years of my uni life, living alone, I learnt to become more responsible for my actions. I learnt, I grew. I started to be able to think properly again, recently, though unfortunately I was 3 years too late. The sparks that died, recently got revived again (mostly because I haven't been around people who keep putting it out). True, that part of me that is partially psychotic still lives, but I am dealing quite well with it. I would say that I can deal with it very well because I have experience with it. The key is to channel it into something useful, like... Spontaneous Randomness!!! Woooo~~~~~~ That, and being more confident helps a lot. You'll be surprised.

Still learning how to feel and interact with other people though - the problem being, if you're a tank, you just tank, but you tend to overlook things that others do not tank.

My friend has constantly told me, "Hate is like hot coal. You'll hurt yourself if you hold on to it. Why are you holding on to it?" I look back, hey, it's a lot of rage, a lot of hate, a lot of childishness. 

I can only sit here, laugh at it, and look forward. In a moment of rashness, I hurt a lot of people. Relations are better now, and I have reached newer levels of understanding with my family (though still, as separate uh... cells? I have to keep a safe distance from them still, for no-bullshit reasons).

Point being, we can always drag such bitterness around, but it is what we do from now that will change, and define us. Having too much flaming baggage, ain't it a bit tad heavy and incendiary for flight?

Honestly, I'm fed up with the bunch of friends and whispherers who keeps posting stuff about how no one understands what an extroverted introvert is.

Pleeease. You're just being a normal person. It's entirely Normal for a person to feel tired after talking with people for an hour at a party. You don't possess introverted superpowers like being able to stay at home doing work/hobby for an entire month without needing to talk to another person to relieve stress.

And if you find it strange why other people can continue talking for hours. It's more likely because their sucking their thumbs and putting up with you, and not going around facebook complaining about how tired they're actually feeling.

Either you tell us face to face that you're feeling tired during our gatherings, or you jolly well put up with it. We had already allocated time to meet up with you, so how do you think we feel when we get home and see you complaining about it on facebook?
-
 
I never knew that reaching out to a loved one could actually hurt so much. I wanted to help with absolutely no ill-intention. Yet, you are just too stubborn to face your own mistakes, reflect, and maybe try to be nicer to people around you? And not act like everyone owes you, or that no one understands you. 

We all have our own struggles, but in front of our loved ones, why share the negativity when time can be better spent on enjoying each other's company. 

I never really expected your reaction. And ouch, it hurt. When I asked if I was of any help, you asked me not to do it again, that it didn't help at all, it was of no use. Gosh. In my rational mind, I accepted it with respect. Then again, my whole day was so dull because of that sentence. That rejection of well-intentioned help, hurt, so badly. 

I couldn't even face you later on in the day, because what I feared really came true. Instead of being open-minded, and trying to see things from other perspective, you pushed me away. Damn.

I quit social media recently. No real effects to my life. I still have friends who meet often together.

My 22 year old friend is planning to propose to his 16 year old girlfriend this Valentine's Day. I don't quite know what to make of it
-
 
I have a crush on this guy... but now, his friends are trying to matchmake him with this other girl who likes him too... of course i'm quite sad :( haiz is it like a guy also must go and befriend all his friends? if not i really have no chance already... valentines day is coming, i wish i have the guts to ask him out for a date... how? :(
-
 
does height really matter for a guy in finding a partner? i know i am short, standing at around 165 to 170 range but this is really affecting me too much. can girls please share your thoughts?
-
 
i dont understand why some gf will share so many posts tagged with their guys so many times a day. I dont understand why they still do it despite the obvious lack of response from the guy. 
From the first person point of view, i will definitely give a response to whatever my SO posted on my wall because i feel that it is respect. 
Also, if i were the one posting i wouldn't  go to the extreme of so many posts in a day as it is rather annoying. 
From the third person point of view, to be brutually honest, i feel that the girl is being too overly attached to the guy and trying to tell all the guy's facebook friends that he is taken. 
-
 
Whenever i see articles on pimps or guys preying on underage girls, i can't help it but to feel indignant and jealous. Do any of you guys feel the same too? Not that i'm a lustful person but i just feel sorry for them, like why are they so dumb. Can you guys enlighten me? If you wish to be anonymous you can always tag my post in a new post! Thanks!
-
 
 hmm... bring some mutual friends along for the lunch. 

I don't think his violent tendencies will act up, after all, what you see on social media is just one side of the person (more often than not, an extreme side, a lot of people don't get that). 

Coming from perhaps, one of those "mentally ill" people, your friend might just be extremely lonely. It's a form of reaction, but the fact that people actually avoid it makes it A LOT worse. 

"I am not wanted,why are they doing this? Why are THEY like that?" It pretty much becomes a "me vs them",downward spiralling perspective. 

If you want to help your friend, and are sincere about it, I am hoping that you can put in the immense amount of patience and effort, to listen and be his friend. Be sincere, and extremely patient about it, make it such that he "cannot peel away your facade".

Find out what makes him tick, and slowly (can take months,etc.,) normalise him. Make him understand that there is a life outside that can be more enjoyable than where he's cooped out now. 

I hope this helps, because I was there once; I wore out the patience of many friends, and ended up regretting it.

Anyone still using Letterbox? LOL

I really hate socialising. And there are a few reasons how I've come to this.
In JC, I was pretty much known by everyone in school. Not trying to show off or anything here; I was involved in a lot of "unofficial" cca's, projects, and events so I was able to maintain a very close relationship with all of my classmates. I led a social project with 20++ members, all of whom I personally convinced and inspired. I wasn't the fun-popular type, but people came to me and told me their deep secrets and worries. I was good at listening, and people needed that, as they were facing exams and stressful mugging nights.
But after those years, I realised that nothing was left for me. When I socialised in the past, I would never look at the benefits; people seemed happy when I listened to them, sympathised with them, gave advice, and crack a few jokes along the way. And I enjoyed making them happy. Before coming to uni, all I realised was that there was no time left for me. I knew nothing about myself and didn't even have enough self-esteem. I was skilled at earning trust, and I was partially doing this by bringing myself down.
So when I came to uni at last, I started dreading those socialising sessions. It's not that I don't have any friends; I still have a number of people I can really trust, and I feel proud of myself for already having formed those relationships after only one semester of uni life. But I hate it when we have to stand up, 'network', and talk about superficial matters. I'm tired of asking people how their mods this sem are. I've already asked the question, "how was your break?" too many times. I really don't get the importance of those networking, socialising sessions. People say you should know as many people as possible because they can potentially help you in the future, but that feels too fake. So now I have a tendency of drawing a line between those I consider as deep relationships and those I don't.
So this sem, I've started to do a lot of things alone. I would meet my close friends everyday for a few hours, and Skype with those who are abroad for another hour or so, but I leave all the rest to myself. Excluding the time I spend talking to people during classes, since I have some great classmates this sem. And I've started to enjoy that. I love walking to classes alone and watching people on the way, paying attention to the weather and thinking about how I'm going to spend the day. I love spending some time everyday to read and do some extra studying for my major (by the way, I'm kind of in love with my major right now, which is also another reason I've come to like playing solo). I love thinking to myself, and I don't see a reason to share it verbally all the time. And when I would have hard times, or when my like-minded friends have problems, I would listen to them or talk to them for long hours. But I would spend all those 'petty' and in-between hours alone.
But I think the social stigma on solo-play is kind of a big pressure for me. I really love my life; I love the balance, and I've never felt lonely, living a life like this. (In the past, when I would socialise with everyone and have NO time to myself, then I would feel truly lonely.) I have the best friends in my life right now, and I simply cannot describe how close I feel to them. However, the way other people see me is very difficult to handle. They see me as a unsociable, shy person, which is in fact a personality created by choice. I wish I had the nerve to ignore all these judgemental views, but I can't mainly because I'm surrounded by a lot of people who care significantly about their sociability. How can I endure this? Am I living my life the right way? If I'm happy and satisfied, isn't that all that's important?

Hi guys, just some tips for singles surviving V-day.

1. Stay away from social media, dont check facebook, dont instag, twit and especially dont post anything. Seeing friends' couple pics and vday plans or posting something sad really does not help the situation and we are better off not having other people's romance shoved into our faces.

2. Channel any negative emotions, loneliness, frustration, fear or sadness from rejection into useful energy, such as learning an instrument, learning to bake a new dish, learning something that improves us as a person, you'll feel better about yourself and be occupied this week, 

3. Accept the fact that you are single, and also realise that you are not alone, despite lovely dovey couples all over you, other fellow singles arent exactly parading their statuses as well, there are many around you who feel the same and would like some company, even as just friends. Graduate surveys state only 40-50% are in a rship upon graduation so really, half your peers are single as well.

4. Get out of the house, dont stay home watching dramas or playing computer games, pick an event, and get out of the house, there are many this weekend if you do a quick google search, doesnt matter if you go with friends or go alone, and when we are there, just have a good time, buy a drink/snack, say hi to a stranger who seems to be there alone as well, any single you meet out there is a more outgoing, friendlier and likely a better match for us than one staying at home, be apart of that community!

5. Do some reflection and resolve for some change, just as how we make new year resolutions, we can make v-day resolutions for the next year as well, if we have always been single, what have we done over the past year to change that? Sitting around waiting for the "right one" doesnt exactly work anymore, for the right one to find us, we have to provide opportunities for him or her to meet us! 

Its really not so bad, and im sure anyone in a rship will agree that one of the most exciting parts about love is the search and the chase, the hope and excitement knowing that there is a small chance we meet someone, gets us up in the morning each day, but we have to help ourselves improve the odds by taking some action! getting out there, and simply saying hi!

Present: "No one owes you anything." That is so true and has been validated through my experience, and intensified through pain. No one owes you a helping hand, their sympathy, empathy, kindness, loyalty, honesty, understanding, love and so much more. Beneath all that lies on the surface, that seems to be the reality despite occasional anomalies. As I tear up and break time and again, I constantly question if after all this while, I have ever gotten stronger or is it that the path that has chosen me and at the same time, which I have chosen for myself is just getting increasingly arduous to thread. At such moments, I wish the world had been different and perhaps myself as well.

Past: But it is also in such moments, that I remember you having been part of my life and it always seems as though it was only a while back. I see myself living in three separate times, the past, the present, and the future. And the past that haunts me is also the past that etches your presence in my mind. Thank you for having believed in me and I think it's your presence and such thoughts of you having believed in me that has always helped me push through during my tough times.

Future: Just as no one owes me anything, so too does it seem that I owe nothing to anyone, and you might think I owe nothing to you. I doubt that is true, but nevertheless, I owe myself lots. Amongst all that I owe myself, including a reason for my existence and the privileges that I have, I not just think but also feel that I owe myself a reason to be truly worthy of your belief in me and the expectations you had of me, and a reason to be able to look you in the eye sometime in the future and thank you in person for all that you have done for me. Subconsciously before realisation due to pain, you had already become the most important person in my life, someone whom I highly regard and have the utmost respect for.

Will you please come back.
I miss you, to the point where my mind is fully occupied by you.
When I hear a love song, I would think of you and think back on all the nonsense that I spewed when I was a jokester, and how you would entertain them with your laughter. And you doing the same and how you would drive me crazy with your antics.

I want to take you back. I want to say that I want you. I want you. I really do.
I miss you so much that I'm really afraid of losing you. I wasn't sure what came over me that night and when I think back about it, it's so embarrassing, but that was real. At that point, I was so sure that I had already fallen in love with you. So too am I now. My tears don't lie, neither does my fear and sadness at the thought of losing you, nor me wanting to process my thoughts and write them here.

I wish I could take back my words but I can't turn back time nor can I lie what I was feeling or thinking then at the moment. So too I can't lie now. I don't know if it was a big mistake given how I felt and thought then. But I know it will be a very big mistake and perhaps the biggest mistake and regret I will come to have in my life if I do nothing to make you stay. You have been the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and I want you in my life.

I miss you and your nonsense. Will you please give me another chance, us another chance to be psychos together?

Somehow I feel relieved and slightly happier (as sadistic as that sounds) when I see posts about how people are feeling lonely or not having much friends. Im actually now convinced that there are lonely people in nus, and im not the only lonely soul here. Seeing everyone in groups makes me feel really sian that I just want to escape to somewhere quieter sometimes. 
Being an introvert, I find it hard to sustain my friendships. People come, people go; just friends for the season. It’s quite sad, looking back at the past and realise a lot of the people you once interacted more with have all moved on. Funny enough, most of my remaining (few) friends are extroverts and have their own bigger groups of friends. It has come to the point where I don’t feel like meeting anymore new people and form a bond with them, cuz I know it is just going to be a passing memory. It doesn’t help with my low self esteem - that im not good enough, not humorous enough, not fun enough for people to want me in their lives. 
Im so lonely, but somehow ive learnt to embrace the silence. I’m getting by.

 Whar are some of the factors that motivates guys to take action and approach a girl they don't know (for her number, to strike up a convo etc.)?
Ans: You ask as if there is a general consensus among all guys which obviously isn't true. For me, I probably have a very complicated answer but here is the short version. It's mutual attraction and mutual attraction only. I have a lot better things to do than waste my resources including time on someone whom I'm not interested in. And just as in a relationship there's no point clinging onto someone who has no or lost interest in you, outside a relationship there's no point chasing someone who doesn't reciprocate my feelings. They may develop feelings (for me and not the chase) after my chase, but nah...

Conversely, what dissuades you from doing so? 
Ans: Lack of mutual attraction and other reasons I deem to be important which is context-/time-dependent, i.e. I have low self-esteem.

Just accepted a friend request from a secondary school classmate. From his posts, can conclude he's definitely mentally ill. Why like that? I wish we kept in contact after secondary school, so perhaps can prevent it from happening.

Want to reply to his Facebook post or message him, perhaps can offer some advice, but not knowing his current situation well, it might make things worse. Say we meet up for lunch to catch up, I'm afraid he might be violent.

Any advice?
-
 
 hello there! similar story haha. think he's cheating though. at least in my case, my ex was cheating already. think about it logically, if he really did misunderstand you, why didn't he approach you to clarify things? Ought he not simply assumed and executed his "revenge" or wtv that is by posting an intimate picture with another girl? (like what you wrote, you saw him post an intimate picture with a girl and you approached him to clarify. shouldn't that be the norm?) and if he wasn't cheating before this but is really of such petty and immature character, you're better off without him anyway :) *hugs*

Continued from  [part 1]  [part 2]:  
The end wasn't an explosion, it was a fizzle. It ended without fanfare or drama. Looking back, it ended long before we acknowledged it. 
It was a snide comment from me about how I found his friendliness with people (Ok, to be specific, other girls) annoying. It was him, wanting me to love him more, give him all of me, when I felt I had given him everything already. It was me not replying to his messages the moment I got them and it was him stopping the texts. It was hug's that were brief and kisses on the cheeks at the end of the night instead of on the lips.
Somehow slowly we started to drift apart instead of difiring together.
We still loved one another, of that I had no doubt. 
I would do anything to make him happy but we just didn't work as a unit anymore. No longer did we finish each other's sentences.
Isn't that what a relationship was supposed to be? Two people working together, stronger together than separate. Inspiring each other to be better. But somehow along the way, we stopped being a unit. We had become individuals again. 
The last time we met up, it had become a breach that we couldn't deny anymore. His kiss felt like goodbye on my lips. After the first kiss we shared, this kiss became my next favourite. 
After the longest of time, this kiss was filled with passion. It felt for a moment as though he was trying to merge us both together. As if we could stop the inevitable crash if we just held on a bit longer. It was a kiss that was filled with all the "we could have been", "we should have tried more", and "fuck I miss what we had."
As we held onto each other after the kiss, he trails a finger down my nose to my cheek, and stops at the corner of my lip. His finger is moist. I had been crying. He drops a kiss on the tip of my nose. "I love you even now." "Me too," I reply. "But it's not enough is it?" "Not anymore." "Friends?" "The best kind. We are forever."
I am not sure if he could tell if I was lying. Perhaps he could. He was the only one who could tell when I was lying. He still smiled as I turned to walk away. He hugs me once more from the back(his fav way of hugging me), I lean into it and he drops his head onto mine. I try to memorise his unique smell; Marlboro, Hugo boss, and just his own scent all blended together.
We haven't spoken since then or tried to meet up. It's been 61 days. It hurts too much. Maybe he knows that if we met up, we would end up trying to make it work even if we know that in the end, we are better off apart than together. 
Walking away from him was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. How can two people love each other so much but cannot find a way to stay together? It was 2 years of memories. 2 years of being one instead of two. But I know that this is the best thing for the two of us.
PS: I know you read this. I love you. Always. Take care Love!

I go for paid massage and other... "intimate" services once in a while to fulfill my urges, is it really so wrong to do so? I can't be the only one... right?
-
 
Dear lady, if you ever come across this, I want you to know that at the very least, I tried.

Right now,same as before, I would rather get a good friend, than get a girlfriend.

True,at one point I had shown interest in you, but I realised that I am better off as a friend of yours instead.

I had started to observe you, to try to learn more about you, trying to interact (or disturb) you,and what sparked that initial interest?

I had thought that maybe, you might be someone, whom I could actually work something out with. It was confirmed that I was wrong.

There's much to you I do not know, as much as you actually bothered to try knowing me. I have only seen you around for like... what, less than a few months?

However, with things so awkward between us now, I understand that a gentleman must know when to back off. 

If you avoid me like plague,I can understand. If you ignore me, well... I will play along. I am sensible enough, after all.

Understand that yes, I am very aware of my surroundings, and I do see and sense you every now and then.

I may sound and behave like a stalker, popping up everywhere (mostly because I do travel a lot around campus), but do pay attention to the people around you - you actually see them around more often than you see me. It's just my behaviour that makes me stand out.

Nowadays, I am moving away from the clusters to somewhere where I can get better peace,quiet and solitude (ironic,isn't it?).

As a person who (really) do not matter any more, I wish you all the best .

It's been months since I confessed about crushing on one of the student conductors of the NUS choir and my feelings haven't changed. Now what? :(

 I am a guy and I empathize with your bf. I had been in his position before. 
My first love was someone who had three sexual, but not really serious relationships before. 
I had always wondered how it would be to do it with another girl, especially since she could never reach the big O no matter how hard I tried (neither did she with her previous partners).  I guess it's natural to have such thoughts, but it is important not to act on it and not to let it affect your relationship in any way.
She cheated on me and confessed a year later (we were together for 2 years at that point). She was repentant and I tried to get over it, but I couldn't. Apart from the loss of trust, I felt it would be grossly unfair that she got to have all the fun while I didn't even get to make a girl O. I broke up with her. 
At that point, I had just graduated and was worried if I had missed out on all the univ fun. I couldn't be more wrong. I had enough money to pay for "dates", and to rent a unit on my own. Getting girls to sleep with me was not a problem anymore. This is in spite of the fact that I slept only with those who were upfront about keeping it casual. My curiosity was sated, but I realized that sex is more fun when you're in a relationship. 
Eventually, I met someone and am in a very happy relationship now (getting married soon :D). She has had some experience too, so we've some parity in that respect.
-
 
 If he never ask you out again, he is just treating you as a friend. Just move on lah.
-
 
 I having the opposite problem. People been deleting me from Facebook and social excluding me. If this goes on, I will be mentally ill and might turn violent 
-
 
Someone please tell me if this is weird. I find myself wanting to spend time with this guy and feeling happy whenever we're about to meet or afterwards. But when we're actually together I don't really feel anything. Then he will leave, and only then I'd feel happy thinking back about when we were together. 
-
 
Anyone else prefer the idea of having a boyfriend to actually having one? I am seeing this guy I had a crush on on a casual basis (we're not officially a couple yet), but I am not as clingy as I am supposed to be... Idk why, cause I enjoy thinking about him for a couple of minutes before getting back to work and meeting up once a week. But actually attaching is a little bit cheesy for me :/ what's wrong with me?
-
 
I can feel for guys/girls who made their confessions about V-Day. This Valentine's Day, after years of rejections and disappointments, I'm going to go rogue. Instead of self-pity, I'm going to take radical action. I shall be happy for once.

Massage parlour + special service, limpek lai liao!

I recently read about the 80/20 rule of relationships (which I believe is trending on FB). I'm in a committed relationship myself, and I found it to be very true. Our partner is 80% of what we want, and there is no perfect human being out there. There is certainly that 20% of imperfection in everyone, including yourself. I love my boyfriend very much, and I appreciate all that he has done for me, and I to him. Of course there are times where things could have been better (beyond relationships, aren't there always instances where life can be better?). However, we should not immediately think of leaving someone who is 80% right for you, just because of that missing 20%. Yes, perhaps sometimes we see another guy that may have that missing 20% that your boyfriend doesn't have. I confess that sometimes I talk to some of male friends and wonder to myself how nice it would be if my boyfriend also had this interest/liked this sort of stuff, for instance (everyone has different likes and dislikes, and couples need not be 100% similar to each other). But I let myself stop at that, and think about everything else I love about him. I think this 20% is where friends come in, in our lives. There is no reason to leave your boyfriend simply because of that missing 20%, because you don't know other guys well enough, and they may really be only 20% right for you. We'll never be 100% satisfied, and that is okay. Anyone has any thoughts on 80/20?

, Me too :( Especially when my friends are all very pretty, I don't even want to look in the mirror for 1 sec. My bf also thinks I'm not pretty . A bit self-conscious when I'm out with him/friends, but I'm good when I'm alone ;D
-
 
 its kay I think your quite experienced compared to the rest of us whom never even went out with girls alone before. Those hoes ain't worth your time. Remember our value appreciate with age. Just be nice to the people around you but don't expect anything from them. Genuine girls will notice.

I just got to know this guy three weeks ago at work. He left the company for another offer but still remain in contact with me through text (we text almost everyday).

This week, he initiated to treat me a meal on Sunday and I agreed, only to realise that its V-day. I'm unsure if this means an official date or not. I do hav interest to get to know him better, but am worried if things are going too fast?

what should i do if a girl i really like tell me that she doesn't know if she likes me as a bf, she is not ready, or she just like me as a friend only? she said she tried thinking but she couldn't get an answer.
-
 
To  you're probably really attractive and give a good first impression. But probably after going out on dates with you the girls get turned off. Probably you're being too pushy/ overly enthusiastic. Or maybe just creepy idk. 

Someone told me this before- if everyone leaves you then you are the problem, not them. 

Just sayin.

I am with my girlfriend for around a year now. Sometimes I wonder if she is really happy being with me. She claims to be happy with me, but I feel that another guy in my group seems to be more suited for her, in terms of personality and interests. She is also interested in talking to him, and appears very happy talking to him too. Am I reading too much into it, or is she looking at an alternative?
-
 
 &  That's a very bad attitude to take especially if you like the guy. Not being aggressive need not mean he's not sincere and not into you as it might mean that he might not want to come off as irritating or that he doesn't believe in a relationship or a date where the opposite party is not at all interested in him or not interested in hanging out with him. What about shy guys? Or guys who do not want to risk friendships being broken? Please don't stereotype all guys the way you girls are doing for whatever reasons. Inevitably, you might also be signalling to guys that you are stuck up or gain pleasure from self-validation without chances of responding.

Or perhaps you might reason that no aggressiveness doesn't necessarily mean that he's insincere or uninterested but if he's aggressive, he's definitely sincere and interested. Is that true? What logic is this? I don't understand.

I started to romantically like a friend of mine. We are meeting casually on V Day. She calls me "bro" in text message. I simply like this blunt and whimsical girl, secretly. :-)

Year 4 evergreen guy here. Whoever said that it's easy to get attached in uni, it's all a lie. Pardon me while I set a date with Ms FYP for valentine's day.

Not sure if others do this too but there are days like this when I feel so depressed after some event(s) and it's as though my calm inner mental state has been disturbed. It's such days that I just want to close myself up and not give a damn about anyone or anything except living my own life. And at such times I wonder who can I or would I turn to and most of the time I return to the answer: no one. It makes me wonder why in which case, I still bother maintaining some friendships when sometimes they are the ones making me feel distressed. There are only two things I really need now, real solutions and support. Otherwise, I'll probably be gone for quite some time. Till then, pardon my selfishness and silence. Goodbye.

I think i am an overly paranoid guy. I worry a lot about what others think of me especially those whom i don't know well. Like after talking to him/her over a short conversation i always keep thinking did i say anything wrong? did i say anything which would make him think i'm weird? etc etc. Also, on whatsapp when i'm texting the girl i sort of like, i would constantly be fretting about whether i said anything rude or that would piss her off if she takes a while to reply, especially if she blue ticks my messages. I can't help how i feel cos that's just the way i am but i desperately want to just be free of all these negative and paranoid thoughts. Any advice?

As a guy staying in PGP for conveniences' sake, it gets lonely sometimes. I'll numb myself by studying. Judging from last sem's results (Yr1 here), it seems to be futile. I am largely at fault, being socially awkward and having trouble carrying a conversation with people after NS, opting for dark plain tee and jeans and blending into the environment. I envy the fleeting friendships of others, and yet dread small classrooms and invasion of physical space.

Sometimes, I get tired for trying too hard, being the kiasu one in group assignments, although I turn down social engagements from friends. Sometimes, I dread this helplessness. I fear confiding in close female friends, for no one should be forced to wait on the washing of other's laundry. I'm not only building walls, but shooting arrows at people who get near. Besides, I've no idea what I want to or need to hear. I fear that an emotional attachment can lead to misunderstandings that complicate friendships.

I fear many things. I can't seem to get myself to try. I can't swim, nor cycle. The arcade games I liked became pointless after outlets close down one after another. Books become bland after guilt seeps in with the opportunity costs of academic readings. I fear smiling for the camera. 

Although I fear this would not be posted, it seems necessary to keep myself in check. I'll still need to smile tomorrow.

So VDay is coming and i just wanna know what im doing wrong. Ever since sec school, JC days, up to NS days and now in my 3rd year in NUS, i've never had a problem asking girls out for dates. But the thing is, i've always been relegated to being just friends and worse, the "bro-zone" for these girls. There was plenty of times these girls even chose to go on dates with me rather than their current bfs... And once done, they just dao me in school when they're with their bf. Oh how i wish i could just rattle these girls out.

And for those of you who gonna say "just make your intentions clear laaa"... Well, i did that once and the girl just left me hanging, no replies, and just ignored me in school. I've always had this mindset of "just move on la, she's not that interested". And yea, i did move one. But a couple of weeks later, then the girl was like "oh? if you liked me that much why didn't you stay?"... Really now? Really dn understand you girls at all man.

There was also a couple of them who just saw me as their respite when their (later) relationships got bitter (I asked them out when they were single) and a few months later, got back with their ex. Some of the girls whom i was close to, i even knew their parents and they were talking to me about marriage and so on but little did they know, their daughter and i were never even official. And other girls whom i was close to, i was their "plus-one" whenever they had an event to attend to (like their friend's wedding or dinner nights for work). But, never once i had an "attached to a girl" status on me.

Im really ready to settle for one as i hopefully embark on FYP next sem or graduate for work. And as VDay is approaching, i'm still evergreen (would you even count this as evergreen?) after years of dating. But i do have close female friends who wouldn't say no for dates. But i really just see them as my 姐姐 and have no romantic feelings for them. 

So tell me, what am i doing wrong to those girls whom i see i wanna have a future with? How do i close the deal with you girls anyways? I never get pass the dating stage with y'all :/

So I've met this guy through Tinder last month. After meeting, we still do text quite frequently, but have not met up ever since. Does this mean that he's interested in me or is just treating me as a friend? 

- confused girl
-
 
To the girl of , I can totally relate to wat you are saying. I had a relationship exactly like you want yours to be. Initially I was a not very confident guy and didn't know how to approach girls. I met a girl I really like and she knew the fact that I cannot approach girls very easily and this is what attracted her the most. I asked her why , she said It makes me more trustworthy and value her more as an individual and not as an entity if things do not work out, I have plenty more available outside which was true. So this made me more confident about our relationship at the end coz I was sure she loves me for who I am n aware of my weakness so I don't have to pretend anything :) Go ahead girl and I hope you find the guy you are looking for. 
-
 
Dear guys who are looking to ask girls out for V day.. Do try not to be wishy washy about it. I've had guys hinting and asking in a teasing manner/ asking to meet and not following up.. It is not that I am being fussy, but sincerity will go a long way.. =)
-
 
My cousin is no longer with her boyfriend and she's no longer Facebook friend with him. Should I unfriend him too? #socialmediaproblems
-
 
If a guy doesnt reply to your texts readily, does it mean he is not that interested after all?

This is really confusing because all his other actions seem to prove otherwise :/ but he just doesn't seem to care about replying texts and it is getting really hard to communicate because we don't see each other everyday.

I'm confused.

I think one of the frequent commenters on here is quite attractive but my friend said he's in a complicated relationship relationship and i shouldn't approach him. I don't know if her information is accurate. What should I do?

A guy asked me out for valentine's day dinner. I don't particularly like him, but I don't hate to be around him either, I'm willing to try out dating him, but valentine's day date seems too official. I need some advice guys.

I genuinely feel that I am ugly. I won't even look at myself in the mirror in the toilet. I would look down and wash my hands and get out ASAP. No matter how some of my friends said I am cute I still feel that I am ugly. I don't think I have self-esteem issue because I would think I am quite confident and can hold conversation with other people. 

Anyone else has this problem?
-
 
 Yeah! I got a friend who did that to me too. I just take it that he is not interested in me and ignoring his further attempts to get close to me romantically. He is probably really not interested.

Hi I am a 22 yrs old male getting some legit advice over here.

I have been dealing with acne ever since primary 5 and suffer pretty bad acne throughout my life. Now at the age of 22, I dont get regular pop ups anymore and dont really get new pimple too. However, having suffered from it for 10yrs, theres still those leftover scars on my face.

Would like to ask if anyone knows of any good dermatologist fo recommend and the rough costs as well. Planning to seek treatment and end the battle once and for all!

 What if I'm in the male position (I think, I can never be sure) and I think I've got an answer already but she ain't responding? I've been thinking a lot about her of late, and looking at myself, I think I'm really afraid to lose her for good. And I think it's more than just being afraid of leaving regrets behind or consciously knowing that I've probably never find someone like her again. Advice?

Vday is coming soon. My relatives asked the same old question again: "When you showing us your girl girl?"

I came across your post randomly on Instagram some days back. You were holding a sunflower & that's like the cutest face i've ever seen. I suppose you're the wrapper? 

Saw that you tagged @2016Pledgetolove, i think that's the campaign you're involved in? Somehow this 'pledge to love' struck me. 

I've decided that this year, my vday will be different. I'm not gonna camp in my room & date Dota anymore, not like what i've been doing for the past 22 years. 

I'm gonna get your flowers & i hope i will see you when i collect them. 

If i do see you, i'll definitely post about this in your campaign, add & tag you. Hope you will still remember me by then... Wish me luck guys!

Every CNY is emo-sessions for me for the past several years. I always barely say anything. My parents, aunts and uncles are getting older, and don't look healthy. Yeah, even on normal days I don't say anything, don't do anything...yet I'm afraid that they will go suddenly without me saying anything to them..I am a very big dumbass.
-
 
Hey OP , I understand how you feel because I'm in a similar situation. It sucks, especially if you are carrying the burden on your own. You need to know you are not alone and to share it with someone. If you need, we can talk over email (we can make new email accounts). Hang in there.
-
 
Dear OP, I went through a similar situation. We found out my dad was having an affair too. I honestly when ballistic when I found out. It was hard but ignoring your dad is really not the way to go. You need to think about your siblings and most importantly yourself. Spending money unnecessarily was what my Dad would do even before we found out about the affair. I'm not sure how your relationship was with your dad prior to you finding out nor how your relationship was between your parents. Not saying is your fault either but people go astray when they do not feel welcomed at home. This is what happened in my case. I don't think I would ever be able to forgive him completely but it's what you need to do. You ignoring him makes him feel useless. Why should he be left to do nothing especially after what he did right? Talk to him again. Tell him that you have forgiven him. I know its going to be hard but if you want things to be better you need to make him feel like he has a place in this family. He needs to know he has responsibilities as a father. Make him feel useful again. Ignoring him is letting him get off the hook for what he did. And for what he did, he should come back as a better father.  You need him financially. Your mother does not have to go through this alone. This worked for us and I'm hoping it would for you. If you see no change in your dad's behaviour please please speak to a counsellor. It would greatly help.

@16284 speaking of pointless friendships, i met this girl who pretended to be friendly just to score an ebook copy of the course textbook. After i sent it to her, she pretended that i did not exist.

I feel kind of sad that my relationship ended, cauz my (now ex) boyfriend thought i cheated and cheat on me???

during christmas, I went out with an attached guy friend just to hang out abit, and for me to pursuade him to become groupmates for this semester project. I told my ex bf about it when he texted he just returned to sg. So my friend and me went home our ways after dinner. I wanted to tell my ex bf but i thought i shouldnt disturb his sleep since he probably is tired from the long flight. Then I forgotten about it. After that day, my ex went cold towards me for many days. Then I saw him posted an intimate photo with another girl and when i asked him about it, he just blocked me??? /: I am wondering is it because of what he thought I did? Should I explain? Or does it not matter anymore.. that girl was not even from NUS which I dk where he met her from. Maybe tinder. But it hurts still ):

Did you ever just come to this sudden realisation that your friendship is pretty much pointless? That you were just used all this while and nothing was ever reciprocated. Not that every favour had to be returned.But it would have felt good to be appreciated once in a while... I just woke up one day, having absolute no desire to sustain this friendship. I was always there for them but they were never there for me. My passive aggressive nature didn't quite aid me in this situation either. I never knew how to tell them how I felt. I was so afraid of coming off as sensitive and weak. Hence it resulted in continuous ignoring on my part. Ignoring calls, texts, SM notifications until they finally gave up. Oh and did I mention that these texts and calls were them requiring some sort of 'assistance' from me? To make things worse, I haven't made friends in Uni either. It took me quite a while to recover. I still have no friends. Zero friends to be exact. I was lonely for a while. But now I'm just alone. There's a huge difference! Being lonely gave me a chance to embrace solitude, which is being alone. It's a chance for you to examine who you really are. A chance for you to work on yourself. Feeding off other people's energy most of the time leaves you with so little time to reflect on your wants. I'm not telling everyone to cut off ties nor am I saying there's anything wrong with being an extrovert! Nothing wrong with socialising either. If you have great friends, treasure them! And if you need people around you most of the time, that's completely fine too! I know it doesn't relate to my situation, but it really upsets me to see those 'I'm so lonely posts', especially when V day is nearing. Take this time to work on yourself. Learn from past relationships and embrace this time you have for yourself! As cliché as it sounds, you do need to love yourself before you want to love someone else. And these posts just show that you don't. Stop dwelling in self pity. It got me no where. It hurts but you have to move on. Good luck! There's nothing wrong with being alone!

How to tell if a girl likes you also? Was thinking of expressing my interest in her soon but am unsure if it is mutual. Pls guide

I miss this senior. He just graduated recently. Back when I was a freshie, he was in the engineering oweek committee. In the past, I always have this big smile when I bumped into him in school. Same faculty but different course, somehow we kept bumping into each other. He's a really nice dude and he always have the excited look when he sees me. I think he was interested in me, not sure about now though. How I wish I get to see him again, but he's probably working already.

Been with my boyfriend for 6 months, everything is going smoothly but i cant seem to get rid of the insecurity/fear that he'll get tired of me soon. He hasnt done anything to make me feel that way but i just do :( perhaps it's because of my previous relationships. talked to him about it but there's nothing he can do to make me feel better :( doesnt help that we both have many friends who just recently broke up with their S/O of 2-3 years :/ any advice on how to get over this nagging insecurity? 
-
 
As a woman, I'm much more receptive to a nervous man asking me out than a confident one. To my mind, nervousness is strongly correlated to genuinity (that's just how my own emotion work). I've become desensitized to all those smooth taking players who are able to confidently approach a woman and ask her out. If asking me out is that easy, it means he feels he has nothing to lose (i.e. getting to know me isn't worth much, likely because his relationship strategies rely on quantity rather than quality). If I'm going to invest my time into a potential relationship, I want to feel like I'm valued and not just any of the dozens of other women he has approached that night. That said, once that initial connection has been made, confidence is incredibly sexy and I wouldn't want my man to be nervous about me. Thoughts?

Been using tinder for a few weeks now and I have this conundrum. Currently I'm chatting with two girls whom I feel have potential, like the chemistry is good and the vibes are good. Girl A has a very similar personality as myself, while Girl B has a different personality but we share so many common interests that it's really uncanny. I'm probably thinking too far ahead, but if there came I a time I had to choose one to date exclusively, which girl would be the better choice? I know it's unfair to label one as "better", but I can't think of a more appropriate word. Just looking for some friendly opinions here :)

PS. Assuming the signals from both were positive and I did eventually choose one, is it bad that I have to let one down? As though I led her on. Because I'd feel bad about that.

In a relationship with boyfriend for a few years, but the sparks are gone. Tried to revive but I'm not sure if it worked. I guess he got sick and tired of me and there's lesser communication with each passing day. Not in any mood for CNY..

This will be the first valentine's day in years that I'm spending it alone (just got off a long relationship). I've since moved on but just feels kinda weird.

Hey there. My boyfriend is bipolar. We've been together for close to 4 years now. We've tried everything, therapy, medicines etc. and nothing seems to work. Medically, he's getting all the help that he needs and he's financially capable of doing so. But how can I be better able to cater to his needs? This year, it's taken a turn for the worse. I can see it in his aura, he's more despondent than usual and saying things someone who's expecting to die would tell you i.e. when he starts asking me for forgiveness, complimenting me on how much we have achieved together. It's nice, but strange. I really care about him but he won't let me marry him because he can't provide a normal family life for me but I love him nonetheless. Are there any psychology majors out there who study about bipolarism/manic depressive and can give me a few pointers and/or advice about how to help and support him through his condition? Thanks in advance.

 Dude, get a life. Whatever you do, being a "smart genius", observing people, guessing others' thoughts "accurately", anyone else can do it, if we pay enough attention. There is no pride (if you've got a spine, you'ld know what this is) in doing things that can hurt others for your "enjoyment".

If you have enough time to sit here, and make your posts that expose your thoughts and identity, surely you have the time to do something else, gain some intelligence and have enough empathy, (as a year 4 University student), not to make light of others' situations and thoughts.

Looking at , Sometime, somewhere else, there are also people such ass myself, in another "secret lab", who are Year 4, who have aliases, whose identity, if we post, are pretty damned obvious, to those who know us better, but not well enough to know that we do not do the things that you "do". (Aye, pretty damned obvious who I am, right, gentlemen?)

You're not weird. You're not a dick. You're just someone whose time could be better spent, doing something less petty than this.

 Because there is a difference between outright rejection versus not giving a definite answer? Don't some girls sometimes do this too? Instead of outright rejection, she may say that she wants to know the guy more first. From what you're saying it seems to me that the guy wants to date w/o having given you a definite answer and w/o wanting to enter a r/s with you proper. I think it depends on the guy (as different persons have different mindsets when it comes to dating and entering a r/s) and you need to question his motive. Here are some possible reasons I can come up with: he thinks that he doesn't have feelings for you or is unsure of them at the moment, yet sees you as a potential partner; he isn't ready for a r/s due to psychological or whatever other reasons; he wants to lead you on; he doesn't mind dating anyone or getting to know someone more as the opposite party might eventually be his future partner; he is looking for benefits while wanting to avoid responsibilities and commitments (as in a r/s).

Here's what I would do if I were you. First, I would get a clear answer and explanation (w/o misunderstandings) of 1. how he really feels for you right now and 2. why does he want to date you, followed by asking myself if I can trust his answer. Finally, I will think if I really should date him given my own mindset and what I think I know to be true thus far.

- from a very simple guy :)

People often say that: girl u should confess. There can only be 2 outcomes: 1) he accepts, happily ever after. 2) he rejects, u get closure and move on. 

But what if.. He doesn't reject, but doesn't accepts either? He considers giving it a try together. He leaves you hanging. When asked, he says that he's not rejecting you. 

I think it's very selfish of the guy, to give the girl a glimmer of hope and make her wait for him. Isn't it better to just tell the girl u are not interested at the get go? I don't understand. 

People say that rejection is better than uncertainty. But in this case, confessing results in uncertainty; remaining quiet results in uncertainty too. 

Maybe he is just afraid to reject out front, and him leaving the girl hanging is a kind of rejection it self? I thought guys were simple creatures :/

@ I, too, face the same dilemma and dread during Hari Raya. Just have to put on a fake smile and eat my heart out. Thank goodness for smartphones to distract me. Always feel drained at the end of the day but the good news is, no matter how bad it is, it will pass. Hang in there, at least we have an escape route in our near future when we grow up and get our own family

 Only do things you don't mind doing? So for instance, if you don't like doing something yet don't mind doing it, go ahead. But otherwise, don't? That's how I think everyone ought to live their lives if they are to be worth living. I would suggest to go on study dates like once a week or something if that's ok with you. :) Reasons being:
1 - Who the hell doesn't study? o-O
2 - To get to really know someone, there definitely needs to be some time for talk and you can do that during meal(s) or after study/meal(s). For the latter, talk is after productive work has already been done and when both parties already don't feel like doing any more work. They can then both focus on the talk without being distracted (e.g. I should be doing work right now).
3 - Lines are less clearly drawn when you go on a study date with a person v.s. say, going to catch a movie with him if the former is what is more appropriate for both of you at this point.
4 - Maybe he hates texting in general as well (e.g. texts freaking slow, impersonal, distracting etc.). I think there is also a tendency for parties to want to be perceived as attractive/interesting over text and that's taxing for the mind when you or him has to come up with jokes etc.
5 - Plan is extremely simple and there are only two things to consider, time and place (guys will probably get slammed for this but that doesn't matter in your case I think).

If you are here scrolling through NUSWhispers, you might want to reach out to your aunt and ask her how's she coping with work, to your cousin and ask him or her how's school, or to your grandparents and tell them you love them before you never get a chance to do so ever again. Alright time for me to do so. Tata smell ya later

Seeing all these posts about Valentine's day, crushes and relationships make me sad. I have never had a crush on anyone but I do feel a momentary attraction if someone does an exceptionally kind thing or knows about eccentric things. I am pretty certain no one has ever had a crush on me either. Sometimes, I fear that the status quo will be the same forever and I will never love romantically. :(

Some people should really know when to draw the line. There's no point dragging on and dwelling on the same topic when the others are not willing to comment on it or even talk about it, because it's getting on their nerves and they are trying hard not to get angry. There is a reason they don't want to speak about it, and if you don't know, keep quiet. Know how to sense when is the right time to say and when is it not the right time to say. Because, I quote from a chinese saying, 你不说话没人当你是哑巴。

I really want to be an anime character, specifically like in those cute anime like Ponyo and My Neighbour Totoro. Firstly because then I will be kawaii... but no mainly because my ideal life would be that simple. Playing with my human friends and wood spirit friends everyday and in fact everyone are friends. There would be no backstabbing and deceit to reach the A on the bell curve. (This kind of thing happens more often than professors think seriously most students are no angels and professors should be more wise and ensure that there is no way that students can cheat.) Heck there is even competition among getting that guy/girl and who can get attached first. I think the hate and jealousy I've been seeing from some friends from not getting a particular someone should stop because I believe then there will be someone who fits you better. I don't think its about being good enough but couples should just fit each other. Its about the good fit not about competition ok... Why is everything a test? It can be a good thing by making society more productive but I think there is a lot of harm in it too.
 
When people instead strive to be altruistic and for example go for ocips and post photos of themselves with the overseas kids they get bashed by society for having hidden intentions and being selfish and egoistic. Look I know some of those who do go for ocips and they don't have such intentions, some are unaware of whatever negative consequences ocips have, some just do not think so much and view it as a self-enriching adventure, some really do it just for resume of course but some really do have a heart and want to contribute but they just do not know it is not really an effective way. When people get bashed for having good intentions I want to give up. I thought we should be encouraging such behavior? Instead we are encouraging people who post photos because they are good-looking or what.

I am in a rather technical major where we are really just chasing big bucks. I just chose it because its practical but I am the kind who would rather study something more meaningful. Honestly I would rather work in healthcare, specifically to work for medical breakthroughs. However, I am not clever enough to get into such research or medical school.

Anyway back to my main point, sometimes I think I am too gentle and weird for this world. On the other hand I guess most people nowadays will just find me negative, unambitious and lazy if I reveal my true desires. Maybe some of us are like this too but they just became more successfully conditioned to be competitive and thrive in this world.

I graduated last year. I did well in school. But I've not been able to find a job. I fell into depression right after I graduated. For months, I didn't feel like I was myself. I thought often about suicide. I couldn't function - at least, not as well as in the past. Between the time I graduated and now, I did go for a handful of interviews but I never got any callbacks. I also got myself into a treatment plan at the hospital and I'm much better now than I was last year. 

Although my parents are aware that I'm in treatment since they're the ones paying for it, they seem to think that I'm not depressed. That I'm just wasting their money and my youth. They've been pressurising me to get a job. I admit I haven't been active in my job search in the time before treatment and during, but I'm trying now. They don't seem to understand that I am trying. 

I feel like a failure all the time. I worked hard in school. I graduated with a second upper. Now I'm lagging almost a year behind everyone else in my cohort. They're all doing so well in their fancy jobs. Jobs I dreamed of having back when I was an undergrad. And what am I going to say to my future employers when they ask me about the gap in my resume at the interview? 

I want to keep my diagnosis private and don't want to disclose it to them.... but I don't know what I can say when they inquire because I haven't done much in that time... Just thinking about a job and going for interviews stresses me out... there are days when I wish I wasn't so screwed up in my head... there are nights when I think I've failed and fucked up my life and it becomes so overwhelming... I'm sorry for the wall of text... but I feel so fucked up right now... P.S. I'm a guy if it matters...

Hi guys! My boyfriend and I are each other's first love. However, i have slept with 2 other guys before (my dates, i was young and foolish) whereas he has not. We love each other very much but i worry that he will be curious to "try out" what it feels like with other girls etc. Any advice on this??

Sigh, most people are quite happy with the arrival of Chinese New Year. Able to see their relatives, receive angbao etc etc. My family haven't been spending CNY together for years till I lost count. Usually my wheelchair bound father just go solo to his relatives' side and same goes for my mother. I always dread deciding which side should I follow when they asked me. I feel super bad to make my dad to travel by himself, but at the same time my mum will rage like hellfire when I followed him.  I dread even more when relatives asked how's my family situation. I rather not receive any angbaos to avoid meeting them. Everyday, there will be quarrels at home. So tired of living this shit. Anybody have a similar situation and managed to overcome/alleviate it?
-
 
My crush's birthday is coming up (just after CNY). I dont know if i should get her something, or just send a text to wish her happy bday. I do want to get her something nice for her, but i dont really know what she likes. Both of us are a bit close, but also not that close. We do talk to each other like once a week or so during lecture. So how ah? Any advice? Or maybe ask her out on v-day plus bday celebration as well? 
-
 
I just found out that my close friend and I are crushing on the same guy...What should I do? (She doesn't know he's my crush and I feel a little guilty for pursuing him now) :/

-
 
I am the worst at texting. I literally do not know how to carry on a conversation using text, even if it's someone I like a lot. And I hate using text to know someone because it's so impersonal. Can anyone give advice on what to text people? I'm sort of scared that I'm giving guys the impression that I'm not interested.

Luckily Valentine's Day is on a Sunday this year, lower chance of feeling sad from seeing all the happy couples.

Any girl interested in going out with me on vday itself next week? Just catch a movie n dinner is fine. I will make it worth your time

I am a Year 4 and sometimes I enjoy posting here with another alias/as another person. I make the posts so obvious such that everyone around me knows who is "me" and what "I" am actually thinking. I derive joy from doing such things: exposing what I think others are thinking (e.g. confessing on the person's behalf ). I am a smart genius who can almost always guess others' thoughts accurately. I enjoy making observation of the victim thereafter. Am I a dick or am I weird?

Most of the post complaining about being evergreen are from guys. If most girls can live with being evergreen and being happy at the same time, why cant guys do that? Why are guys so desperate?

Would like to know how many of you out there have dated someone of a different religion as you and have married happily? Currently dating a muslim but having lots of disagreement from my side :(
-
 
I don't like friends who rant on others. Just because you are angry, doesn't mean that you can just say mean things. Who knows you were angry? Who knows you would be insulted by what we said? If you are really pissed, keep quiet. Because we are not the ones that made you angry. 
-
 
For some reason guys only seem to notice me when I'm attached. This has happened at least 3 times already. When I'm single, not one guy seems to want to woo me. But when I get attached, suddenly some other guy will decide they like me and confess to me. Like what am I supposed to do about that? I'm sorry that you're sad that I'm attached, but I can't do anything about it! 

Like seriously, if I was single, I'd probably accept any guy that bothers to chase and confess to me, just because no one has bothered putting the effort before. (In all my relationships I'm the one doing the chasing and confessing)
-
 
Girls, tell us what turns you off when a guy ask you out for a date. Like being too direct, being wishy-washy, or getting others to ask you out. Will help if you can give examples.
-
 
Vday is coming soon and I really want to ask this girl out for the first time. I'm not afraid of a rejection; I'm only afraid of the awkwardness after rejection. We're in the same clique and we'll definitely see each other again. Gosh! I don't think this is gonna work out. It only takes 5s to send a text but after 5 days I still can't decide if I should do it.
-
 
Why do people use the "confess" to tell someone they like them? The word has such negative connotations, you know? You confess to a crime or something, not that you really like a person, as if it's a bad thing
-
 
Is there such a thing as not loving someone romantically, but still wanting to put in effort to ensure that he/she is happy, kinda like a guardian angel?

Well, I feel like I have such a guardian angel (& yep I like this person romantically & this person knows though doesn't reciprocate), yet I don't know if whatever this person does is just what normal friends do... 

This person is really very nice to me. I just want to say, thank you for everything. During the important/tough times in my life, you were always there. Thank you for appearing whenever I ask. Thank you for being such a nice companion. 

Though I know this will not last forever, but thank you for still protecting my heart for now, whether you mean to or not. 
-
 
There's a guy who's interested in having a relationship with me but I've only known him for 2 weeks... He's obnoxious and cynical majority of the time which I cannot tahan anymore...plus he's always negatively criticising my guy friends (I don't know why) So how do I subtly suggest to him that I'm not interested without offending him?  My mind is in a muddle because I like another guy who's absolutely charming and witty but I feel like the obnoxious guy is a burden which I can't shake off.

Assuming you are a guy. How do you ask your female friends to introduce their single girl friends to you without any awkwardness?

 There we go again. I'm again being totalised as a "SPG" for no reason other than the fact that I've dated or am dating a white guy. Like I said, I find people attractive based on their looks, charisma, personality etc. You don't know me nor my history. Most of the people I've dated aren't even White. Let's just not start hating on people without fully understanding them or their histories. I can't possibly know if there are other girls out there who exclusively date people simply because of the colour of their skin. Sometimes you have to acknowledge the confluence of multiple factors that leads to attraction. 

That being said. I've come across a number of Asian guys whom I thought had potential but just never had the confidence to ask me out. Worse still, I have gone out on dates with some Asian guys and it never actually went anywhere after that. Call me old fashioned, but I like my men to be confident and proactive. And oh my god, the worst is when they get intimidated by my dating history. Clearly I'm not the traditional domicile woman you want me to be, and it's never going to work out. Lastly one or two guys get a little insecure about the size of their manhood, especially if they find out I've slept with white guys. Here's a secret, not all white men are as big as you think they'd be. And the converse is true about Asian men as well. We don't really care about the size of your manhood, as long as it gets us to the finish line. Work on your confidence boys. I can safely say the best sex I've had was with an Asian guy. Okay, now cue all the slut-shaming comments.

Life in Mono, although supposedly a romantic song, tends to make me feel more nihilistic and look at life in a more monotonous and absurd way. Or I suppose I read too much existentialism, heh...
-
 
 What?!? Is it because guys like the challenge and would see the female as more precious/valuable? Are these claims even justified? Even if that is true, what if the guy is a serious weirdo like myself and is an anomaly?

I think not wanting him back only makes him reflect. Same for girls likewise. I think there needs to be at least some minimal interaction yet not total interaction to get him attracted (if he can even be attracted to you) but at the same time not let him be too comfortable to stop reflecting or take you for granted. For instance, sitting in front of him and turning to show him your side profile etc. If there's not even any interaction i.e. doesn't even see you in person, doesn't chat and if he's too engaged in his commitments, I think he's a goner over time. :'(

often I wish that my crush has a girlfriend so I can stop thinking about him and get on with my life >< like pls pls have a girlfriend, you're good-looking, nice with good grades and all #valentineiscoming

To the op of the girl trying to get a valentines gift for a guy: Dont be stressed about it! Its the thought that counts. I'm pretty sure he will appreciate whatever you give him.

Just a reminder to everyone, just because he/she agrees to go out with you on Vday, doesn't that he/she is interested in you. I have friends who will go out with anyone to avoid spending Vday alone.

Need some advice here. I recently broke up my ex but we still have feelings for each other. We broke up due to certain reasons that is too long to explain. Since we still like each other should I ask her out on V day? We may have broken up but I still think she is the one for me and I haven't given up hope.
-
 
 The right girl will not come if you don't know how to woo girls....

Valentine's Day coming, and I'm thinking of having my first sex with my girlfriend. However, my past sex experiences were with prostitutes. I'm afraid that I'll treat her like one. And even tip her lol. I'm struggling if I should confess to her, but at the same time fear I'll lose her. Sigh.
-
 
Recently, one of my female friends did not end up with the guy she liked after getting to know each other better. It was a pity that it didn't work out due to many little reasons. But that's not the point...
So now she is single and available once again.. I must admit that there was a period of time that I had feelings for her due to how close I was with her. I am thinking whether I should try to rekindle my feelings for her by talking to her again...
(Have not been talking to her as often as last time)

-Confused guy who currently has mixed feelings for 3 girls

He is almost perfect in every way and I know we both have good feelings for each other - but somehow when we have conversations he will mention his other female friends and compliment them in some ways and it makes me a little jealous. Is he doing this intentionally and is it normal for me to feel this way? Is this healthy? 
-
 
Most of my guy friends are quite respectful and if they accidentally bump into me they will apologise and ask if I mind physical contact. Even if I say it's okay, they still take care not to accidentally touch me because they know I don't like it. But why does that one person not get that it's not okay to randomly grab a girl's arm, or aggressively touch her in any way for that matter? We're not dating, I have never initiated physical contact, and it obviously discomforts me. Maybe because I don't react the same way with my female friends he thinks it's okay? Now when I see him I feel like running away but I feel bad also. What can I do? Please don't say confront him because confrontation is the last thing I would do.
-
 
My friends are unaware that most of my "what if" questions are actually for real! But I like it that way as that means I can continue asking.
-
 
What does it mean when a guy confessed to you and said that he likes you but takes no further action?  Not even to ask for my feeling to him..

My friends view me as a social butterfly, sporty and an outgoing girl who looks out for others. However, I am actually diagnosed with egomania and megalomania. My facade is used to gain trust from others, when in fact I don't really give a F about anyone. I am simply waiting to make use of them when I want to.

It was in secondary school when my obsessive streak started. As I was growing up, I started to find my identity. I have to be a winner and I don't see myself anything lesser than that. It was probably due to the bad influence of my parents. They were failures in life, but they always had high expectations of themselves and others, which resulted in the whole family's misery. At the time, I tried to lower my expectations and told myself that everything will be fine as long as I do my best. Instead, my parents started to belittle me and said very hurtful things to damage my self-esteem. From then on, I convinced myself I have to be better than others no matter what. And this conviction couldn't stop, because it just feels amazing to fantasize I was better than others. And it allows things to work out great as well. It was a short-term gratification though.

So what's my definition of being perfect? Surely there's always someone who is better than me right? To be honest, I have no idea. It just depends on how I was feeling at the moment. But the baseline is simple; I must dominate whosoever I feel like challenging, and ignore those who are not worth it. Even if you beat me to a battle today, I will let you celebrate your small victory. However I plan and look forward to the day when I beat you in ten battles and secretly gloat about it :P

While you may think I am merely an evil bitch with a psuedo mental condition, allow me to appeal to your humanity by stating that I have been seeking professional therapy occasionally to prevent myself from crossing the line, such as killing someone which I dream about sometimes. My actions are very extreme but I control myself to execute them without landing myself in jail. I recall an incident of stealing a schoolmate's phone and throwing it away during the O Levels to demoralize him because that guy is always an outstanding but rude student and I disliked him. It was quite satisfying to see him cry on the day results were released. He did well, but he was still disappointed. And I did better. I felt both happy and unhappy at the same time. I was happy because my plan worked, but I was unhappy because I missed the opportunity to get back on a whole list of people using the same strategy. Lame huh?

As I got older, I became more aware of my actions. Sometimes I feel a little guilty for my wrongdoings, but if I apologize to those I have surreptitiously harmed, I will be shooting myself in the face. Rest assure, I am making a conscious effort to make myself a better person by addressing my obsessive behavior. I just hope people can be more forgiving, don't judge me and learn to understand and help me if they know the real me. I thank you for reading this because I spent my precious time on Sunday trying to get this load off my chest. Happy Lunar New Year :D

That ambivert feel when your energy level starts depleting when you're out with friends, so you leave to recharge at home... only for you to start craving attention again hours later or risk a night of depression...
-
 
One way to get someone is to not want them back. Some people fall in love with people they can't get. You just have to get them when the time is right. Also it buys time for you to be sure that they know what they want. ;)

I kinda love how in Singapore, Chinese New Year is always before Valentine's Day. Because if it weren't, people will be starting to talk about V-day way before and through this festive period! Being a 25 years old forever single guy, could you imagine the horror if that were to happen? Your mood will be sour for more than 2 weeks! Your eyes will probably roll out of their sockets after seeing so many couples being all disgustingly lovey-dovey up until the dreaded V-day, and will probably puke out a couple of buckets more from all the additional disgusting energy you will feel without the CNY buffer.

It's a week away, but once again, for the 26th time, I'll be spending Valentines Day alone. My cockster friend said he'd line something up for me, and so gave me a packet of red dates today, saying now i have a bunch of sweet dates. nabei haha 
The thing about being evergreen even when you don't wanna be is that, it's like the world is telling you aren't wanted, or you aren't good enough. Until proven otherwise, you'll never be anyone's first priority, and physical contact is.... a rare commodity. And as much as you wanna distract yourself, playing games or simply disconnecting, you know at the back of your mind, people out there are getting together, celebrating. The world spins on in its joyous splendour as you fade quietly into the background, and you feel your loneliness and meagerness as actual, physical pain. 
To all those suffering as I am, it isn't much, but know that you aren't alone. And even as I struggle to keep my hopes alit (it dims frightfully as time runs its course), I'll hope for yours to be fulfilled. Let's soldier on.

To the "evergreen" guys... Don't feel bad. I know a few of them and they're really gems. Some of them just don't know how to woo girls. There's no shame in that. The right one will come along soon.

My birthday is around the corner!
For me, I just want my birthday to be meaningful! I rather have letters & cards packed full of words dedicated to me than an LV bag... Haha.

Also, I would love to spend time with people I really care about... (And whether they feel the same is another matter). Yet, I feel that if it becomes a burden to them & they are doing it out of obligation & guilt... I rather not impose it on them (though I will be sad of course). Anyone feels the same?

hey . When i first met the girl  i like during cca competition, she gave me a death stare when she caught me looking at her. It was my first time meeting her. A few years on i asked her what she thought of he when she first saw me, she said i looked cute (yay) but sadly we still are not together due to super deficiency in common interest, family background and thought process. She did give me one or two chances before but sadly i failed terribly at it (sighs). 

However, i'm glad to say that wea re still close friends and i've not given up yet. Effort is extremely important, act normal and treat her as a friend at first and just be cheerful around her!
-
 
I smile a little whenever I hear some couple have sex in the middle of the night down my corridor in the hall I live in. Not because I'm a pervert or anything, but because I'm happy that they are getting pleasure and enjoying themselves with someone they love or is at the very least physically attracted to. 

But it is a sad kind of smile at the same time, because hearing such things just reminds me more of my singlehood. I guess you could call me someone who seeks vicarious gratification through the enjoyment of others. With Valentines' Day coming up, once again I'll wonder where is my happy ending, if it even exists at all.

 To you and all the closet SPGs. You might think you're very smart for trying to trick all the stupid single chinese males that your actions are okay by saying "OH it's only the insecure ones who are making noise", and the "hot ones are totally okay with it". First off, how would you even know that? You presume to know what everyone is thinking or talking about? 

The fact is, and all guys know this, guys almost always don't talk about girls in front of girls. Within their own circle, guys do talk. As do girls. And trust me when I say, it doesn't matter if the guy is single/attached/hot/brilliant/smart/whatever, there are scores of singaporean guys who have a vehement dislike for SPGs. It isn't because we are "jealous" or "insecure", it's simply because girls like you behave in such a cheap and wanton manner that it's disgusting and disgraceful for the entire community/country as a whole, get it? 

My caucasian friends from exchange tell me that they are plenty surprised that the girls here are so "cheap". Their words, not mine.. As to why they don't say it to your face.. are you that daft?
-
 
I'm not sure if you've misunderstood what I said so I guess it's best to clarify and I think you read NUSWhispers. When I said that I want to hang out with you, I meant strictly no physical intimacy or contact. It has always been that case since the first day I asked you out. I'm not sure how others and you see me but I'm not that kind of person. Part of me just want to find my feelings back for you. I'm selfish in that way, not in others. Regardless, hope you eventually find what you want and thanks for the memories. :>

Can anyone teach me how to woo a girl that I barely know? 

A little background: I see her about once a week or fortnight during cca, but during and after I got no chance to talk to her and get to know her much. I haven't talked to her before because I am quite shy and introverted, but she seems to be a shy girl also, doesn't really talk much or interact much with people, similar to me. She seems happy when she talks to someone she knows well however. Sometimes she will glance at me, and will avert her gaze when I catch her doing so. Does this mean anything?

I am a dating newbie here never dated before. Tried to ask out and chase a friend of mine before but got shot down and burnt quite badly. So I am kinda having very low confidence around girls now :(

Any advice will be welcome

 A year ago, I was wondering about the exact same things as you are right now. I was in the exact same place as you are. So it may seem as though this is a generic advice, but it's just what I went through from the exact same situation. 

I did go out with her on V-Day for the first time. It was a day of intimacy for us (emotionally, not physically). I thought it meant something, and it could grow into something special. It didn't. 

Just want to let you know that asking out on V-Day may not be as special as you think. If you're asking her out for the first time, V-Day just provides an excuse for you to do so. What matters is what happens after V-Day. Not that it's all on you, but the reciprocation you get on V-Day may not last as long. 

Watch out for signs afterwards, and be a bit mindful. It mayyy not be as positive as it would be on V-Day. 

And yes, your efforts do not stop at V-Day date. If the first date is extra special, keep in mind to maintain the effort level afterwards. 

Anyway, this is what I went through. I do hope that you have a positive experience! Good luck :)

I am sorry I liked you but I couldn't help but to fall for your ways. Is it all over now? Thank you the times we spent together - I won't forget it. You were different from the rest. When I saw you, my heart beat faster, occasionally, it even skipped a beat. You were the first one that was on my mind constantly, the first one who I had an urge to see constantly, the first one that I wanted to see constantly, the first one that I wanted to rush to see, the first of my everything. But, you lied - whether it be a white lie, small discrepancies, lies are still lies and intolerable for me. I will be letting you go now even though it means my heart will ache but I will get over you - I will. The precious memories, I will treasure it. Thanks to you, I thought that things could be different. Thanks to you, I wanted to improve myself and strive for better things so that I could be compatible to you. But, moral values are important to me and I do not accept lies. The precious memories, precious times we spent together, I will treasure it. Thank you, my first. Goodbye, my first.

Hi all. Any tips for being less insecure? I've been with my boy grin for slightly less than a year but I don't feel a sense of emotional security after all these time. It doesn't help that I was badly treated in my previous relationship and sometimes my current Boyfriend stalks girls on Instagram/Facebook. while j know there's nothing wrong with that I just can't help but feel insecure. Any advice?

Can extroverted people feel tired too? I am generally quite a sociable person and have quite a few groups of friends and they meet up quite regularly. I'm not one of the most active people in all the cliques but am involved to a certain extent.. And whenever they meet up I feel obliged to go, rather than interested to meet up. 

On the surface I look fine when I'm out with them, but in reality I just want to spend time at home, spend time alone pursuing my own interests.. Also, as a student my expenditure is quite restricted to my savings and odd jobs every now and then. How do people afford to meet up so much? :( I feel bad whenever I decline, and the awkwardness of declining or saying I cannot make it makes me not want to talk to them at all.. 

Guess I'm not so much of an extrovert after all?

I've been with my boyfriend for less than a year so this is going to be our first valentines day together. I was hoping that he will bring me out on a special date on vday but he told me he doesnt see why vday should be special :( he does bring me out quite often and he treats me well but i do want vday to be special. i tried to tell him i like the idea of vday but now i scared i sound like a silly girl in love so i stopped hinting to him that i want to do something special with him this year. Am i too silly or is he too realistic and practical?

With the modern 21st century that we are living in, it makes me wonder if I can really find somone who loves me, but not someone who claims to love me and expecting sex to be a "bonus" in a relationship. I always believe that Sex and Love and not synonymous. He can have sex with me,but he does not necessarily loves me. 

This happened between me and my ex. He probably treated me as a ready source of sex supply as long as we are in a "relationship", which seems fine and "morally right" (subjective depending on your values). It seems that sex triumph over a real emotional relationship. Sure, we can have sex. But does he understand me? The answer is no. Do I understand him? The answer will also be a no. This is sad but yet a harsh truth thrown onto me. 

Girls ask your SO this "If I have decided that we should stop having sex now till we are getting married, will you still stay with me?" With no sex element involves, will he still stays? If yes, then you are definitely in a right one where love triumphs over sex. If no, you have seen it for youself and I have no need to explain further. 

I really wonder how many will stay and how many will not.

I know you read NUSWhispers occasionally, perhaps you may see this. I've put in a lot of effort and tried very hard to make it normal for you. I know you are also very busy with your own activities and it doesn't help that our timetable don't match well. But I just want you to know that I've decided that it's no longer worth it and I will not expect anything else from you. At the start I thought you could be one of those close friends but perhaps no longer.

To 

I have friends who lost their home, have abusive parents or even lost their parents. Heck, I've known someone who witnessed her own dad murdering her own mom.

Bottom line: stop your self-pity with your first world problems. Go do some CIP and be thankful at how fortunate you are.

My earpieces have an interesting function. 

Putting them on, the world around me does not matter. 
People along the corridors can become just faceless, moving blocks that I walk around.
Unless they're someone I know, and make an obvious gesture (or noise to break through the music, as someone did), I wouldn't actually notice anyone's faces (specifically, identities), which would explain why I've been told that I would tao people (my apologies,it was unintentional).

However, it also enables me to read body languages. 
Ironically, it is precisely that I cannot hear what others say, that I am actually rather sensitive to their gestures, their mouthing of a simple "thank you" when I hold the lift doors open, their playing of phones when you're speaking to them...

Unfortunately, I tend to read too much into it as well. Paranoia sets in, and I start panicking because I do not know how to respond. What to say? What to do? Will what I say be relevant? Should I say it? Such questions come flooding in.

I start reading people, and realise that, at times, I have to purposely ignore a person's presence (and it actually hurts quite a bit every time), or make my presence around a persons scarce, because I would make the person feel uncomfortable, and I'll feel unwelcome, if I ever engage with him/her.

You see, I don't deal very well with people  - it's extremely draining for me to hold a conversation, for some reason. I will soon drone away after a while. I get rather nervous and stressed when talking to people I do not know very well (ladies, in particular), and tend to go haywire. If an outgoing person suddenly just starts talking to me, the most I can muster is a "ok,uh... I see." because it is just too overwhelming.

Which brings about the point... Did that lady I met on the bus when school started just wave hi to me a few weeks back? Omg... Well... Sorry if I sort of ignored you. Perhaps, I might run into you on the bus again sometime? Well, perhaps, who knows, I might make a new friend.

Perhaps, I should just very well take off my earpieces.

Dun worry. Honestly from young till the end of my schooling days, I've been an ugly duckling. Was obese in sec school, but I slimmed down to just abit of chubbiness when I entered NUS. Looks presentable though. Even after a graduated, nothing. 26 years of my life and was never pursued, then again to be fair, there wasn't anyone that I wanted to be with either. I figured i dont need get a boyfriend to be happy. Ive got plenty of close friends who were there for me, and i enjoyed hanging out with. When i entered the workforce, i got into shape, dressed better, took care of myself, all for my own sake, not so i can attract guys. Come 27 yrs of age, I got into my first relationship. Was pursued for the very first time. Fell in love. Although I'm happy being single, being attached is another type of happiness I guess. It will all fall into place once u are happy with yourself. U will look attractive when u exude confidence. There's a quote that says, work on yourself, and the rest will follow. Fully agreed.

What do girls think of guys who visit or visited prostitutes? This is a serious question and i'd really like the opinions :)

There is this girl in my GER group project that I think is cute. Somehow, she has been privately messaging me on really random stuff. However, she is already attached.  Should i make a move this valentines day?

Hi, I just saw a post about dialects and noticed that quite a few people responded positively to a dialect. I was thus wondering if perhaps we could set up an interest group to promote dialect learning and dialect sharing or sth along those lines. Anyone interested?

One year ago, I remember spending my valentines day on an online dating site. Fast forward to 2016, I still find myself as evergreen as ever. Looks like even online dating have let me down.

I know theres no reason for me to feel this way. But somehow the circumstances just makes me feel this way. I have always been your very average looking plain jane. Okay, maybe a little lesser than average looking given that i was actually overweight, plump and chubby during my secondary and poly days. Now, i manage to keep my weight at a controllable level, but i am still considered "chubby" given today's standards. Some of you may say that the right person for me is not here yet, fate has it all planned out for me etc etc. But i just find it so weird, that through out my 23 years of existence, i have never had any guys taking an interest in me. Not even asking of phone numbers. It doesnt help that my closer friends are above average looking - your typical chio girls. I have had many instances of being neglected in a social group, where some guys talk to girls just on the basis of looks. Superficial. I felt horribly ostracised but i tell myself that its okay - i dont need such people in my life too! I try to stay positive, be open and "put myself out there", by joining CCAs, clubs and activities. Hahaha although i didnt join them to look for guys, i can only express how speechless i am when the guys approaches my friends and clearly left me out of the entire conversation. I am not bitter or jealous that my friends are able to get guy's attention. All these situations just makes me feel, what is it that i am lacking? I dont have a bad personality, but somehow guys just refuse to look beyond the superficial. I guess its just life?

When I was young, my parents were not at home most of the time and busy working. I had only my sister and my maid at home. My parents didn't control us a lot so we were left on our own to learn and be independent. My sister and I are like polar opposite and thus our relationship is not as close like others. We misunderstand and quarrel a lot. Partly due to our parents didn't bother us and she was also very rebellious during her secondary school days. Also, I really really hate her being so judgmental at times. Until now, sometimes I feel very reluctant to talk to her and I don't want to let her know anything about my private life. Also, since I didn't talk to my parents a lot since young, I kind of don't really want to share with them about my life. All in all I don't have family love since young. 

I am introvert in nature and I feel that I am a boring person too. I can't find my passion and I don't really have an interest too. Which means I don't have many friends. With the fact that I keep things to myself, I don't really have close trustworthy friends. 

Sometimes I feel like I want to take a break and experience what it is like to be in a healthy family, to have a best friend, to be emotionally loved by someone. Then I don't need to face my sister and her irritating comments. I really really want to have someone whom I can trust and be very comfortable with. 

Actually I don't hate my parents for it, I still feel grateful to them as they provide me all the necessities and everything but not the emotional part I guess. Maybe things will be better when my sister moves out.

Ok so i've been seeing this girl i like a lot in school. Like i'll ask her whether she wants to study or have lunch together and most of the time she'll agree. Valentine's day is coming up and i can't decide whether or not i should do anything, like perhaps a confession or ask her out for a date or anything like that. Part of me feels that it's way too soon, as i don't really know her that well yet (we only can talk about school related stuff, nothing really much on the personal level yet). But on the other hand i don't know if i would be passing up an opportunity for a relationship as she could also be expecting some kind of initiation from me on valentine's day. She seems to be really comfortable around me and would laugh and giggle at all the lame stuff that i say when i joke with her. 
My initial plan was to wait a while longer, maybe a couple more months, and if she continues to show interest only then would i make a move. But with v-day approaching i'm beginning to listen to my heart more and more. What do you think i should do?

Is it bad to be a bit of a patriot?

I keep saying that even if this country didn't conscript, I would have volunteered to enlist anyway. Having gone in, served my 2 years and gone out, my feeling hasn't changed, for what it is worth. I do feel bad, however, that SNAFU truly applies to the armed forces, and that it feels as if we who served were superfluous and forgotten. For better or for worse, for the chiong suas and kengsters, serving felt like something to be proud of, and it tears me up inside to see it, and the people above, below or alongside, for what all of it really is.

I'm curious to see how our country would fare in a hot war, and maybe feel a bit the hero doing my part. However wrong it truly is, for there is no denying that war is hell both tragic and farcical.

Part of me resents this country and the service for the way I felt from it, but I still take pride for being the boot on the ground, that I could stand up and be counted. Why didn't I sign on? But why would I? I can't answer this to myself rightly, the pride mixes with the cynicism.

I love this country, and I feel bad that doing my time didn't feel as good as I hoped, as I thought it could.

I don't want to be a forgotten serviceman

 You should have a good talk with him/her in-person? Sometimes technology really can't do the work and misunderstandings arise frequently. This is more so the case if you're doing whatever that you're doing indirectly. For me personally, there's this girl I would really want to date or get to know more as I really felt a connection with her like no other as well and perhaps also because I really like her a lot as a person (except when she's on rage mode). But at the same time, these are all rational thoughts and it would be rather selfish and/or irresponsible of me if I were to ask her out or approach her while being unable to commit emotionally at this point of time. Sometimes, things are just complicated? I guess it's the same whether you are in a r/s or not, and honest and direct approaches will work best. If you trust him/her enough to be honest with you, try it?

Tip: Vday is near! i think any guy who has common sense shld do something on that day or even near the date for the girl he truly likes and desires to be with! Make use of ur opportunity guys... If not you r just losing out. U can just Write something sweet? Need nt even be a rose!
-
 
I haven't known you for long but I've felt a connection like no other. The moments we shared will remain with me forever. 
It's really hard when you are fighting for someone who (probably) doesn't want you back. Not used to being the one doing the chasing, I decided to fight for what I want. But gosh it's hard. It's hard when you start to feel insecure and wonder if you're just being overly pushy instead...you start questioning how annoying he finds you. Having developed feelings for someone after so long, I am realizing how much it really hurts. I fell hard. *wallows in self pity*

To follow up on 

Y baited me to meet her. She offered me a deal which I could not resist. She would allow me to drop by her home anytime as long as she isn't busy. However, from how she sounded, she sounds as if she would not mind even if D had a prior appointment with her.

I felt conflicted. On one hand Y was offering me first-class service free-of-charge. On the other hand she was implying that I should either cooperate with D and agree on sharing Y or dissing D off (secretly) and having Y for myself.

I decided on the immoral path though. I could not resist her gold-class service (her recent dyed hair is a bonus ;) ). Considering my background (i am a chem engineer), it was almost impossible for me to find girls simply because we had no free-time (FYP in one sem, design project in another). Moreover, Y was essentially free satisfaction, love and pleasure all in one. Yet D's warning hung on me... her dominatrix behaviour.

I simply couldn't resist the chance of getting together with such a strange girl though. She was somewhat the image of my dreams: pretty, smart (not only pretty smart) and quite a challenge. I thought, too, unlike D, I was going to make sure her dominatrix streak would become one of equals. (I also think D was just exaggerating when he could not accede to Y's sexual demands.)

In the end, we had a night of fun (I really remembered the condoms lah, I was just kidding).

FUCK, I just accepted an offer I couldn't resist... and from Y.

Maybe I should speak to D about this... Y and I are already like FWBs and even for FWBs, I think we can sustain thrice-weekly service. Just moan about my MRT fare because I must now travel to the East.

And Justice Bao, sorry, I am just a man with normal needs. She is a lady with special needs. Mutual consent you know, bro.

hey. it was never you. Sorry. i was talking about breaking up with my best friend, and i guess you got caught up thinking it was you. my friends are helping me through it, and i'm stronger now. i'm working hard at what i do too, and it's cathartic. even though you always troll me for it. she's cute i guess, just like a kid. gfi man. and say hi next time? promise i will be nice. posting this here because i don't have your current number.

I love my girlfriend very much. She's dynamic, spontaneous and full of life. But that's only one side of her. The other side...is like a totally different person. I've been trying my best to be there for her when she goes into that 'dark' state, even though I feel like I can't help much (which frustrates me to no end). Sometimes, she lashes out at me. I understand that such actions and words arise in the heat of the moment or due to a built-up of all her feelings. However, it does take a toll on me. 

I want to be someone who can help her get through this, make her happy. I just feel like I'm losing myself in the process of it. So I'm struggling as well. I've been struggling for quite a long while now.

I'm sorry (this can get filtered out), I just needed to release some of this pent up frustration.

I just need to gather up more strength to support her.

 Go ahead and date your white boys, SPG. We all know you are cocky because there are so many weak asian men of our generation. Some of them are so pathetic that they even fawn over spgs. I promise you that this will not go unavenged or unforgotten. If I succeed in life, you and your lot will be treated worse than dogs.

I had always believed in love (or at least attraction) at first sight. But after meeting you, it seems like feelings do change... And it kills me a little everyday that we're not talking.

Today, I finally ended my relationship. I gave him a chance to admit things that he did but he still tell me 'really, it is nothing', a sentence I heard for four years. It feels weird and empty now but I think I will get used to it. Are there any ways to get over this period? I already blocked him from everywhere so that we will not have any other forms of communication.

hi guys, i keep seeing ppl posting about relationship stuffs. i'm someone who never gets the point of it. i have never been attracted to anyone and i really don't see the point of getting a partner. is something wrong with me?

Here's another age-old question: Do you guys/girls believe in the existence of a purely platonic friendship between a bi/heterosexual guy and a bi/ heterosexual girl? (I'm not against homosexual here. If both are homosexual, this is definitely possible)

Recently, I broke up with my gf. We had some issues already before this, about our compatiblilty and all. Then somehow our relationship became even more distant when this guy came along and appeared in her life. 
They met in a party, became friends and started to hit it out well. Chatting earnestly on whatsapp etc etc (more than the frequency of me and her).
Well she even spent her Christmas last year with him instead of me. 
So I asked her abt him, and she told me they were purely friends. And even told me he has a love interest already.
Well, I tried to believe her but deep inside something is still nagging me. For one, I do not believe in 100% platonic friendship between a girl and a guy. Eventually, realizing our relationship has lost its essence, we broke up. When we broke up, she told me she needed some time to be away from relationships. 
Guess what, a few weeks after we broke up, I found out that she and the guy got  together.

This incident just cemented my idea that pure friendship is not possible between a guy and a girl who are sexually attracted to the opposite gender. Either one or both of the parties will have some other agenda. 

What do you guys think? Do you think its possible?

Why no girl in engin eva approach me:(?? I am probably a wallflower and I don't even think any girl from my course notices me. The irony is that my females friends from other faculty would tell me that I am cute and would sometime flirt with me. Is it just that engin girls are more conservative? It does not help that my personality seems cold and would always disappear after lectures. 

Engineering really make guys feel unwanted. And if you are introverted say GG to your non existence dating life. Im already prepared to buy a blow up doll to spend my life with.

friendships > relationships. why concentrate on one person when you can share it with so many others?

(then again, I might just be an aromantic)

Girl and guy gets matched up together by their friends.

Girl finds out that guy has feelings for someone else. She doesn't know who else within their circles of friends has he told.

Girl feels awkward. Her friends really think there's chemistry between the two of them.

Girl feels hurt too, because she had feelings for guy.

Girl desperately tries to move on, but it's an uphill battle against emotions and being reminded about the possibility of being with him.

Girl considers cutting ties but she doesn't like the idea of subsequently burning bridges with her other friends.

Girl is currently clueless and helpless, and is therefore seeking NUSWhispers for help.

Will it be very obvious that the girl is interested if she initiates the convo after about 1 week of not talking and will it scare the guy off? Before that we were talking everyday but it somehow ended...

You know when you're dating someone and you know you're on the verge on being ghosted, but that person still message you once in a while? Omg just stop texting me altogether and let me heal my broken ghosted soul, you asshole! Or at least tell me that you're not interested anymore and are dating someone else.  Have some respect for people! I really hate people who ghost >:(
-
 
I don't understand why we girls are made to feel bad when we limit our dating pool to white guys. Everyone has preferences, do I need to date someone I'm not attracted to in order to make YOU feel better about yourself? It just so happens that the kind of chiseled features that I am sexually attracted to are usually possessed by white guys. Try finding a girl in the same league as yourself and maybe you won't be so bitter.

In the beginning of this sem, my boyfriend and I had planned to take this same mod together. I had planned my timetable and shared with him those tutorial timing which I was taking for the mod. But a few days later he told me he couldn't take the that tutorial during that timing as he plans on taking another mod's tutorial with his friends. At that time, I didn't think much of about it so I compromised and agreed to push back that tutorial timing by an hour to take it with him. However, on the day of the tutorial itself, as I sat there for 2 hours outside the building and attempt to study while waiting alone, time passed by painfully slow. And I felt slightly uncomfortable thinking that he so willingly pushed aside my plan just to take the tutorial with his friends. It made me feel as if I was not as important as his friends. 

So a few days ago, I told him I wasn't comfortable waiting 2 hours for lesson to start (afterall my day starts really early on that day and I'll get tired) and I'll be taking it at the timing which I had originally planned to take instead. In the meanwhile, to my horror, I also found out from him that he wasn't exactly taking it with a group of friends. He had planned to take that tutorial with another girl. What's more poignant is the fact that he pushed aside my plan aside after I had shared with him my timetable because this girl couldn't make it for the tutorial on other days. I gave him and option to take that tutorial with me today after explaining that I would feel uncomfortable knowing that he's attending a class with some girl which I don't know about while I wait alone. However, much to my disappointment, and after I had explicitly explained to him, he still went ahead to take it with that girl. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against him taking lessons with other friends at any other timing. But this incident truly reveals where I stand in his life as compared to his friend. And to be honest, I feel extremely disappointed in him because it made me feel like I'm not his priority and I thought he could be better than that. 

What do you guys think?
-
 
Just one question. Do girls feel an ego boost after rejecting guys?
-
 
 if he engages in conversation actively with you, then it's a good sign. He probably likes talking to you. And like I always tell my friend, "if he wants to talk, he'll text." So don't initiate the conversation all the time and let him do it sometimes.

Recollection:

While dining at the UTown dining hall today, I met a 'marvellous' girl by the name of Y. I know her and now have escapades with her in the east, but I didn't realise Y now lives in the residential college.

Here's the story.

I liked Y when Y was still attached to another guy, who we can call D. As far I know Y, she was a dominatrix and was overpowering D. I used to allow D to confide in me over Y. D would say that, for all of his skills, he could find no way to satisfy Y. So I tried to teach him a few tricks, but deep down, I was curious about Y.

Fast-forward to the day of fun: we had cider. Then we had some wine. And then she was saying that I was weak. I then challenged her to whisky. She accepted. I demanded she drink first. Y then promptly enslaved her life to me. Poor her. She was begging me literally to take her home, which I did, and accompanied her for the night. She was ridiculously hard to resist and I thought D was so damn lucky; she was smart, witty and had the sexual drive and attraction to turn any guy on and mad.

One day, Y suddenly confided in me with regards to D. She asked me whether D was completely committed to her. Confused (pretentiously), I asked, how so. She then spilled all about her "needs", and the more she said, the more I was shocked. Shocked because she was really like a guy more than a girl: having sexual needs that needed to be gratified, and that D just won't cut it.

Then she suddenly asked... P, should I break with D? In return, I know you actually like me very much.

Skipping all the details, according to her, I gave her the best night possible, but now that I glance at her, I am myself sometimes afraid. Each time we see each other for dinners, it almost always ends up in me staying overnight at her house without D knowing.

A few weeks ago, I heard Y and D having the most serious argument in a while. The problem? D confided in me again, that Y said that thrice a week was insufficient. D contended that his FYP meant that he couldn't meet Y as often as he would like, but Y would have nothing of that. I was conflicted because I was already involved should Y and D break up. Yet I like Y, and we have already got sexual.

Admittedly I am afraid myself, meeting her twice a week is already beginning to be slightly taxing even though she is still quite a desirable girl, except her almost insatiable desire for something normally men would want more.

I didn't say hi to her for fear that I'd spend a night in the residential college when I could have been studying. You see, I don't always have condoms with me.

With Valentine's Day approaching, I feel lonely to the point that it hurts :(
-
 
To  if you feel that the two of you are close/comfortable enough that you feel it won't damage the friendship, then go ahead! But here's just a warning: my ex-girlfriend did that with her guy friend while we were still together, and the guy admitted that he did like her before as well. Next thing I knew, they became very uncomfortably (for me) close and after a month, she broke up with me and got together with him.
So actually maybe you might stand a chance to be together with him? No promises though.
-
 
wtf this is damn irritating. I really don't understand why that girl just have to tag him and only him in that photo in the entire album. there are so many people in that album that she knows. she doesn't tag herself nor any other people. if she so free she can just go tag the entire group. trying to draw attention not so subtly eh???! 
-
 
what motivates people to confess? 
for me I feel that I will only confess when I sense that the person I like is about to be taken, otherwise I can just leave it as status quo because I don't want to give myself unnecessary stress and possibly sadness. I feel that this in a way is rather selfish as I am kind of like acting as road block for them but  I think I will kill myself if I didn't do anything to stop this. perhaps this is because I love myself more than the person.
-
 
With all these confessions about guys texting patterns, what do you make of a guy who reply you once (or on really rare occassion... at most 3 times) a day? He is not cutting the conversation but just becoming less frequent. I know he is not interested in me but we don't meet so why are we still chatting on a daily basis? 
-
 
For heavens sake, is it so hard for girls to just state how you feel to someone else? I don't see the big deal why people are so afraid to tell others how they feel. Instead of playing 'silent treatment' games and 'he loves me he loves me not' and all those nonsense why not just speak up when you feel something for someone? The best case scenario might be that you guys will at least get a chance to date, the worse case scenario is that he turns you down. If he stopped talking to you after he turned you down it shows what kind of friend he is. So have guts and just say how you feel there's really nothing to lose here. 
-
 
To . To answer your question, the factors may be plenty. He may be busy, may not know what to reply you, may not ve interested, or even may just be bad at texting. You said you guys are not meeting up so I'm assuming that you met him on an online dating website? If so, there may even be more reasons as to why is he behaving like that, for eg from not being comfortable yet to chat with strangers, or even too shy to ask you out. May be you could try to ignore him and see if he restarts the convo again? Depending on the contents of the conversation between you two, it may be any of those reasons stated above! Or you can just ask him outright if you're brave enough. That's the best way forward I feel. Take care!
-
 
We've been friends all this while. I used to have feelings for him last time. And then I didn't pursued further. Is it ok to confess that I once crushed/liked him? Would it burden him and will I risk destroying the friendship that we still have today? But I feel like I should at least once make known my feelings to him. Some courage.

There will be a lot of pretty faces when you go out to work unless you are in CS. :( I like nerdy guys but they are attracted to the pretty faces (which obviously I am not one of them). I think the part on difficulty in finding the other half is relevant for both genders. :( Please don't go into the npnt talk. I admit I am not pretty at all.
-
 
Saw a recent post from about how guys text. What if the guy replies immediately once he sees the message (e.g blue ticks), and engages actively on conversing (e.g not one word replies). Yet whenever he says he will talk later (cos working,busy etc),  he doesn't start the conversation again. The initiating of conversation is pretty equal between us but I dont know if I should start the conversation again since he was the one who said he will talk to me after and ended the conversation. I'm scared he isn't interested and im just bothering him

The weird moment when others are selling you roses for valentine's day, and you're single,and more or less one of the most tested-creepy people around.

Hmm... roses. I should go and learn to grow roses, rather than just folding them and putting them in the printing room.

Interestingly, because I am single, I can spend a lot of time doing self-improving stuff.

Perhaps, creeping a lady i hoped to know better away may very well be a good opportunity in disguise.

Though no,i had really hoped to know her better. That is, if she would stop seeing me as a stalker because of various sincere coincidences. 

A pity, but life does go on. Life's one's greatest teacher, no?

@15923
It depends on your relationship with that group of friends.
For me, my life revolves around a few groups of people. 
My core - the guys that I grew up around that I'd happily give life and limb for.
My secondary group - guys which I've been friends with for a while and get along just fine. However, despite being close with these guys, they're not exactly family. Nonetheless, I'd be happy to help them out whenever they're in need

The minor circles - people who I've no choice but to hang out with like classmates or maybe people I just got to know that I'm not close to. People here are either here to provide temporary companionship in certain situations or they are simply well connected and may be of use to further my agenda in the future.

Id be more than happy to split the cash with my "core" group of friends. I've grown up with them and I see them as part of my own family. Hence, I wouldn't feel apprehensive sharing any good fortune I have as I know they'd do the same for me.

The second group is slightly trickier. I would vaguely tell them that I received an unexpected windfall but not from that particular lucky draw and treat them to a crazy night out or maybe a meal at Joel Robuchon.

The last group? It's a lot trickier cause fuck em. You don't really wanna invest too much money on them unless there's individuals there that are well connected and could help you land that prestigious internship you always wanted or they're filthy rich already and you wanna build rapport with them because of the free country club visits, club tables and whatnot.

At the end of the day, do whatever makes you the happiest but keep in mind it's a dog eat dog world and not everyone is willing to share that money with you.

I've recently become aware that I'm rather loud. I'm extremely self conscious of it now and I've been trying my best to be less attention-attracting. Any tips or advice would be appreciated.

I'm not sure if this is a girl school thing but how do you express yourself to a guy that you are interested in him/like him more than a friend? I can talk perfectly fine to guys I see as friends but when I like someone I just get sooo shy in front of him I don't even talk to him/ acknowldge his presence first. He will think I'm giving him the cold shoulder right? What should I do?
-
 
I used to be together with a guy from NUS. We would spend almost everyday together, just enjoying each other's presence. But, we didn't work out due to personality differences and the same arguments that eventually grew out of hand. I'm with another guy now - he's really caring, dedicated, and I love and care for him the same. However, the same issues arise again. I'm not sure if the problem lies in me instead. I like guys who get jealous, those that express their dissatisfaction if another guy comes into the picture, or gets cutely jealous when I appear to show attention to other guys. But, not to the extreme. In my previous relationship, my ex ended up interrogating me every time i go out, turned moody every time i go out with friends (even if the group consists of both guys and girls), asked me why I couldn't not have male friends if he could afford to not have any female friends. My current one is starting to do the same. Ever since I told him about my past, and how I'm not a virgin anymore, he thinks about it and gets sour at me suddenly at times. He peeked at my whatsapp (accidentally or not) and saw my guy friends talking to me, and ever since that he has been really frustrating me. He monitors my whatsapp 'online's and blue ticks. He assumes that I'm talking to guys if he sees me 'online' but not on his chat. I explain to him everytime to avoid him misunderstanding, but sometimes his accusations just cause me to feel really wronged. I have tried to reassure him many times, but every time my phone sounds to alert me of a notification, or every time he sees my guy friends online in game (yeah he adds them), or every time i do something that may be related to them (like playing a piano game when the guy plays piano), he thinks they are talking to me, flirting with me, playing games with me even more than I do with him (which is not true, I don't even play that much with my other friends), or tells me he doesn't like the game because he must have introduced me to it. I really don't know what to do. Every time we argue about this, every time I try to reassure him, every time I throw in everything just to prove to him that he's the only one I see, he just doesn't believe me. He says he trust me, but I really find that really hard to believe. This arguing has been going back and forth for a year now. I've tried to talk it out with him, but nothing seems to work. It doesn't help that it's an LDR and we only see each other once every half a year.. I feel like crying because I feel so lonely, I really don't know what to do.

Thanks for hearing me out, I just wanted to let it out.

It felt awkward when my attached guy friend stared at me for some time and said "You've got pretty eyes & nice nose". Was that supposed to be a friendly comment, since he hasn't spouted weird stuff like this before?

I'm in a dilemma. There's a close female friend of mine who recently wanted to borrow an interest-free four digit sum from me. She said she need the money to pay for her brother's school fees. Although my parents are well-to-do professionals, I am not. Ever since I entered NS and subsequently NUS, the only thing they provide me is a roof over my head. My phone bill, utility bills, food, transport and school fees are all paid for by myself using the money I earned as a freelancer and savings from NS. Therefore, I know I won't be able to lend her this amount of money, considering my own financial constraint.

Ya, I know the easiest way is to just say NO straight in her face. However, she is a really good friend of mine and she's real gorgeous. I don't like her romantically, but it's a male ego thing to find it harder to say no to pretty girls right? Also, she knows my family is well-off and a four digit sum is trivial to us. Hence, I am afraid she may think that I am being a miser if I do not help her out. 

However, based on past experiences, she does not have the habit of properly returning things. She once borrowed my book because she said her friend is looking for the book but cannot find it. So I passed it to her to lend it to her friend as I've finished reading it. And guess what? After a whole year, she never mentioned anything about the book. So naturally I asked her if her friend has finished reading it, and she said he had read it, then she gave me his contact details and told me to find him to get it back. WTF?! I don't even know him! It will be really awkward for me to go up to a random stranger and say "Hey give it back. That belongs to me!" Hence, I never saw the book again. This is not the only time I find it hard getting things back from her. A few of my stationary, magazines, textbooks, water bottle etc. are long gone. >:O

Returning to the money issue. Although I can easily ask my parents to lend her the money instead, my greatest fear is that she does not or find it hard to return the money, this may sour the relationship between all parties, since my parents take the notion of personal responsibility very seriously.

I don't believe she's greedy or selfish, but she's just very irresponsible, low self-awareness and take things too lightly. When a person borrow something on someone's behalf, he/she is obliged to take responsibility for the transaction. They must make an effort to place clearing their liabilities at the top of the list! People can't just start returning things only when it is convenient for them to do so! 

Although I personally explained all these to her countless times, she will just say "Okay sorry!" with a cute smile, and then she'll forget everything I told her. Should I not lend her a single cent with the risk of affecting our friendship because the money is important to her brother's future, or should I lend it to her with the risk of not seeing the money again? Help!!! D:

Bro at least your friend showed up . My friend got a gf and disappeared entirely . Seen texts without replies . Doesn't show up to invitations . Calls u only when he needs help with studies . Since then I just decided to cut him off entirely . To the guys out there : BROS BEFORE HOS DAMNIT

This buddy of mine brings his new girlfriend everywhere he goes, and at our last gathering, it was pretty obvious she was a little overwhelmed by all the unfamiliar faces.

I don't get it, do dudes usually do this just to show off their girlfriends to all their buddies? Like a trophy? Am I doing it wrong by not fusing myself with my girlfriend and sticking to her 24/7?

What's up with people not being able to eat alone? I don't understand. Its so immature. Like not being able to go to the toilet alone. Maybe its time to grow up and be an adult? I pray that you don't get stranded alone on a deserted island. Because even if got all the food around you also you won't touch.
-
 
Hey OP of  
I do not mind eating alone outside of school, but not in school. 
I don't like acquaintances who are always with their large groups of friends to judge me when they see me eating alone. They will give me the look of 'Why are you eating alone? O.O' Don't say that I am thinking too much. I was judged before by a group of acquaintances who are not close to me and I really don't like it. 
Of course, I will not starve myself just because I don't like people to judge me. Like what you said, we are mature university students. I will eventually succumb to my empty stomach and fill it up with my favourite food. (: Oh, if you present to me all kinds of food in an empty island, I will definitely take that! 

Food is more important than face, my friends.

I think I like him but he is always with other girls. I feel jealous seeing him with other girls. Even though we interact quite often, I don't think I should be with him. I just need to get over him ASAP!!

So I've seen a lot of people confessing that they do not know what a guy is thinking through their texting habits. Firstly, if you think he isn't interested then you're most probably right. If a guy likes a girl, he would go that extra mile to reply her messages as soon as he can and he will not do funny things like reading your message and then go offline before replying you much later. And as for the initiating conversation part, if it's you who's always initiating the conversation, he doesn't like you. Simple as. I mean he could like you if he tries to keep the conversation going. But if he keeps wanting to end the conversation by giving you shitty replies, then you should probably stop bothering him and move on with life. I know it's hard to accept that someone you adore so much doesn't like you back, but this is the cold hard truth. You should move on to better things in life that are worthy of your time.

I actually stopped texting this girl because I dropped my then nokia phone into the toilet bowl while peeing and texting her at the same time. Nokia phone didnt make it and I was too embarrassed to tell the girl about what happened. Biggest regret of my life.

I have been going out on dates with this girl for a while, but actually i have a boyfriend (yes you did not read wrong) who is now temporarily overseas. Recently, some arguments made me realise that the girl's character is way too intense for me, what should I do?

I am a very very lost year 2 student who can't seem to find her way and direction in life. Nevertheless I know that I need to get internships to find a good job in the future so I can feed myself and be good to my family, but I have no one to ask and I'm scared that there would be no internships left for me in the summer.

Do any seniors know if there would still be any offers around March/April? Or do they normally stop by the end of January? I tried asking my friends (whom I thought were closest to me) but it seems like they didn't want to tell me anything when I asked them... I think I understand that they don't want extra competition? But still I feel a bit sad being left behind. I always thought we'd be there for each other but somehow it seems like I'm the only one who thinks this way.

Anyway, I really really need help on this so I hope you guys can help! sorry for the rant.

I used to be the kind of girl who knew that I have tons of issues going on, that's why I couldn't settle in a proper relationship and was only dating. For a few months now, I've been going out with this wonderful person who has his own share of issues. I learnt so much by conversing with him, about life, reality and self. He deepened my views on the world, and he is the first person to make me want to be a better person. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever get into a relationship with him due to certain circumstances, and also the fact that he deserves someone more gorgeous, smarter, wiser, more bright and cheery, and less dark and twisted. But now I definitely understand the saying, 'When someone else's happiness is your happiness, that is love'. Even though it hurts to know that I can't be with him, my times with him have been liberating. He was the only summer in my entire life of a winter, and now because of him, perhaps I can find a spring.

Note to self: (and maybe other girls who are going through break ups)
I promise you I will stop blaming myself. I promise you I will start getting my shit together. I promise you I will stop stalking my ex's life and start living my own. I promise you I will be better than I ever be. Not because of anybody else but because I am going to start taking care of myself.

How should I trust my boyfriend who appears to love me a lot, i.e. through words, actions (making known to everyone else we are an official couple etc) but likes the pictures of a ton of girls on social media behind my back and texts other girls? Sometimes I feel like I should break up with such a hypocrite.

My gf's sister's foot was touching mine during dinner but I didn't move away. I was curious.

Whenever I casually comment about how I'm always forever alone, my female friends would always tell me that I'm a really great guy with fantastic personality and I'm perfect boyfriend material, and whoever is my girlfriend would be very lucky.

But then I always wonder, if they think that way about me, why don't they go for me?? I'm really very puzzled about this.

You actually trusted a 22 year old boy when he told you he loved you and would make you his wife? I am sorry to say you are the only fool here.

Hi everyone I'm in need of some advice. I've been texting this guy I really like, and I'm always the one who initiates the conversation. He replies but never tries to continue the conversation by asking questions or sound interested. And also, he will read my message and not reply sometimes until I text him again. Does this mean he is not interested in me or is he just a bad texter?
-
 
When I'm getting intimate with my girlfriend, sometimes I fantasize that she is my exs, her friends, or other girls. I didn't tell her about this though. Is this like normal?
-
 
 It's hard to say if the guy will find you irritating given the limited information. He might have lacked initiative or was unresponsive previously for the following reasons:
1. He's in fact giving you the space that he thinks you need.
2. He thinks you find him irritating.
3. He thinks you're not interested in him.
4. He thinks you're playing hot and cold or whatever mind games girls nowadays play.
5. He thinks you're irritating.
6. He's busy.
7. His interest for you has faded or he's uncertain.
1 - 4 especially possible if you were previously seemingly disinterested or unresponsive.

These are some reasons I can think of and I think you're the best to decide which category or categories apply to you and whether if you should still initiate conversations.

I've always felt inferior. I came from a humble family where both of my parents are not educated. I worked very hard in my secondary school days to be able to promote from normal technical to normal academic, poly and finally a local university. However, my uni life wasnt easy- i had to juggle between work and studies and yes,  i really wasnt as smart as my peers(you can say its an excuse but yeah i know it myself) i failed some modues and was prepared to drop out of school untill i met my current boyfriend. He is someone that i really love and see a future with. His parents would not be happy with someone who drops out and i really hope to get his parents' approval of us. He encouraged me not to give up and continue with school. I took his advice because i know my loved ones - family and him would love to see me graduate in 3 years time. Hopefully 3 years. 
But now the stress level is just too high, i go to school everyday feeling like a burden to my teammates and being in course i dont like. I know having a degree would mean a much more stable future so up till now i still could not make up a decision...
-
 
 Let me give a contrarian thinking: If you need to 'think very hard' about how to interact with your crush, there is a high chance that both of you are incompatible with each other. If both of you are suitable for one another, there will be a lot of matching topics to talk about.

Advice to those trying to enter a relationship:
1) Don't give up, keep trying
2) Romance does not drop from the sky; it takes effort

Trust me, I failed several times before I got into a good and stable relationship now. I did embarrassing things, like confessions on V-Day. I experienced lots of awkward moments pursuing girls. I cried after rejections, feeling lonely, miserable and depressed. But I emerged stronger, more resilient and more confident. Most importantly, remember that your crushes / people who rejected you are also human. If they reject you, it's NOT about you. They might have different priorities or needs, and not because they don't exactly like you or even dislike you. And don't overly romanticize them (or hate those who rejected you too much). Always pick yourself up, and tell yourself that at least you have fallen in love before, and have tried.

I like my friend but he's of a different race and I'm swarming myself with possible challenges before anything even starts. This is bad.

As an evergreen guy for more than 23 years, this sem I'm going to spend Valentines Day alone this year again. But its gonna be different, I'm going to catch a new love movie which I would also suggest all gentlemen to bring your GFs and crushes to watch. Its beautiful take about hardship, brokenness and solitude but through which the main character, Wade Wilson, finds strength and new birth in his view of the world. Love grants one courage and the will to live and fight on, I'm gonna learn so much from this love story about perseverance and determination. Deadpool (2016) simply can't wait!

I understand that right now you are busy and all. And even though you have hinted at the fact that you are not interested to pursue any form of relationship due to your busy schedule, I still feel the need to get this off my chest one last time. I'm still harboring the hope that you did not give a definite answer because you dare not promise anything and not because you do not care. Frankly, I don't expect much. We don't have to keep going out if you don't have time to. We can simply just spend time doing essential things like getting our work done together seeing as we do have a few common mods. I'm all about quality time and we don't necessarily have to do the whole going on dates thing to know each other better. We haven't had the time to truly know each other better and chances are you probably won't see this. I don't want to come off as desperate to you because I'm really not, I simply value every interaction that I have with people in my life. So if this speaks to you and you want to give it a go, ring me up. In the mean time it might be best if I move on. Best wishes to you.

 I hate to say this but all the crap of guys from dating apps that says "character is more important" or "chemistry is more important" is bullshit. Most of the guys from dating apps are focused on the looks and that's the first criteria. They can be having lots of chemistry with you via chatting but after you met them and they do not like how you look, they will just suddenly become introverted. If you really want to find a boyfriend, just forget about using dating apps. Or just treat it as a practising ground in dating apps. The focus on looks is too high on dating apps... :(

need some advice here pls ): 

I have a crush on this guy and although there should be chances of seeing him, I haven't been seeing him at all probably due to timetable clash.. Even on whatsapp when I try to start a convo with him he can come online but just don't reply my message like grey ticking it >< there is no convo at all even though I'm just trying to talk to him as a friend! I don't feel like whatsapping him anymore as it will be despo.. is that a sign that he isn't interested in me at all??? What should I do to get closer to him? I can talk to him when I see him at least for a while but now that I don't see him I felt disappointed ): howhow 

-lost evergreen girl here ><

I have always wanted to stay in hall as my house is so far away but keeps reading how people lost their virginity unwillingly. As I still want to keep my virginity, I am very worried it may happen to me. is it still recommended for me to stay in hall?

So this guy used to be the one initiating dates and conversations however recently after his "busy period" when i decided to give him space to do his stuff, we stopped talking.  I seem to be the one initiating all conversations but it doesn't seems to last for long and if i stop talking, we don't talk at all. To the guys, should i continue to initiate conversations? I'm afraid the guy might think i'm irritating:(
-
 
I am writing this as a confession because I am afraid of telling this to my girl directly in her face.

I know you have great expectations for me, but I will not be able to achieve them. I am not as clever as you think I am, nor am I romantic enough at all, even though I always try to pretend that I am. You might have seen through my pretense. I promise you many things: more private time together, more sex, more money. And I won't be able to deliver on any of them. It scares how much disappointment I am going to cause you one day.

Do girls feel insecure when they do not have a boyfriend? I do not know why but some of my friends told me that they feel this way. I am a guy and I can absolutely say that they are cute,witty and funny. Girls many times y'all are just being too harsh to yourself.

I understand that many of your female friends are attached but there is nothing wrong with not having a boyfriend. Do not feel insecure because of it.   

I think the major also play a role lol. My frens are from fass and biz so maybe theres a shortage of guys? If they come to engine I'm sure guys would throw themselves at them lmao...

you girls are pretty and cute so dn worry too much!!

People say that time heal wounds. Even you said that and believed it yourself. But I could not; its just me bearing the pain and getting used to it. Getting used to looking only at the pictures we had, going through the memories time and again. I tried putting you down, deleting the photos, forgetting you but I can't. It was a lost battle. I had to have our photos in my phone so whenever I felt alone and depressed I could see your face. I tried not to interfere with your new life over there but I needed your advice and words. I could not bear not talking to you in less than a month. I was deprived of such care and words but you came and you gave me what I needed. But now it seems like you moved on to care for another person and you forgot who you left behind. 

You asked if I am religious. No, because no gods can explain to me why they make fun and deprive me of what was rightfully mine. No, don't give me the bullshit that its a test for my love for any god or it was a path to make me grow. I have seen people who are born with a silver spoon, with love and care both of us were deprived of. They are matured in their thinking too. If I need a god, that is you, whom have provided so much in my life during those times. But since you turned away, I do not have a reason to believe in any religion anymore.

 If it is so easy, everyone would be successful with relationship. It's like telling a fat person that the way to lose weight is to eat less food. The real problem is usually Akrasia.
-
 
So I finally meet this guy after chatting online for some time, the next day after meeting, he stopped starting conversations. I know it means that he is not interested after knowing how I actually look like in real life (he does have my photos previously) but I can't help but to feel kind of sad.
-
 
I think it is a good idea for all the evergreen guys and girls out there to hang out together this valentine's day and truthfully share about their common problems faced when trying to chase their crushes.
-
 
If a guy is being hot and cold to you, does it mean he is not interested? We mostly text because I seldom see him in lectures and he is always surrounded by girls. 
-
 
To guys out there, if your girlfriend asks you to change a bad habit of yours such as smoking, playing games, etc. will you consider it? 
Given she is logical and rational and level headed in her approach will you guys appreciate her thought and give it a go? 

I mean, I know sometimes when you're in a relationship you're meant to be accepting and try to tolerate their shortcomings but sometimes when you are witnessing your other half wasting his life away we gotta do something!!! 
Just wanted to know what you guys think???

Last week I left a lecture early because the lecturer kept going in circles, I felt I was not learning anything there. Thinking back, I feel that I am able to take charge of my own education and maximize my time, but part of me feels guilty for being disrespectful... How do I draw the line?

Talk about awkward, I finally spoke to my crush for the first time and asked her to have dinner together immediately after our 4-6pm lecture. Fortunately, she's a spontaneous person and agreed enthusiastically. I intended it to be a session where I can know her better as a person and maybe we can find common interests... develop it into a serious relationship. It seems like I stood a chance with her until we walked out of the lecture theatre together. A close female friend of mine was waiting outside the LT with a surprise birthday cake for me and wanted to have dinner together since she knew I had nothing planned.

It was a very awkward dinner with the 3 of us.....

Dear ,
You may want to search up the term 'sexual fluidity'? 
I think it's quite common that at some point of time people might feel attracted to someone of the same sex. 
However, the important thing is to find out what you're truly feeling. Is it pure admiration (since you mention she's highly intelligent & very good looking), lust or love?
Ask yourself questions: Can you picture a future rs with a female? Or are you just curious about girl x girl rs? 
Don't worry too much about it & take time to slowly figure out your feelings & thoughts. 
I guess the last resort would be to consider dating women & see if you're comfortable with that. If not, you can always go back to dating men (:
All the best  xx

Anyone knows how to date an evergreen girl? I mean she's obviously new to this dating stuff and i don't know if she would be uncomfortable going out with another guy and stuff like that. Also, are there any signs that I should look out for as to whether she's looking for a relationship? Or perhaps she wants to be single by choice?
-
 
I've once dated someone who was my Best Friend and it didn't end pretty.
It ended with both of us being hurt and shortly after we broke up, she got attached to someone else.

I don't want anything romantic to do with her. At least not anymore. But it's been 4 months of minimal contact and I feel that I'm somewhat ready to be friends again. However, I don't want to come off as "that guy" or a creep that didn't get over his ex.

Any advice? Cause I've honestly been extremely vexed by this.

-
 
im in a dilemma. a guy semi-confessed to me on valentines day (2years ago). he is still not attached. gradually I realize that I like him but I don't know how to tell him. also I am afraid that I misinterpreted what he was trying to say and what if he doesn't like me? 
valentines day is approaching.... :*(
-
 
This sounds kind of dumb, but how do you actually interact with your crush prior and after confession? I read what the previous commenters and posts mentioned that you need to be genuinely interested in the person's life and background to interact and delve deeper. However, here comes my problem. 

As much as I want to know about her, nothing really comes to my mind during the interaction - it is just like a piece of paper, blank. It's like, I don't know what or how to ask in a conversation that can help to bring people closer. Even for the conversations that I generally had with people, be it texting or on a face-to-face basis, are pretty much on the surface level. And i think it doesn't help much that i've been a person of few words since young, After the confession, I just find it too awkward to broach any topics with her (and not sound too desperate) >.<

I'm an exchange student. I like this girl, who is a full time student here. If I was here full time also I would love the opportunity to date her. But alas the situation is shit because I'm leaving end of this sem. Just sad to have found someone like her and know that it will never be.

Polyamary sounds like bullshit. It's just cheaters getting people who can't afford to lose them to agree to their cheating ways officially. Bullshit about infinite love for all. The whole concept is a joke. Would you accept such a relationship?

Is it cheating if I sext other girls that are online but I don't meet them or maintain close contact with them? Sometimes I get bored with my own

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 10 months, and I don't quite know how to feel about it.

When we first got together, it was all very surreal. We were very happy, spent a lot of time together; it was kinda like the honeymoon period where everything seemed okay.

But everything changed when the fire nation attacked. Nah jkjk. In the second month, things changed when she suddenly became very moody all the time, and even constantly had suicidal thoughts. They slowly became worse when she actually tried to commit suicide, and I had to drag her off the edge a rooftop and pin her down while she struggled.

She was having quite a stressful time, with the endless work, projects and presentations from school, and there were also problems at home. As (arguably) her only pillar of support, I sacrificed a lot of time and effort to be there for her and to stop her if need be.

Things got better in the third month and things became smooth sailing again, until the last month of our relationship. We kept quarreling more often, even over the smallest of things, and she often blew it up to exaggerated proportions. 

During one of our fights, she said that the reason why she had the suicidal attacks was because of me. I was really puzzled. Me? What could I have done? She continued on saying she constantly felt very insecure around me, and I didn't give her enough security and comfort. But the thing is, I showered her with so much affection, attention and love and we had such a great time before she had the attacks. How could I be the cause????

A week later, she broke up with me. I honestly didn't know/still don't know how to feel about all of this because I feel like I've  been wronged.
-
 
to . OMG is this how girls think? I use to talk a lot about what I am doing to my crush and I felt SO sad that she do not even bother to tell me what she is up to. I felt that it is always me who is trying to initiate something. Omg maybe that is what ur bf is feeling right now. Why won't my gf bother to share anything when I am sharing so much abt myself. 

Think from your bf perspective la gal. 
-
 
I wonder.
I wonder if I can sustain in solitude.
I wonder if others can fill the gaps within me.
I wonder if even if others can fill the gaps within me, if such occurrence will ever occur to me.
I wonder if I can survive in this cold and harsh world alone, being the idiot I already am.
I wonder if I should still be wondering on what I had previously wondered upon.
I wonder why you are still wondering.

My advice for all those evergreen guys wanting to have a girlfriend is to be more proactive and join more camps and activities. I was an evergreen up to the point where I entered uni and met my now girlfriend from a camp. Just be yourself and try to make friends with everybody there be it guys or girls. Don't just stick to the girls as that will make you seem desperate/flirt. And when I say be yourself, I mean be your most comfortable self, don't tell yourself that you are shy and can't do anything about it. Girls love guys with humor so just joke about anything. My final advice for you guys is to befriend them and don't habor the thoughts of chasing them. Take things slow and get to know them inside out. I rushed things and realized that there are many aspects of her that doesn't coincide with me. 
-
 
my bf always likes to tell me what he is doing when I never even ask him but refuses to tell me what he and his friends talks about. he will call or text me telling me what he is up to (mostly about the activities he is doing alone) thats all. feeling abit upset he never even ask me what im doing. pls dont say im attention seeking or what but when two people are in a r/s of cos you wanna the other party to care about what you are up to! it tells me that he's kinda self centered...

I am the same person who wrote confession . I found my A0115 so all you 999 other A0115s can stop worrying if it's you or not. The real A0115 saw my confession.

I feel that a girl who has rejected me has been avoiding me or giving me the cold shoulder. Even though we agreed to remain as just friends, I feel that we don't talk like how we used to. Is she afraid to give me the wrong signal? (After all, I already know that she doesn't like me and I respect her decision.) Does she feel bad or embarrassed after rejecting me? I always though it's the rejected person who should feel embarrassed and give the cold shoulder. However, it appears as if it's the other way round. I've already tried to be normal, but she isn't. How do girls normally treat guys after rejecting them? Am I thinking too much? I just want to be friends like before, nothing more.
-
 
Admin, I hope you don't filter this out.

Anyway, I can't go into much details if not it would pretty much reveal.

Well, there's this thing bothering me for some time and more so, this week. Between me and this guy, we have interest for another but no, we didn't get together. At least not now. The thing is, his ex lingers ard me alot. Like we have mutual friends etc. And I have seen her once. But she doesn't know me, obviously. It bothers me because, I think she is a seemingly more sociable and likeable person than me(stalked) and I know their rshp was quite a "big thing". 

Sorry, just need to rant. Is it to feel bothered if you keep seeing(social med or literally) for your potential bf's ex?

After being evergreen for 20 over years. I casually got into a relationship, when my so-so below average girlfriend confessed to me. At that point of time I didn't gave much considerations because I saw my current gf as an convenient source of  sexual intimacy.After a year into the relationship, I became really good at flirting with women. In addition, I learnt to dress well and improve my style points. More pretty ladies around me, started to notice me and some even want to get naughty with me. However, I didn't gave in to temptation yet. Not because I'm a loyal bf. It's because my gf is a heavy burden who has low self-esteem and she has ocassional suicidal thoughts. Sometimes ,I wished that I can be more cold-blooded and just let her jump down. Then I will be set free from those shackles and nothing will hold me back from dating hot chicks. Given my current status, I seriously think I deserve a better girl.

This may sound very old fashion but i really hate it when my guy puts his arm around other girls' shoulders when taking photos. partly because i don't put mine around other guys and i dont like it when some guy (that i view as a friend) puts his arms around my shoulder. i dont want to be mad at him because it seems like a very small thing to argue about but i think that it is bothering me very very much.

I wonder.
I wonder if you ever felt emptiness. 
I wonder if you ever felt hopelessness. 
I wonder if you ever struggled to resist dropping me a text or a call.
I wonder if you ever talked about me to our friends.
I wonder if you ever faked a smile when you heard about me from them. 
I wonder if you ever get reminded of our memories.
I wonder if you ever missed me. 
Some days, I wonder why I'm still wondering. 
Other days, I just do.
Simply, I still miss you.

There's this girl I really like whose in the same faculty as me. She's pretty, smart, capable and nice - and after observing and talking to her for some time, I can gather that she is still single and searching for her guy.

Sounds like your normal confession? But wait, here's the plot twist.

You see, I am bi. I am already attached, and to a guy. We're together for quite some time already. Although we are in love each other, we frequently question whether our relationship is right, and if it is sustainable especially in this society. I know my bf will be deeply hurt if I tell him that I like this girl. In fact I am too, and I can't bear to break up with him over this but I just feel the overwhelming need to make my love 'normal'.

What should I do? What if she asks me out of the blue? Do I tell her that I am in a rs with a guy? I really need some kind advice on this....
-
 
To , 

No you won't be set free from your so-called shackles. You'll be guilty for life for making a girl end her own life. Please bring her to see a counsellor for her own sake or at least have the damn courtesy to initiate a proper breakup and set the poor girl free, because she clearly don't deserve an asshole like you.

I love to explore many kinds of sexual fantasy with my partner, like swing, threesome, parties and many others. Is it wrong to have such feeling? When we are young, shouldn't we try everything so we wont regret when we are old?

Recently I travelled to taiwan to meet up with my male coursemate, who is having an exchange over there. We went out together on one particular night to see firefly and he asked me, "can I kiss you?". I didn't agree with his idea, but I didn't decline his idea too. Hence he ended up french kissing me for quite sometime. I swear that It's a one-sided affair because I just merely opened my mouth only. It's not like I actively lick him back so It's not consider cheating right? My bf is going JCC soon, should I tell him this incident before he flies off to brunei or wait till he comes back from brunei?

I'm scared that my previous post has been filtered but admin please don't! I'm genuinely looking for advice here.

I had always thought I was unquestionably straight until I met that classmate. There was just something about the way she looked at me that was a bit shockingly electrifying and I didn't dare to overthink so I just kept really quiet around her. Even when she tried to make eye contact with me and strike up convos I would avoid doing so... I think deep down inside I knew that I was perhaps bi but I daren't admit to myself. That was perhaps a couple of years ago.

But yeah I guess such facets of one's personality cannot be kept hidden for long yeah? Recently she swept me off my feet with her charisma and humor... Didn't help that she makes it pretty obvious that she does take note of me and the subtle way she flirts is actually more slick than what men have been doing to me... She's a butch yes if you are wondering. Highly intelligent and very good looking. 

Gosh I am just feeling like a mess right now, guessing that it is mostly because i have always thought I was straight and everyone around me thinks so too. Now I am not so sure. Has anyone been in the same predicament? Some advice would be greatly appreciated. Didn't expect this kind of 'crisis' to pop up when I am 23 years old. 

Straight (is this just a phase), bi, or femme lesbian (yes I dress femininely and I have been told that I am very womanly for someone my age)? Confused soul right here. ><

My EC (L) sits next to me in lectures, by coincidence I guess. I will feel a little flustered that I find it hard to focus on the lecturer. L has been initiating small talk with me and I'm secretly jumping for joy inside. Still feel awed by L because L is quite good looking and even participated in a pageant, while me on the other hand..just some average person out there, nothing special but yet L still talks to me. But I still can't help but to look forward to class every week!! 

Dear L, 
I want to say HI! Every time I see you enter the class, I actually am controlling and stopping myself from breaking out into a grin and greeting you. Please continue talking to me occasionally you really make my day. Maybe it's just coincidence or fate or what but I thank fate for letting me spend a little time with you, L. Stay cool, L 8) 
Until we meet again.

I hope this doesn't sound mean or anything, just some personal thoughts.

I honestly want to get into a relationship. I mean I have dated and they didn't work out. I know I am definitely slightly above average looking and sometimes (this is where I hope I am not crossing the line) I wonder how some people with really bad personalities or "not as socially deemed" good looking can get attach.

I guess I am still an evergreen and I am so tired of waiting for the "right" guy to come along... Any advice or consolation or anything of that sort?

My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I think used to think 'traditionally' of sex after marriage. Thus we remained virgin till now. 
However recently she keeps requesting she wants to have sex and would give me the very sad face when I keep rejecting her. I still prefer to have sex only after marriage and I talked to her about it (although she agreed but don't look really happy). And recently I noticed her behaviour changed abit. Like she would always come home way later and sometimes drunk. 
What should I do? Should I just be the same if talking still don't work? If she decides to have sex with other guys, it is because of my fault?

In response to , here's #laoniang 's POV:
I found Ian handsome even before we came friends.

Until today, I still find him attractive. He is both adorable and handsome at the same time. Unless he turns into a douchebag one day, I believe that he'll remain physically attractive to me for a long time to come.

I think the question isn't whether it is important to find him handsome or not. The question is: Are you still physically attracted to him? Can you be physically intimate with this man (and this man only) for the rest of your life?

Guys, do you guys ever got fingered by yr gf? Recently my gf love doing that after sex (at times with a dildo) and it's painful. I love her and I dont want to disappoint her so i let her do it. what should I do?

Is it important to find your boyfriend handsome?

I'm in love with my boyfriend but I don't know if I find him handsome. For those who are already married/in long term relationships, do you guys find that the attraction fades over time? How do you cope with it?

I notice lots of confessions about sex.

I understand the conflict.

But what if the conflict within me is simply the question of me just "wanting to be a good person" and trying to dispel the evilness from within my heart?

Hello NUS friends! I graduated from NUS Law in the last academic year and am now working. Although work is tough, life is relatively stable and I'm earning a comfortable amount. My social life is fine - I'm busy but still stay in touch with friends. But here's the issue... I want a girlfriend.

I broke up with my ex-girlfriend in 2013, after a long relationship that went down in flames. Ever since then, I hardened my heart to the idea of a relationship, focusing solely on school, work and securing myself a good job. I can't complain because those years were fulfilling and I did well for myself. But now, as I see peers in love, dating and getting married, regret is starting to set in. 

In school, it was really easy to meet people, particularly when I took modules at the main campus. It was not strange to speak to strangers in classes. Things are very different now. Its odd and awkward to speak to strangers in public and certainly creepier still to ask a random girl for her number. In the workplace, there are barriers and I don't think my colleagues or myself would countenance an office romance. Long working hours also limit dating potential - even those in relationships confide in me that they can't spend sufficient time with their significant others or worse, they don't have enough time to get to know their significant others. SO YES, ADVICE HERE! PLEASE GO AND DATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE IN UNI. 

I've tried dating apps, but it has never worked out. I suspect because there's little to go by except your photos and a short description, looks matter a lot. And I'm fat. I'm also troubled by the extremely cursory way people get to know each other on dating apps.

So here comes the crux of it - I want to get to know more people. Any advice on that? And also, being sort of out of touch, do looks matter a lot to girls, too? I'd like honest opinions. 

Lastly, and this is a shameless sell out, if anyone would like to get to know me or give me advice, I've created an email account just for this purpose: a0073408@hotmail.com.

This message is for a friend who is not perhaps a friend anymore. I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry and I know I may have hurt you. I know I ignored you and didn't talk to you and maybe I couldn't handle the kind of emotional strength that is needed to handle someone like you.. I can barely handle myself emotionally much less you.. I felt ignored by you as I felt you preferred the company of other friends and not mine..so I in turn chose the company of others and not you.But I felt you didn't need me as you clearly chose to make plans with other people and ignore me...which is fine and hence I kept myself apart from you because you hurt me too and I didn't want to hurt myself anymore. I didn't even think that it mattered to you but when you asked people to choose between your company and mine that's when I realized how angry you were at me...You are angry because I stepped away from you.. But u fail to realize that I stepped away from almost everybody emotionally...and I think you know why... and you of all people should understand why because you have done the same to me and another friend once since you felt hurt by us.. You cant even bear to be in the same vicinity as me.....why? I don't know if you are reading this but I just wanted to say its ok for friends to grow apart...but that doesn't mean we cant be civil to one another. It doesn't mean we ask our mutual friends to choose between either of us.. I have never ever asked anyone in my life to choose between you and me.. but you have and what's worse you have accused me of taking your friends away from you? We both know that's not true . You can choose to tell people whatever you feel like I just think you should know that I never have and never will harbor any negative thoughts about you...I have realized that maybe you and I are very different people and its best if we don't get involved emotionally and that's exactly why I stepped away from you...anyway I am writing this here as a last resort cause I know even if I tried to tell you this in person you are probably going to ignore me and walk off... I will respect the friendship that we once had because I think we did have one and I hope you shall do the same.

I understand that when you get into a relationship, you should not hold your partner to any expectations.

But I mean, if it's your anniversary then is it okay to want a small gift or just even a note? Is it too much to ask? Should you even ask??

Regarding NUS bus drivers. I know that they aren't the happiest bunch of people. But are they allowed to tell students to be quiet?

We weren't being particularly noisy, normal chatting noise level I guess. Furthermore this is a school bus right? When he signed up for the job, don't tell me he expected silence?

Just to elaborate. There wasn't any incident that justified the need for silence at that time, nor were there any mitigating factors for consideration.

I don't know if this will be posted, but just want to encourage the girl in my chemistry lecture, hope you can cheer up soon and be full of smiles again (: you look really cute when you smile! Have overheard some friends and realized you are currently going through a hard time with your break up. He is not worth the time and time will heal everything eventually (: don't tear anymore for him

I just got together with my bf this week, and am new at all this dating stuff. Just want to ask the NUSwhispers community how often do couples meet in school, because at this stage I find myself wanting to spend every moment with him, whereas he prefers to take it slowly.

It was the second time we met up... And I realised I'm starting to get attracted by your character

My friends asked whether we took a photo together yet. But nope, we didn't. I'm not sure whether is it too fast to do that and as a result you might be scared away.

Sometimes I wish i could know what others are thinking... Right now, I'm just kinda afraid to make any move..

I met my gf during orientation, and we got together later. However I also like another girl from my major. I think she also has positive feelings towards me. I wonder if it's possible to have the best of both worlds. Would girls accept this arrangement?
-
 
 To OP, perhaps before thinking if she's interested, think about whether you are truly interested in her. If not, you will be wasting her time, and your's too. But if you are, then why not? And make sure you plan the date well and leave a good impression. Speaking from my dating experience, good luck bro! ;)

People come and go, so they say. Some people walk in and stay for a short while, maximising their use of you while they can, and leave. Some stroll into your lives unknowingly and you two end up trekking across life's knolls and valleys as a team.

Unfortunately in my case, the latter scenario is like ordering a teh ping from The Deck and not having the fucking straw shoved inside already - it doesn't fucking happen! 

They say you need to work at maintaining friendships and what not, including taking the initiative to carve time out to catch up. But if you're always the one trying to organise meet-ups, isn't something wrong there? Why does that rule not apply to the "friends" then? Or perhaps it just means they don't deem me worthy enough of their time. That's a pretty galling prospect then. It has reached a point where if I don't reach out to anyone, I am completely forgotten; no one sends messages to me. Perhaps I'm non-existent in their reality.

I really want to have sex with my girlfriend. But I respect her decision to wait till marraige for both of us to lose our virginity(no hj/bj too). Sometimes I feel sad I can only self-release.

Ok so recently i started texting this girl i like. I didn't really know her that well before,and expected it started off slow at first, in the sense that she wasn't that responsive (one word answers and all) But over the past week we've been texting a lot more and  sharing more and more personal stories like childhood memories, interests, hobbies etc etc. I have not met up with her yet this sem as we're taking different modules. But based on what i just said do you think she may be somewhat interested? Would you tell someone whom you see as a "friend" all these personal stuff? Do you think i should ask her out some time? Advice needed please.

Would like some advice on the situation.
So I've been going out with this guy for a few times these two months. I've started to really like him and thought that we may become something more. However, recently I saw him out with another girl. He definitely saw me but just ignored me and quickly walked away with the girl, not holding hands or anything. I don't want to ask who that girl is because I don't want to sound so clingy or possessive, and I do understand that he has the right to see other people since we're not anything anyway. But the mixed signals are really getting to me. Can any guys shed some light about this? I have a feeling that I'm being played or am the "other woman" though. And yet he still texts me good morning and whatnot. If this is true, I need someone with an accurate perspective to tell me so that I know it's not all in my head.
-
 
If you are a guy, would you actually be interested in a girl who is two academic years ahead of you (but the same age as you, since guys usually go to army)?

Asking this out of curiosity, because recently there seem to be two pretty decent (and cute) guys who seem to have given enough hints for me to conclude that they are sufficiently attracted (?) or interested me and this really surprises me because I thought guys would usually go for younger girls (as I would for older guys) 

lol or does it not matter much at all?
-
 
I have a friend who either takes forever to reply (one day later) or blue-ticked us and never reply at all. 

These days whenever we plan an outing on group chat, he would always say he was busy. I understand that it is perfectly possible for him to be busy on all those 5 days we suggested. However, I think if he was sincere at all, he would have at least suggested a day he was free or at least reply to our messages when he has read them. 

Just wondering what we should do with this friend. No nasty comments please, this is a serious post asking for good advice on how to deal with this situation. 
-
 
Am I suppose to tell a girl that I am interested in her or let her discover it by keep staring at her? I don't understand how this social algorithm works......

Another question. Am I suppose to talk to my classmate when they sit beside me during lecture? What else do I need to do? Ask for their names and hobbies? If you see someone familiar, do we need to greet them?

Im a muslim student in a research group that tends to have group lunches for special occasions. As we all know, having a muslim in the group means you'll have to go to somewhere halal. Since im the first muslim the group has (at least since a long time), naturally, they've never considered this. Now that I'm a part of them, i feel guilty of having them to search for a halal restaurant every time we're planning for a group lunch. I also have trouble rejecting such lunch invitations cos... well, i don't think it's very nice... As an introvert, I have absolutely no problems with not being included for such gatherings. In fact, i will feel better if they're free to actually choose whichever restaurant they please. Yet, everyone's always so nice that it doesn't feel right...

Now that CACTUS is coming, I just want to say this to my dance partner.
I know you probably only see me as a partner. But ever since you asked me to a dance, you have always been my favourite partner. Not only because i feel you are the best, but also because I think we connect on a level deeper than just a partnership. Now that we have been partners for a period, and people have been telling me we look good together, I am wondering whether that is all we will ever be. 
I want to be more than cca mates, more than partners and more than just friends with you. I want you, probably more than I have wanted another guy. 
It really hurts me when I see you with any other girls. 

(To all the dancers out there, do you feel a weird attachment to your partners that seem to go beyond a normal level?)

Would like to know if anyone here faced/know of such problems regarding relationships and hope some advice or thoughts could be given. So umm i have been in continuous contact with this guy i met last year and my parents have met him before but it wasn't for a good reason. They found out he had borrowed money from me and i had lied to them quite a few times about me meeting him and i spilled the beans after their meet up with him. This matter has been disturbing me for quite a while now as there were a few episodes of drama between my parents and him (e.g my parents disapproving of him due to his character, abt the money lending issue previously). Now, im in a dillemia. My parents want me to cut all contact with him but i don't feel the need to. He still treats me like im his gf but i don't really know if we still are as his actions have changed ever since my parents shouted at him for lying when he was still in contact with me.

You know how in inside out, the dominant emotion for Reily is Joy, but her mom's is Sadness and the father's is Anger? Well I can slowly feel sadness becoming my dominant emotion, whereas anger is yours.

It's in the gradual decline and subtle loss of hope I've had over the past year or so. Where I quietly get lost in my own thoughts because I know that talking to you will only make you upset and angry at me, and that somehow it'll be my fault in one way or another. Telling you anything won't make anything better for me, it'll just make it worse. The slightest things set you off and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, trying to pick and choose my words and actions and friends. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm dancing on glass.

I have a handful of close friends who are participating actively in a cca and are working as part time tuition teacher at the same time. I am already in a cca, but not exactly active, meaning not vying for leadership roles or things like that. Just a really normal member. Personally I don't think I can manage my time well enough to juggle responsibilities a leader would have to carry and commitments to be made if I were to work. I want a change in my lifestyle. Should I spend more time on cca or spend time gathering more work experience? Or is it just me who can't handle study, work and cca all together.

Hi, this is not a confession but I'm just wondering if anyone has gone for counselling at NUS CPS before and if it's of any help? Thanks!

Has anyone been through breakups with the same person many times and still apologise that same amount of time to get that person back? 

I had been trying so hard to keep him, but recently, I'm getting tired and sick of it. Does he not love me? Why does he keep wanting to breakup? Should I just let him go?
-
 
Never knew how much I missed talking to you until I met you again recently. It sucks that we aren't as close as we used to be but it was still enjoyable talking to you after such a long time. You'll always be a great friend to me and I hope we get to meetup often in NUS be it a coincidence or not. 
-
 
I always tries to go out with my bf whenever he's meeting his friends, hoping that I will get to know them too and probably we can hang out together in the future. His friends and I are in the same school, so somehow we recognises each other but we hardly talk. I went out with his friends a few times but they don't initiate any conversation with me and I feel really awkward there. Does this means that his friends doesn't approve our relationship ? 
-
 
we used to be pretty close platonic friends, in fact you were the first person i felt comfortable sharing a few deeply personal issues with. meetups were exciting. a few years later you found a boyfriend and i was very happy for you. well i thought we could stay good friends.

not exactly sure what happened in the following months. i might have said something that offended you, or maybe it is just a harmless cause of desiring to spend more time with the love of your life, or maybe you're inundated with work. your replies to me were increasingly nonchalant, and you'd take full days to get back to me. we used to share common interests, but those interests don't seem to affect you anymore.

nonetheless you still have other interests which give meaning to your life even till now. so i'm genuinely still very happy to see you enjoying life with all these hobbies and with your significant other. honestly though, i am starting to feel irrelevant to your life, though you are still very much relevant to my life.

the signs that everything said above is legit have been pretty consistent. i promise that upon clicking "submit" i will, as the friend i've always been, give you the space to be yourself and be happy with life. i will not bug you with what used to be our common interests anymore, neither will i initiate a conversation unless necessary, but please let me know if you need anything because i'll oblige anytime! finally do not worry about me at all, because i have many things to look forward to in life as well. there ain't no time for me to submerge in a cesspool of loneliness.

Is it bad of me to feel this weird sense of glee after a couple I knew just broke up? Not because I had my eye on either of them or that I'm particularly close to them, but because their relationship was so sickeningly needy and clingy that it was a ticking time bomb? They were both bad for each other. Maybe I should have said something... (which probably would not have helped cos as I said we're not that close) but it's like a train wreck you know? You can pull the lever and change its course but instead you want to watch it crash and burn. Horribly. :)
-
 
Hi . I've been in a similar situation as you. I hope you don't mind me saying this, but it seems like a toxic relationship. If it eats you up inside, do talk to him. Otherwise, it may be better not to be friends. His comments already hint that he only sees you as a friend. If you want someone to talk to, let me know. :) 
-
 
I had been friend with this guy for really long. We do behave like couples and others think that way too, but we are not official. I'm more than ready to be attached with him yet at times he will randomly comment that we will/should never be official. I'm clueless why. It's confusing me and what should I do? 
-
 
hope this doesn't get filtered off. 

Guys, what would u do if you were me? 

I am still a Virgin despite my age. I have quite a decent look and built and never been into any intimate relationship before. Recently I meet this girl in uni, we weren't really an item but there were a couple of times I felt she crossed the border. First dinner date, I drove her home and in the car she was quite touchy with me. I didn't know what to do. She unbuckled my pants and started to stroke me and she kissed me until I came. Then she just leave the car and went home. On several other occasions, whenever we meet she would try to be very touchy and I always end up cumming at her disposal. Just last week, after a late night movie, she asked me to drive her to ecp, we stopped by the park and she started the whole episode again but this time she gave me a BJ and she fingered me. I feel this is not right but I cannot stopped her. After I came, she asked to drive her home. Well, I feel I m just a toy for her to release. Am I being stupid? I tried to stop meeting her but she keep texting me.

Do guys find a girl A (who is always alone for classes, lunch) less attractive than girl B (who is always with her clique), say their looks are both above average?

Or find girl A, who is slightly above average, to be less attractive than average girl B just because she is always alone?
-
 
Hey , 

Bro... I thought I was reading my own memory! Letterbox > messages > meetup > mute. 

Give it some time? If her replies aren't as used to be or worse; 'ghost' you. I don't think she's worth. The nerd in me thinks that since all possible scenarios are bad, 長痛不如短痛. It's not just respecting her choice, it's also about respecting your own feelings and not let it be played.

To the guy who wants some advises on how to see signs that a girl is interested. 

The thing is, if you're interested in someone (this applies to both genders), you should try to invite the person out politely for ..anything! Politely ask for what the other party is interested in, hang out, get to know the person, and progress on. 

Back to your question, it's honestly difficult to tell whether a person's genuinely interested in you just basing on text messages. Let me give you my personal experiences. I have learned not to trust and rely so much on text messages because several guys have texted me before, and this may just be my case, but things didn't always turn out well. So now I become cautious around text messages, until the person is brave enough to ask me out, or at least we still have face-to-face interaction, then I can trust the person and continue on with the messages. Does it mean that I'm not interested? No. It's just that text messages don't reveal so much of a person than face-to-face interaction. All I'm trying to say is, there are many angles in seeing this "ignoring message" thing, the best way is, ask the girl out and be genuine in getting to know her more in real life. :) 

Plus, I believe many people would feel delighted to be asked out. If she's uncertain about her feeling or don't have any particular one, give her some space and allow her to think about it. I believe it's time wasted on waiting for messages. Better be more pro-active (but not in an aggressive and invasive way) to get to know the person more. :)

Hope this helps! Cheers~

You know how girls are expected not to give sex to the guy so early in the relationship lest the guy loses interest after getting some? I believe it applies to guys as well, and trying to seal the deal too soon might cause the girl to lose interest if she realises that you're not too blessed in the, ahem, baby-making department. 
-
 
Girls, i need your advice (i'm a guy). What are some signs you will show, both in person and in text, that you just want to be friends with a guy and nothing more? I don't think you would totally ignore him right? More like you would still talk to him and reply his texts out of courtesy. Because of this it's a bit hard for me to tell when a girl is or isn't interested. Advice please (input from guys are also welcome).

somehow i  starting to feel myself dying slowly on the inside. i've been through too many hurtful experiences regarding friendship (i don't even know if the problem lies in me or what) and that has made me lose faith in people in general and somehow now i feel less and less wanting to make friends or maintain friendships with people because i just don't want to get hurt anymore. occasionally i see people on snapchat having fun with their friends while i'm just at home with no one to jio/no one to talk to and i do sometimes feel lonely. worse is that i already know the rhetorics to this problem, which are things like talk to more people have less distrust in people share with more people but the problem is like i felt like i've given up on those solutions too? day in and day out i feel like i've been reduced to just machines to carry out daily mundane tasks or to get something done and i feel like there's isnt much meaning to life (not suicidal but just feeling like life no longer has anything exciting to look forward to anymore)

sorry just had to rant.

Guys please make clear if you are single or attached..don't make the other party guess.

@ I think my situation is a bit like yours too! Except that this crush isn't from last SEM but like this sem and I also don't really interact much with him unless we bump into each other and talk! Actually I also don't know what to do ): as you said, if there's a long time not being with your crush it may die off and I really don't want to let him go.. He's also low key and i don't really know him very well so I'm scared that if I keep wanting to bump into him he will get creeped out by me also!! But I really want to try to do something, perhaps something small so it won't scare him but I don't know what to do and how ):
-
 
I started knowing this guy last sem and I from the very start, I found myself having a crush on him because he is talented and good-looking. Having had a few crushes in secondary school and JC days, I know crushes will disappear after awhile if you don't interact with the person that you're crushing on. I felt that this amazing guy is wayyyy out of my league. Subsequently I didn't see him much and even if I did, I didn't find the chance to chit chat or get to know him better :(

However, I recently got the opportunity to interact with him more since the new sem started! My crush on him not only came back, but also developed more and more. I found that he's not only good-looking, but has just my type of sense of humour :) He has a great personality, and a little bantering with him literally makes me smile for the rest of the day ^^

Thing is, I don't know if I should continue finding opportunities to bump into/talk to him, since he might find it creepy... Also, I don't even know if he's already attached (he's the low-key kind, just imagine the quiet and charming kind of guy that makes you swoon without having to do anything haha) so I'm afraid to express my liking/crush towards him. Those who have similar experiences in the past (and those who don't also can, haha), what should I do? I don't want to keep being indecisive and wasting time and pass up such an amazing guy :'(

Please give me some advice and hope that school has been kind to everyone so far! :D

To  someone who isn't interested may still reply, but take hours to reply, without giving a reason (e.g: I would tell someone I am sorry for the late reply if I were interested). 

Other signs... She gives you one worded replies. Or you find that it's a one-way conversation most of the time. 
-
 
How open are you to being introduced by friends who has friends who are interested in you? Personally it makes me uncomfy as i prefer to approach or "hunt" on targets i like rather than being introduced to people who are interested in me but dunno me... i m too old fashioned i guess...

Got rejected by crush after crush after crush.  I feel that I should stop looking for a SO anymore because my heart is dead..or does anyone out there have any advice?

I'm from a very conservative family and have been a good and innocent girl for the past 19 years of my life. However, a guy entered my life and showed me the pleasures of exploring one's body. He is not my boyfriend, just a friend. Is it advisable to continue such a relationship?  Considering that we never went all the way and he is extremely considerate towards my needs everytime. Thanks.
-
 
Just curious. Anyone would take the chance of dating a PRC (be it if you are local or foreigner) ? My childhood friend jokingly asked me to help her find a boyfriend in Singapore/NUS since I am here. So I thought I might as well try my luck and ask the community here.
-
 
 It sounded like my past relstionship. Just get it over with that guy, he doesnt seem to be worth your time. My ex was like that guy as well. He dont cherish the relationship at all, and thinking he has done nothing wrong by talking constantly to other girls on whatsapp. You have made a right decision to leave that kind of guy. You will find a better one. 
-
 
What do you do when the one person you want to talk to is ignoring you? You browse NUSWhispers for hours on end hoping that just maybe you'll read something from them. 
-
 
I'm starting to fall for this guy who has confessed to me..but he seems to be drifting away from me when I show my interest back.. What's wrong? 
-
 
I don't get it. Just because I'm scrawny and have a mushroom head hair doesn't mean that you can dislike me or give me that face. Who do you think you are? Yeah so what if you are muscular or pretty? Don't judge people. 
-
 
I feel so conflicted... My hormones are raging like crazy but after ORD-ing from NS I just can't find an outlet to pent my sexual frustrations (other than jacking off which is so passé). All my JC friends are guai kias and it's unlikely I can find a FwB from there. Atm I don't have many chances for interacting with the opposite sex and neither do I really pick up girls from clubs. It's come to the point that I'm considering hiring escort services. The most messed up part is I'm still a virgin. Someone help me PLEASE!!! I don't know what I might do next

I met her through Letterbox.
After chatting online for about a month, we decided it was time for us to meet up and supper. And we did. 
The meet up went really well. We ended up chatting for 2-3hours at a cafe (: 
We continued texting on a daily basis. But recently, her replies haven't been the same. Her replies became shorter and it seems like everything is going down hill....
In the past, she would initiate conversations with me. And its not the case anymore.... And i'm afraid to text her as I feel  i might be bothering her...?
What should I do? Honestly, i want to know her better and see how things go .... 

-Evergreen boy

I used to read NUSWhispers quite regularly, but not anymore. This is largely due to a handful of frequent commentators whom I've realized to be extremely toxic. Toxic in the sense of "toxic friends that everyone advises you to cut out of your life".

A common trait among these commentators is how they like to show off. Be it their assumed-to-be-correct liberal views against a conservative, their apparent abundance of sexual experience against a first-timer, their presumed intellectual prowess against a slightly dull student, or their self-proclaimed Very Successful Life against a struggling soul, without fail, their comments will appear to be giving advice, but between the lines subtly belittling the OP while stroking their own ego.

I hope to never meet these people in real life.

This is #ahgirl and i would like to share some of my opinion on sex. I know this is a frisky topic but i feel the need to rant and discuss this topic. I would start by sharing my experiences.

For me, i begin to discover my sexuality at a very young age(around 10?) I was caught playing with myself in the bathroom and was lectured by my parents. But it did not stop me from discovering my own body. I would say my sex drive is although periodic, relatively higher than most girls. 

Anyway what inspired me to write this post is probably because i just had the best sex of my life. And it's a result of communication. Yeap. Commuting and talking about sex with my partner. I guess i never really talk about it in terms of blatantly saying what i desire and love because of various reasons such as the way i am bought up or the exsisting stigma about this topic. 

Seeing how #laoniang had share her experiences, i would also like to share some of mine and hopefully have some new insights from NusWhisper readers. Let me know if i should go on and post more :)

I get extremely jealous sometimes over the fact that my boyfriend still occasionally contacts his ex. They've only broken up 6 months ago and she still has feelings for him which is what makes me mad. She knows about me but his friends do not. I hate it when his friends still randomly "OTP" them. I get very insecure and I've talked to him about it but he just kept telling me that he only has eyes for me. I know I shouldn't doubt him but I just feel so insecure and jealous I just can't help it. Any advice on how I can get over this feeling?
-
 
We have been together for 4 years. When we were in our first month, you have already started to talk to another girl and told me you like her. Well, I choose to break up with you. But cause of her coldness, you came back to me, asking for forgiveness and telling me you will not do it again. I trusted you. I waited for you when you were in NS. Then I thought things were good till you started texting other girls again. You can even ask a random girl at the bus stop for number. What do you really see me as? I told you it is ok for you to text other girls but just be honest with me about it. I asked you and you claim you did not when you obviously did. I have known you for such a long time, of course i know it when you lie. Do you really enjoy texting other girls so much? And whats more, you can tell me you are crying over our relationship when you say 'haha' on another chat? I wouldn have known all these if you never show me your chats. I have trusted you many tumes despite all these and you think I will never left you. This time round, I am serious. Really serious. I do not want to drag it anymore. I guess we do not have anymore feelings between us, it is just a habit. I hope you will give me my freedom and not be selfish to hold me back again. Wish you all the best. 
-
 
Do you guys think there is someone out there that is really "the one"?Or do we have to put in hard work to make someone "the one" ?
Saying this because I am sick of dating people who seem to have the "grass is greener on the other side" syndrome or people who gave up very easily. :(
-
 
Uhm...

If you want a person to go away, don't avoid him outright. Instead, just act natural. The more unnatural you act, the more I actually mind you. 

I understand that somehow or rather, things have become awkward as friends, but if you would want to avoid me, just be natural, really - I will just fade away, like many other acquaintances before me.

Trust me when I am typing here, that I am making a conscious effort to avoid you as well. I do not have a social media account, and I don't want to ask for your number for no apparent legit reason(that's a bit creepy to me).

If you act unnaturally, you are showing and emphasizing that you mind my presence. Don't do that. Take it from me. It's bad for your mental health, fretting over something that is unconfirmed. I do not want to end on bad terms on your side either.

I'll admit it, I liked you. Given that I have only known you for around half a sem, I really hoped to make an effort to know you better, to decide on things.

Unfortunately, because I fumbled, and became very nervous, I acted like such a despo in front of you, and made it so damned obvious as daylight that I was after you. That should more or less be the cause of your avoiding me, I hope.

I do not know if you'll even come across this, but all I can say is, not to worry. I will not disturb you again.

Confess to a girl on her birthday, and with a card? Unless she has a super huge crush on you to begin with, good luck.

It's her birthday and instead of saying "happy birthday", you said "I love you". Think of the shock, disbelief, and huge betrayal of trust if she only sees you as a good friend or perhaps an acquaintance. 

Try asking the new girl out on dates, and tell the new girl face to face next time. And read more nuswhispers, and watch "How I met your mother" (when Ted first met Robin). I'm making the assumptions that you have not gone on dates, and test ioi (indication of interest) enough before your confession of a lifetime. Honestly, I think being super direct, cheesy lines, or being flirtatious will work better than such sentimentality. 

It's fine, a lot of people have been a noob before too.

Best Regards,
BSG

I told my bf sex after marriage; He was fine with it and did not find any fl/fwb or jerk off to other girls. My previous ex kept trying to get me back; I distanced myself and made my stance clear. He trusted me when I said I will not go back to my ex; I really do mean it. We do not go on dating sites/flirt with others to look for cheap thrills; We find thrill in making each other happy. We have no problem communicating our thoughts with one another; After an argument, we will always patch things up with lots of love and try our best to change for the better. We know humans are not perfect; he loves me for who I am and I love him for who he is. We trust each other; I know he has my interest at heart and he knows I have his interest at heart.   

We are strong advocates of "己所不欲，勿施於人" (What you do not wish upon yourself, do not extend it to others) which in turn give us strong mutual trust. For those who have given up faith in relationships, don't give up! A relationship can be perfect (in your eyes) when you find someone with the same values and beliefs. 
-
 
Same ol bs. I have always been a person who doesnt have friends, lest close ones, of a different gender. Its probably cos in subconscious she's either an acquaintance or a gf (potential one). Thus, often dont understand how other guys have super close friends of a gender. As one gets older, makes me wonder should i have just taken the numbers game theory path (more gals one know more potential picks)
However, i m still one who believes in really getting to be focused and go for one that i m really interested. 
Typing this out makes it seems like brainless ranting, not sure how others with similar problem get around this.

My gay friend and I were playing Grindr & Tindr for fun the other day. He was the one who wanted to swipe but I ended up matching with a rly cute guy in NUS but graduated alr. Never met anyone from Tindr before but he seemed like a very nice guy. I wanted to meet him but had no mood to go out so he offered to cheer me up at my place. At this point, I really thought we were just friends. 

Have you ever bought something from the internet and when it comes in the mail, it's completely different from how you imagined it?Yeah well...all along I thought he was Chinese Singaporean. But to my surprise, and slight horror, he was a PRC.And in my heart I thought 'oh shit, can I send my shipment back?' 

But I'm so glad I didn't because that was like a really eye-opening experience for me. You know how Apply shifted their production plants to China? Yeah. I think I know why now. They really are very hardworking in the way his body was so fit, biceps so big and stamina damn zai. We were at it like rabbits. He's not at all like the common stereotype that  PRC are loud, rude & not very hygienic.  In fact, he was really funny and I admired his attitude ah. Idk how to describe but we talked about what its like working and managing your own finances. Totally husband material with boyfriend material face.

We had dinner at the hawker and went grocery shopping together & I swear to God,that was one of the best dates I've ever had cos I don't feel like my personal identity is subsumed at all being around him. i.e. i dont feel the need to eat what he eats or behave in a particular way, like what he likes etc. 

I have mad respect for PRC guys now.
-
 
How do you distinguish between dating someone and hooking up with someone? I've been seeing this guy for a few times and sometimes we just go out for dinner and sometimes we hook up, so I've always assumed that we are just acquaintances hanging out. We don't see each other that often because we're both busy with work. Just recently, he asked me along to his friend's birthday gathering and that confused me. I mean, would you bring an acquaintance/hook-up to meet your friends? I'm currently not seeing anyone but I'm not very sure about him, and I'd never asked because I don't think I have any right to ask him that. It's his own business on who he wants to date anyway. I'm just confused about his actions and my own feelings. What do you all think of this situation?

I am the OP of . No i don't go around telling people i wish to do a phD. I say it only when my friends ask. The issue is that my mom don't want me to say that i wish to do a phD even if they ask, because of how society views women who are highly enducated but yet unmarried. And to make myself clearer i already intended to stay single so it doesn't matter whether i can find someone or not. So you see the problem now? Its the fact that my mum wanted me to lie to my friends about my intended career path as she believe society in generally still don't think too well of such women. Is my mom being too traditional? Or is she afraid that i cannot find someone? Thus using the story that society badly labels highly educated yet unmarried women to scare me? Please advice on how i can talk to my mum about this issue, like why can't i just be honest if my friends ask for my intended career route.
-
 
Would you choose someone who likes you or someone you like? 

If it matters, I am female. And quite perplexed over two parties. 

I hope you all don't think it's some first world pains. But I ask because I don't want to lead anyone on. 
-
 
Saw quite a number of posts on attached guys texting other girls and I must say I'm guilty of that as well (I'm a girl btw). 

Even though my position is a bit different in that I don't take the initiative to talk to guys,  I play along with them and entertain their flirty messages.   I still find it fun to do so and after all,  enjoy the attention.   My position is the as long as I am not really physically cheating on my boyfriend and actually tts those guys as friends only,  it is of no harm. 

Of course,  I know my boyfriend will hit the roof when he finds out about all these.  So I guard my phone very fiercely and chide him for not respecting my privacy when he looks over.  Then again sometimes when I ask him to trust me,  I do feel a tinge of guilt over my behaviour. 
-
 
 hey, the girl is definitely overboard. Trust me on this. I was in your shoes, except that she was not my good friend. Things happened and she made her advances despite knowing about us. In the end, no matter how unbelieveable, my heart was destroyed. I would never want you to go through the same thing as i did, so go talk to your boyfriend about it. Stop things before everything bad comes around.
-
 
I hate my gf's bff. She is a terrible influence, always trying to convince her to drink and go clubbing. what should i do?
-
 
I confessed my feeling to the girl I like on her birthday. I wrote the birthday card (inside are my birthday wish & my confession) and asked one of her friends to give her. It has been 4 days but she still keep silent, and I feel very bad. The problem is this semester we hardly see each other face-to-face due to the timetable. Can anyone tell me what really happen in the girls's mind (she needs time to think or she ignores my confession) ? Also, what should I do now (like how long should I wait her reply before directly message her, or what I need to do after that) ?
-
 
Guys I have a serious question.

You know how people always say, don't listen and get affected by what other people say, judge your relationship on your own. 

But what if, the things they are telling me, are things that my boyfriend himself told them? And they are trying to warn/advise me not to get associated with him since they know more about him. 

Just for reference, things I'm talking about include:
1) he used to keep his previous exes as fwb when he was with his ex. 
2) after being attached with me, he told them that he was going to teh neh neh with his friends one night (he didn't tell me about this)

I had no clue about all these things they are telling me. It's easier said than done to not listen to others. I asked my boyfriend, what have you been telling these people about yourself? He blamed me for listening to them. I'm just asking from him, a commitment that he is done playing around and is willing to be serious with me. So far, no reply. I'm not afraid of letting this go, but what do you guys think? Should we just turn off what people say about your other half and judge for ourselves? In this case I feel like I'm just waiting for something bad to happen so that I can prove that my friends have been right about him all along and I couldn't see it.
-
 
 
Choose someone who loves you. Because someday when the world feels like its crushing on you, only someone who loves you more than you love him will support you more than you will ever support him.

-
 
, I dislike how guys always think that "thrill, novelty and fantasizing that make me excited about the other girl" is justifiable for their action. To be honest, that could be mentally cheating y'know? Let's assume that it is not, you shouldn't be doing stuff that you know your girlfriend will be upset or uncomfortable. Put yourself in her shoes and you will know it hurts. If you really care about her, please stop now. Texting is nothing wrong, if you merely treat the other girl as a friend and nothing more. Anyway, I think relationship is based on trust and respect. If your girlfriend knows about your "texting" and does not object to it, I guess you're fine. After reading your confession, I realize I am the happiest girlfriend of all! :D And nope, I'm happily attached, there's no need for "brief moments of curiosity".
-
 
Many of my friends and I(average looking)have never had a bf and also can't seem to find one?? :( like 0 guys are interested. i have been joining ccas and stuff to get to meet new people but there's just no one suitable, and it kind of defeats the purpose to continually join more stuff with the intention of finding a bf. I know this sounds despo but I don't want to be forever alone till I'm old:'( doesn't help that I'm in fass and people say it's gonna be even harder to meet someone in the workplace... 
-
 
Does liking someone necessarily mean you gotta have butterfly in your stomach everytime you see him? Or ask him out? 

I felt that way towards a guy in my class at the beginning of last year. Then in the next sem, we became close friends. But the closer we got, the less nervous I was with him until I don't feel nervous when I'm around him anymore. I could openly ask him if he wants to study together or have lunch or whatever without feeling nervous. If he says he can't make it I don't feel bad or anything. If I see him with another girl or getting closer to another girl I strangely don't feel jealous. But I do think about him sometimes. So I honestly don't know how I truly feel about him. Maybe I just care about him as a friend? Or is my feelings for him now actually deeper than it was at the start? 
-
 
to 

Some guys "spread the net wide" by indicating interest in all or almost all girls and then focusing their attentions on the the most attractive ones amongst the girls who reciprocate their interest. My frank guess is that the guys who are unresponsive happened to receive replies from girls they were more attracted to. Or they could just be busy with their lives or bored with the app. 

Either way, don't lose hope. Not all guys do that and there are many guys that will pay full attention to their conversation with you once matched. I personally find the first method above very exhausting and overwhelming. Good luck :)

I want to kill myself. My parents are driving me to the edge. I have depression but I don't know how to cope without acting strong on the outside. I'm afraid if I let my facade fall, my entire defense mechanism will come down and I will then drop deep into depression and suicide. Help. 
-
 
 I was one of those who posted about texting with a girl though I'm attached. Honestly, I don't think I'm cheating. I still love my girlfriend. I guess it's the thrill, novelty and fantasizing that make me excited about the other girl. I've not made any move, so it's not cheating on my gf. Come on, I'm sure alot attached ppl have their own brief moments of curiosity.
-
 
Would love some advice from the guys. 

I am texting this guy regularly. We chat on another social media platform... I can see whether he read my message a not. He take ages to reply sometimes. But i know for a fact that he was online on whatsapp (last seen.. i am a stalker, i know). So basically he can be active on other platforms but yet not reply me. What does it mean? Is he just busy? Or hes delaying his responses to me? I am sick of waiting for his replies sometimes. But i like him a lot.. so despite me telling myself no, i should stop texting him, i still do it. 
-
 
We are not even in a relationship yet I still miss you so much after you said you hope to remain friends. It has been three months but I still think about you. I told you I might distance myself in the future because the friendship is causing me misery and you said you understand. I am really confused because I really hope you will text me but at times I am thankful that you initiate nothing. This allows me to get over you easier. 

Sometimes I wonder do you feel bad on your side too? Do you feel terrible losing me as a friend or are you nonchalant about it? I hate that I am so over protective and is always worried about you. Whatever you do or happen to you should not be of  my concern:(
-
 
Don't ever come apologizing to me again okay? Background: Toxic relationship with my first ex on and off for 3 years. He will go "hot" during mid-sem 2 by apologizing and activing chasing me again then goes cold again when I accepted him and break off with me coldheartedly(suddenly blocked me from all social media and phone) just before valentines in january third time already?! Ya, thanks for your enthusiasm from preventing me to recover properly and finding or accept anyone on a real date for valentines three years in a row. Don't come crying for me again. I'm so disappointed by myself for being so tasteless. Oh and this time I'm determined to block you completely too.
-
 
How do you differentiate between love and friendship?

Lately I find myself becoming more confused about my feelings for a particular girl. I enjoy her presence a lot and see her as someone who needs protection. 

The problem is that I can't seem to keep the conversation going when I'm alone with her. I can easily strike up conversations and jokes with other female friends and I guess most people would think that I'm an outgoing person. We spend quite a lot of time together, but the awkward gap between us doesn't seem to dissipate. Most of the time the conversation would end swiftly and we would drift back to the lonely confines of our smartphones. Occasionally, we'll show each other stuffs on fb and insta and laugh about it.

The uneasiness doesn't seem to settle and recently I find myself wanting to avoid having to be with her alone because I get tired ofthe silence that appears so frequently. 

I'm confused. I find myself fond of her and yet I don't have the courage to build a relationship. My friends mocked about me being a "coward".

But you see, I'm not afraid of rejection, and neither am I afraid of losing a friend. What I am afraid of is a relationship that drains emotions and hurts others. 

Someone told me that "confessed faults are half-mended". I'm willing to confess both the fault and my feelings. But I'm just not willing to let it remain half-mended.

Looking for advice and some perspectives here!
 I'm friends with this girl. She used to be close friends with my bf, then they drifted. In yr 3 or so, she started becoming good friends with me.. But very soon, she began approaching my bf again, asking for car rides to school, asking for homework help, relationship help, yadayada. She was attached at the time, and so much that I found her behaviour rather annoying, I tried my best to close one eye. I told myself perhaps some are just more sociable than others.

However, she began to overstep. A 'catch up' dinner became a weekly request to meet up. Her 'feeling surprised' warranted a clutch and squeeze of my bf's arm. Her convo asking for homework help became her trying to do some HTHT. In the midst of the sem, her relationship also ended. This led to more requests to meet up. One particular incident I remember, was where she met up with me for lunch, whilst secretly asking my bf out for dinner. And she did not even have the courtesy to tell me about it!

Being rather non-confrontational, I briefly brought up the topic during the next time we met, however she seemed totally unforthcoming, and so I dropped the topic quickly. However, even knowing I disliked her actions, she continued asking my bf out for meals, even twice in this week immediately following my attempted confrontation! Later, I even found out that she had attempted to bad mouth me to my bf... ~.~

I've seen her do this occasionally to other guys who are similarly attached. My bf has also showed me her msgs, and to his credit, he remains neutral with his replies and his replies do not suggest that he treats her as anything more than a normal friend. However, her msgs clearly sounded like those you would send to a bf.

It really irks me that she persists with her behaviour despite knowing it affects the relationship between my and my bf. And even tries to aggravate it by claiming to be very understanding and will not meet on that particular day if his gf is being so petty about it (but requests the next day to have dinner again), etc. And all these while she maintains a semblance of a friendship with me!

I have tried my best to Ignore her behaviour, but this issue has caused me great distress and even affects my sleep at night. Is she being too much, or am I the petty one? Please give me some help on this! What do you think is her purpose in all these actions? And what can I do about it?

And if she's merely looking for friendship, why does she adopt the same tone one would use with a bf?

-
 
There's this girl I know who looks just slightly above average, but loves to lead guys on. She is disillusioned to the fact that these guys are attracted to her by the way she intentionally behaves towards them, and not because she is particularly attractive or desirable. Also, she loves pretending like she's single, loves attracting different guys and leading them on and changing boyfriends again and again. It probably makes her feel good to see guys chase her blindly. 

If you're so insecure, fix yourself first. It may not be obvious to you but it's obvious to everyone else you are seeking some kind of validation through the number of guys you attract. Your actions are revolting to some of us guys who can see through the pretence. Also, you're too skinny to the bones that sometimes it hurts my eyes to look at you.

But seriously, given that you have to settle down for good someday, do some soul searching and ask yourself why you seek that kind of validation. It's unhealthy in the long run and I don't think any guy in this world can live with a girl with this kind of problem.

So I met this guy at a dinner party which my friend planned. We were dressed to the nines. Formal attire. There's where I met the most candid yet adorable guy I've ever met. It seemed as though we hit it off. Till I found his Facebook where his girlfriend photo was plastered on his profile photo. So I took the hint, I backed off and went into stand-off mode. Girl code right? Don't flirt with another girl's boyfriend even if you don't know her. Months down the road, found out that they broke up before the party. He didn't have the heart to change the photo. I get it. Had a seriously rough break up about a year ago. We hung out with friends a couple of times since. Seems as though I let it fizzle out and he wants to jump into the player pool. A relationship isn't something he is looking for. It only makes sense to turn my back and walk away right? But I can't stop thinking of him. Should i be bolder and make a bigger move on him?

Why is sex so addictive? Passionate, arousal and forms of love all at once. Right after, everyone of them vanished immediately. Problem is, the girl wasn't my girlfriend, but my ex-colleague.

Hi everyone, I need your help here. I really want to have a pet as my companion but I live on campus. Is there any good advice? Thank you!
-
 
I need help. Third parties are the worst beings on earth. People who have the tendency to be unfaithful should never be in a relationship to begin with. It's easier to get over a break up.

Am i overthinking or what? 
The story goes like this: He asked me out to catch up after so long ever since i rejected him few years back. And we subsequently went out a few times together. He even came to attend my event straight after his bookout and was expecting a meal together or something?? but i already had another date with a friend. 
And now, he shows much concerns to my problems...

Any advice?
-
 
To , what was your reply towards him/her: was it really a yes to the date? 
-
 
I need advice pls

I like this guy and I get really excited whenever I see him(: he's like sporty and smart also since he's like in medicine... We talk face to face whenever we meet but when I text him we can't even start a convo>< what should I do to approach him? Because of different course I don't see him a lot also :(

Hello everyone I need some serious advice from guys. Ever since I started texting guys, I realised that all of them have the same habits.
1. They're online but take forever to reply you.
2. They come online, don't read your text, then go offline again.
3. They come online, read your text, but go offline without replying till later. 

I've asked some of my friends who told me that guys are bad at multi-tasking but I would like to know if it's true/ the real reason. I mean how difficult is it to just reply to texts? 
-
 
I've realised recently that I truly love my boyfriend. Why? I'm a crazy cat lady who loves cats and befriends strays and is following about 40 different youtube channels for cat videos, but my boyfriend is so allergic to cats that he can't even get within 10m of a cat without being incapacitated for the rest of the day. And so I was lying in bed with this random thought about whether I'd rather keep cats in the future or be with my boyfriend forever, and I knew that I'd give up cats in a heartbeat for him. Kind of a stupid thing to make me realise this, but apparently my mind goes by cats-for-scale for importance.

I cant stand it.

All these guys in relationships who post stuff about texting other girls, wanting to date them, BUT have a girlfriend. WHAT?????!!!!! you already have a girlfriend, why the f*** are you even texting her? Your eyes should only be for your girlfriend and no one else. NO ONE. If you really want to text her, then you don't deserve your girlfriend. Break up with her. Its only fair. I get super pissed off at guys who cant keep their junk in their pants. F***ing bastards who spoil the majority of guys names'.

Any of you also feel bad for falling in love because you know you're not the best for the other party.

Have good feelings towards a girl for some time. We can talk on and on for hours, about everything in the world. Although we don't meet everyday, we keep in touch every now and then, texting about exams, and random stuff. She's also pretty and curvy. She excites me. I really wish I can ask her out for regular dates. But I can't.

Because I'm already attached.

Got to know this girl from a math lecture who's really pretty and click well with me. After some stalking found out she's a lesbian with 2 years gf. Fml.

With valentine's day coming up and me still being as evergreen as before, it looks like I am going to spend it all by myself again. 
-
 
Here's a question for the guys- what boundaries should a girl have when making friends with a guy to ensure that it remains purely platonic? I do not wish to lead anyone on. Thanks!
-
 
is there a way to view someone's timetable?
-
 
Are guys intimidated by ladies who are decisive, know what they want and unafraid to go for it? Whenever I go out with a guy, either friend or date, I'm a bit afraid of emasculating the guy. I'll offer to pay and I decide where we go only if the guy cannot decide. But then again, like, aren't we all talking about and advocating gender equality?
-
 
Dating question - 
So I've got matches who indicated interest in me, but when I indicated interest back, there is no reaction, lukewarm at best. 

To those who would recommend I initiate contact first, FYI yes I did, and responses just die off, I can tell when someone isn't motivated to continue this interaction. 

Anyone can shed light on what these guys might be thinking? I'm so lost and defeated.

On a random reflection why people tend to meet their partners overseas. Quite a few people I knew met their partner overseas (including myself). Being in another country gives you the feeling of absolute freedom (of course this is exaggerated) but the uplift of restrictions and responsibilities make you feel akin to that. 
The word 'adventure' comes into play. You would hardly say,"Let's have an adventure" in your own homeland because things are hardly new. You might be doing new things, going to new places- but some things like your companions remain constant. Overseas, everything is new. A new you, a new adventure, a new companion etc. More importantly, you actually realize it and appreciate new things. Things become refreshing-not only to you, but others' view of yourself too. 
With a new you, you had to build new friendships and relationships again. This gives you the chance to better control your social skills. Forced in a new environment, you had to make friends than break them. 
With all these factors in play, you feel closer when you meet your partner during one of those 'adventures' you had. Naturally, there are some assumptions here but this is just what I have observed.

Guys, question for you all. 
My boyfriend is a good bro to his bros. He's spontaneous and enjoys hanging out with his bros. The bad part is that his bros like to go nightclubs and dodgy places; places that girlfriends typically are not happy to let their boyfriends go to. My boyfriend is not the type to firmly reject when his friends suggest going to such places.  I told him how I don't like him to go to such places, esp to Bangkok where it's 100% certainty that his bachelor (or not) friends will want to go to those red light districts and engage in questionable activity. We have come to a consensus that he won't go to such places a few weeks ago. Today he suddenly told me that he wants to work on earning trust from me, so that I will trust him enough to let him go to Bangkok with this bunch of buddies of his. Honestly I was saddened by this statement. What do you guys think he means or what is he trying to do? 
-
 
Sometimes I am scared that my partner will settle for someone better for me.  In today's society, I am afraid that it is easier for people to settle for someone better. I hope it is just me being insecure. 
-
 
I have a friend who is rlly dependent. Its like she's not used to being alone and so she always looks for me to eat or for study sessions. Sometimes I just want some alone time and when I reject with either an excuse or reason, she finds some other ways to persuade me.. Advice please? 
-
 
My boyfriend is a very distant guy, he has few friends and I'm his closest one. He used to be warmer to me but after many arguments, he is his cold distant self with me now. I've brought this issue up with him but he just claims this is his personality and I'll have to just accept it. Other than this problem, we also don't share many interests so I have doubts about whether we will last. When I confide in him my problems, he just brush them off. I brought all these issues up with him and I know he's not willing to try to be different. I know I also have my own set of flaws but how can i keep this going if he doesn't even want to talk? So I initiated a breakup with him recently, and he refused to let me go and told me we can't break up. How do I sustain this relationship? 
-
 
Dear Ver_...
U r pretty. We don't talk...but I like u. But I'm starting over. Please don't be angry. I don't know.
-
 
so after reading  i went to watch Man Up (also because i was trying not to do school work) and i really liked it, despite the unrealistic ending.

the film resonated with me a lot - i took an extremely long time to get over my previous relationship because i didn't truly believe that i would meet someone better. half of the time i replay the good memories from the past, and the other half of the time i am cynical about the future. and i was also super risk-averse and self-conscious about putting myself out there. i always wanted to do things right, but never actually doing them because i would be over thinking things, before eventually putting off any plans i might have had.

and recently i have been trying to put myself out there a little more. baby steps, but i actually put my thoughts into actions. i tell myself that all the judgements you are feeling are actually just your imagination. nobody cares (enough to judge you). and that makes things easier, of sorts, getting over yourself. 

signed up on an online dating app recently, just to see how things go, and to try to know new people, just to get back onto the dating scene. well, so far things haven't been super positive (i.e no dates yet), but i'm not going to quit so soon. i know that part of me still doesn't quite believe that the future is going to be great, but at least despite that, i am still trying to make it better? 

so other than just ranting about my emotional state here, i guess any comments on how i can do this better/ how i can meet more people are also welcomed?
-
 
What does it mean when someone asks you out for a date, and you say yes, but then you don't hear anything from that person again? Like no follow up with any day or anything?
-
 
Would you consider starting a relationship with an exchange student? I just started studying here at NUS and have noticed that Singaporeans are very attractive. There's one guy in particular who is in 2 of my modules and happened to sit nearby for all lectures so far. Is it a good idea to even bother getting to know him? Everyone I've talked to says long distance relationships are doomed to failure. Should I save myself that pain and not get my hopes up? Would he even consider it?

I can't wait to get married so that I can get away from my psychotic parents.

@15223 everything you said struck a chord and feels familiar to me. Just hang in there, you're not alone. I'll be your friend if you want to :) we'll figure out a way to get in touch if you are interested!

"The truth is that the more intimately you know someone, the more clearly you’ll see their flaws. That’s just the way it is. This is why marriages fail, why children are abandoned, why friendships don’t last. You might think you love someone until you see the way they act when they’re out of money or under pressure or hungry, for goodness’ sake. Love is something different. Love is choosing to serve someone and be with someone in spite of their filthy heart. Love is patient and kind, love is deliberate. Love is hard. Love is pain and sacrifice, it’s seeing the darkness in another person and defying the impulse to jump ship."

Guys and Girls, I hope this quote serves you well in times of adversity. Sure, it's never black and white in any relationships. But if you decided to be with a person, decided to love her/him. I begged you to be patient. This is coming from someone who have quite a few failed relationships because I refused to fix my own mistakes, only to keep looking for someone even better out there. I thought i had tried my best when in actual fact I didn't really. Looking back, there was this one time where for quite a while, I thought she was the one. But as time goes by, i began to see many of her flaws which i thought at that point in time was an absolute deal breaker. But I failed to see that she was still the same girl i fell in love with. Witty, funny and loving in her own ways. The constant fights that plaque the last few months of our relationship completely made me forgot about all the good times we had. I thought she had changed. But on hindsight, that was her defying her impulse to jump ship. I wish I hadn't let you go :( Sorry

I stopped going to class this year-
because I know we cannot be together for life
because I need to be away from you
but I miss you

oh 8912, how i sorely wish you would come back. i miss the banters we had. would you come meet me at the same place as we normally would say, monday at 12?

Dear op of , time can heal almost everything. In the past semester I thought I will never get over him, that I will always get that weird feeling in my stomach whenever I see him at school. I thought I will never be ok. I didn't see him during the holiday and recently, I found out that he got back together with his ex and surprisingly, it doesn't hurt that much anymore. So, just focus on one step at a time. I know it might sound impossible now, but things will get better. One day we will all be fine. *hugs* 
-
 
When reading NUSWhispers, I often come across confessions which sound like they could have been from my friends. Sometimes they even describe my own thoughts so accurately that I wonder if I accidentally posted it in my sleep or something. 

What's sad is that I secretly wish some confessions were from certain people in my life. E.g. when an OP says he likes a girl, I'd fantasize that he might actually be my crush - and God forbid - talking about me. The possibility is near zero la but I guess this is one aspect of anonymity that makes it so addictive!
-
 
I always thought that guys liked girls who are soft and feminine, so whenever I go out with someone I like I subconciously act more feminine and shyer instead of being myself. Recently I confessed to a guy I liked but he rejected me cause I wasn't his type. Apparently he likes girls that are more outgoing and outspoken which is how my real personality is like. This is the ultimate like 'just be yourself' and fml. What do I do now?

And now I'm confused. So what are shy girls out and outgoing girls in now? Then why do I feel like if I'm too outgoing guys will friendzone me?

Please help out this clueless girl to navigate the hazardous Singaporean dating scene. I'm so frustrated!
-
 
I am really dejected and stress recently. Nobody seems to believe me when I tell them about it because I always put on a smile on the outside. I feel so alone sometimes and this really suck! :( I miss the times when I was in JC. I had friends then. Now I don't; the friendship that I have here are all superficial. I just need to rant about this because I know that I can get through this with time. I'll find my friend somewhere and stop feeling so lonely.

#thingsilearnfromrejections

note: this is from a guy's perspective and I thought by typing out all this would be therapeutic and cathartic for me, and maybe it can help someone out there too :) 

1. don't be the rebound.

Rebounds seldom if ever work out and some of the reasons why is because:

1) She haven't really moved on and will subconsciously project the feelings/image of the ex onto you. And the worst thing that can happen is when comparisons start to surface eg: "my ex-bf use to do this and that for/with me, why can't you do the same." 

2) She still has a lot of emotional baggage and is just not ready to be in a relationship yet and this could due to a myriad of reasons such as there wasn't any closure or she just needs more time. 
The amount of time needed to move on is different for people and you shouldn't force or pressurize the other party to be in a relationship with you if they are just not ready. 

3) She gives you signs of interest but the reality is that she jsut misses the feeling of being in love and the routine of a relationship

tl;dr: if you can, try to avoid being the rebound or using others as a rebound. 

-
 
what does it mean when a girl doesn't blue tick and doesn't reply also?
-
 
I thought things were done when my ex and I broke up. That we will go our separate ways to let ourselves heal, and when we were ready, we might be friends again. It was supposedly not a bad break up.

But right now she's spreading so much false information about me, exaggerating and dramatizing the things that I did, or in some cases I didn't even do those things but she said I did.

And she also has, among her friends, accused me of spreading false rumours about her when I haven't. The thing is we don't even have mutual friends whom I'm close to, so she couldn't have known what I told my close friends. We are from different faculties, so our closest friends don't mix. And mind you, I never spoke ill of her, and never accused her of anything or slandered her when talking to my friends about the breakup.

So now I'm being portrayed as the bad guy and she as the victim, when I never did anything wrong. With her big mouth (yes rude but sorry not sorry), her whole faculty probably thinks very badly of me.

What am I supposed to do?
-
 
I've been struggling to get over being cheated on. It's like a scar. I don't think I can ever get over it. It'll always be there. I am so embarrassed, I hate spending time in school so that no mutual friends can see me in school. I wanna have more confidence in myself, more confidence in us, that I'll never be hurt again. Any advices? 
-
 
I need a bit of advice :/ My family is quite well-to-do, not super rich, but money is not an issue in my family. My boyfriend is not as rich, his family isn't super poor but they are quite thrifty. It is obvious in the relationship that i come from a higher social status than he does. There's no problem with that, we both know it and he even calls me atas girl playfully sometimes. However sometimes when we go out and eat (can be as casual as a hawker centre) I pay first, and he doesn't offer to pay me back. I usually don't say anything but it's been becoming increasingly frequent and I've been starting to remind him that he owes me money. He'll say things like oh yeah i forgot i'll pay you later, but then he doesn't pay me back. Am I being too calculative? I don't like bugging people for money too :(

TL:DR Life isn't a smooth sailing journey and it doesn't have to be. Do what you like and accept what you don't if it can't be changed

I always been wanting to share this post but after reading SP confession , 166 https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=738624486239751&id=329564370479100, I decided to share this story.

I joined a CCA for the entire 3 years of my poly life. I faced many problems in this CCA. I was disliked by the club members, coaches, seniors. The timing was also very bad. My lesson on Friday ended at 12pm but my CCA starts at 7pm. As I live far from SP, I had to stay in school for the entire 7 hours. Imagine people saying, "TGIF" at 12pm but I could only went home after 9.30pm.
 
That wasn't all. I have a weak stamina and several people actually gave up and quitted the CCA halfway because of that. Moreover, many of my friends changed CCA throughout their poly life.

Imagine the amount of influences I had to change a CCA?

Not only did I joined the same CCA for the entire 3 years of my poly life, I also went for training even during holiday despite living far away from SP.

Many things in life aren't perfect. Many things come with flaws. To commit to one CCA, what ever keeping you there(which in my case was interest) must be stronger than what is chasing you out(in my case social exclusion, timing, distance from home, stamina, peer pressure)

This advise also apply to a relationship. A relationship isn't a smooth sailing journey. Your partner will bound to have some flaws. 
-You might end up having less time for your other friend(social exclusion)
-He/she might be late often(timing)
-He/she might live far from you(distance)
-You might want exercise with him/her just to spend more time with her even if you aren't fit(stamina)
-His/her friend might not like you(peer pressure)

When that happens, ask yourself this. Can you accept those flaws?

I am not encouraging you to find flaws with your partner and leave. I am telling you to have a realistic view of relationship and hopefully, you can tolerate some of the flaws and continue the relationship if you really like the him/her.

-
 
What do you do when you miss someone a lot? And that someone is already attached. And you just can't seem to forget that person no matter what. Its just do difficult. 
-
 
To  and anyone yearning and pining for someone else,
Over-dependency on a certain person is kind of like addiction. Try watching this short (4min) video from 1:46 (or from the beginning :) ) for some good advice!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-g5V27Jyus#t=1m46s

Have more friends and connections: the more relationships you have, the less attachment you have to any one person. To start getting rid of attachment, go and try new things! Finding a passion/hobby will take your focus off that certain someone/something.

Best of luck!
-
 
Sometimes I really wonder what's wrong with me. I'm not a 24/7 mugger with participation in some CCA (can't make it too obvious here). I don't have many close friends and may not be socialising around much, but i still meet friends every now and then. When I see friends getting attached, I just wonder when it would be my turn. That isn't to say I'm extremely desperate/needy, after all I do recognise that some things can't be forced.

To make things worse, I think I have a crush on this girl whom i'll be working together with this sem for quite some time. The thing is, there's this guy A who has alr made his intentions pretty clear that he likes her? (but i never dared to ask anyone abt their progress) And another guy B whom I think is like me, maybe unsure of what to do but may have some interest in her as well. Both guy A and B happen to be my friends.

For those going to bash me for being so passive, let me just say that I wanted to get to know her better (i knew her since last year, maybe i waited too long alr), and secondly, i can't possibly confess at the expense of the progress of our project/working relationship. Maybe we aren't meant to be, but when I think of this sometimes it does hurt.

Admin u can filter this if u want, I just needed to let it out somewhere.

To , 

I can understand how you're feeling now as I was in a similar situation as you a year back.

I cried all the time for almost a year, but looking back I've really come very far. Thought I'd share some tips with you: 

1. Make a conscious decision to stop telling him things. Send other friends that funny link, get advice/ share your happiness with other friends instead of him. Type the message to him out of habit, but delete it before you send it over. You'll get used to it after a while and the emotional connection will weaken in time. Resist the urge to tell him things when you meet him as well. 

2. Let yourself feel all the emotions. I've always been a generally happy person, so crying so frequently was rather strange for me. However I realised that just accepting and feeling your emotions is the best way to get better. Cry as much as you need to, write out your feelings, write a song, feel all the hurt and pain and tell yourself you'll be ok despite it. One day you'll realize that the crying has stopped, and the pain comes a lot less frequently. 

3. Talk about it. Talk to your close friends, listen to their advice (or not). But talking about it always helps. See a counsellor if you need to. I saw the one at UHC for a semester!

4. Focus on the fact that there are so many other people who love you, even though he didn't. Spend time with friends and family and strengthen the relationships that matter to you. You'd be surprised as to how much better you'd feel being around these people. Remind yourself that you are worthy of love.

5. Put in the effort to meet new people. I joined new CCAs, went on school trips, made friends with group mates. Looking back now, I realized 2015 was the year that I made the most meaningful new friendships, and I'm so grateful to have crossed paths with these people. Talk to that cute guy in your class to distract you, but remember not to get into a rebound relationship (that shit does not work). 

6. Focus on improving yourself. Work out, put in more effort in school work, focus on building your character. Volunteer at an old folks home. Take up that new hobby that you've always wanted to try. Remind yourself that the best way to meet someone who's the most suitable for you is to focus on being the very best person that you can be. Most importantly, work on being someone that you are proud of. 

7.  Forgive him, and genuinely wish the best for him. I have always loved him, and I think a small part of me always will. Don't hate him and get rid of all negative emotions towards him - you're only giving yourself more baggage to deal with. Accept that you guys are not meant to be. Want the very best for him anyway. 

8. Tell him how you feel. It took me a long time to be fully honest with that guy. He didn't give me any closure or any answers whatsoever, but the honesty really helped me get over the situation. Sometimes the lack of a response is the very answer that you need. 

9. Take it one step at a time. Its cliche, but its true. I used to cry a few times a day, but I'd tell myself that its ok and it will get better soon. Without realizing it, days, and slowly weeks will past between the last time you cried over him. You'll no longer think about falling asleep in his embrace. He will not be the first person you think of when you wake up. You'll look back and realize that you got a lot better just by taking baby steps. 

10. Keep contact with him to a minimum. I know you still see him around and talk to him. You don't have to avoid him entirely, but don't talk to him as much. Tell him honestly that his presence is affecting you, and ask him to keep his distance if possible. You don't have to pretend that everything is ok. 

11. Don't give up on love just yet! Work on healing yourself, and becoming the best version of you. Don't get into rebound relationships to distract yourself / seek the love that you crave. Look within yourself and your support system to make you whole again. Remind yourself that it is possible to love again.

Hope this helps somewhat! The road ahead may be tough, but you'll emerge a stronger person, I promise. You can do it! Till then, keep your chin up and remember to take baby steps! =)

@ 

Hello, "passive" guy here. I chose not to make a move on a girl I like(d?). 

I think, even now, I still think that she's the perfect girl for me. She's brilliant, true to herself, unafraid of showing how much she's into her fandoms... and I think I like that about her. She came into my life when everything else seemed quite uncertain, and I don't think that I could have gotten through my first semester without her.

I chose not to act, because I thought she wasn't interested in me. I think somewhere along the line since that point I realized I was wrong, but who knows - feelings come and go, and the only thing I can do is regret that I gave up too early. 

And so I chose instead to look at her (to love her?) from afar. Some part of me knows that she'll be happier with someone else, seeing as we lead such different lives, but another part of me knows that I have all the right in the world to try, but I don't want to sour the memories of times that I once shared with her if it all ends in an ugly falling-out.

I feel like you're misunderstanding guys here. Sometimes, we're anything but passive - sometimes, we want to move, but if moving comes with the risk of losing you forever, we won't, because you are just -that- important. We do stupid things, like doubting ourselves and giving up too early. We attempt to justify these things to ourselves, and sometimes these things become self-fulfilling prophecies. Sometimes, we answer shitty NUSWhispers because we feel that twinge of regret in our hearts.

And so it goes.

To  and other commenters.
From op of .

Thank you so much for the advices that you guys gave. Really appreciate it. 

I will try that and I hope that things will get better. I guess what hurts so much is that sometimes he can be mean too. And worse, I still treat him normally and even nicely just because he was once a real gentleman. I just still can't understand what made him changed so drastically. 

I feel stupid to treat him nicely. I feel stupid for loving him too much. 

But anyway, thanks again guys.. I'll work on this.

Be passive, caring for someone from afar, and etc is silly. 

Like what a certain poster has mentioned previously something along the line of there is no such thing as "Like girl, confess to girl, get attached and go on dates". Movie/drama-esque perspectives do not work most of the time. I have fallen into the cycle in my university days too. 

"Man Up" is a pretty decent movie though, as they have certain positive messages like "putting yourself out there" and "the list of compatibilities is no guarantee" even though the ending is still unrealistic.

If you find someone attractive, talk to her and interact with her more, ask her out 1-1 (if you are too humji, 1-1 interaction in group setting shall be your stepping stones first) before deciding if you really like her. As much as it feels like love, your feelings are infatuation and her unmatched goodness is simply a collage of your fragments of imagination. Anyway, independence and assertive are sexy, so don't be an emotional clingy vine plant.

Recently, I had asked someone out for dinner. I only had a few interactions with her (and it totaled less than 15mins). She is cute, seems sporty, sounds intelligent, works hard, and is ang mo pai. I am very cheena, but I am drawn to amp females. Don't ask me why, I had failed to answer my friends that question every time. 

I am feeling nervous as this is the first time which I had asked a stranger out, and I had been out of the dating life for quite a while. It was a real struggle before I finally man up to ask her out. I'm pleasantly surprised that she agreed. Looking forward to knowing her better. :D 

Best Regards,
BSG

P.S I am not Bill, so I won't be appearing too often. I had a bit of free time for this month, which is why I posted more. Good luck to anyone who is job searching, studying hard, falling in and out of love. If you are facing setbacks, keep faith that you will emerge eventually as many people had gone through the same cycle and moved on in the end.

Hi I need some advice. 

I have come to the realisation that I am not good enough for any girl and will never be. In other words, I will be forever alone. 

How do I prevent myself from being sexualy/romantically attracted to girls, knowing that such attractions are pointless and feeble, and only serve to make me miserable. It's wanting something you'll never ever get, and being unnecessarily miserable about it. What a pointless state of being. Some advice please. Thanks.

Just curious. How do you handle situations where you work closely with someone you dislike? Say you're in the same tutorial class or lab. Do you pretend that person doesn't exist? Just acknowledge they're there but never converse with them or talk to them normally but secretly despise them from behind?

I need to learn how to let go.
I need to move on.
But I just can't seem to do that. I've tried and I thought I have moved on and I thought I am okay but I'm not.

I still see him everyday in school because work and circumstances always make us see each other. We talk normally and do things like usual. Though I behave like nothing has ever happened, deep down, it still hurts so bad. 

I know I can't keep you by my side, but I don't want to see you happier with somebody else. I'm sorry for being selfish but I guess I have really loved you too much and I can't bear to let you go.

What should I do? I want to move on just like how he has now but I don't know what to do.

Why should I really bother about having friends and caring for people anymore? I may care about them but it's not like they're ever there when I need them.

People say I don't open up to others but what if every time I do that, I just get hurt time and time again... there's only so much hurt I can take...

Once I know of a guy-girl pair who were quite compatible with each other. The trouble was that the guy (call him X) is attached to another girl (call her Y) while the girl (call her S), well, was more than willing to go for the guy as a good friend.

S once asked me what she should do to get X. At that time, almost everyone except X and a guy called P himself realised Y was a douchebag. P was more than happy for a one-night-stand with Y, so a thought went through my head, why not fulfil P and Y as well as X and S?

I am not sure if what I did was right; X was somewhat alright with S, and with more wine it became obvious that X and I found each other attractive. A few touches and a drive back to one of the NUS residences meant a good night spent for X and S. The same for P and Y, except that Y was not so willing and was rather blur with the whole event. P, however, was more than eager with his new discovery.

I really don't know if fulfilling two and a half person's request at the expense of half a person and monster was a good idea. But Y was really a dominatrix in her time; she would force X to give her pleasure. X would often complain to me that Y was demanding he go to her house every day for pleasure.

I told him X that he had to sort it out by himself, but then S could "nudge" him with I since S was willing. But S was super young and just graduated from JC, and so there was a significant age gap. S said yes and X said whatever.

Y still has little idea what happened to her. I admit, though, she deserves whatever she gets for the horrible things Y did to my friends.

my boyfriend and i have been together for almost 6 months but we aren't as intimate as i wish we could be. We tell each other we love each other a lot and we care for each other and show it through actions, but we don't hug or kiss very often. We haven't really had a proper kiss yet. I think he is shy but i wish we could have more physical intimacy, should i make a move first? I'm afraid that he won't be comfortable if i do :(

I know people say it's okay to be single, but sometimes it really gets very lonely. I am at peace and happy with myself, I really am, but sometimes I just want someone to cuddle with and do stuff with. I want an emotional relationship and not just a physical/sexual relationship (god knows how many of the latter I had). It's about time I settle down with someone but I can't seem to find anyone I like enough. Feels like I'm going to be forever alone...

Everytime I see you

My heart skips a beat.

Everytime I hear you

Life becomes more 
meaningful for me.

Igniting the warmth in my heart

Such is a powerful thing you are

Admirable you are a person

Nothing can beat your passion

Dancing with music living your dream

Elegant yet mesmerising your works are.

Guess who? Hint. Look at the first letter in each sentence.

My boyfriend is exactly like you and I was exactly like your girlfriend. I would suggest you openly talk to her about it, the way my boyfriend did. 

He is a straight A student while I was a straight B range student...with the ocassional C. Like your girlfriend, average grades never seemed to bother me as long as I was passing, until we got together and he told me upfront one day about how my satisfaction with mediocrity, not being the best version of myself, lazing and procrastinating and not doing my true abilities justice, frustrated him a lot. 

He is right, you know. I was indeed shortchanging myself. Your girlfriend will be able to see this if she's honest with herself. What he said essentially means, if I don't pull my socks up and continue slacking around with my academics, it will threaten the relationship. I vowed to do much better the next time around. 

Many commenters at your original post may have told you to just accept her/she probably has strengths and interests elsewhere/not to be arrogant with your own achievements and drive; but this is how I see it: Her behaviour of taking her studies (and eventually work, most likely) lightly and lazily, is a negative one, no ifs and buts about it. It is NOT some quirky character trait that you have to "accept".

She has nothing to lose if you tell her upfront. With me, I now have a better understanding of how to make my relationship work, I get to keep my boyfriend whom I value deeply, my grades are improving, and I'm now seeing my boyfriend as my source of motivation, rather than constantly brushing his achievements off as "yeah that's him alright" and thinking it's unattainable for me. 

In a relationship, if something about your partner or the relationship itself bothers you, bring it up, reasonably. It can only help the both of you in the long run. Else she might think you're ok with her behaviour which can actually totally be helped and changed for the better; plus you'll also now be with someone who will be more in sync with each others' values in the future. 

She will be hurt and maybe even defensive when you first tell her, but if she's any honest with herself, values you enough and is reasonable, she will understand and make changes. Trust me, I used to be in her position.

Emotions are my biggest weakness.

I get easily annoyed, angered, stressed out, anxious, depressed. I care too much what people think. I don't want to care, I do not want to feel left out or to feel like a pathetic loser anymore. In my head I know that I would be a stronger person if I were less emotional. But how do I change the way my brain or heart operates (Wherever emotions stem from, I don't know. Psych students would you like to weigh in on this)? How can I switch off my emotions? How can I just get through this life in a calm and rational manner?

Help. Please help me. I have had enough of being emotional and needy.

 Op of  here, I am glad you are mature and not rushing such decisions. At least you are making interactions with the girl even though you may not confess at the end of the day. In some cases, the guys are not doing anything at all. Just being silent dreamers and expecting something to happen..? Continue dreaming then.

To dreamers: If you are interested in a girl, be sincere in knowing her. Dont rush and just hope for a r/s, it is a huge turn off to a girl.

I thought I treat him as an eye candy but I think he just became my crush cos I love seeing him, talking to him whenever I can and I get really excited when I do! I want to whatsapp him but I don't dare ><  we talk face to face more than whatsapp.. But it seems like there's not much opportunity to talk to him now cos his study break is over and I think I won't see him around anymore ): I only know him for about a week.. Should I give him up before I sink in even further or just continue to try to get his attention? (And that's only if I ever see him again ): ) 
-
 
 Actually, it really depends on the situation. Say, if I only know you after exams last semester, and I find that I am infatuated with you, I would spend my time observing you, and interacting with you, to get to know you better, before I actually confess (or not) to you.

Reason being, I won't know if it's just a one-time crush (coming from a course where majority of the student populace are guys, it's common), or if I can make it work. Sometimes, it is better not to rush head-on into a relationship, though at the expense of your "confidence".

For me, I learnt it from experience - I rushed head-on, and got hurt real bad (like CAP drop to no honours bad), because I didn't know the other party well enough. 

If I were in my 1st, 2nd or 3rd year, it would be easy. But in my final semester now, I am more interested in making and keeping friends.

If I let my impatience take over me, and confess to you outright, I'll be desparate. 
If I continue interacting with you, learning more about you and others, and at the end of the day, if I take the risk and confess to you, I look forward to a great future with you.
If I choose not to confess, at the end of the day, I still make a new friend.

The fool sets out on another journey, taking a step to a new frontier. Who will he meet today, and how will he grow?

Boyfriend always attend to other friends' help immediately but whenever I asked for small help, he is always rejecting, side-tracking to some other topic, taking quite a while to help. He recently helped a female friend as soon as she asked him. And he still calls me as a girl friend? It seems that to him that I am nothing or he has taken me for granted. Whenever he asks me for help, I never reject/delay.

To  

Say that to my middle finger please _I_ 

To 

Thanks for standing up for Xiao Mei, but I would want you to stop bashing nerds. There is TOTALLY nothing wrong with being nerd.

Not long ago, Xiao Mei had a short relationship with a nerdy guy. Although he isn't handsome, he has the brightest heart compared to every other men i met. He is almost perfect except that he can be quite blurr at times. Honesty is his attractive point because he would never lie to me. There was one night, I invited him over for a drink and we ended up having sex. When he woke up in the morning, I didn't expect him to go down on his knees and started begging me to allow him to take full responsibility. This is a really awkward situation for me because he simply refused to stand up no matter how hard I tried to convince him. "Da nan ren mah! How can just kneel down in front of a girl like this! ". 

However, honesty is also his Achilles heel. He couldn't mask his disappointment after knowing Xiao Mei's liberal lifestyle. He tried to act like he is totally fine and cool about it, but his acting is worse than mediacorp. A few days later, he told me to quit my current lifestyle and settle down with him. I had never seen his eye so serious before. Honestly speaking he did sway my heart at that moment. 

Sadly, life isn't a Disney Cinderella story with happy ending. Xiao Mei rejected his offer ( definitely not because I'm ashamed of my lifestyle)
because I know that I'm an imperfect and complicated girl. He's quite poor thing because Xiao Mei is guilty of bullying him, times after times when I have some emotional issues. Perhaps, it's due to the fact that he is evergreen therefore he is willing to tolerate all my nonsense, no matter how I abuse him. Even though I love him deeply, the right decision is to set him free, back into the forest. I'm sure he will pick up a flower that is so much better than me.

Nerds can be romantic and gentlemen too! Give it a try!!

Need some help here. 

I have been with my gf for close to 3 years now and frankly speaking i couldn't ask for a better girl in terms of looks, personality, character and values. But there's just one problem with regards to long term goals. 

You see, I was brought up in a family where there is a lot of emphasis placed on getting good jobs and good income in the future. My parents are holding top positions in reputable companies and they got up there through sheer hardwork and determination. Naturally they have passed on this "hardworking" and "settle for nothing but the best" traits to me. They aren't overly demanding or anything, but they just expect me to do my best in my studies and hopefully that would translate to good grades, good degree, good job etc. 

The problem is that my gf is nearly totally opposite of me. Where i would be really disappointed with a B+, she would literally jump for joy if she got the same grade. From what i see with the few times i studied with her, she seems like a really laid back person who doesn't really take her studies seriously, not exactly a bo chap attitude but a very low standards kind. She seems to settle with mediocrity and doesn't want to push herself to do better in the future. Her cap is currently in the second lower region and she seems to be content with it. She's already in year 3 but has 0 plans about future job prospects and stuff like that.  I have briefly asked her about whether she wants to work harder to improve her cap, but she casually brushed it off and simply switched to a new convo topic. I didn't want to push it any further after that. 

I know that some people say couples have to compromise for each other, but this is one area where i'm unable to do so as i just cannot see myself simply accepting her low standards. I'm really worried about our long term goals and whether this difference will affect us in the future. Also, my parents do not know her well enough yet to figure  out that she isn't a driven person, but i'm worried there could be problems once they get to understand her better. 

This has been bothering me for quite some time now and i would appreciate if anyone could offer some advice. Thanks.

Need some opinions over here.  

I am someone who can be considered quite wild cos I am okay 'doing stuff'  with guys but what people do not know is that I always stop short of the actual sequel intercourse. So till now I am still a virgin. 

My boyfriend is also of the impression that I am a virgin (he is a good boy and we haven't done it yet) which is in a sense true since I really am right?! Yet I still feel guilty about my past. He says he is very particular about his gf being a virgin.

So just wanna ask for opinions on whether 'other stuff'  will be okay to such a type of guy?

Will it be extremely weird if I used female perfume? (I'm a guy). For some reason, I feel extremely giddy whenever I tried male's perfume. However, some female perfume is ok (while some others make me feel giddy too). I've only used it when going out (not to school) but I'm considering doing so now but I kinda get worried I'll be judged.

Saw my crush with her new boyfriend.

She changed her boyfriend and yet didn't consider me.

What worst is that her new boyfriend is even uglier than me.

But think of it this way. If her boyfriend is uglier than me and my crush still want him as her boyfriend, why can't I find someone else prettier than her?

For those of you planning to say I should choose a girl because of her character and not her look, this will be my reply. I can also find a girl with better character than my current crush.

If say, you realise that your  current gf/bf was once involved in an intimate (including sexual) affair as the 3rd party between a married couple. But the affair ended before you both got together. How would you feel?

For me, I have the urge of cheating on her/him because I want to know what's so fun of cheating and why did she/he want to get involved. She/he said she/he had never loved that married guy/girl, it was all due to a moment of curiosity. The affair lasted for almost a year. Was it very exciting, like keeping a big ass secret from everybody and doing things without anybody knowing? Was it very fun?!

Yes, I'm an asshole who can't move on after knowing that she/he is such a person. Without a little sense of moral and principle, doing things which she/he know is wrong and might hurt the relationship between that married couple. But why... 

But it's not in my character to do bad things behind my partner's back. I can't even bring myself to initiate a non-work related conversation with another girl/guy. I'm conservative, so I can't fully accept the fact that my partner was involved in the intimate affair... 

She/he gets pissed off when I accidentally bring it up or ask more questions. This has always been in my mind every single day. I need to find a closure on this issue. It's driving me nuts and fantasizing of cheating on her with other girls.

What should I do? Its easy to say, let go of the past and move on, people change, now all that matters is she/he love you, etc etc. I tried all the above but I can't...

To the OP of , I feel you, man. It is so sad that there are people like us everywhere but we cannot see each other :( We would be good friends.

I accidentally discovered my partner on a dating app once and no, i wasn't on it. He was exchanging texts with some girls looking for a quick hookup. However, nothing happened as they didn't respond. Should I just let it go since he didn't do the deed. Or perhaps the opportunity didn't present itself?

Would it make a difference if we were in a stable relationship versus the honeymoon phase (just getting to know each other)?

To  I was in the same situation as you. In my first year of uni, I hung out with a group of coursemates almost everyday in school. But after a while, I found out that they have a seperate groupchat without me (and a few from the same group as well) and they have been going out in the weekends without jio-ing. Yes it sucks and I was sad. I did not know what I did wrong - i treated everyone in the group sincerely and I was pretty sure I was on good terms with them, never offended any. But eventually what I did was to not let it bother me (took a while tbh) and hung out with other awesome people! Now I am in year 3 and I have other friends in uni who I can count on, thankfully! (though I maintained my friendship with the prev bunch by saying hello when i see them but thats about it). So yup, I guess don't let it affect you too much? If they dont jio, then it is their loss ;) go and know other people and make new friends!!! There are nice people in NUS. Cheers! ^^
-
 
What to do when my friends bo jio? I have a group of friends whereby I am included but at the same time excluded. (It's like you're in their group but they have another sub-group without you) They must have their own reasons for not jio-ing me and asking them "why bo jio?" will only make things awkward. Asking them that may make them jio me once or twice but they're definitely not going to jio me consistently. We are on good terms with each other and I don't see why would they exclude me. I feel so sad.

I need final advice guys. 
Just found out from my friends that my bf has been doing the following, after being attached with me:
1) when out female colleagues, he joked that his di*k is big. 
2) told one attached female colleague to tell him when she breaks up. And that he's a better guy. 
3) texting female friends to hang out one to one. (Inclusive of girl mentioned in pt 2)
4) in front of me, not considering my feeling, puts arm around girls when taking pic with them. When I told him that I'm not comfortable, he said he will keep doing it, and I will get used to it. Because if she's a close friend, he will continue to do that. Problem is, he has alot of 'close' female friends. 
5) when random girls whom he doesn't know, chats with him, he replies. 

I feel like he doesn't respect me as his girlfriend. He hasn't full fledged cheated (yet), but is this a dealbreaker already? I'm so worn out being worried and troubled with his behavior which I cannot make sense of. To me these things should come so naturally without having the gf needing to say, if you really care for her. Guys your input please. Girls as well of course.

 Here's what I would feel/do (I'd like to think I'm a responsible individual) and for the most part, what I think other guys (or even ladies) ought to do. I would first ask 'why' just for curiosity reasons and perhaps get an idea of what the other party's philosophy on dating is. So for instance, if a lady comes up to me and says 'I just find you attractive/that you have good character,' it doesn't fit with my philosophy on dating so that's an instant 'no.' It doesn't fit with my philosophy on dating which means that I see no good reason to date you and in which case, I ought not to date you if I were to be responsible. From here on, the best I could do would be to suggest that we remain as friends till I see a good reason to date (if it ever happens).

If I see at least some plausible reasons to date, I might agree to the date but specify right at the beginning my intentions/thoughts of dating you and ensure that you are clear about it (especially so if my reasons for dating isn't that I am fond of you and/or at the point of time I don't see us going further into entering a serious r/s).

I'm not sure if I have answered your first question since every guy has different reasons for dating and there are scumbags around but I would think most if not all guys will be highly impressed/admire your courage and straightforwardness.

Whether or not you should ask him out depends a lot on you and the reasons you have for doing so? Is risking annoyance or asking him out on a date/getting to know him more, more important? I can't tell you what you think about this. If getting to know him more is all you want out of the date then you could probably do so through other means such as befriending him if you guys aren't already friends, or become close friends etc. If this can't even be done, the guy must be really mean. :/

How can short guys  jio girls without use of money? 

1. You just need a good personality. A girl who falls for your money cant be a good girl.

2.After seeing comments like "girls prefer taller guys", I feel that that is a naive stereotype. Tallers guys give a sense of security? Utter MOOT.

 Taller guys tend to be easy 1st targets in perilous situations(Cant hide and stuff). In war, you take down a tall guy and the rest flees. End of story. 
In fact, the real sense of security comes from treating a girl nice and not betraying her, that kind of assurance.

3.CONFIDENCE! Be brave to accept rejections. Keep trying until you succeed. Treat failures as life experiences and level up ad you proceed.

Lacking point 3? Go take up MMA. It makes you more sexy. Look at people with martial arts background like Donnie Yen and Jackie Chan and you will see my point.

So i have been dating this guy for a couple of times and the both of us did express interest to each other. But there was one day the conversation just broke off and the guy doesnt initiate the conversation anymore. But throughout the days that he did not initiate i will initiate a few times, but the conversation will still continue again. But i am just so sick of intiating first as a girl, so i decided to stop it. Does it mean that he is no longer interested?

Has anyone ever been ostracised before? Be it I'm class, work, CCA etc. If so how do you cope? Most times I can handle it, but there are times when it gets so lonely. I do have friends but they have cliques of their own, which I have no intention to join (either too big or consists of people I'm not too fond of).

I wonder, do people usually delete or block their ex from their social media and phone? 

I just deleted all forms of contacts, and i have to say, it feels as breathtakingly awesome as standing on top of Mt Fuji with the wind blowing on your face. #sorrybadanalogy

Of course, i'd understand why some don't delete their ex completely from their lives. But when it ended really sourly, i don't see the point of not erasing all trace of that person from your contact list.

With reference to , to those guys who say that you will be happy/out of the moon. But actually there are some guys who will take it for granted that the girl is asking you out and play hard to get, what do you guys think?

I saw the story posted by xiaomei about her sexual exploits and would like to share mine too. 

Unlike xiaomei,  I wasn't so sexually mature from a young age.  I was informed enough and often joked with my friends on sexual stuff but I never actually put any of this into practice.  Perhaps part of the reason was that I grew up in a sheltered environment with a conservative family and was in elite schools all the while.
 
Uni was the turning point for me.  I stayed in one of the happening hostels and was introduced to the world of drinking and partying.   I became part of the cool crowd and indulged in nightlife as much as I could. 

As I can be considered reasonably attractive, I had no issues attracting tons of guys in clubs.  Being a girl who was previously evergreen and shy among guys,  this made me feel really good about myself.  I began to view the attention of guys as a source of validation as to my attractiveness.  I craved and enjoyed the attention so I tended not to reject the guys.

Of course,  with guys came the sleaze.   The number of guys I made out with in a night became a trophy to me and I found it fun to go back home with guys or bring them back to my hostel.  I have lost count of the number of guys I have had some sexual intimacy with especially since some of the trysts were one off.  Maybe 20?  I went to a budget hotel for a tryst before and also got picked up by a random guy on the streets after a night out. I know these sound horrible,  but these were the cool exciting stuff to me then. 

I knew I was judged by many people as they somehow managed to find out about my promiscuity.   But to be honest,  I kind of enjoyed having such a reputation.  This is as it was juxtaposed against my background as an elite smart student and I felt it was cool that I was both smart and happening. 

Fast forward to today,  I have a loving boyfriend who is blissfully unaware of my past.  I try to keep this all in the past, but due to my existing history,  I constantly feel the temptation to cheat.  I have been keeping it in check and I hope I continue to do so.   Why let my past taint my future?

Social anxiety struck a chord with me. Although I am a quiet person by nature, one would not normally classify me as someone with SA. Like any normal NUS students out there, I took opportunity to go for programs like NOC and OCIP where I have to meet and talk to many new people and pretend that I am extroverted. Nothing kills me more than to pretend who I am not to be and during overseas I would cry myself to sleep on many nights because I feel that I am so different from my peers. Peers who could not understand when I do not go for outings or why would I stay home on a weekend when everyone is out having fun. 

Everyone around me is so witty and confident and loves going out to meet new people. When attending parties (which I cannot avoid), I would hide in the toilet so that I can be alone and cry and prepare myself for the next 15minutes of socialising when I go out again. This cycle continue on and on until I start realising that it is not my fault for being quiet. I am just being placed in an environment which might not be optimal for my growth. I slowly started to love myself and began giving less fks about what other people thought of me and do my own things. 

I feel happier and is more confident about my own personality now. I know how it feels like to have SA and how crippling it can be. Everyone is different and I cannot advise you on what to do but please stay positive. Surround yourself with close friends who understand you. Godspeed.

Is it common to fall for one's guy friend? I have feelings for this guy friend of mine but I'm positive he doesn't feel the same about me as he's dating someone else. Friend zone sucks :( For the sake of my own heart, I want to stop talking to him yet I still enjoy talking to him.

 I know you're not referring to me, but I know someone who has a crush on me and I have feelings for them too. I'm just waiting for them to just say something.

Don't be like me. Quit the waiting game, and just do it. :)

I would like to seek advice on something which have been bothering me quite a bit and wonders if anyone is facing the same issue. I have been with my current gf for almost 4 years and recently applied for a bto. However, as the results of the bto balloting draws nears, I started to reflect on our relationship and have a bit of cold feet. Well after 4 years, I don't find the spark in our relationship anymore. The relationship is great and we enjoyed each others company but somehow I feel something is missing. Although she has loads of great points, but some of her quirks pisses me off too. Has anyone felt this way before? I dunno if it's a sign when our relationship is starting to go downhill, or its just a passing phase that everyone must go through. Thanks for listening! (Admin please don't filter this post. Honest post here :/)

I have a crush on you. I could ask you out and move on with my life if you said no. Or, we could be friends!

No one wants to talk to me or be friends with me. Even at the start of the semesters, everyone has their own friends who they stick to for lectures and tutorials which makes making new friends impossible. Or perhaps it is just me. Perhaps I am not enough :( I give up. I am going to be alone forever. I might as well start loving it. #foreveralone #nofriend

How would you guys feel if a girl asks you out on a date, like a straight-up date? I'm a girl and I want to ask someone out. I'm not afraid of rejection nor will I get sad over the rejection, just that I'll be a bit annoyed if the guy think he's too good for me or that I'm desperate for him and all the egoistic stuff. Should I go ahead to ask him out? I'm not desperate for a relationship or anything, I just want to find out more about him.

Hey guys, I need your advices regarding some relationship issues. 

So... There was this day, I asked a girl whom im interested in to go out with me on the following week. She told me she'd confirm with me an available day soon but didn't get back to me in the end. Does this mean that she isn't interested? Or are there any other underlying factors? I don't want to sound so pushy to keep asking her. Sigh...

I'm 20 this year and I seem to have a liking for older guys (preferably 5/6 years older) ever since I started dating. I've been on dates with guys my age and maybe 2 years older but for some reason I just couldn't connect with them at all. Is there some problem with me or am I just old at heart?

Tfw a groupmate changes part of a project without telling anyone, you found out and merely ask whether he was the one who did it (haven't even disagree with the change), and he tries his utmost best NOT to give you a direct answer... I don't understand why people do that?? A simple yes/no and an explaination would do. If you keep doing that I might tell you off one day, at the expense of being labelled "the guy who likes to start conflicts".

Friends, I love searching for diamonds in the rough and making them shine. For those who think you have social anxiety and is thus afraid to mingle, I would really love to know you all. I believe everybody has issues and it really depends on how each individual deal with them. That said, I may appear to be loud, (crazily) jubilant all the time but I too have issues. I have cried alone several times for school stuff, family stuff and friendship stuff. I also have very low EQ and tend to do things without putting in much thought. (And offended countless of people) But it's all right! It's these personal quirks that makes us who we are and what matters is how we are letting it shape us. Don't let negativity and pessimism creep around to consume you! If you have social anxiety, dont do be depressed over it alone! I am sure you will be able to find friends who are more than willing to help you embrace it(ME ME ME ME!!!!) and remember you are all diamonds, all of you.

i have been in a long committed relationship. I fully intend to marry my current gf. However, she refuses to engage in fellatio, even though i am more than willing to go down on her. Before marriage i would just want to find out once how getting a blowjob is like, and am considering getting a fl. I fully know its a bad idea on so many levels, and am thinking clearly enough to stay away. But my resolve is being chipped away. Please tell me what to do

I recently made friends with this girl who's really nice but yet real quiet and shy. I think she's those type who would rather merge with the shadows than have the spotlight on them. I really want to get to know her better but she always doesn't talk much and won't exactly carry on the conversation. You know those 1 question 1 answer kind of conversations? Yeah that's mostly the type of convos that we have.  Anyone knows how I can get her to talk more and open up? I never really encountered such a quiet girl before so i'm not exactly sure how to proceed. Any advice?

I have known my ex for 10 years now. Over that time, he had done many despicable things to me (cheating, verbal abuse, neglect etc), to the point that it doesn't make sense to be associated with him in any way anymore. 

I have already stopped all forms of contact with him. But even knowing that this is the right thing to do, even though i know that he is not even worth a second of my thoughts, thoughts about him still invaded my mind every once in a while. Those thoughts are always the negative memories he gave me that just reminded me of how silly i was to not have cut him off earlier. 

Humans are so irrational sometimes. I wish i can just delete all trace of memories of him and not waste any more time thinking about that jerk. 

Does anyone know the best way to move on from a relationship? (Dont advice me to get a rebound, i'm not looking for a relationship right now) I dont have any yearning to get back together with him, but the anger i feel towards him and my own stupidity is still there. All i want is to move on without holding these grudges.

Since I was young, I don't have a lot of friends. I always find myself alone most of the time, during and after school. I have not spoken to anyone on that personal level yet (very rarely, but people will just disappear when I thought there is hope(, it was always a hi-bye kind of thing. I was depressed, I tried seeing a psychologist about my issues and she said I have social anxiety, and because my childhood and past events have shaped me into who I am today. 2 years after getting out of the programme, and I still am friendless. Sometimes silence is your best friend, but it can also be your worst enemy. I am slowly getting tired of seeing cliques going out together and enjoy life. I'm not asking for a clique. I'm just asking for a friend who won't judge me for me and my past. Is that too much to ask for? 
-
 
 I share the exact same feeling as you. In the end, I engaged a FL to blow me, but it was protected. Only once did I do it unprotected, but only for a few seconds before I stopped her. I don't know how to get my gf to agree to blow me, sigh.

I had a female groupmate who was my friend's friend last semester. We did a project together in a big group but we were still rushing it out on the day before the submission. I always start my work early and I also go to sleep really early, so I was already frustrated when the group was rushing it out that night. I contributed points here and there and typed in quite a few paragraphs, and everyone in the group agreed with the quality on the whatsapp chat. When it was way past my bedtime(midnight, as I said I sleep really early), I couldn't use my brain anymore so I checked the progress of the report. Turns out there was only 1 sub-section left. Someone volunteered to do it. So I thanked the groupmate and went off to sleep, assuming everything is fine.

WRONG. The next day, I got up and went to school. To my horror, apparently this groupmate suddenly appeared in the google docs after disappearing for a few hours, and proceeded to claim that my section(and only my section) was lacking. So she went ahead to type in her own stuff and my other groupmates just agreed with whatever she said. I was so shocked when I saw the report and found my sections totally gone. It looked like I didn't contribute at all. But being a quiet girl, I kept my observations to myself and my group just went ahead to submit the report.

I already couldn't get along that well with that groupmate, but this sem I realised that we somehow ended up taking all the same core modules. Since she is my friend's friend, we sit together during lectures and it was awkward as hell between the 2 of us, although I doubt my friend noticed. I think she still has this opinion of me that I am a lousy student and lousy groupmate who cannot perform up to her high expectations. So here's the question, how can I improve my relationship with her? I think there's a high chance we will continue to take the same modules, and I don't want the groupwork incident to repeat itself.

tl;dr Have a friend's friend who seems to look down on me after a groupwork incident. Need advice to improve relationship.

Dear ,
I understand how you feel. I feel you. It is not easy being you.

You sound like a good man. This may sound cliche, but she does not deserve you; you deserve better.

Do not be afraid of broaching the topic to her. Be honest, be truthful, admit to your mistake of looking through her phone. Likewise, she should admit to her own mistake too. I suggest you to leave. Give it a closure, knowing that the relationship does not work out because she is unloyal. It will be painful and difficult for you but bear with it alright. I hope you meet somemore more deserving of your love in the future

A question. How would you guys feel if your friend started dating your ex? Recently I found out that my ex has been dating one of my close friends for a few months now and I'm not sure what to feel about it.

Got a strong weird feeling and looked through my gf's phone and found out that she cheated on me with her ex over Dec. I should be angry, but I'm feeling numb inside because that boy cheated on her more than 2 year ago and wrecked her emotionally for 6+ month. I thought she was much better than this.

It took another man (who's a much better man than me) to heal her back, but he left her cos she still have some issues. And somewhere down the road, I picked her and all her pieces up, and tried to put them back together. I may fail, but every attempt came from my heart. 

Yet, I don't effing understand: Why would she go back to him? Why would she inflict that same pain on someone? I'm sitting here lost. No idea how to broach the topic with her because it'll become an argument that it's my fault to peek.

So lemme just say that I'm not confident about myself and what not... I should lose weight.... But anyway I think I like this guy that's quite good looking and he's like a medicine student.. So busy and all that.. I don't even dare to whatsapp him although I have his number and I hardly see him.. I should give up right? ):

Hello all! Would like to share my experiences to see if anyone feels the same way, or has any advice to give.

I am somewhat of an eccentric. In terms of friendships, I enjoy spending time with my friends, and I care greatly about them especially if I am around them. But when I am alone, I do not feel the compelling need to go and spend time with them, or find out what they are up to, and am perfectly comfortable by myself doing things like reading or watching videos. 

For relationships, I have liked girls before, but I have never found one that I always wanted to spend time with and really get to know more; I've never really liked anyone enough to do anything about it, and it's beginning to worry me a little bit. I do not see a need to constantly text or hug or do activities together with my future girlfriend, I prefer a more practical view in the sense of parallel play (together, but each doing their own thing), or that I will be there for them when they really need me.

I enjoyed my overseas holidays very much and seeing new places, but I do not feel the urge to travel the world and see every single country like some people do. I like pretty sights, but they feel somewhat intangible and repetitive after a while, so that it gets boring.  Anyone like that?

I realised that there are just as many people who take mods alone as there are people who have never taken mods alone. I don't know how the latter does it but there are times where I wish I were them :(

 Yes, it probably is. Just tell him you need to rest and do it manually in the mean time. Tell him you came and suck him off while resting for bonus points.

Attached person here. Does anyone know any good online resources for conflict management with your Girlfriend/Boyfriend? Sometimes I feel like we're unable to understand each other, despite talking out our disagreements. How do we resolve our differences while staying true to who we are?

kay, heres another girl confessing to guy story. Hope this doesnt get filtered because i really need the advice!! 

I confessed to him, and he seemed taken aback. He didnt outrightly reject, but he did mention giving it a try. However, his messages to me remained very normal and non-flirty. Although i sometimes feel that he gets jealous when i get close to other guys at social meeting locations. Our texts never start with good morning/nights, and i am finding it very difficult to initiate conversations of any sorts since he is not putting in effort to share his life with me. I have to ask, and sometimes i am scared that i ask too much, to the extent that i should know my own limits, because who am i to ask? 

What makes thing worst is, we are on 2 different sides of the globe now. I am heading to Taiwan for exchange and he is already in Sweden. I get tired waiting for his replies, get tired of having to initiate almost everytime. I really wanted to try and make it work. He is just simply not interested, treating me as a back up, or he just needs more time? FYI, we've talked (he talked very reluctantly) about us, and he gave the killer sentence: Not ready for a rs. All of my friends says that its best to move on to prevent more hurt caused to myself. I hate that i placed in too much feelings. Should i continue? Or just stop the texting.. But if i stop the texting, he questions my quietness. Oh lord.

I'm currently dating a few guys and they are all either smart or have potentially good careers, while I'm stuck in one place trying to get my shit together. I feel really inferior because I'm not moving towards a career with big bucks and I'm still trying to figure out my life. I'm afraid that my mediocre career/studies will be an embarrassment to my future partner. I'm so insecure about this that I don't dare to go beyond the dating phase with any of the guys.

U know what? I have not been in a relationship for years & I kind of forget how to be in one. 

I'm someone who has no trouble talking to guys as "bros" but when it comes to meeting new ones out there, who approach me with the intention to date. I'm just a clueless chick. 

So the story goes like this. I met up with this guy (Lets call him A for now) through an online dating app. Pretty decent guy who works & studies part time degree. On the surface, it seems as though we can talk as per normal but I find that it is impossible to chat with the person through whatsapp at all! 

So, after 2 dates, A started to end off whatsapp msges at the end of the day with those "i miss you" messages.. which seems creepy.. wouldn't it be too fast to say all these to a girl you just met?! Seriously.. Wouldnt it be great if things start out as friends (no commitment no obligations?) 

Now. I need some advice on how I should get things gg with this fella. 

I hope this doesnt get filtered.

I met this cute guy randomly while doing a sport which was coincidentally introduced by another guy friend and we hit off quite well with the cute guy making the first move by asking if the other guy friend was my boyfriend. We went out several times and learnt that the attraction was mutual. However, mustering enough courage to ask him about his commitment level, I was very disappointed that the reply was that he was not ready to commit in a relationship given that he had just broke up about a month back and didn't want to rush into things. Thereafter, he didn't exactly ask me out anymore and we kind of talked lesser. Am I being used as a 'rebound' or should I be more patient? :(

I never had sex before so I am quite curious about this: do guys don't feel any pain during sex?

Sometimes, I read through the confessions posted here, and some posts just cause a hint of sadness. 

Why do some girls crave the 'excitement', as they call it, of having new guys chasing them even when they have a steady, loving boyfriend? I've been through 3 relationships, and none has worked out (obviously). My point though, is that when you already have something so worthwhile, can't you cherish what you have? I want what you girls have, yet you are throwing it away just to chase something so fickle as a feeling of 'excitement'. If you feel that your relationship is fading away on your part, that's another thing altogether. But 'excitment', really? Don't cause unnecessary pain. It sucks, and I don't wish it on anybody.

Which links to, if you think it's not working out, speak. Why is it that I must question what is going on, whether you are in this at all? Every single relationship-though few-have required me to do this. Whether you're female or male, if you have the guts to get into a relationship, then you'd better have the guts AND responsibility to break it if you don't think it's working. Even if you are not in the best state, even if you are so stressed, be it about your relationship or something else. Don't force your SO to ask. It hurts. Badly.

And don't ghost. 

It has happened to me, and many things happened at that very moment as well. Breakdowns aren't pretty, even if they don't involve tears where other people tread. While I got my answer eventually, it is not something you wish to repeat. Try being so worried, so afraid of what may have happened to your SO, and yet having to chase for an answer as to the status of what you thought you had. Because soon enough you know he or she was alright all along. 

Respect what you have, or at least what you had, if that's the case. 

Have a good day :)

Hello  and ,  I can completely relate to how you guys feel. I am in my year 3, and in the past I used to feel anxious and had blank outs during exams. I started seeking help from a counsellor in UHC nearing exam period when I was in year 2 to help me to cope with my exams anxiety. However, last semester when I was attending a lecture, I suddenly had a panic attack in the LT. It was my first time having a panic attack, and initially I thought that it would be fine, it could probably be due to caffeine overdose. However, the following week during the same lecture I started having symptoms of anxiety again. I decided to seek help from UHC and shared what I experienced to my counsellor. She provided some suggestions such as practicing mindfulness and deep breathing exercises. To be honest, I feel that those techniques are only helpful to a certain extent, but personally I believed that it will be more beneficial if you can try to be open and share what you experienced to your close friends. Friends that you know that will be there for you. I am really grateful for the support that I have received from my friends when I shared with them what has happened. Anyway, all the best for the new semester! Jiayou and stay strong! :D

What should I do if I realise my boyfriend cannot keep up with my sexual habits? Say, once daily? I talked to him and he said thrice weekly, but he won't accept my compromise of five times weekly.

Don't worry, we have been safe. Just that we sometimes make too much noise on a creaky bed. You know lah, PGP bed not best bed.

Meeting her was really the luckiest thing that happened to me in my life. However, I am confused. She has been throwing mixed signals to me but I really really like her since meeting her on our first date.

Dear Readers, can you please give some advice to this evergreen guy over here. What are some signs that a girl would show if she likes a guy? Would really appreciate your help!!! :)

I have become so dependent on my boyfriend to the point that I feel totally insecure when he is not physically by my side. I have few friends and now, almost no friend that I can share my troubles with. 
What should I do to feel alright even if he is not by my side? 
It is becoming a huge problem as I worry about a lot of  things. Without him, I feel anxious or empty. Due to his other commitments, we will have even lesser time together in the new semester. In addition, it will become a ldr when I go on exchange, while he go on a summer programme. What should I do?

I had a really cute ogl during my orientation camp. He asked me out a few days after the camp and I couldn't be happier.
Fast forward to 2016 , he finally confessed to me after dating for half a year, and wanted me to be his gf.
He's evergreen, but confessed to have had several fwbs and one night stands before. He said all these adventures stopped the moment he saw me during the camp.
He also said "Having had experienced these before, I know only how much joy a random girl can bring me physically. It just pales in comparison to the warmth in my heart when I see you smile. I will never cheat on you dear"
However, even with his reassurance, I still feel uneasy to say the least as I'm a rather prudish girl, not going past kissing with my past two bfs. Even with my ogl, we only started holding hands a month into dating and kissed for the first time a few days ago when he confessed to me. I have thus asked him to give me the weekend to think if I'm ready for a relationship with him.
Any advice?

To fellow schoolmates with social anxiety, you guys are definitely not alone. I've always had social anxiety. However, I've never once felt embarrassed about it. No one's going to "help" you except yourself. Talk to a school counsellor about the cause of your social anxiety. Be truthful to yourself and of course to the counsellor. If counselling doesn't work, see a psychiatrist (we have them in UHC). You see, in NUS we are blessed with all these services that will cost a bomb outside. Treat these sessions as another medical consultation (like a cold). There is really nothing you should feel ashamed about. Instead, my close friends and family were relieved and proud of me for being able seek professional help voluntarily. Hope those who are suffering or have friends suffering from social anxiety/depression read this and seek treatment soon. Don't wait till a breakdown or it'll really be too late. Face it, treat it and thereafter spread the words. Good luck!:)

What will you do if you're still single @35 y.o. ?

Assuming that you have a above average career and some savings. You have enough money (for deposit) to purchase a resale HDB by yourself near your workplace and a car if you want. Your life dream is to be financially independent by 45 y.o. so you can quit your stressful job and do something more relaxing and interesting.

1) Consider dating an old friend who is about your age. She has been interested in you since you were in your 20's but you never liked her as much because she isn't very attractive. She's a nice person but basically spends most of her salary on branded goods and luxuries. She probably doesn't need to be 'supported' financially since she does fairly well at work. She does have CPF so she will be able to help you pay for housing.

2) Ask your cousin's Vietnamese wife to introduce you to someone. Your taxi driver cousin married a Vietnam girl several years ago, however despite his relative poverty they seem to be a fairly happy couple. You assume that if you marry a Vietnam wife, you will have to support her and your 'dream' of early retirement will be delayed by at least a decade.

3) Ask your married friends for introductions. You have several good friends who have been happily married for awhile. You could ask them for introductions but it might take awhile and you might have to re-enter the dating game again.

4) Have fun with a Sugar Baby. You always wanted to date someone when you were younger, unfortunately you were too poor and too busy with your career to succeed in a serious relationship. Perhaps having a Sugar Baby would let you fulfill this part of your dream.

5) Remain alone and buy a 3-room HDB. Continue skimping, investing, and working hard in order to retire @45 and fulfill your dream of being financially free. Profit?

I was here a while back confessing how sad it was to end the year with you losing our friendship, and me, losing my mind.

Then came our clique outing, you appeared out of nowhere and started talking to me again out of the blue, normally, as if nothing negative between us ever happened. As if my heart remained intact, never broken. Then we started texting, and the next minute - you unsurprisingly disappeared again.

I'm really, really tired of all these leaving me hanging situations. You don't get to decide when you'd like to talk to me, to your whims and fancies. You don't get to decide if the medication works on me or not. You don't get to decide my mood. Stop, just leave me alone. Leave us alone. For the last time, I dug out our photos and I couldn't help but noticed that you used to laugh so much more genuinely and happily, before you knew me (or even when we first knew each other). As our friendship grew closer, your smile went fader.

I used to think it's really stupid when one says if you really have feelings for someone, you don't need to own that someone but just hope for that person to be happy. I never understood that, I even questioned such a saying - claiming that it probably wasn't even true love to begin with. Now I know how wrong I was then - I truly want you to be happy. And for that to happen, I have to withdraw from your life - by force or otherwise, permanently. Even if it means putting everything to an end, it has to happen. I will watch you from afar, or wherever else that may be, hoping that you find your true happiness and I'll be really glad (from wherever I may be) when that happens.

Nights, and goodbye. You gonna welcome a 2016 without any presence and thoughts of me.

So many confessions about...confessing. 

Is there an ideal time frame for confessing? (Yes, this really depends from person to person, couple to couple, but I'd like to hear some views).

I see people lamenting that 1-2 months is too short. For myself, if the feeling is mutual, I would accept him in a heartbeat. 

However, I've heard from friends that if two people get too comfortable with each other, the timing is gone. I've also personally experienced this...being too close to someone for nearly a year, only to find out that the other party only views me as a very good friend. 

What do you all think? 

There's also the point about confessions not being necessary, but my personal take is that both parties should be sure of what each other feel...

Hey, I really do hope I don't get filtered out as I hope my stories will be a regular read for you guys on NUSWhispers. SO... I've recently got out of a long-term relationship (when i said recently, I meant about a year ago) and been on this dating roller-coaster ride since. The relationship ended because he felt the relationship was too much work and I think he not will to commit properly at least. Anyways, to orientate your visual image of me, I'm rather beautiful, sexy, confident, some may say I'm rather exotic looking girl. For the sake of identification, call me #MissM. 

It's been a while since I've ventured out into the dating world and especially a such an adventurous age (about early twenties), I've got a lot of qualms about casually dating. Don't get me wrong, it's not something I've never done. I've gone out on a couple of dates in between breaks with my ex (woah, totally miss that red flag there, right?). Faced with a mixture of super desperate guys to guys who probably wont even give me the time of day for me, I actually do enjoy going on dates with an array of selection of men. So many things run through my mind when I'm on a date. Whether I should reply the guy messages? Is it too early to start staying over? How do I tell him that I'm not interested without hurting his feelings? Does he get the condoms or do I? Is it okay to joke about marriage?

2015 has definitely helped me develop my dating skills. My first "adventure" was like a splash of cold water on your face after being out in the hot sun for a really long time. He was a friend of my good friend who I hung out a fair bit with. I knew about his dating antics. He is smooth. He daring in a sense where he'll ask the girls out even when they seem as though she way out of his league. From a rather prestigious discipline in engineering. But due to his super huge fear of commitment, we'll call him Mr Scaredy pants(SP).  Having a bf who barely made any effort to plan dates, it was fantastic that he took a lot initiative to plan them out be it a spontaneous or pre-determined date. 

Date  was fantastic and chemistry was above average I guess. (from my perspective I guess)
 Fast-forward to date ? Idk. I've got a terrible memory. One of his close relative passed away and he was rather torn about it. I guess that why he stayed longer than I planned. I wanted to dump him that day actually. You cant dump a guy whose grandparent passed away. Anyways, with every date, he kept saying he wanted to keep it casual and stuff. I was cool with it but not great at saying goodbye. Prefer the whole thing fazed out and he stop replying my messages by thinking that I'm a commitment junkie.

Start posting a crap load of #relationshipgoals post on my social media to add a cherry on top, I'd write/say rather coincidentally commitment-rich things to my friends and on my accounts. Woah, with he consistently yakking about how scared he is, I thought he be gone in a few days. Two weeks guys....that was sooooooo long. It was perfect tho. The semester ended. He flew off for exchange? I dont even remember now. It was nice while it lasted but if you scare easy, you should leave early.

I remember when we watched  那些年 when it first came out in the theaters. It was just a nice movie to me then, with a bittersweet ending that made you laugh and cry at the same time.

Right now I fully understand the story and what the bittersweet feeling is. It's more bitter than sweet, reading our emails to each other that are filled with the words of a couple still falling in love with one another. That sometimes, who you thought were main characters won't end up together at the end of a story. That things don't always go as planned, even though you've already fought through so many battles to be with each other. 

I miss you each and every day.

I am a guy who has a longtime girlfriend who recently met this attached girl.   From the moment I met her it was love at first sight. This sounds very screwed up,  but I can't help how I feel and have been thinking about her ever since. 

I have actually told the girl how I feel (though I am not planning to chase her due to our current situation)  as I just couldn't resist letting her know that I care for her.  However everytime I tell her about my interest in her,  she brushes me off and says that I must be doing this to girls all the time. 

Though I am not planning to get her,  I feel hurt she thinks that of me.  In fact,  through the 7 years I have been with my girlfriend,  this is the first time I ever felt something for another girl. I am not a player; but just someone who happened to fall in love with another.  I just want her to like me as a person and know that I'm alws secretly caring about her from the side.

I honestly don't know what I'm confessing about but I just wish to share my story before the semester starts next week. 

After my break up from a long term relationship, my male friends from my lecture gang who were all single immediately pestered and bugged me to install those dating apps on my phone. Initially I was like -.-. But out of boredom I installed those apps( yes including letterbox) to play around since I realised I had a lot of free time after being single again. Tbh, most of the girls on those dating apps were obviously using fake or heavily photoshopped profiles of themselves as their DP.  Having an ex who had the ability to manipulate make-up and body posture to make herself look more attractive made me more wary of those Super "chio" profiles on those dating apps. After a while, I grew disillusioned and uninstalled all of them. 

Anyway, feeling super bored and lonely, I decided to chat up my jc friends (who were all guys) and we went for a drink together at a  restaurant bar. One of them decided that a dick-fest was too boring and decided to "call in some chicks". Somehow, from a group of 4 guys, it became a party of 9. One of the girls that came along immediately caught my eye. In my eyes, she was really attractive and maybe perhaps bored being single for a while, I decided to chat her up. I found out afterwards that she was my friend's friend's friend(work that out yourself) 
Long story short, we clicked well and we exchanged numbers before we parted for the night. My guy friends decided to go clubbing with the girls(including her) while I went home to sleep. For those who want to know why I didn't go along , of course I was tempted to follow along to get to know the girl better along the way, but at the same time I was terribly tired and felt a bit sick. 

After that night, I initiated a conversation and things progressed very smoothly for quite some time(Being in a previous Long term relationship really helps one understand girls much better lol). After texting a while, we found out that we really clicked quite well. Importantly, we were the same age and still both studying, me in NUS while she was private Uni. Therefore, somehow, we were able to relate to each other quite well. We started going on one-on-one lunch/dinner dates as well as outings to GBTB and Coney Island just to name a few. We were still unofficial then. After a while, I was sure that it was the right time to confess to her and that I was so confident that she would agree to be my girlfriend. Then one day my friend(who was part of the group that night I met her) dropped me a bombshell. One morning out of the blue he texted me something  along the lines of " hey bro, I'm so sorry to say this but I can confirm its true, the girl you have been going out with is a social escort"( I altered the actual text as saying it would give away my identity lol). I didn't believe it, I asked for evidence, and immediately he sent me images/screenshots as proof. I shall not discuss the images in detail here as it would be inappropriate. There were other things discussed but I shall stop here. From the evidence he provided, it was impossible for me to deny that she wasn't a social escort. Naturally of course I was extremely heartbroken. It was more painful than rejection. It was the feeling of being "cuckolded" or "戴绿帽”. I took a while to calm down, gather my thoughts, and I called her to meet to talk about something urgent. From her response, I reckoned that she thought I was going to confess to her, since I managed to calm myself down to speak to her in my normal tone. 

We met outside the MRT station. I brought her to a quiet corner since I didn't want anything nasty to happen when I broke the news to her. From her demeanour and expression, I guessed she thought I was going to confess to her lol. (Quiet corner and everything). When I broke the news to her that I found out about her "job", her expression immediately changed. It was a very long and emotional talk so to summarise what happened: She said that she was planning to tell me about it once she knew I could be trusted with her secret. She said she had really cut down a lot of her "work" after meeting me. She asked me if I still wanted to be with her. She kept apologising and crying. I said I wasn't planning to break up with her at that time I found out. I said that I was heartbroken but I didn't want to end things like that immediately. She cried a lot. 
I immediately felt guilty when I saw that she started crying uncontrollably. That was when I knew I really liked her a lot. Then I made a decision that I don't know whether I will regret in the future. I said something like " I really like you, and I don't mind what you did in the past, if I ask you to become my Girlfriend, will you become exclusive to me only? That's all I ask for. " Of course many things were said after that but basically she agreed to be my girlfriend and promised to stop her social escort job immediately. 

Till now, we are still a couple and are going strong. However, there is still a bit of awkwardness between us especially when we try to get intimate. Therefore, our relationship has never progressed beyond normal kissing/hugging /holding hands. Neither of us has suggested to each other about the more "intimate stuff" so far.  I am happy with the status quo and I guess she is too.

Personally, I believe that if you really like a person, you would accept him/her despite their past. If they love you, they would willingly change for you too. I believed that she would change for me, so I gave her that chance. To all the singles who are dating, it doesn't matter what your partner did before he/she got together with you. What  matters is what he/she does in the present and in the future. That will be the true gauge of their commitment to you. 

Ps:  I know she often reads NUS whispers. I love you HANNY.

Finding a module now... is like finding a SO
1) of course must have a little bit of interest right? no interest become arranged marriage already
2) can fit into timetable
3) exams don clash

But ultimately whether you get your SO, must see how many people chasing him/her and how much they can pay him/her to date them. If you poor af, you don't get the guy/girl. 

NMNHNLM :(

  I know exactly how you guys feel. 

It's the attention that we miss, where the guy actually shows interest in you and actively chases you, it makes you feel wanted and desired and it gives you all the butterflies and the initial feeling of the "chase"

Many times after being in a long term relationship, the guy tends to start to become lazy. (To leave all the chasing to the guy is sexist of course but read this with a pinch of salt) slowly the girl feels taken for granted, that she's no longer worthy of interest as the relationship settles into a routine. 

Talk it out with your bf, give them a little shakeup. Take the initiative, arrange some dates and reignite the passion between the both of you. It doesn't always need to be the guy initiating all the time! Talk to each other about your love languages, to keep the flame going. Don't look for excitement elsewhere when you have a great guy at home.

Peace

I have a friend who's usually quite pleasant and lovable. Recently we were doing some academic stuff together. My other group mate and myself sometimes come late but this pleasant guy doesn't seem mad. I even asked him straight out if he was mad. But now I find that he's acting kind of moody. Like he'll be his usual self one minute, then suddenly come up with some barbed remark disguised as sarcasm. Today when I called him a friend he was like 'hmm, I'm your friend meh?' Something along those lines. I can tell he hasn't been sleeping well. When I asked him what was up, he gave me some stuff about being swamped with tasks. I don't think he's lying, but I'm not sure that he's telling the whole truth. 

Do you think it's just a personal issue and I'm overthinking this? Do you think he's mad because of lateness? Do you think he's just this way, and was nicer because he didn't know us that well then? Do you think that when we joke with him, we were being too mean but he just hid it? Whatever the reason, what do you think I can do about it? My friends said to ignore it, but first, I really do consider him a friend. Secondly, we will be forced in extended contact for some time, so I'd rather have the issue resolved before then. Thirdly, I can't let this go because if something is my fault, it is my responsibility to ameliorate it. 

Please, any ideas?

We were in a relationship for 3 years, and I took her for granted. I never actually listened to the problems she is facing. As she bottled up all these unhappiness in her, it finally reached a point where she can't contain it. We broke up. Even so I pestered her and became a nuisance for her. I was selfish.

It hurts that I only am able to realize the mistakes I committed after I actually lost her. And I am not able to do anything for her any more. Is letting her go the only way I can do something right about this lost relationship for once?

To  and , I think it's possible for people in r/s to be intrigued by someone else, afterall that's how you get together with your partner. IMHO, if you really love your partner, you'll try to keep a distance from the other person/avoid doing stuff that will upset your partner, and not simply leave it to fate.  What does leaving to fate even mean? You toss a coin to decide if you want to go out with that person? You're not Dent. Just, put yourself in your partner's shoes...... Nonetheless, if you decide to fall deeper, I don't think you deserve your partner..?

This has been bothering me for a while so instead of going crazy alone, I guess I shall just put it out there.

My boyfriend is Christian and I'm a Buddhist. Yes, I know, it's a recipe for nightmare. Prior to him, there was another guy who had chased me for about a year before before becoming totally aloof. I called him out and asked him about it before he spilled that he has asked the priest at his church if he could date a non-Christian and the answer was obviously-no. My boyfriends knew about it as we were friends at that point of time. Despite that, when he chased me about a year or so after he stated that he would like me to convert. I out rightly told him that I would not and that the relationship will never work out.

We had a few more serious talks about it and he finally relented and said that he's okay with me practising Buddhism. The days after that were blissful as our personality really matched each other. We managed to work out our differences and were having a great time together.

However, after about 1.5 years he suddenly asked me about it again. We argued for a bit and in the argument he asked me this " Can you really imagine us having a future with different religions? Will you be okay if I'm bringing our kids to the church instead on Sundays?" 

To be honest, I have seriously thought about it before and despite the desire to raise my kids with no spiritual influence and allowing them to choose their religion when they grow up, raising them as Christians is something I can live with as well. What really hurt me was him questioning our future. We're the kind of couple who talks about marriage openly. Marriage was not something we take extremely seriously due to our young age but it was something that we could talk about casually and not a topic that we shunt. We decided to drop the topic after realising that we'll never be able to come to a conclusion.

Now, what am I supposed to do when the person I want to spend the future with actually has doubts doing so? He said that he's sorry afterwards and that he was just over thinking but I can't help but feel that words uttered doing an argument is the truest of all. I don't want to lose him but I feel that this relationship is damaging to my self-esteem. The promise to allow me to stay a Buddhist sounds like a utter joke right now.

After all this while, has anything really changed at all? I think we all have been through this phase at least once in our lifetime where we were desperate to see a change in ourselves or in others, but nothing comes to mind except disappointment. And then we start to wonder if we or others are ever going to change at all. I really had my hopes up, believed in the words you said and thought things would really be different this time round, but I guess things don't always turn out the way we wanted them to. I guess this really is it for us and where we say goodbye because I won't be looking back anymore nor continue being a fool. You had your chances and I think I gave enough of them. I sincerely wish you all the best ahead. Goodbye.

 if you ask me, your problem lies with confessing six weeks after first getting to know her.

What happened to building strong friendships before deciding you want to take it further? :/

More thoughts on rejection.

Rejection elicits disappointment. Disappointment breeds doubt. Doubt inspires change. I think the kind of change that happens varies widely. Rejection need not always be cruel if you can clarify the doubt. Be it no chemistry, no clubbers or no whatever. If you let his imagination run wild I think its even more cruel and simply mind-f him. Usually the guy will understand one laaa. (If not even close enough to discuss this then gg lor)

Personally, over time, I'm less and less disappointed. Maybe because I think I tried my best. Or maybe, like what my friend says, liking a girl is ultimately a small thing.

And justsayin , I have a similar theory on relationships as well.

"We may be attracted to someone with traits we didn't know we like": 

Please keep that open mind! At least my faith in girls is restored. Hope your Mr. Right(s) appears soon!

My boyfriend is a nice decent dude and we have been together for a very long time. We have went through many ups and downs in our relationship and we are in the comfortable and potentially marriageable stage. I'm grateful for what he has done for me, supporting me and helping me to shape my character. However, after being in a stable relationship for quite long, I still wonder if there's someone out there who is more suitable for me. I crave for the excitement of meeting new guys, the butterfly in my stomach feeling I get from flirtatious moves made by other guys. On and off, there are guys who made me feel this way but the feeling dies when they gradually moved on and stop having contact with me. Recently, it happened again and the feeling is stronger than ever. He is a guy who I admire a lot because of his unique character and both of us has quite some chemistry. According to other friends and my observations, he might have some interest in me too. I have a really big crush on him this time and it's hard to persuade myself to walk out of it since the feeling is mutual. My boyfriend is still loving and nice and there is no reason for me to break up with him. I'm not sure if I should give up this relationship which has come so far since I have become more interested in this other guy or should I just remain status quo and let the guy slip by. :'( Please give me some advice on this because it is really tormenting me.

 When I first read your confession, I stun for a moment. 
Almost thought that I sleep-wrote this at night or something, because it was totally what I was thinking to myself. Im in your exact situation.

My BF  now gives me assurance, he tells me when he goes out, with who and so on, and tells me about his friends as well. 
Thing is, he likes to go out with his 'bros' whom I can say are not exactly the best influence. These bros like to go to nightclubs, for the company of women there, and go overseas to visit the dirty places and bring girls back to their hotel (not just to chat and drink, if you know what I mean). 
He went once before we got into a rs, and is planning to join them again this year. I am seriously uncomfortable with it. I know they will still go to such places, and he will join them. He told me he will just go there and chat with the girls. (seriously?!) Even if he tells the truth, that he won't do any hanky panky, am I supposed to be comfortable with it? 

Is it unreasonable if I don't let him go, and if he wants to, we may have to re-evaluate our rs again?

I've recently started dating (evergreen here btw) a few people but since I'm new to this dating and relationship thing, I have questions. 

1. When you are not in a proper relationship yet, it is okay to play the field, right? Meaning just seeing/dating many people. 

2. Do you have to tell the one you like most that you are also seeing/dating other people? If the other person do ask, is it a must to tell them? And would they think you're not serious at all? I mean, it would jeopardize the chances of being together with the one you like the most.

3. Do dates typically end up sleeping with one another? Or they just end with a hug/kiss?

Thanks for all the answers/advice in advance! :)

To  

I feel your pain. I am currently in a relationship with my long time boyfriend and the rs has been relatively smooth and steady and everyone expects us to get married after I graduate. He has been with me through ups and downs as well, especially during the time when I had depression. I have recovered from it since and for that, I am very grateful for his understanding, patience, love and care. However, I too, as a girl, crave for attention by other guys and get all excited when they show signs of interest such as texting me. I am currently on exchange program now and have met a nice guy whom I kinda like though I try to hide my feelings in the best way possible. He is currently trying to pursue me as he sends me texts and ask me out to explore some tourist spots together. I didn't really accept his offers yet as I feel like I am betraying my boyfriend... but I don't think I can resist the urge of going out with him to find out more about him anymore :(. I guess at this point in time, I shall leave it to fate.

,
Hi there :) I'm kinda like you, just that I am also the DUFF in my clique :( My boyfriend and I started off as good friends. I thought NO ONE will ever like me, so I was really really open with him.. Just being myself, and not trying to impress anyone. Moreover, I'm not that kind of girls who would dress up nicely to lessons, I'm always in t-shirt and shorts/jeans. I guess, we really hit it off and my personality won him over :p Anw, he told me before I wasn't good-looking at all, just average. (But wasn't hurt that time, because we are really really good friends) Since you mix with guys too much, just continue to mix with them and be yourself, probably one of them will be your Mr. Right :) All the best!

i was rejected at the 1.5month mark since I known her and its has been nearly 3 months thereafter and I still miss her dearly. We are both at different countries now and I hope my feelings for her will fade away and then decide whether we could be friends again. Initially after rejection I thought I would be happy just being friends because I feel so ease with her (her too) but it was not. Different expectations of the friendships has led to misery for me and I don’t think she realises it. I did not talk to her about it because it is not her fault that I can’t help to want something more out from the friendship. 

I told her I need to distant myself and she said she understand. The day when I left and gave her my well-wishes I knew it could be the very last time I talk to her. I do not know what will happen in the future and I have no doubt we could connect at a very personal level even after a long time but I am afraid of getting too close to her once again when I am finally over her. 

Why do you have to make me feel this way? I am not a needy guy and like you, would prefer most of our time alone or with friends who understand us. You probably do not read NUSWhispers but I want you to know that I do not regret meeting you 037. It is such a shame because we could really become good friends if not for my romantic feelings. Please take care of yourself over there and don’t be too trusting. Sorry I can no longer give you advices or provide a listening ear. I hate myself for not being a genuine friend and I will not be that guy to stay on and let resentment brew. 

I will find you when I feel that I am emotionally ready 037:(

To the guys who are trying to chase women, my advice to you is don't.

Let the woman chase you. 
So become a man that a woman will chase, and trust me things will all fall in place nicely.

My Roomie caught me enjoying myself with lesbian porn and I admitted to her that I am actually lesbian. From then, she outcast me and tried to avoid me as much as possible. She also told our hall mates what I told her and now everyone is like judging me. What's wrong with preferring someone of the same sex as me? Someone even asked me what's wrong with guys? Why didn't I like guys? They judged me even before they understand my background. Actually I was straight back in my poly days. I even went imitate with a guy back then. But while we were doing it, I just felt disgusted. I cannot stand the sight of a kuku bird. Don't even mention about touching it or putting it in ny privates. Then each time I saw nude girls I would felt v high. As a girl, I had my needs too. I am not breaking as Offences, I just like to watch nude girls making out via online channel while I satisfy myself. What's wrong with that? I thought guys watch porn too? Then why judge me?

After going through a few sexual assault incidents and a toxic/abusive relationship over the past few years, I have depression. It took me a very long time to admit this.

I've been crying so much I can't recall when was the longest period of time I went without crying. I screwed up many classes and other stuff as a result.

I've gotten a prescription for the first time and will be starting medication soon. Right now, I'm depressed that I'm depressed. 

It's so painful; I just wanted to rant.

Wow, seems like a lot of girls are making the first move nowadays! I have yet to meet a girl like this. Where art thou? Its uncommon to hear of guys rejecting girls?

Guys, what are the chances of getting back with your ex? 6 months on and I am still not over him. During the course of our relationship, I did many things that he didn't like (not infidelity )that ultimately led to the demise of our relationship. When we broke up, he said that he forgives me for all those things that I have done. It has been 6 months and I still really like him. He is still single and I am thinking of getting him back? We still keep in contact. Do I have a chance?

Average looking and not so nice body kind of girl here... Why is it that I keep getting friendzone.. Ok maybe because of my size ? I do have crushes on guys of course but none of them likes me back and I'm those evergreen girls that never get chased by a guy before. That's quite sad I guess like after seeing how all your other friends actually start dating while I'm like here in a state of "I don't even know whether I have a crush on that person or he is just nice to look at or I'm just in a delusion I just treat him as a friend".. But anyway also no one cares so whatever ): Probably mix with guys too much I guess! Someone please advice ): why does everyone have someone to reject but I'm like NOPE no one loves me. I don't really know what's wrong

My friends always say that I am so rich as I am always enjoying expensive meals and splurging on luxury items and leisure, but the sad thing that they dint know is that I never have a girlfriend all my life and this money should must well spend on myself first. 
-
 
You smiled at me and I faked a smile, waving you goodbye in the bus. Today, as we part, I feel happy for you and sad too as I should have confessed to you, something I wanted to do, yet did not have the courage.

Now I realize the fear of rejection is nothing compared to the loss in my eyes. As I share this out, I hope each of you would have the courage to do something that you always wanted to.

I have nothing much but to wish you and your partner a good life. Sincerely.

Well well hello , 

the first time I read your response I’m like “woah gong simi”. your english very good, I like. “Mature”, “original jokes” and prep “small gifts”, woah seh, date me maybe? JOKING lah hahaa.

On a serious note, I do see your point. Naive perhaps. Or you can say I’m playing hard to get, but then this is not really the case. Of course my rule doesn’t apply to every men, and maybe I have sent the wrong signal to fellow friends who are thinking of applying my technique of “reject-first-then-observe”. By “observing”, I mean to still be friends and get to know the person better. The thing is, how about “rejection” after dating then (ie get dumped eventually)? My chiobu hedonist kaki will tell you "never mind", and would just date anyway, which I find unfair to the one “hunting" while she’s the one calling the shot.

Essentially, we don’t want to reject the wrong species, don’t want to NOT reject the wrong species (double negation, ie we want to reject the wrong species), we don’t want to date out of pity (ie just date lahh) and so on. So how sia??? Cannot this cannot that. Well, I guess the answer to “reject or don’t reject” is “it depends” lor. It depends on who the girl is looking for in the first place. If I want a guy with mature thinking, and someone whom I don’t know very well appears to be quite mature, then I really don’t mind trying out a few dates. If he’s a little childish to begin with (or “seems" to just want to get out of the evergreen circle, or he “seems” to just want to have some fun etc), I’ll apply my rule. This is just me lah hor. After all, who we think we like may not be complete after all. We may be attracted to someone with traits we didn't know we like. We all have different taste in men/women, so there’s really no fixed rule. And after observing I find that the guy is really really not bad, I think I’ll be the one chasing him. Not hoping that he’s still loyal and whatnot, but a sincere attraction.  

-from a girl who is still waiting for a gentleman to appear, maybe she should tweak her rule a little bit

How do you classify a girl WITH boyfriend but keeps texting you till 2-3am everyday, give you nicknames, helps you in whatever you needed help with, wants to travel to school together (as we live at extreme ends of sg) etc etc....
Is this the ultimate friendzone? (She's never mentioned anything about her boyfriend at all) 
-
 
 lol yeah you're obsessed. But who am I to say; I do that too. Maybe not to the extreme of worrying so much about what I did wrong, but kind of more like just a fleeting -_- emotion. Then I move on and do my own thing. And he's already my bf, who was the one who chased me and we just got together and is supposed to be in the honeymoon phase. So i have no idea, lets just give him the benefit of doubt that he's really busy. For your case, i think most probably you'll still be having this issue even after you guys get together. 
-
 
Many people I know are happily in love or looking for a relationship. Me? I realized I'm scared of being in one. 

Firstly, I'm not an attractive looking girl. Kind of nerdy even. I feel uncomfortably self-conscious just thinking of going on a date with someone, so I made myself seemed cold and rejected all date offers so far. 

Secondly, I find it difficult to put so much trust on a guy and making myself vulnerable to heartache. I find it hard to believe that there are good guys out there who could love me for all that I am, and not eventually go down the path of infidelity or endless arguing. 

Thirdly, I feel like there are so many things I can improve myself on. Looks, fashion sense, talents, and of course personality issues such as patience and emotional stability. 

Lastly, I am in it for the long haul and don't see the point of dating just to play the field. With this in mind, there seems to be so many things to looks out for in a guy as long term compatibility means small issues can easily become deal breakers. 

So yes, I'm certain I am not ready to be in a relationship. What scares me is if I can ever make enough changes to feel ready for a relationship, or will I stay feeling forever inadequate to be in one. Sigh. Perhaps I am only having this dilemma because I haven't met the right person. 

Any mature advice is welcomed, and do share if anyone of you feels the same way I do.

As a person with mild depression, I hovered between normality and seeking psychological help/medicine. Everything was failing: my family, my CAP, my relationships etc. Often, I wondered what my aims are, because they are so hopeless. Holidays made it worst. While everyone is enjoying themselves, I wondered about the house, drifting between sleep, gaming and a little study (almost none). Sometimes I barely eat, on other times I binge like crazy. 

You, on the other hand, has everything I wished for: an open family, a nice CAP to graduate, a wonderful married relationship, friends to support you. Yet you say you are depressed and sometimes even take medication. You never mentioned what you are depressed about; yet I helped and supported you despite myself. Sometimes I wonder; perhaps you should be the one helping me to 'get my life back to order' (you love to say that)?

Now that I helped you past the stage, you flew to somewhere else and left me here to struggle. You used to light the way and I used to guide you. Now you left a half-alcoholic, heartbroken me fighting through the darkness that once I thought left me. But I loved you more than you know; even if the sky fall, I would tank it all. Goodbye from the other side.

I need some help/advice. I've been going out with a girl recently. I really do like her and wanna explore possibilities of a relationship in the future. The only thing is I don't know if she feels the same way, or is also looking for a relationship (still too early to ask her me thinks). 

Anyway, I don't know what's wrong with me but I find myself constantly checking our whatsapp convo. I notice she'll come online for a while then go offline without reading my text (still grey ticks). It's only like maybe an hour to maybe 3 hours later that there will be blue ticks, and even after the blue ticks she only replies like 15-20 mins later. And everytime during this period while waiting for her reply i would be having paranoid thoughts and asking myself questions like did i say anything wrong in my previous text to her? Is our current conversation too lame that she cant be bothered to reply? Am i that far down in her priority list? 

A lot of people say i overthink stuff and that her long response time could be that she's busy or something, but i can't help but think she's not that interested in me or doesn't want a relationship. But during the few times i went out with her she was pretty sweet and nice, but could that be due to her just being polite? I noticed that her whatsapp replies tended to take longer ever since we went out for dinner on sunday. So naturally i keep thinking did i do/say anything wrong during dinner? Is her long replies a way of saying that "i don't want to go out with you anymore"?  etc etc etc.

Is there anything i can do to banish all these negative thoughts? I know that i'm probably obsessed over her but i really can't help it. Her long replies are making things even worse and it's killing me inside =(
-
 
some guys are just so persistent its really admirable. they continue to pursue the girl they want until they finally succeed. i wish my crush is the same. my crush kind of said something flirty that time but just because i didn't understand him, he avoided me for almost 1 month. its just so infuriating that im making all the moves and he is acting like a coward!
-
 
3 years ago i told myself if there isn't any progress by 2016, i will confess to you on 29th Feb. the reason being that if you reject me, i will only think about it every 4 years (better than emo every year) and if you accept me, we will have a very unique anniversary date. Obviously there hasn't been any progress or i won't be ranting here. However, with 29th Feb approach in about 40+ days i feel my courage disappearing slowly, day by day. It sucks when you are so sure that you want the person but yet you cant overcome your fears.

I come from a faculty that requires alot of human interactions, and looks inevitably allows you to do that job better. People say looks aren't important, but people are just less kind to the ugly. I'm not happy with the status quo, and I find myself unhealthily obsessing over the idea of plastic surgery. But my parents would never allow for it, and I know numerous people share similar sentiments, we've all seen XX/QQ/etc being vehemently lambasted online with caustic vitrols. Besides the risks (clearly people do not detest strangers who went under the knife because they put themselves at risk), what other reasons are there for hating on those who underwent PS? I know the usual reasons: "ugly babies" "fake" "vain" (methinks the appropriate word is self-conscious) "you will turn out like MJ". This is coming from a person who thinks there are really 0 reasons to hate on someone who had succumbed to standards from society and eventually resorted to cutting into her own face, i feel sad for them, maybe because of empathy. If someone is extremely hideous, what possible reasons could you have to despise them for wanting to fit in? People always have an oddly cheerful view of "ugly", by ugly i really mean it, not fishing for compliments. "Your personality is more important" save the platitudes, the slight bias is always there, so tangible i can feel it. 

In a similar vein, i feel equally bad for transgenders, nobody likes the idea of hurting their own body, so I urge everyone to think of the reasons for them wanting to, instead of condemning them blindly. Was it for vainity? A lack of morals? Maybe for some, but not all. Imagine you have a face only your mother could love, it cripples your career, your love life, the way you're treated when mistakes are made. They're subtle (not really actually) but it drives you nuts. I've known ugly friends who have the best personalities, and yet boys do not pay attention to her. It's like the opposite of Lang leav's poem, "her arrow sprung in worlds of dark, she turns their heads but not their hearts" except she would never turn their hearts because their heads won't even turn. I shall end my rant here, if you have some important reasons for hating on the transmutation of ugly people then feel free to write them below. I doubt there's any real concrete reasons though.

 If you don't want your friend who texts you at that kind of timing, can I have her?

Hey , using rejection as a measure of a man's maturity is at best; a one-sided view of maturity and at worst; naive on both sides.

One-sided because maturity is more than 'accepting it like a man'. It's about responsibility (my Ma taught me that). I'm responsible for my studies, my actions and my own happiness.

I consider myself a mature guy. I put effort into thinking of original jokes and make her happy in the messages. I prepped my first date with small gifts and gestures. If she rejects me, I accept it and move on. I don't see the point of attempting to start random convos and annoy her just to prove the 'feelings are true'.

Yes, some guys aren't worth your time and will show their pattern after rejection. But rejection is a blind trap and will also hurt the rare species. Perhaps even more so since they will keep trying. If the trapper expects loyalty from the victim. I think that's pretty naive as well.

Just my thoughts

Once caught a classmate trying to take my upskit pictures, and after confrontation, our friendship  became so awkward. 

I really still hate him

Can guys and girls really just be best friends?

I have been best friends with this guy for over 2 years. We met at orientation and have had several classes together since. I have started viewing him as more than just a friend and have been liking him for quite some time now. We call each other best friends, but sometimes, I feel like we are emotionally reliant on each other (more so than regular friends). I would like to take our relationship to the next level, but am scared of jeopardizing our friendship if he doesn't feel the same way.

Advice, please?

@ the OP of  I know how you feel. I was in the exact same shoes as you! Sharing my own experience so that more people can know about rejections... especially when girls make the first move. Last year, I liked this guy (a friend/classmate) unknowingly and i decided to confess right before he goes for exchange in Norway. Worst decision of my life. He is a shy guy, and dont have many female friends, nor text girls often. I thought i stood a chance, but i lost to exchange. After my confession, he said the exact same words: Not ready for a r/s. Yes, by this he means that he is not ready to be in one with YOU. He did not accept my feelings, but he did not reject it too. He suggested to keep things status quo, and wait til he comes back. At that point of time, i didnt know what to do. But if i had a chance again, i wouldnt confess. FYI, we are no longer friends now. We eventually stopped talking because i felt like i was putting in way too much in this "relationship" that sees no future. He acts all awkward when he sees me now. Hes a nice guy, but just doesnt know how to treat girls properly. So girls out there, open up your eyes. Yes, a r/s is a mutual effort and requires 2 way communication. So if you realise that your messages to him are insanely long and he replies not as fast, or even blue tick your messages before replying you 2-3 hours later.. Face it. You are just not that important to him. I accepted this cruel reality and moved on. I guess what hurts the most for me was that, i felt like i wasnt good enough, not pretty enough.. It was hard because i liked him a lot, got constantly worried and reminded of him EVERY single day and countless moments in a day. Its hard, but you need to tell yourself that hes just not deserving of you. Your love can be better put on another man, a man that will shower you with equal love and attention. Sad to say, its indeed more blissful to be loved than love. 

TLDR; Girl confesses, did not get rejected nor accepted, guy went on exchange, game over.

I confessed to my crush.

Big mistake!

The feeling wasn't mutual. She had been avoiding me ever since. I regretted my decision.

If I can turn back time, I wouldn't have confessed to her. Rather, I will try to keep my intention mysterious and interact with her more and confessing only when I see signs of interest. 
-
 
In response to , I think the reject-first-then-observe method is okay for the women but I think it's super cruel to the guys, don't you think! (I am a female here by the way.)

Because rejection hurts like crap. Maybe it's just me but I would feel really bad to reject a guy and then accept him again/chase him back later? Or maybe by "reject" OP means to tell the guy that we can be friends first or something? 

This grey zone between being single and becoming an official couple is so complex. My theory is that there are two main groups of people: outgoing and reserved. The outgoing ones dare to date people they are attracted to even if they don't know them that well, and if it works, it works; if it doesn't, then it's okay and it ends there. Consequently these people are more social, and able to manage different situations, and are more experienced in dating and socialising with romantic intentions. This way makes sense because you are open to different individuals and have a lot of chances to test water and get to know people. For people like this, it's probably okay to go up to them and indicate interest right away. 

Then there is the other group who is reserved, but will totally devote a lot into one dating relationship when it actually happens. They date people with a long-term view, so in a sense they are quite picky. Contrary to the first group, I think this group rarely gets a chance to know a large number of people because they don't date a lot of people and don't respond to indications of interest at first sight. So if someone you like belongs to this group, it's better to be friends for a while, try to control the romantic feelings and focus on understanding who the person is. After being friends for a long time, and seeing what the other person is like, you can reevaluate.

7. Catfish

Hi everyone, #laoniang is back with another story to add on to #datingstoriesbylaoniang. Can’t promise any more stories after this, but I was looking through my old conversations with people I met on dating apps and was reminded of this horrible terrible vegetable sorry excuse of a man. Because his character is so jiat lat, we shall name him Chou Dou Fu.

So Chou Dou Fu had an extremely captivating Tinder profile. Dimples, sexy smile, hipster glasses, athletic, that boyish yet sexy kind of look you know? As I swiped through his photos, I was smiling to myself while thinking “Why hello there you beautiful creature!”

CDF and I start chatting. At first, he seemed like a decent good boy.  We have a mutual friend, an acquaintance of mine. Not super close to him but he’s an okay guy. So I assume that since CDF and my friend are friends, that means CDF must be an okay guy too.........right? Wah, Laoniang was too foolish back then lah. As a rookie, Laoniang was sibeh noob. So Laoniang let her guard down and allowed her heart to be captured by CDF.

For many days, I spent a lot of time texting CDF back and forth. I tell you, of all the captivating conversationalists Laoniang has ever spoken with, this person takes the cake okay. Not just the cake, he takes the cake, eats the cake, then finishes the cherry on top and ties a knot using only his tongue. Yes he was that smooth. His words were as sweet as UMF 25 grade manuka honey. Just like the other sweet talking guy. But you know what the difference was? Sweet talking guy was not a huge intellectual. CDF was super smart and witty. He knew the words to say, WHEN to say it and how to flirt in a non-creepy, very attractive way. 

CDF stated that he was not on the app for sex or a relationship. He was on the app to look for a workout partner. He proposed that we meetup and exercise together. Okay, but get this – he wanted to go swimming. TEEKO ALERT! You tell me, how to read guys, how? They nod their head yes but they want to say no. (lol.) They say don't want any hanky panky romantic thing, but they want to exercise with you in your skimpiest possible article of clothing. Haiz.

Laoniang was young and gullible indeed. Actually I still am hor. Hahahaha! But not gullible enough to be fooled by CDF. In Laoniang’s gut there was this feeling that something wasn’t right. Something was very…………off about this handsome, flirty and intelligent man. Women’s intuition. I asked myself, why does this guy know my friend, yet I cannot find him on his Facebook account? Very strange leh, if I cannot verify his Facebook account, then he could be a catfish.

Fellow NUS friends, what should we do in such a case where a person’s identify is fishy?

1. Screenshot every damn photo. YES! If he has 6 photos on his dating profile, you better screenshot all 6 photos.
2. Crop away the background just to keep the photograph in your phone.
3. Now one by one, upload each photo to GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH. YES! You can google search an image. Even your profile picture on Facebook to see if anyone is trying to impersonate you online. Technology is amazing isn’t it?
4. Make you sure you search every single image and open up all the “leads” aka URLS/websites that seem useful, or remotely linked to suspected catfish.

Laoniang did this. I was so excited, doing it for the first time. I quite smart hor. Hahaha. First image, nada. Second, nada. Third, nada. Fourth………na- wait. WAIT. I GOT IT. OMG. I FOUND THIS MAN’S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT.

CDF’s Tinder photo was also his profile picture for his PRIVATE Instagram account. But CDF’s name was different. He didn’t write CHOU DOU FU there. Instead, it was a completely different name. Instagram account private, nevermind. I typed that Instagram name on Facebook and BOOMZ, I found it.

Found out that:
1. CDF’s real name was obviously NOT CDF
2. CDF wasn’t 23, he was 31 years old
3. CDF said he was still a uni student, but he’s actually………….WORKING LIAO. For many many many years.
4. CDF is MARRIED and has been married and living in his new house for more than a year with his beautiful WIFE (ya she’s quite chio, I would swipe right to that)

Lesson learnt:
1. You should google image search someone you've met online that wants to meet up with you, because catfishing is a very real phenomenon. It would suck to fall in love with a married person. Glad I dodged that bullet.
2. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Refusing to live in his reality, CDF painted such a beautiful photograph of himself, what could've been perhaps. 
3. CDF’s photographs were him, alright. But they were photographs of him from like 8 years ago is it? Last time so sexy and hot, but his Facebook showed that he was no longer a young stallion. Instead, a lumpy Dou Fu. Please la CDF, using old photographs on Tinder is still being deceptive. You should be a decepticon. Go for Transformers 5 casting lor!
4. Don’t assume people on dating sites are single, they might be attached. Yes it is horrible, why would attached or even MARRIED (WTF were you thinking CDF????) people be on dating sites/apps? Flirting with young, undergraduates some more. Walau. Tai guo fen!

CDF matched up with one of my uni kakis after I unmatched his sorry ass. I helped her to dodge that bullet. I hope that he's not still on the app. I truly feel sorry for his beautiful wife. She should create a Tinder account and maybe Laoniang can swipe right to her ;) Joking lah! But on a serious note, if you're attached, do your partner a favour and delete all your dating app accounts and apps. Emotional cheating with other people is just as bad as physical forms of cheating. Don't cheat hor.

Bye,
LN

Hi OP of , before I start, I don't get why you see your friendship related post as a less important post than other posts here. Your post is definitely not stupid. I too, has yet to find platonic friendships in university, I have my suspicions too, but I have been trying my best to believe in them. 

Like you, I joined camps but I didn't manage to make close friends. I am currently only closer to a few whom I will attend lectures with. Even so, we are not very close. 

Most of the time, I attended lectures and tutorials alone. As much as I like to make new friends and maintain friendships (yes I value friendships a lot), I like to be a loner too. I really find it burdensome to adjust my timetable just so as to fit others' timetables, or waiting for others for hours to have lunch/go home together/to go somewhere together. Ok maybe at this point, some people will say that I am selfish. Yes, I may be selfish, but I really prefer to have a greater say in my own timetable and my own life. Of course, outside of school timings, I am more than willing to hang out with my friends and accommodate to their timetables. During school days when different people have different timetables, it is just really burdensome for me to accommodate to them. Of course, if a friend ends school at around the same timing as me, I am more than willing to go home together. 

I am saying the above because I hope that you may see that being alone isn't that bad. Of course, you may feel lonely eating alone/study alone/have lessons alone, but look, you have a greater control of your time which is very precious in university especially when you have many commitments. 

Some people may say that you cannot afford not to have friends in university since you have to depend on others sometime and somewhere during your journey. However, I don't see the point to find friends just for such practical reasons. I make friends and say hi to others as I genuinely want to be their friends, and I hope each friendship last beyond university. 

I hope to make more friends, however, I need more time to warm up with people and I find it hard to trust people. For example, I hope to be close with my project mates too, but to no avail. I have to admit that I am a little dubious of them because of my very bad grades which have projects. I have been suspecting that they marked me down despite my efforts as they were absent most of them time when I contributed to our report, and I was not as vocal as other members during project meetings, hence they may not be aware of the efforts I put in. This was especially when finals were not that hard for me, and I did pretty well for my CA and mid terms. I don't know what to expect from the 5% peer evaluation though. Maybe I am thinking too much. I have not voiced to others my concerns. I feel apologetic to my group mates whenever I think this way. Frankly speaking, I really don't like myself for being this suspicious. I hope to change this mindset. 

Also, rather than knowing people through an app, why not open up yourself to more people by saying hi? This is more practical isn't it? If you really want platonic friendships, you have to learn how to trust people and make sacrifices. This is something I myself have to buck up on. Yes, platonic friendships exist, it is just that we have yet to find it in university, and I hope that you don't give up. Maybe one day, we will find each other as friends. Cheers~

What does it mean when a freshie whom I met through camp keeps initiating conversations with me - I'm already happily attached and she knows it too.. and I don't think I'm leading her on in any way. 
-
 
So today, I happened to glance through screenshots of our old conversations.

Do you still remember those conversations where we'd talk about our various game obsessions? How we bonded over Portal 2, and how we used to say that Fallout 4's never gonna come out until we're 50 (heh, how wrong we were.)? I still remember I'd watch you play and die multiple times on Dark Souls. You'd get so frustrated that at one point you even nitpicked that sigh-like sound the game makes when you die. It was pretty hilarious.

Do you still remember those cheesy romantic messages we used to send each other? Man, you were so fucking smooth with your words back then...and to be honest, you still are now. I don't think I could ever match up to that. You were so quick-witted, knowing how to make a witty romantic remark in response to an innocuous statement. I guess that's one of the things that made me fall for you back then.

I still remember that night I felt so down in the dumps that I was pretty inconsolable. You got so worried that you even messaged my younger sibling to check up on me. You stayed up all night reassuring me that everything's eventually bound to work out, and cracked those jokes that made me grin despite all the tears. I still recall jokingly telling you to "cut it out, I'm supposed to be crying!"

But I suppose all good things must come to an end. It's been almost a year since we broke up.

I don't think you'll ever know how everything suddenly felt like it shattered and lost its colour when you told me that maybe we should break up. You told me that "maybe I wasn't good enough as a girlfriend", and those words still echo through my head up to this day. 

And yet somehow, looking back to everything I've gone through this year after we've broken up, I feel that maybe this breakup was a good thing.

After you've said those words, I've started to reevaluate my life. I'm not perfect, but it doesn't mean I can't be better. I've decided to change myself for the better. Maybe I did it in the hopes that we might get back together (we never did). Or maybe I did it as a sort of spiteful show that I can do fine without you. Whatever the case may be, after a year of figuring out what I needed to improve about myself and actually doing something about it, I've never felt so assured of myself for a long time.

I've found my own happiness once again. I used to rely on you so much to make myself happy, and that was a mistake on my part.  I used to complain about the boring life I had - in fact, I did nothing but send complaints your way. It's actually no wonder you've grown tired of me and broke it off. Now I'm slowly easing back into doing things I used to love, and I'm actually pretty overwhelmed with the amount of things I wanna do. 

I won't deny the fact that I still long for that feeling I used to have when we were still together, and that I still long for how things used to be. But I also feel like I've moved on, and I'm ready to take on another adventure - in singlehood or otherwise.

So in the end, I wanna thank you. You definitely won't be able to read this, since you're busy with your own life now and our friendly messages have slowly decreased in frequency. I'll never forget all the things you've done for me, and all the memories that we've had. I thank you for being the best boyfriend I've had so far. I don't think I'd ever find somebody to replace that part in my heart, even though I know I'll find the man who's really the one for me sometime in the future.

Most of all, I thank you for letting me go.

I wish you all the best, my dearest A.

You know the couple banter where each of the pair argues they love the other more?  I don't have that problem  and I am not too sure if that is a problem in itself. 

You see,  my situation is one in which my boyfriend obviously loves me more and when I say more,  I mean much more.  He says that I am his world but to me,  he is just a part and I am not sure whether he will always be a part of it.  He has made plans for marriage but I am still in a state of going with the flow and not thinking further than that.  Or rather,  even when I think I am not too sure whether he is the right fit. 

It is not that I don't love him but the disparity in our love is an issue I feel.  I think more practically but to him, when it comes to love,  all it matters is that we remain together.  Because of that,  he appears to neglect all our differences that we need to resolve before we step into the next stage of life.

Yup this is just a rant. But any opinions are welcome.

After reading the post  and , I can’t help but give you guys a heads up about rejection, coming from girls who think like me. Just a perspective; I have quite a few guys chasing me before, and have dated before too.  

When talk about BGR thing, I have a “reject-first-then-observe” rule for a few reasons, incld guys I’m initially attracted to. It’s bcos guys who chased me are those I don’t know super well (and I think this is the main reason why most girls would reject guys also). I hang out with my female-only kakis most of the time. And I don’t believe in platonic friendship, one party is bound to fall for another I believe (feel free to disagree though, it’s just my opinion). You have to see a person through their ups and downs in order to really know them, and not just based on the previous moments when they behave themselves around you just so that you would be attracted to their good-boy/girl front. There was once I rejected one and woah once we resume as frens, all the pattern chut lai/come out already sia (walao, I felt like I kena cheated). That’s when I know that that guy is not for me. I doubt people can put up a front for long. It takes only time for you start seeing their true nature. 

Next, I have to agree with OP of . If guys can handle it like a gentlemen, woah I think I will end up chasing him back lehhh..! Mainly bcos I found that very mature, which I find very attractive *gasp*. Handle it in a way that the friendship is not affected in any way, that you don’t resent her for rejecting you after all that you did to chase her (that you worked on your body or your looks etc.). It’s ok to be affected, after all, it’s like a failure after putting in so much effort and it seems like it is all for nothing. For one, the girl didn’t ask for any of it. Take your time to recover from it. Handle it with maturity (ie BE A MAN; most girls like men, not boys); everyone has a choice, and respect her decision that maybe it’s just not the right time for her, maybe she just hopes that you’d improve in other aspects like your character, or maybe she still have someone else in mind (in that case you suay lor, or you can give her time you know), or maybe she wants to date after graduation, that’s all. Rejection is a good thing in a way, at least you know she’s not toying with you or your feelings and just to fill her boredom temporarily. One of my kakis she will just date any guys (with acceptable standards) who chased her just bcos she pity them and she feel bad for not giving any chance. Btw she's a chiobu and Ms Popular, more chio than me. Eventually she’ll initiate the break up and jump to the next relationship (she’s heartless that way). Time will tell if the you guys are really into the girl and vice versa, or it was simply a temporal attraction. For the latter, rejection is still the better decision imo. If feelings are true, I hope you guys will not give up chasing bcos...just maybe, she hopes that you would ask her out again (UNLESS she tells you directly the first time that she’s not into you at all, then I think chasing her again might just turn her off hur hur). Trust me, the efforts put into chasing her is not for nothing. Perhaps she hopes for other changes as well, not just the physical. Relationships aren’t easy; couples do fight quite a bit (don’t fool yourself with K-dramas/Disney love stories); it ranges from some jealous third party, work stress, boredom, family problems, her PMS, differences in expectations and so on. If guys can’t even handle a rejection, I don’t know how they’re going to handle all that is to come. 

One of the rules when comes to dating: don’t expect your partner to “make you whole” or to handle some aspects of your life which you can’t handle yourself. In other words, if you can’t handle loneliness yourself/just want to tell the world that you got girlfren (that you are desirable too)/just want to have fun/stop being an evergreen, I think the relationship might not end off too well (again, just my opinion, feel free to disagree). Sometimes people want to fall in love for all the wrong reasons. I learnt from NUS how to be happy and alone sometimes when your kakis aren’t ard: to eat, to attend lectures, to survive a difficult module on my own. It’s not easy, definitely. I do fall into mild depression that the world/life in NUS is just too cruel. But it takes time to see it otherwise although reality is that no one is going to be there for you every single time. But friends are out there, gotta make an effort to meet them you know. At work, one is bound to meet a bitch (unless you super heng). Sometimes in a relationship, you’ll realize that you feel alone even with that someone. Somehow you guys just can't click/talk things through. So my advice is to learn to be more independent first, else you might end up pestering/clinging to your partner a lot (this will suffocate them and tire them out eventually). That you’re okay being single, but you’re happier being in a relationship. I hope my words shed some light to those who are wondering about the things I’ve mentioned. Of course, I’m just speaking from my point of view, every girl is different. There are those like me, just as there are those like my chiobu kaki, just as there are those who have no idea who they really want HAHA. My Singlish not super fluent lah, sorry it’s not as funny as #laoniang or #laobu story. 

ps. I hope #laobu will update soon.

I can hardly imagine throwing a guy under the bus after he helped you get over your ex-tended and ex-cruciating pain.

Looking at the fact that most confessions on NUSWhispers are trolls nowadays, I thought why not post a small (but real) confession of mine to help return it to a real "confessions" page? 

Here goes. I had a crush on a senior from Raffles Hall. He's a really sporty and talented person. Never seem to study but always manage to get good grades. I hesitated for a long time before confession to him......anonymously:( He has since graduated and went overseas for further studies. I really really regretted not being brave enough at that time. This will always be one of the biggest regret in my life. I wish him only the best in whatever he does:))

Yup. Real confession. Enjoy the rest of your holidays guys!

I am diff from the OP of  I clearly loves my bf more than he does of me. Well, we have had quite a number of BIG FIGHTS and all these fights resulted in him initiating a break up from me but we are still together till today cos I kept holding him back promising that things will be better. He's still nice to me and all but he has mentioned that we should check whether we are suitable for each other when the time comes for us to consider marriage. it's clear that he's not sure if we are suitable for marriage due to all our fights. we are 1.5 years old together. it has quite an impact on me too, constantly thinking that he doesn't love me enough as I was always the one holding back...when boys did too much of the initiating breakups and girls did too much of the holding back... who wants to be in a r/s when you are uncertain if you wanna be walking down the aisle with him or her?
-
 
I hope this doesn't get filtered because I really want to put this out ;x

Sorry this might not be as *important* as other confessions and is rather irrelevant to NUS. And... Sorry for sounding stupid  but it is really a thing I wonder if it really existed out there. 

I'm feeling rather lonely ever after since I entered university. I did join camps but the friends i've made are not just as close as sec/jc friends. Also, I don't really feel part of the clique i am in.

So hence, I wish I can make some friends perhaps, through an app or something. Unfortunately, most of such apps out there are what we call "dating apps". It's difficult to find an app just purely for platonic friends :( 

So I wonder, do such an app for platonic friends really exist??? I prefer chatting up friends who are of the same gender too, as I am truly looking for platonic friendships. Like, i just want to chat with people, who wouldn't judge me as they don't really know me irl, at the end of the day to let off some stress and such. 

I guess, it's impossible right? :( And yes, I don't want to download those dating apps just to give "false hope" to others who wish to find a soulmate. Also, my bf wouldn't like the idea of me downloading these apps and I don't want to make him worry either.  

Anyway, tldr; does a friendship app really exist? 
-
 
My boyfriend is introverted and shy by nature. He doesn't have female friends who he interacts with. On the contrary, I am an extrovert who enjoys hanging out with my friends. Sometimes, I meet up with different guy friends or acquaintances individually. I have no intention to cheat so I always tell my boyfriend before I meet up with them. Unfortunately, my boyfriend is very upset about me going out individually with guys. It could be due to these two reasons. Firstly, there have been past instances that some of my guy friends were attracted to me. When this happened, I immediately stopped meeting up with them. Secondly, my boyfriend's ex cheated on him. Anyway, I have no intentions to cut off all contact with my guy friends. I still want to be able to meet them from time to time. Any idea how I can talk this out with my boyfriend? Or do you agree with my boyfriend that I should stop going out with any male friend or acquaintance one-on-one?
-
 
I know we're just doing this play gf-bf thing to satisfy our friend's teases. But I'm slowly buying into it. I'm not going to be the rebound girl you're going to have after your longest and serious relationship. I'm better than that. I bet you know it too.
-
 
So I have been  refreshing nuswhispers for the past 24h and I have no choice but to accept that my post has been filtered and rejected, once again, for the 3rd time now. It was nothing inappropriate or rude or insensitive. The only fault I could think of is that I might have written it in run on sentences. But that's hardly the point, is it? Pretty sure it was still comprehensible. Sigh.

I have seen lots of people cheat on their significant others in NUS, especially during exchange. There seems to be some unsaid rule about not reporting/letting their significant others know (?) 
-
 

your story sounds exactly like mine. i just want to say... when guys say they are not ready for a relationship, please take his words at face value. some may even go as far as to say that guys may tell you they are not ready, but they are just not ready for a relationship WITH you. 

blowing hot & cold is already a red flag. please think twice before agreeing to be his filler of his free time & boredom.

one day (and the day will come) you may just find out that actually he had been texting another girl/other girls all this while... by then all you can do is to laugh at yourself for being so pathetic.

Please stop lying to yourself and others that attachment is love. If you are together with your partner only because you cannot be alone, please leave. Dont hurt her any further. She ought to be with someone who loves her and respects her.

It might not be obvious to her. But we as bystanders can see it all.

I yearn to have people not to understand me, but at the very least try to do so. But time and again, this just doesn't happen. I'm really not sure what's wrong with me. Is the problem with others or is it with myself? And that's just part of the disappointment I find in others that leads me wanting to be alone. They betray the trust that is crucial in friendships and there's only this many times I'm willing to play the idiot. It isn't because I don't value the friendship. I do. The problem seems to lie in that time and again, they really take me for a fool. Is it that hard to do away with manipulation, lies and disloyalty? It has come to a stage I'm not sure whether I should even try to forge new or maintain romantic/friendly ties anymore. Part of me wants to be alone even with the struggles of doing so because I know I will never disappoint myself. So can anyone please tell me where does the problem exactly lie if there's a problem at all?

@14666 I also find it really hard to sustain friends in NUS, they seem to change everytime the sem ends, no matter how much i try. Being in FASS/Pol Sci doesnt help either. Can anyone provide advice/ extend their friendship? :/
-
 
In reply to . I know how that feels. The best way is to break the ice and have an understanding with them that you are different from them. You don't have to fit in, just be yourself and who knows, despite the differences, you would be really close friends. :)

I'm really really friendless in NUS..been wanting to look for a cca but so far I can't find anything that interests me. Plus I'm pretty shy and introverted..does anyone know of any cca that has tons of introverted kids around?

People always ask me why I can accept such a screwed up person as my boyfriend, someone who used to sleep around and hit on girls, has a bit of moral issues. At first I was extremely skeptical about someone like him, but after a while, I warmed up to him and found that I like him and believe in his present character and person, and that is all. But of course I'm not dumb, I am still a cynical person and I will keep a part of myself closed, so that if I find out he is cheating and stuff, I can be firm and initiate a break up. I guess in this way, I can love but still be a cold and heartless bitch when the time calls for it.

I am closer to my friends from other majors as compared to friends from the same major. Sadly, different majors result in vastly different timetables, I can only meet up with them for lunch weekly. I want to become closer with my friends from my major, since I will probably need their help in the future. However, they seem slack-ish and I also don't feel that comfortable talking to them. What makes it worse is that they are my only friends from my major, plus they are closer to their JC-mates whom don't seem to like me. I really want to forge stronger friendships. How should I go about doing it?
-
 
I have never been asked out before. Nor have I ever been approached by guys. Sometimes, I wonder if there is something wrong with me :/ Is this peculiar? :(
-
 
I perfectly agree with confessor of . 

I don't have any close groups of friends from my major although it's pretty clique-y. I used to have one but some thing happened so I've become a lone ranger. I know my parents who worked hard to put me through Uni would want to attend the ceremony and I know I should because of them. 

But sometimes I stay up at night thinking of ways to make myself seem less loser-ish. I don't want my parents to know I have no friends in Uni and that their son is nothing but someone that's pretty much a loner.

Be it female or male, everyone should try not to control their partner and see who they truly are. Because someone that's controlled won't be that way forever.

I have been together with this girl for a few years. In the eyes of others, we are very stable and marriage is a matter of time after we both graduate and settle with our jobs (aka financially stable). However, she doesnt know that all these while I have a liking for for boys. Now i am trapped between 2 options. 1) to let her know the truth and work things out together OR
2) to hide from her the truth and deny myself and cut myself away from that vice. 
I am a firm believer that, Ignorance is Bliss and is more in favour of the second options. But I dont trust myself to be able to handle the temptation. And I dun want to be cheating on my wife in the future. Please tell me what should i do.

To guys who think that looks are important, you're flat out wrong. I've had girls telling me that I'm good looking but I still haven't gotten myself a girlfriend after 4 years in NUS. When I look around, it seems like there are lots of guys who don't look as good but have better eq than me getting girlfriends. 
Moral of the story: looks can only help *so* much.

- Good looking, high iq but low eq guy

Currently seeing a beta orbiter (physically + socially) with multiple unresolved emotional issues, studies best described as "low impact mental exercises". None of this really bothers me because I have enough confidence and security to power an entire damn family. Also I'm sick of fuckboys playin you dig? However I do realize that I might have to introduce him to my high achieving tribe where I have close to apex predator status, and I'd rather get into a minor motor accident than have to face the pity and disapproval from "the big reveal". Is this worth pursuing? Because despite the trash talk he is really quite a wonderful person and I don't wanna start a new fire that I can't put out for him, ya feel?

I'm not being a troll and this is a serious question. Do girls get jealous just because another gets more attention from guys?

I'm not trying to hint at anything but I find myself in an awkward relationship with my friend every time we're with our group of guy friends. This friend of mine is extremely competitive and it is obvious that she always wants to do better than me in terms of grades and whatnot. I never wanted to compete with her but I find her behavior extremely irritating. It's like she's being sarcastic in every way and always trying to put me down every time someone else says something nice about me. Especially if the 'someone' is male. 

One of the best examples is that we applied for an internship at a particular company together. She was really interested in that company seeing how it is one of prestigious ones that people always aim for, while I was like the 'blur sotong' that just wanted an internship to clear my attachment. But by the twist of fate, I got the offer but she didn't. She eventually interned at another company, not as prestigious but also a rather good one. Then after, she kept repeating to our guy friends about how her department in the other company than mine, and how the interviewer was practically begging her to join them. I mean I'm totally cool about you talking about your interview experience but seriously? I'm not even trying to compete with you. That kind of sarcasm disgusts me. 

Another example would be when we're out for an outing with our group of guy friends. For idk what reason, I can click very well with them, so they'd joke with me and engage me in conversations most of the time. (We'd engage in our own conversations while walking because It's a really big group of 6, so we'll split into smaller groups) So throughout she'd show a pissed off face and say she wants to go home because she's very busy. =.= but the thing is, this doesn't happen when we're out with our female friends?! She'd stay till midnight or even later.

I have no idea why she's acting this way. And the way she talks to me when I talk to her in front of the guys gives off the signal "stop talking bitch".  We've known each other since secondary school and she's one of the few female friends I have. (I have way more males friends than female friends)

This is really starting to piss me off. I mean I have no intention to compete with her and yet she's so freaking competitive.

Girls are seriously difficult to comprehend. I guess this is the reason why I hang out with guys more often.

-A very confused girl

My girlfriend has a few ex. Just a few,  about 3. And somehow, I feel uncomfortable about it. I manage to get her to block off them and start a new social life with new people, and I don't even let her follow any of her other friends that's related to them because I'm afraid that her ex photos may appear. I Know some of you may feel that I'm being too much,  but the insecurities are there. Im afraid that she will go back to them or even think of their moments when they see them. However,  recently,  some of my friends told me that I should let her accept her friends which may be related to them so that people can get jealous of us. They will know that I'm the only man that can make her happy,  and she's really happy with me and had never regreted her decision. This makes some sense because I also wish that those people do know that she's really happy with me and has never regretted it and she will be the one that is going to marry me in the future. It's their loss for not having her.

Shes a girl. Hes a friend. More than a friend to her. She didnt want to ruin the friendship between them. She Kept quiet. Until that day, where she gathered all her courage. She confessed. She did. Never a person to express her feelings, the guy was taken aback; not because of her personality, but just because he never expected her to confess. After what seems like an eternity after sending her confession through text, she received a reply. He's not looking to get into a relationship now. The resume as friends. My question is this: How to identify whether the guy is interested or not? She receives a lot of mixed signals from him. sometimes hes very cold. Sometimes hes enthusiastic. Shes confused as hell...  She would like to know how quiet guys respond when confessed to!

My boyfriend had been hanging out with this other girl. I even heard from several of my friends that he was seen holding hand with her.

I confronted my boyfriend with about this issue and he admitted that he had been dating this other girl. However, he said he still love me and he valued our intimacy. He merely date the other girl as he missed those chemicals that caused infatuation. 

What he said make sense. Infatuation is only temporary and his infatuation with me had faded off as we had been together with each other  for quite some time already.

I heard that men aren't meant to be monogamous. Should I forgive him? I mean I still love him and vice versa. Isn't love about mutual feeling of affection?

Something like .
We have been friends for 4-5 years, were in college together. Now whenever we meet, he keeps throwing casual hints at how he used to observe me when we were in college, he likes when I laugh, and that he used to have dreams about us being a couple..but then immediately laughs off as if it's just all in the past.
This one time, we were out for dinner and his friend called for something. After the call, he told me jokingly that his friend was just wishing him good luck for the date. And then I asked him is this a date, and AGAIN he just laughed off and changed the topic. (So even I am not clear when is a dinner 'date' or 'just dinner'?)
So he keeps doing this. Throwing random hints that he likes me, and cares for me..but when I try to talk further on this, he becomes non-interested. I am super confused. 
He is a great guy, and a very dear friend. I am very fond of him and dating him would be great, but I don't know if that's what he wants. I also feel that talking to him about this might make things awkward between us, but then this uncertainty isn't working for either of us. I am a girl who keeps things simple and clear. I think the next time he does this, I'll ask him straight about this.
What do you all think? Any suggestions/advice/your take on this?

 This is with reference to the post about gift rejection.

Having read the post and the comments, allow me to give my comments after careful analysis.

1. I understand that OP does not really like the gift, but after all, the guy did make the effort to wrap it nicely, hence MAYBE you could have just accepted it, and like what others have mentioned, you could do what you want with it after that.

2. Even if you hate chocolates, you shouldnt have told him directly in a crude way. Perhaps, you could have made a polite excuse to reject it. For example, you could have told him that you cant accept such an expensive gift? Or rather, reply "I understand your intention and I greatly appreciate that, however, I have a bad experience with chocolates, maybe this gift would suit someone else better? Thank you!( With a smile)". If he still insist that you accept it, then take it and pass the kind gesture to someone else who would like the gift better.

3. Indeed, the guy also has his own fault. "He then said he would throw the gift if I don't take it as he already have "lots of chocolates" at home" would imply that he did not put in enough value in this "gift" of his, or rather treat it like a garbage.Such a reply could be due to his disappointment or anger, or he is trying to make you feel hurt or guilty. 

4.Neverthess, it is no excuse for him to reply your rejection in such a manner. I do agree that it is hurtful. After all, you give someone a gift to make her happy, and now are hurting her just because of rejection, isnt that reductio absurdum? Guys, if you get rejected, have some 君子风度 and accept it. There is no such obligation to accept a gift, as long as someone refuse it politely. It is understandable to feel hurt getting your gifts rejected, but the other party has the right too.

5. Throwing away chocolates is a wastage of food. There are tons of people suffering in Africa due to hunger. Donate the chocolates to these people if you dont want them. Dont say such 缺德 remarks.

Verdict: Both of you have your own faults, as the situation could have turned out differently if both of you think before speaking.

To the OP: There is no need to get frustrated over such a trivial matter. In life, there are better things to get frustrated over. At least you know what kind of person he is. Take this as a life experience of learning how to reject. Start the new year with happiness, not frustration. Do not be upset by the commenters with rude remarks, as they might have meant the same thing, albeit in a crude way. Cheer up and Happy New Year!   Huat ah!

One thing I've learnt about relationships. It's all about attraction. If the girl attracted to you, you fart in front of her she also think you cute. If the girl not attracted to you, you get the moon for her she still think you lame. So just be yourself and meet as many people as possible; you will meet someone. True story.

If you need to consult NUSWhispers about your relationship or the state of it, it means you need to breakup because communication. 

If you need to consult NUSWhispers about whether to chase a girl/guy or not, don't bother; you don't like her/him enough.

Hi OP of ! I would love to find out more. But when will you be in griddit? Say 10pm daily? Hehe. 

Oh yes, I have already initiated 2 meetups with him and he have not initiated any meeting after that. Perhaps I should sort things out with him or just block and ignore him?

Lately, I have seen some posts on nuswhispers regarding people discussing about height issues, ego etc.
 
Well, let me give you my personal opinions on what I think about this.

Even as a guy with average height, I must admit that sometimes I do have this kind of thoughts, such as whether the girl I like will end up taller than me in heels, whether I will feel sian when an amazon with heels walk past me, etc etc. ( I know some guys do feel that way too ).

But think carefully. If you really like a girl, you shouldnt be bothered by this height difference stuff. Also, if that girl really likes you and is a girl with mature thinking,I believe she wouldnt mind that height difference. A true relationship works when both sides really understand each other and ignore the trivial differences. Why do you want to care what other people think of when you 2 walk side by side? If you 2 really like each other, it would be as though both of you are in your own world, where others are invisible right?

As for the other case where guys feel hurt getting towered by girls in heels, you need to ask yourself this. Is it important? There are sheet tons of tall girls in Singapore and you cant expect yourself to get affected everytime a tall girl walks past right? You are yourself and shouldnt be affected by such trivial issues. I believe there is a girl out there (with the ideal kind of height)who will like you for who you are, so you shouldnt be bothered by the rest of the amazons.

In case some of you vertically challenged guys need some ego boost, here are some facts that you might want to consider. There are in fact short people who are successful in real life, as elites of the society. 

As long as you put in effort, I dont see why you cant end up on the top tier of the social ladder, and eventually command people who are much taller than you? You may be the shortest in the clique, but once you open that golden mouth of yours, I dont see why those people wont just shut their mouth and listen to you with due respect yeah? (No offence to the tall people)

Moreover with success, I believe a girl will have that 安全感to woo you instead of you doing the work,because some girls do want their partner to be financially stable. (What good is a tall and buff guy who flirts everyday without a life ambition?)

Once you secure that relationship, you can proceed to make her like you for your character and who you are.

In conclusion (Well I have said alot and pardon my Engrish...), short guys, you are not alone and please be confident of yourself and take note of the aforementioned scenarios. With a great ambition and successful career, a 4 foot guy can also be seen as a 8 foot guy ;) !

I am the OP for .

I was hoping for some help but it looks like I could not get much.

Not even the trolls will bastardise my post.

Let me explain a little more.

I try hard to make friends, and I think I make friends well. However, whenever I try to make moves such as getting to know the girl better, either I am auto-friend zoned or I sometimes get told straight in the face "I know you like me, but I don't".

I mean, I try to keep myself open, read about all sorts of things so that I can at least talk a little about different things to try to break the ice. But I don't get a chance to. I read about Japanese anime and manga, about wines, about Asian cuisine, shoes, travel and more so that I am somewhat knowledgeable about life.

Yes, I know romance is realistic. I know the other side of love is cruel. People get together and break up. The head can live with that. But while the head always says I need to let it go, break the ice and try again, the heart just gets shattered harder and harder with each acrimonious resolution. In the past I could still salvage the friendship, but I remembered how a bitchy girl bitched about me and hence causing my interest to block me without a chance to defend. I also remembered how another girl said she rejected me "peacefully" but then got her friends to shun me.

I am not here so much to find Ms. Right. I want to know how to defend against gossip mongers and how to give myself a fighting chance at getting a Ms. Right. How can I stop being gossiped about because either they say I try to hard, I creep people out, or that I'm just weird and not worth people's time?

I'm sorry admin.

When  do you know if it's time to breakup? When the very thought enters your mind? When it stays there, day after day? I woke up this morning, unable to pull the trigger on us. I don't know if I can, or if I dare to.

I'm confused by this particular situation.

So there is this guy who texted me on a daily basis but doesn't reply regularly, like after many hrs even though he was online many times and even have time to update his social media accounts. He will always ask what am I doing then goes to disappear for many hrs even after I replied.

He has never asked me out before even though he claimed to be the type of guy who will impromptu decided on an activity with his friends.

I have no idea if he is interested or not. If he is not interested, then perhaps I should drift away from him to prevent further damage to my heart. (Yes, I am interested in him.)

It is so difficult to read guys. :( Any advice? Oh, and this is not a troll.

I don't think I want to attend my graduation although I think my parents would like to attend it. This is because I would feel out of place and upset because I'm not sure who I can hang out with during the ceremony, highlighting the sad fact that I did not manage to make many good friends. Until now I don't really have any close friends in university. Actually the majority of people I come into contact with seem quite superficial and like to hang out in large groups, talk about the latest gossip and about people and I found out that I was sort of backstabbed by a friend I thought could be trusted. The pressure and rat race of wanting to do well it seems cause people to turn really ugly and deceitful. For the few that I find genuine, I don't really have many opportunities to keep in touch with them as I always seem to be with different people every semester. Also they seem to already have their own gang. I think another main reason is because my personality is quite different from the majority of those in my faculty but this can't be helped. 
Though this is the case I still regret perhaps not trying to understand these people better and maybe put in more effort in getting to know more people. I believe it would also have benefited me a lot academically. I often hear about test banks circulating and people working together in groups to do online tests and I found out that I could easily have retrieved a past midterm paper from others for practice because it was actually returned to students the last time and it was not posted for practice for my batch. How naive I was to think that I could do well with my own effort and beat the bell curve. 
Well I think I will just try my best this upcoming semester to gain more friends. I still have one more chance to have the "best years of my life" apparently. 
-
 
With reference to OP of , I agree with just about everything you have said. But I would also let you know that the reason why some guys "persist" (if you want to put it that way) is because they want the girl to know them better. 

A lot of girls reject guys without even knowing them much, and therein lies the superficiality of it all. So the guy might think OK, maybe when I am better looking, richer etc, I can try again. Just saying. 
-
 
New semester, new me. However, I find it vv hard to be motivated, especially when I know I can just 'get by'. I do want to try to excel and work hard for every mod I plan to take this sem (some of them are really, really hard and require a lot of dedication)
How do I not lost focus? I make a resolution at the beginning of every semester to work as hard as I can, but I find myself losing focus in the middle. 

I sometimes feel depressed...thinking what's the point of life at all, and if I die nobody will miss me. Then I think of my parents and stop this chain of thoughts. I feel like I should also visit CPS this sem. How do I do this? Do I just drop by, without appointment?

-
 

i'm someone who went through something similar. i just wanna let you know that if a guy leaves you confused, he does not love you. if a guy loves you, he will not bear to leave you puzzled & hurt. 

seeing that you're already interested in him, i would advise that you pull yourself back before things get too late, because the pain and tears would be of so much greater intensity if you allow things to grow. although i guess even if i tell you this, feelings may not always go the way you want them to, and you may be enticed to venture further, especially if he continues dangling carrots in front of you. but always remember that it's still a life experience & please don't hate yourself for it. still, protect yourself & what's important to you (ie your values).

would love to share & advise further if you need someone to talk to. you can find me on griddit ^^

General Tips for lovelorn NUS guys: One of the more constant type of posts I see here is the sad rejected guy lamenting his unjust deprivation of love by enigmatic women who appear to be equally interested in the guy, only to confine him cruelly in the friend-zone when he confesses. The outcome is painful for both parties (and for me to see such unnecessary emotional hurt), but it can be avoided. Here are some tips from bro to bros (ladies feel free to constructively criticise)

1. Pre-First-Date Confessions are for the movies and serials. They don't belong to real life dating.

movies: [attraction] -> [interaction] -> [confession] -> [first date] -> [happily ever after]

real life: [attraction] -> [interaction] -> [ask on a date] -> [first date] -> [many more dates] -> [confession/ "the Talk"] -> [exclusivity]

2. Be honest of your intentions, don't pretend to be just a friend
instead of asking ambiguously "wanna hang out/ eat dinner?" like any of her other platonic friends might do, make it clear that you are not looking to just 'be a friend' if that truly is the case. Don't waste her time by acting like a friend when your "friendship" would crumble without promises of romance. But of course, "making it clear" does not mean "I love you and I want you to have my babies" confession style...

"If you're not already attached, could I take you out to dinner sometime?"
This makes your intentions very clear, without being too direct and pressuring. (usually... see point 4)

3. Accept Rejection like a Gentleman
Another lie we are fed by movies and serials is that a man's effort (despite his initial unattractiveness to the woman) should always be rewarded by a woman's affections eventually. Misogynist bullshit. It's ultimately her decision, and if she says no, stop bothering her and move on.

And no, this is not because its some sneaky way to gain her respect and admiration in the hopes of asking her out again. It is because you respect her decision. Period.

4. Women are not like standardised locks to be picked with a secret manual

One of my close female friends prefers to be strictly platonic friends for months before any romantic hints and doesn't like the pressure of going on on "official dates" even with guys she finds attractive. For every 10 girls harassed by suitors and stalkers, 1 girl would find her true love in a guy who persistently chased her despite rejection for a year. Each individual is different, and these tips, while applying to most people, are not laws or rules that apply to all people. Keep an open mind.

Good luck,

It's hard to be myself even in front of my family. I know I have a very low boiling point,  meaning I get pissed and flustered easily. Because of this, I tend to keep to myself and not talk much even to my family when I'm at home. My speaking loudly is also another factor. People think that I'm angry when I speak, but it's actually my normal volume. Because of all these, I stay in my room most of the time and have very little interaction with my family. 

It's even worse with friends because I put on and facade. I pretent to be happy and interested when actually I'm just an empty shell in front of them. The worst part is, I smile a lot in public. I read in an article that smiling makes a person more approachable. That's why I keep smiling when I don't feel like smiling. My face is a natural sulking and pissed face. 

I apologise to all my friends and family for being such a fake person. Yet, I have to do this, because if I don't, I will argue a lot with my family, and not have friends. Although I'm tired, I will still do all these, because in order to survive, I have to do these.

@  

 has some great advice. 

Anyway what has been done, cannot be undone. Focus on doing your stuff and being a great person, and upgrade your dating perspective next time.

I once creeped out a girl too. Not sure if gossip is spread about or what else she has done/said, but that's too long ago for me to think about it. Looking back, I did have much to learn about dating.

There's a guy confessing to me. We have known each other for a few months and I kinda like him. He graduated on Aug 2015 and now going to go overseas for postgrad. I still stuck in NUS for 4 more years. People say long distance doesn't work, should I give it a try?

I would like to get your opinion of your definition of a date. When 2 friends (guy and girl) go out together for a meal, would that be considered a date? I'm asking this because i recently went out for dinner with a girl whom i don't really know well, with the intention of getting to know her better and possibly something further in the future. In my eyes this is obviously a date, since i'm exploring the possibility of a relationship with her. But what about from her point of view? When a guy asks her out for dinner would that automatically be a date? Or is it just 2 friends catching up on stuff over dinner? I dont wanna ask her at this point in time as that would only make things awkward between us.

My friends keep on giving me opportunities to find soulmates. Given my age, it is probably time to look for a partner as well. I thank them for wanting to help me, and mentally I have been trying to push to be much more open to do things I almost never do before.

I think finding friends from different circles for me is easy. I make friends extremely easily. Acquaintances, extremely easy too. Just open up and speak up. Except that none of these groups are marriageable age. However, among those of marriageable age, groups can discredit me even before I make any half-decent move, such as asking for a meal out.

The trouble is, I think I am still traumatised from a bad romance one year ago. I am still feeling the pain from the chain of events that happened which led to the loss of crush, friends and admittedly, as much as I like to pretend that I am strong and emotionally unaffected, I think I am still visibly shaken.

I just sense the darkness in me grow bit by bit, and each time I try to seek "counselling" from my friends they give up on me because all I just want to do is to explain my situation fully so that they can help better, but they make me sound like I'm a useless bastard.

Ok, so I met this girl and we have been texting almost everyday and we even went for dinner together for a couple of times alone and stuff like that. We can talk about anything and we even shared stuffs about ourselves that you normally won't even tell your good friends. Everything was pretty smooth sailing and I really enjoyed her companion and I am always looking forward to the next outing together which is probably once a week or so. 

After hanging out with her for a few times, I realized that I had subconsciously became interested in her because the kind of feeling expressed towards her is not the kind a normal friend would usually do. However, one thing about her is that she's interested in someone else and has already told me about it before and she's also the kind of girl that is generally fine to meet up with other guys alone. That's why there're times that I feel that she's just leading me on because why would someone initiate the chat almost everyday and not be interested in the person at all? Or am I just a spare or reserve for her because from what I know, the guy isn't really interested in her but she's just waiting like me. As you guys might have guessed, I confessed to her anyway and was rejected. I knew my chances was slim because I guess I am a little bit too rush but I felt that I should just go for it anyway. Till now, we're pretty much still good friends or at least that's what she thinks I am to her, and we're still chatting almost everyday. Weird? I know but yeah..

So, I am just curious about the opinions of you guys. Am I a sucker for falling into the ultimate friendzone trap or is it just my wishful thinking to think that we will ever be together? I feel like giving another try by telling her what I feel till date to get a definite answer that I will take it seriously since school is starting soon and I don't want this drama to drag on with me to school.

I met this wonderful girl at the start of the last sem. She was really friendly, funny and she enjoys learning and sharing stuffs. While I was contemplating skipping lectures at the start of the sem, eventually I stayed around because I wished to know her better. To some extent, I liked her and I confessed to her quite early and got rejected.

After the rejection, I asked to be friends, which she agreed, but along the way I did something that made her really angry. To make things worse, I got angry over one or two of her remarks during that period, and ignored her for around 1 week. That was when she sort of got tired over the friendship.

I tried waiting for things to heal, and very recently, I found out from her about how she had disliked the way I walk and talk, yet decided to overlook them because she didn't want to immediately rule out the friendship. But she got tired eventually. I told her I would change her, because those things she disliked were legit, but she still sort of insisted we could only remain acquaintances at best.

I really don't get why girls seem to like to condemn guys to friendzones or worse acquaintance-zone in this case and they seem so sure that things will remain status quo forever. But worse thing is in my anguish over this, I questioned her rather harshly about what she really disliked and I think it really worsened things. I really don't wish this friendship to end like this, because it was really the start of all my other friendships in NUS. But given how bad things are right now, what can I do for things to heal, for her to reconsider the friendship?

 Not sure if it's me OP is referring to buy I shall reply anyway. Feelings are funny things I guess. Not sure why and where things will go from here but I'm definitely not ready at the moment. Was I never ready all this while or did things just changed? I'd never know for sure but I'm thinking the latter. I too am glad to have met you and hope that you stay strong always :) Part of me wants us to be more than just strangers. As friends who are able to understand one another :) May 2016 be a wonderful year for you too, and happy belated.. new year.. christmas.. .. :)

I don't like my boyfriend's poly friends. I'm okay with the secondary school people (we met each orther in secondary school, thus we have a lot of mutual friends) and NS people, but not his poly friends. I don't know, they seem to be some braggy pretentious group. I have not met them before in all of our 4 years of relationship, and it gets to a point when I found out about him meeting them for some birthday dinner because he was tagged on Facebook. He didn't tell me about it. 

Honestly, if this group means lot to him, he should introduce me to them right? Or probably he has no intention to, because I'm inferior, boring and dull comparing to them? I'm a huge introvert while they look like the extrovert kind of people. Which I dislike... but still isn't it weird if your friend has a girlfriend but he has not introduce her to your group yet? I feel that if they matter to him, then he should introduce me to them no matter if I seriously dislike them or not. At least I know what kind of people he is hanging out with.

While others are saying happy new year, I have been saying it will be another lonely year to myself.

While others only say they are lonely because they don’t have a girlfriend, it is different problems for me

Not having a girlfriend is the least of my concerns. I always get social excluded no matter where I go.

All my male classmates can add every single female classmate on facebook except for me. Even the least attractive girl in my class rejected my facebook friend request me. They even blocked me from following their public Instagram. What a great failure I am.

To top it off, I always get kicked out of any clubs that I tried to join. People will make all sort of excuses just to kick me out. I feel so worthless. Others can scream and shout at their club members and some of them even shouted vulgarities and yet, no one even said a word to them.

After so many cases of social exclusion, I can only thought of one explanation why I haven’t committed suicide yet. Both heaven and hell also wanted to social exclude me!

Am I really that worthless?

My new year resolutions
1) To find a friend who I can clique very well with
2) Hopefully get to know a girl and get into a relationship
3) Find a job that I like

But first, I will need to find my goals and be less of a introvert boring person.

Is it true that guys (and maybe also girls) tend to date or flirt with several potential partners at once before deciding on one? I think I might have been to naive to have put too much feelings into the dating phase and felt rather indignant when he eventually chose someone else that I never knew existed. Thanks in advance!

Really need advice on this. Currently in my third year and don't really have friends. I really find it hard to make friends given that we will meet new people every sem. Tried joining a camp organizing team to try expand my social network but managed to make a few friends (about 6, not the very close kind though). I was encouraged to join cca to meet more people (and hopefully i can find friends from there). 
However, i am having a dilemma. You see, as i am an introvert, i would need to spend some time with people to open up more. Plus, some people say i am boring and this sort of pressured me to thing of something funny to say every time i meet new people (but of cuz it didn't work). 
Therefore, i really am struggling to decide if i should join a cca as i would be joining alone which i feel is a little awkward and i am worried that people would find me boring as most of the time, i really need to know people for awhile before i open up. I will stay true to those who treat and respect me as friend, but i notice those who are out-spoken and have a joker personality tend to succeed in this
Any advice on what i can do?

I have no idea why but I find it really difficult to commit to anyone. I do admit I get lonely at times and even thought about settling down. I've also gone on a couple dates but every time I get to know a person better (like almost getting into a relationship), I'll feel like breaking up or cutting the person off really soon. What should I do?? Do I have some commitment  issues or do I just like the chase?

What are girls' views on getting into a r/s with a guy shorter than her? And what's the ideal height difference? I always thought the ideal height difference is one where: 

a) they are of the same height, or 
b) where she's slightly shorther than him 

when she wears heels.

But of course, that's just me. Ladies, care to shed some light on this issue? Guys too of course.

My new year's resolution: 
Be less creepy, be less stalker-ish. Be less nervous around a certain someone, and stop imposing myself on others.

Dammit, I think I managed to irk the one person I don't want to creep out. I really do hope that there is still, somehow, a chance... To be a friend.

Or maybe I should focus on getting my shit together more.

I have been in relationship with him for five months. He likes kissing me and always says he loves me. He compromises me when we argue. However, he is not keen on listening to my problem nor willing to change to suit me. Does he really love me or not?

"Not friends, not enemies, just strangers with some memories."

A lot sure can happen within a year. You entered my life without a notice, and left without any reason. I'm still trying to convince myself that for whatever reason, we are just not meant to be in each others' lives anymore, and that is something that I have to accept. 

And I finally understood why people can never love someone more than they miss them. It has been more than half a year, and I still miss you.  

You might not get to see this but in my heart, I'll always be wishing the best for you. No matter what, I'm glad to have met you. 

May 2016 be a wonderful year for you, familiar stranger.

In the past few years I have not done many things right. But as far as possible in situations that involve others I try my best not to let anyone down. With situations concerning myself alone I fall far short

I hope to have better self control in 2016. I hope to find some inspirations to push myself to wherever in future. I hope to recover from my sinister habits which have consumed my soul. And I hope to find solace in an ever bleak and ever changing world. 

To all those feeling down or have some resolutions, new year seems like the right time to start because it feels like a cleanslate. But always remember if you fall, everyday we wake up is another chance make us feel better about ourselves.

Bad news is all guys are horny. Good news is some guys are disciplined and have very good self-control. So if you happen to know guys who appear ignorant, he is in fact not ignorant just that he is very disciplined and self-controlled guy.

Hi.

Apparently my chem tutor was mentioned on NUSWhispers a few times too many.

I was forced to take chem tuition by my mother. She did not know where to look for one, so she found one from the Internet.

Unlike what everyone mentioned about my chem tutor, I think he's quite a nice guy. To the point that he's too nice. He would buy me sweets whenever I did well for a test.

He also gave me some nice counselling and even a private one-to-one session for free when I told him I broke up with my boyfriend. He gave me the confidence to break up with bad guys.

I cannot say more, but I sometimes did wish that he would be my boyfriend, except that he should cut his hair more often. Leaving your hair bowl-shaped all the time isn't the most appealing, tutor. Otherwise there are 34351 reasons why I think you rock.

After a really messed up relationship with a girl that ended with me on the losing end I started to have severe trust issues and it is really a thing now. I also have an insurmountable emotional block where I can no longer empathise with anyone 100% anymore, not that I do not understand them but I see the world with emotions out of the equation in an almost pathological sense. I haven't been able to feel sharp emotions nor cry nor fall in love for the longest time although I feel so lonely sometimes; it is like I want so much to be with a person or to let someone in but I logically block myself from it because I have never done that even from when I was a kid (semi-dysfunctional family). I used to get by because while all this has been happening I still have a very normal looking life on the surface would seem to be doing pretty well in fact but recently I feel like I have fallen for someone who is attached and every time I feel an emotion that is too strong my body reacts and I just feel like throwing up and this has never happened before I just don't like how something emotional can affect you physically and it's starting to affect my life and I know this is just some confessions page but I just needed to get this off my chest

 If your bf can ONLY be aroused when you wear swimsuits (or he is attracted to swimsuits as an object), then he might have some problems. For e.g., if you refuse to wear swimsuits, then he can't be aroused or he gets angry; or he buys or steals swimsuits to masturbate etc. These might be signs of a disorder because they disrupt his normal functions. You guys gotta communicate first, and can seek free help at NUS Counselling and Psyh Services.

2016 is already beginning to slip into my life but I wonder what is there in life for me. I know I am fortunate in many ways, but the most important thing to me, companionship, has never been there no matter how I hard I try.

Let me start off with my looks. I am probably below average looking, and got told by enough people that I am ugly to believe that it's true. Companies have directly told me that I was rejected because the jobs require the person to meet clients and my looks don't cut it. My friends have also told me that it's difficult for others to break any ice when my looks don't make a good first impressions. You know at camps where people go around trading numbers? I'm that person who others never bothered asking. 

As if heavens is playing a prank on me, I have skin that is sensitive to heat and sweat (and dear Singapore always has plenty of those). When I start feeling hot or sweat, my scalp and occasionally my back itches terribly. And no matter how much I resist, the discomfort will show on my face and eventually I end up scratching like a monkey. I have seen a dermatologist for it, and the only advice he could give me is that for a permanent solution I should migrate to a place with cooler climate, and that medications can only do so much. That's why I am terribly afraid to go out into the sun and only hang out at night.

Personality wise, I am an introvert. I am the kind who feels like I am being a burden if I just approach others with the intentions of making friends (and they'd probably think I am creepy too), so I will sit at the canteen tables alone frequently, hoping someone would notice and come up and make friends with me. I guess it doesn't help being a male in this case. Also, as a person with limited social energy, I spend it  on a few people who appreciates it and intensely while at it. I am the kind of friend who is loyal to a fault, and who would pick up a call at 3am and rush over if the person needs me. But in return, I also expect them to do the same for me. But for most people who are extroverts, such a friendship is too intense and eventually it fades off when I feel the other party isn't giving enough. In fact I don't think I have found any of such friends in NUS. Which begs the question, do I even have people consider me as a friend in NUS.

I am the kind of person who would spend like a year just knowing someone just to decide if the person is compatible. However it always end up that if I ask them out after that one year, things get awkward and the friendship that has been built up over a year disappears in flash. That's why it feels like there's so much to lose. 

I don't need hundreds of people in my life, I just need a few who would always be there to have my back along with a special someone that I would give the world for. But it seems like there's nobody in my life. Is such a life worth living on? I've hinted that I need help a few times, but no one ever gets it or notices. I am just afraid that if I ask for help directly and I don't get it, that will be the last straw for me.

It's New Year's Eve and I'm alone at home, crying while having dinner alone. I have a dysfunctional family. My Girlfriend is out celebrating with her friends. I don't know how I am going to survive 2016. I feel so hopeless and lonely. All I want is peace and love. I feel so hopeless. I don't know how to get my life together. My body is failing. I live in poverty and illness. I don't even know why I bothered trying so hard all these years when the future seems so bleaker I cannot escape my family and their expectations for me to save them from poverty. The weight of their expectations is too much to bear. I don't know what to do now, they do not understand logic. Help me.

What's wrong with me?? Rejected a guy almost 10x since I just feel we are not the type to last till marriage so there's no point starting. However despite all the hurt I gave him, he still wants to be the one to make me happy. I don't know if I'm just too hurt from my last relationship (ended more than 6 months ago) or that there's something wrong with me. I just want to stay friends although it's selfish but I'm worried staying friends is wrong as it'd be leading him on. I've been very clear from the start that I'm not keen on a relationship but he stayed anyway... The old me would have been so touched I'd probably just date him till marriage but somehow this time I just can't help feeling that everything is wrong. What's wrong with me?

Ps: I'm totally over the ex. I just don't know why I can't accept him as anyone more.

Being evergreen for the past 19 ( coming to 20) years of my life, i can't help but to hope to get into a relationship now especially after seeing so many couples forming. I understand that i should let nature take its flow but sometimes, i can't help but to wonder whether finding the so called "right" one depends on your luck. I am pretty involved in my faculty, having joined rag and FOPs but i have yet to find anyone that i am interested in. I would say that i am pretty sociable and above average looking? I have a fair share of suitors in secondary school and jc but i did not want to commit to a relationship due to studies. Now that i am in uni and being all alone, i can't help but to think that maybe i shouldn't have rejected all the guys because of my studies in the past :(

I broke up with my ex because he couldn't quit smoking. My current bf was aware the reason because he was there with me when I initiated the breakup. Recently, I was looking through his phone, and discovered conversations with his friends which showed that he had been smoking even before he got together with me and is still smoking even up till today. I felt really heartbroken and I don't know how to approach him about this. 

*My grandfather was a heavy smoker and he died of lung cancer when I was 7 years old.

If you're dating someone, but not officially in a relationship yet, is it okay to look for friends with benefits?

I am dating this lady for awhile now. Although we are not officially gf bf yet, but recently I found out that she has a friend with benefit even now. They even met up last week for the benefit purposes.
I am not angry because she is not longer a virgin etc, infact I think can't be angry since we are not even in a relationship. I myself is not a virgin too, but I only have sex when I am in a relationship (might be a traditional thinking). So saying this, yes, I am abit uncomfortable about it.

I have not asked her about it. What should I do?

I only have a cap of 2.8. I receieved a warning letter in sem 1 and honestly tried all i could to do better after that. Despite that, i scored Cs and Ds for my core mods. I probably took the wrong course, but it's too late to change now. Im left with a few more sems to go and getting a 2nd upper hons (what i wanted when i entered the school) is just impossible now. I've broken down every single time results were released but i havent told anyone the truth behind my cap. Every time someone asks me about my cap, i'd put on a poker face and tell them in the eye "2nd upper". Im afraid they would look at me differently and start to shun me for being stupid. Im a liar and im stupid.

If your friends shun you for having a lousy CAP, they don't deserve any friends.

vise versa.

If you can't be truthful to your friends, you don't deserve any friends.

I'm a girl and 23 this year, but I have never been in a serious relationship. Sure, I've been in relationships that lasted only a few months and dated many people, but none of them ever interested me enough to want to continue with whatever it was. Maybe it's because I have commitment issues and I'm too free-spirited. But now that age is catching up, I feel a need to find someone to settle down with, yet I still want my freedom and not have someone messaging me all the time and I feel obliged to reply, or like have date nights where I can't bail if I'm just don't feel up for it. It feels like a quarter-life crisis. Does anyone feel this way too? #quarterlifecrisis

Question: So my bf confessed to me whilst he was still attached with his ex. I didn't accept of course, stating this is wrong but eventually he broke up and came to me. I gave him a chance and started a rs with him after 3 weeks of dating. 
So here comes his past biting. So me being the more innocent one, our common friends  (we've got quite a few) warned him not to play with my feelings and to warn me about him. So I found out that when he was attached with his ex, he visited dirty places to play when he went overseas. How far he went I don't know. But a few of our friends who went with him told me that he's not the kind of guy for me becoz he's the playboy type. 
So far 6 months into the rs, he has been great to me, faithful and all. But I just don't feel secure in the rs. Now there's still love, what happens when that fades? His character is such that when he speaks he's the flirty type and the things people tell me about him, makes me think whether I see a future with him or not. If he's the playboy type, who am I to say I have the power to make him change, make him loyal?
I dunno what to do . My friends say I'm just waiting for things to happen so that I can  move on. Should I continue to give us a chance, or let go?

Is it naive to hold on to a relationship which none of the people beside me approve of? And to be fair, their points are valid, and I'm not blind to all the red flags, but it's just that most of the times, I let my logical side take over, and I justify his actions to myself (his actions which usually won't be acceptable in a relationship). To give an example; maybe you guys can judge for me: Allowing a drunk girl to sleep on his bed while he slept beside her, but he swore he didn't touch her.  To clarify, this is when he is already in a rs with me. So how do I interpret this? 
Dunno why I'm holding on. Because of the good times we have? Because I feel good being doted on? Im pretty sure I'll be happier single, but that's what all married people say, but that didn't stop them from getting married. 

So how?

Well another year has come to an end, and my 2015 resolution to find myself a girlfriend has failed yet again. I have heard of stories of how people could get a girlfriend within like a few weeks of meeting them, some even within a week, and stories like this always make me awestruck. 

You see, I am an evergreen, single for the past 25 years of my life, and the last close, female friend that I could connect with was in secondary school, and during poly we lost contact. Unfortunately, I somehow began more introverted and shy from poly onwards, and this resulted in my difficulty in connecting with people. Even when people try to get to know me, I will somehow attempt to retire from the situation, because of my lack of energy ( introvert problems :( ) and my fear of letting people find out how boring and quiet I actually am when I spend too long with them. I understand that it is an irrational fear, but it is just so hard to overcome this self defeating thinking. 

So far only two of my close friends were able to break this barrier of mine down. Majority of the people usually don't talk to me because I am too awkward to hold a conversation with them, and only guys so far have initiated conversations with me, girls less so (and by less so I mean I can't remember the last time a girl even initiated a conversation with me). 

I know I am a wreck, I hope 2016 will have a miracle for me somehow.. Anyone can give any advice?

Hey JW, It's strange how I still remember all the times that we spent together, as if they just happened recently, although they're long gone and I'll never get them back. I wonder if I ever really mattered, whether you felt anything for me those times. I remember our impromptu KFC dinner, our late night movie, our time at the library, our time at HV, and about everything about us. I wonder if you know how much I liked you then, and I wonder if you know the soft spot I still have for you now. You're not an expressive person, but I guess I liked that, the fact that you let yourself be vulnerable around me, and the feeling that I was one of the few people who could get through to you. But I guess that it was probably my wishful thinking feeling that I mattered, or that I was special. It's been a while since we had a proper convo, and you've clearly moved on with life and outwardly, so have I. But I still miss those times, those times were one of my happiest moments. You're on your way to being successful, pursuing your dream, and there's no reason why you should care for someone who angsts at you all the time. But I wish you knew how hurt I am, why I bother so much, why I rant so much about you, and how much I wish you would come back, that we could go back to those times. I really miss everything about our friendship, although it may have been quite questionable, but I know we can't go back. You obviously don't care so neither should I, but I still do. No matter what, I'm still just one text away you idiot. I really miss you, even though I shouldn't.

Can a couple without much common interest get along well? I am afraid I will ran out of topic with her.

To OP of , 
I'm the OP of . Well, if he expects me to go shop with him that will be the best right? Since I can shop together with him! As for food if he do not have the money and I can pay then I pay lor. But of course it depends on individuals. I always believe that as a couple you should just be yourself. Why pretend to be someone else in a relationship? If you are going to marry that person, are you going to pretend forever?  
-
 
To OP of ,  and , it is not that you don't deserved to be loved. It is just that the right guy is not found yet! 

I am together with my boyfriend for 6 years and going strong. I also don't believe in having him to treat me like a princess by going shopping with me and carrying all my bags, or to pay for my meals and everything. This is just torturing him. If I want to shop, I go with my girlfriends. If I want to eat a meal with him, we should split the meal, why should him pay for my meals just because he is a guy? 

All in all, don't give up hope and continue looking. The right guy will come one day! Gambatte!

My gf and I have been dating for a few months now but she seems to place more emphasis on her schoolwork over spending time together. I understand that she wants to score well and maintain her good grades and I would definitely love to see her do well too. Its just I find that she doesn't have a work life balance. Most of the time when I ask her out on a date she would say that she has no time and is busy with work but yet she has been meeting her friends for gatherings. I'm not insisting on going out every day but maybe once a week because at present we have been going out on dates only once or twice a month on average. It feels like she is spending more time with her friends and schoolwork and I feel neglected in a way. Hope you guys can offer me your views and some advice? Or do you guys think I'm being unreasonable? Thanks!

I need some advice for my problem. During the last semester I am interested in a girl (and she does not know that). Both of us are not local here (and my country is ... uhm... not so developed). At first, everything seems ok and we messaged to each other very frequently. However, I think there has been a change in her since the reading week. At that time she had a performance. Well, this performance is important to her and before the performance I sent a message to say good luck. The problem is, I feel that she guessed I like her, and since then her messages become shorter and less frequent. It takes a very long time for her to see and reply my messages (although I see that she onl facebook very frequently, every half a hour). She always replies me at 2 or 3 am (what the f*ck) and the content is as short as possible. What should I do in this situation ?
-
 
i needed some reassurance on what i am doing. I have known this girl whom i can really connect for nearly half a year but was rejected at the two months mark. I thought i could be friend with her and after awhile of awkwardness and silence, we were back to being close as before. Subconsiouly I was trying to be nice and hoping she would find how a great guy i was in the future(i know that sucks but i cannot help being nice to her)

however there is one incident which really hurt me because of the different expectations in this friendship. I am sure she doesnt know it or meant it and it could be a small matter as seen by outsiders. On one day While I was always trlling her about my travelling stories, she did not even bother to tell me she would be travelling e next day until i found out about it on facebook. I was still consoling her the day before when she complained that her parents do not allow her to go. I know she is not obligated to inform me but I still feel angry and stupid.

I know she only see me as a good friend but i feel that i am less important to her than she is to me. I used to text her everyday and it feels like i am the one who always tries to continuethe conversation. I am pretty tired of it but I do feel that she cares about me. She is a simple and not an expressive girl. I have tried to distance myself and stop replying to her texts. Hopefully my feelings will fade and i could be a genuine friendto her. Am i doing the right thing? Or should I continue texting her and being nice to her? I can tank these hurts. Although its painful but i would normally feel better after a few days. I am not too sure what is my threshold.

When you cheated, the first question that comes into my mind was, are you the same person that I loved and trusted? 

Maybe, it is my lack of understanding of you that led to this. 

True, I cannot expect you to be exclusive to me, but maybe, I am just one of those many "other guys", which brings about the point, "other guys also do it", is most probably the most sorry excuses a person can give.

But what do I know, I'm still single.

The B77W has returned.

To the CAP calculator, good aptitude is more important than micromanaging CAP computation. Stupid idea to S/U so many mods early only to see later mods screw you up later on in life.

To the exchange guy: good on you for killing many birds with one stone. I guess that is one of the ways, not the only way of success.

Anyway, I would like to use this confession to ask a question.

I have a friend who is very conflicted. He likes a girl called Y. Actually he has fancied her for quite a while and she knows it. She's currently very attached to another guy called 1 (not revealing his real initial --- too easy to guess).

The trouble, as I heard from the guy (who is my friend, making it uber complicated) is that, of late, Y has been torturing him. Don't get me wrong, Y is a wonderful girl, but of late Y has been asking 1 to sexually gratify her so much that 1 has been asking my friend for advice on how to curb Y's tendencies, even though my friend actually also fancy her. 1 knows somewhat, but my friend and 1 have yet to have a heart-to-heart chat on this.

It is complicated because my friend used to like a girl called J who 1 knows as well. My friend thought he could hit it off with J and get with her for good until J was too high-maintenance for him. My friend reluctantly had to break with her because our philosophies differed too much even though we had a good initial spark. Thankfully he and J are still on good friendship terms.

The trouble with my friend and 1 is that my friend and 1 are actually rather good friends, but it seems to border on the edge of my friend and 1 fighting for the same girl. Strangely enough I seem to think that Y could very well just share my friend and 1 on sexual terms; Y seems more than happy with it looking at the way 1 has been requested, but I doubt it would mean a happy relationship either.

I want to help my friend, yet not adversely give 1 too many problems. I can't mind-read Y, but I am not sure if Y is the true love 1 or my friend seeks, considering the nature of the relationship now. Any relationship gurus can help?

All advice accepted.

(coincidentally Y and J stand for economy and business respectively.)

Happy new year.

2015 has been a really trying year for the both of us. You losing our friendship and me, losing my mind. I guess it always suck when your feelings crossed the line.

I hope you still keep the cactus with you, alongside the wallet you claimed to like it - with the accompanying handwritten cards.

I don't know how long I will need or how many pills it will take for me to recover but things have ended between us, for good - for both of our good.

Take care.

Dear R,

I don't know if you read this platform but it's worth a shot anyway. It's been 2.5 years since we broke up but I'm still feeling bad about how I treated you towards the end. You don't know the full reason behind my initiation for the breakup, but I think it's time you did. We haven't talked since your new (neurotic) s/o so speedily eradicated all our possible communication platforms, but I'm really hoping you'll read this, because before this year ends I'd love to meet up, because I think you deserve to know the real reason. Please do contact me if you read this. If you want to. How do you know it's you I'm talking to? Some hints: I know your favourite soccer team is Arsenal, you know my favourite Disney princess is Belle.

I guess it's true that you never really forget your first love.

Sometimes I really wonder if anyone can be trusted in a relationship. 

I am a girl who appears soft-spoken and decent but yet I cheated.  On a crazy night out,  I succumbed to temptation and had a romp with one of my friends.  All this while I'm attached with a boyfriend waiting for me at home.  I feel guilty and afraid to be discovered but what can I do?  I just act all sweet and nice to my boyfriend and pretend nothing ever happened. 

The guy I cheated with appears so nice and sweet to his girlfriend but yet with me he was a beast.  No sign of guilt or any hesitation. He didn't just stop at physical cheating too.  Emotionally he reiterated how he likes me for my character and loves spending time with me. 

Maybe we are just really horrible people. But I find it increasingly common for people to cheat while maintaining a facade of normality.  Perhaps people have better acting skills these days.  It's scary.

I have a close guy friend for almost 3 years. We can talk anything under the sun. He would tell me his crushes and how they rejected him, his grades, what he was doing, etc, and i would tell him mine. There was a period of time when we chat in a daily basis, phone calls, and meet out at least once a week. I feel really good around him and like his company. As for now, we have been drifting apart and we don't chat like before. I am just wondering will it be different if i am being honest when you asked me if i like you and i will not feel so miserable right now seeing you with other girl. 
-
 
My current boyfriend is so boring we never got beyond the first base. I am willing to satisfy him sexually (bj, hj etc) but I can't seem to initiate it without losing face and of course I would like something fun in return. I am so tempted to give in to my male friends who asked me to have a good time with them.

That moment when your best friend you are in love with tells you she is probably getting back together with the guy that broke her heart a few months ago, causing her to cry into your shoulder and making you fall in love with her over the next few months as you spend more time with her. 

My heart is crushed.  Sigh.... Why am I such a fool for you?

Having studied excessively last year, i got a burnout and my grades plumetted a lot. One year later, i find difficulty in studying long hours and communicating with friends and my family members. I feel that i cannot think as clearly as i could before. My family members say that i have a pyschological problem as mental exhaustion cannot lasts for so long. During my burnout phase i still continued studying. Last week i took a one week break off from studying but i still cant think as clearly as i could before. Any advice ? Thanks ! I am a teenager from an independent secondary school.

Question here, what makes you feel loved in a relationship? Out of the 5 love languages, what if your SO shows their love that just isn't yours, do you just deal with it or do you ask them to change or....?

Why do some girls who look perfectly fine like to tell everyone that they are fat? Especially on social media. Do you all like want someone to tell you youre not fat to feel good about yourself? 

Or are you really insecure about the smallest of rolls over your stomach. You have fallen prey. Snap out of it. 

Also 

You dont talk about your money problems in front of the poor. You dont talk about your weight problems in front of the obese. You dont walk about your mobility problems in front of a handicap.

Today is one of those days when I wanted to see you and talk to you. Today is one of those days when I thought about you whenever I see a couple walking past. Today is one of those days when your absence feels extremely apparent that it seems as though nothing can fill it up. 
I have this urge to run back to you and to tell you we can work this out. 
But I will hold back this urge because we both know that there are no happily ever after. 

I will be strong and allow these feelings to ripple within me because after all life is about experiencing so I will not shut down these feelings, I will address them, let it envelope me and continue to live my day. 

I know this phase of mines will pass and like the cycle of seasons I will find myself missing you once more, but it is okay I will pull through. 
Though you are not by my side anymore, the memories of us will forever be etched on my mind. Both sweet and bitter I have all of them to look back to, so leave, you don't need to feel burdened, I will be okay. 

Today is one of the days. 
 I miss you.

Not gonna lie, I've had admirers at my workplace, and when I was still back in school. And all these guys are Chinese guys. What's the issue? I'm not a Chinese girl. I'm a Malay girl. Just another girl with mixed heritage and look nothing like a Malay (that's what most of the people I met said). I kept quiet and not pay attention to these guys because if they found out that I'm not Chinese, they'll be disappointed. Honestly, would you chase after someone who is of another race than you? :(

I thought I had given up on finding someone who I would be willing to settle down with. Then I met a girl I would gladly wife. But she's approaching the end of her exchange and we won't see each other for a long time. Sometimes I just want to smack life in the face.

I read a few posts about how girls experiences pain when having sex for the first time. Sometimes I wonder why a girl's body is designed to feel pain for the first few times while a guy can never feel pain during sex (assuming he's healthy and normal).... Also the posts seems to suggest that sex for the first time is not just painful, but extremely painful so is it right to say most girls bleed when doing it for the first time? Sorry I'm asking this question here because Google give conflicting answers (some say the first time have no bleeding no pain while some said there's bleeding and extreme pain so I don't know what is right). To some girls who feel uncomfortable commenting here, maybe you all can share your views on another post. Sex for the first time sounds scary...

As an introvert, at time, I am really uncomfortable at some of the topics that you wanted to discuss, but I still tried my best to discuss it with you and giving in to your request. In fact, I never like cosplay, 'cuming', drinking, clubbing or 'shopping', among others, and never a social animal. When I say No to your questions, you keep asking whether I like it. So I lied that I like it since I thought you like it and to stop you from asking. Also, I would only accompany you when we are out together and not trying to control or restrict you from meeting your friends. Further, I repeated my questions, like cooking, since you keep avoiding it. This doesnt mean that I Iike it or want you to become it. I am fine with compromising my needs to reach a resolution.

I know that you dislike me travelling alone and think that I lied about it. Thinking back, I should have told you that I met two of my ex-colleagues and added them onto FB while travelling at Amsterdam and Switzerland so as to avoid any misunderstanding. Also, I should have told you that I will be travelling with my family during Christmas vacation instead, but after considering that you came from single parent background and your tight financial status (when I asked twice, you seem reluctant to talk about your family and their support for your education), I did not. Now, I can tell you that I am in the states with my family since you will never see it.

I specially travelled to London to buy your favourite F&M tea, cookies, and visit Christmas night markets and landmarks since you mentioned how much you missed the city. Actually, I never like to travel during midnight or any necessity to travel to London since I have already completed my London trip before school start. I do remember everything you told me. In fact, I have prepare gifts for every of the special occasions that I missed and wanted to give it to you personally when I am back since you didnt want me to send it to you.

Even though unreasonable, I did consider buying a new air ticket to fly back just to celebrate Christmas and New Year with you since you hinted twice. However, when I asked you on two occasions, your reply disappointed me so I didnt alter my travel plan with my family (planned since early September), especially after you insisted on going out with your 'coursemate'. After the events, I tested you and your reply disappointed me again. 

I know that you have deleted and blocked me from Facebook, Whatapps and contact even though you agreed to remain as friend. From time to time, I will think about how you are doing currently. If time can turn back, I really hope we can give it another try even this mean giving up everything. Now, I really regret not fighting for it. I doubt you will ever see this since you never read NUS Whisper, but I just wanted to let you know the above, if you happen to chance it, since I never have any chance to tell you personally. 

To that special someone, a very Merry Christmas and happy New Year well in advance. Hope you have a joyful and great time.

Spent the whole morning thinking about this and I just feel so... Down. Like I have lost something that could have been. 
I had a very good guy friend. He was there for me all the time. When I broke up especially. He would text me and be there for me everyday. In fact, I think I fell for him subconsciously. But we werent meant to be.
He liked someone else, and I got together with someone else too. And now things are kind of awkward. We don't talk often because it would upset my bf, and even when we are face to face it's hard to start deep conversations.
Just makes me feel so... Idk. Like I lost something really precious. I dont know what to do. Sigh

I am the OP of . Lol. This goes out to the angry 'economist' with three first names who commented on my post. My post was obviously a joke based on common stereotypes, i.e. it was supposed to be funny and nothing else. Chill and stop being such a sensitive bloke. It's bad for your health. Merry Christmas :)

Im a girl who has many guy friends , some of which we can hit off really well. However, im quite a cyber person , i can talk a lot on whatsapp and online platforms but irl , im actually shy and reserved. Sometimes, i will start to like my 'online' guy friends romantically but i know they don't feel the same. Its quite sad really , having many close guy friends... but tbh, i want a bf. People always tell me that i have a nice personality and im a very decent girl who is brought up really well. (Low maintenance and am a very family person)  is it that hard to get someone to like me romantically? :(
-
 
Being a rational and objective person, i havent done a lot of foolish things in my life. But just this once, even though you told me that i have no chance, let me foolishly continue to love you alright? Let me continue to care for you, protect you and be by your side. Doesnt matter that im treading this painful path of unrequited love.. as long as you are happy. 
-
 
Sorry this is a BGR rather than a CAP post. It has been more than two months since she rejected me. We have went past the silent awkward phases and have been talking to each other again. There is no awkwardness between us now. We are good friends and can be at ease with each other. I should be contented and not screw up the dynamics again but i just can't control how i feel.

She is a very simple girl and I do not want to hurt her but I have to be protective of my own feelings too. I know she sees me as a good friend whom she can connect with and trusts me. I have mixed opinions from friends. Some ask me to move on. Some ask me to stay on as friends. Because when I confessed she barely knew me for two months. She shares her feelings with me when she felt sad and I would always be there for her. I know I should expect  nothing out of this but I always feel that I am doing way more for her than she does for me.

I would be going for exchange soon. Should I kept the status quo and see if my feelings change or should I have a talk with her before I leave? I did not ask her why she rejected me. I do not want to beat myself up to only realize that it is bad timing. If she staright out said that I am not her type maybe I will feel better.

For all those who have had your hearts broken either by yourself or your partner, how does it feel like to fall in love again? Its been a long time, like 5 years, since i have felt anything for anyone. Any idea of what/how much it'll take before you can feel the same for someone again? Sometimes I wonder if my heart has become broken beyond the extent of repair. Maybe I'm just destined to be forever alone. I honestly have no idea how I'll feel even if someone confesses to me.

You know all the jokes and stereotypes about the differences between the boyfriend/husband and girlfriend/wife? 

Like the guy has to always accompany the shopaholic girl on her long shopping sprees, carrying all her bags, and just sitting in a corner in the store. Or like how the woman keeps talking but the guy has to just keep quiet and listen. Or like when the girl says something it's like a trap and the guy has to struggle with deciphering it. 

I just wonder if there's any couple out there that really fits all these stereotype because these jokes are still funny to the people around me, and they keep saying stuff like that. Is this the norm?? I am evergreen clearly.

As a girl, I wouldn't want my boyfriend to carry all my shopping bags for me and sit down and wait for me for so long! He can totally go shop at some other place while waiting for me! And if I can't carry all my stuff, then um maybe I am over-shopping?? And if he really insists on waiting for me, then wouldn't it just be nice to reciprocate, i.e., accompany him to shop for what he likes? 

And if the girl is always talking and expecting the guy to be obedient.. that's such a strange dynamic. Wouldn't the guy feel like he has no dignity? And I don't know how to expect my boyfriend to understand and interpret my feelings if I do it so vaguely (and sometimes I think girls do it intentionally).

I feel like it's a bit difficult to be the guy and unfair sometimes you know, if all these patterns of behaviour are indeed happening in reality. I'm not meninist, I just think that gender equality means exactly what it should mean - equality, not that women get to trample all over the men.

-
 
 I completely agree with you. I am an evergreen girl and I don't have any restrictions for a potential boyfriend such as looks, height etc. I just want a guy with a good personality, who loves me a lot, responsible and who will be financially stable in future. 

I will not torture him by making him carry my shopping bags or make him wait for hours while I wear make up. I wouldn't mind helping him if he has a lot of things to carry. Because I believe in a relationship, we are equals. I will trust him and respect his freedom, allow him to go out with friends and have his own life, at the same time showering him with a lot of love and care. 

I don't believe in gender stereotypes like guys always need to pay for dates and such stuff. I have done internships in the past and I hope to fulfil my career aspirations one day, so I would gladly pay for our dates to celebrate special occasions like his birthday.

Alas, I have been rejected more than once already. I don't know what's wrong with me. I guess I don't deserve to be loved. :'(

Im a female with a very high sex drive. I watch porn often (about 2-3 times a day), depending on my needs. Sometimes the urge gets too overwhelming and ill head to the nearest bathroom to -yknow- sometimes i feel like its normal but sometimes i feel like it isnt and that i should see the counsellor to talk about this.

Hey guys, do read through this and help me... I'll appreciate it alot.

I have a very close female friend who is a year younger than me. We knew each other for 3 years already and there's been many ups and downs in our friendship. The first time i met her was during a school event and i knew i wanted to know her more. Back then, she was still relatively young but already filled with many relationship problems. Gradually, we got to know each other more and we became somewhat close to each other. However, she always saw me as a senior and a very close friend, a little more than a bro. She shared many of her problems with me as i did so with her. Things were not awkward and all with her, and i gradually fell for her.

However, she was the popular kid in life. There were many guys itching to get to know her and many confessed to her. However, she rejected most as she isn't those type of girls who plays around with relationships. Although i was rather close with her, i was never around her physically long enough to watch over her. Sadly, she mixed with bad company and had several terrible relationships. Till now, she still has some problems overcoming it. 

In 2013, in a moment of folly i shouted at her in order to break a fight between my junior and her during another school event. As a person who holds grudges, she was very angry with me and wanted to cut off all ties with me. She didn't reply my messages and told me not to talk to her ever again. Through the help of her friend, she forgave me which was a miracle. 

Things were better as the days went by. During a school concert that we both attended without each other knowing, i met her during the intermission. She said hi to me and i was surprised she turned up as she said before that she was too lazy to attend. We chatted and went along quite well amist our friends. After the intermission, we went back into the auditorium and she kissed me on my cheek. I was shocked and after the concert, i never questioned her about that move. She went out for super late supper with her clique while i went home. Around 2am, i texted her asking why she kissed me and she said she felt sorry about treating me badly. Don't get her wrong, she's a conservative girl who won't do such things out of no reason. Of course, i was happy yet confused on that day.

After i graduated, i met her even lesser and texted her far lesser than what i would have wanted. This was due to a sudden turn for the worst with my physical health which affected my mental health. I didn't like to interact with people as much as i did a few months back and i liked peace. However, i did feel lonely. People left me, but she was one of those few who did not. 

Now, i am trying my best to self recouperate. None of my family members know that i am deeply troubled mentally and emotinally. Last night on christmas eve, i travelled from the west to the east just to surprise her with a christmas present on her last day of work. As hard as it was, i tried to put on a brave front trying to act normally, full of energy as i had when my relationship with her was at the peak.

The problem is that whenever i am with her, i have to act normal if not it would be awkward for both of us. I have to add on that in the past, i was never one bit awkward with her. I really miss those times. Unfortunately, i gave up halfway and started telling her about all the problems i had on the way home with her. Surprisingly, she too told me about the problems she had, mainly studies and her relationship. It was quite awkward during the 45 minutes train ride home. 

I forgot to add on that since the first time i met her, i had the feeling that i liked her. I thought it was just love at first sight but nothing was further than the truth. Through all up and downs between us, i never stopped loving her. I love her till the point where it really hurts. She's not the smart, she's not rich, she's not pretty according to others, but i still choose her. People ask why i hold on, i say its worth it. She once told me she won't date guys smarter than her as she thinks she's inferior.

 I really hate it when i see her as someone i'll protect forever yet she sees me as a bro. What should i do? How do i control my emotions? Please help me. I apologise for the very messy story...

Asking a female to undergo FGM will be the worst idea ever because it involves snipping off the clit... and since most females achieve orgasm through their clit compared to penetration, all youre going to get is faked orgasms and a very unhappy girlfriend.

To  and , I'm no different from you girls. In comparison with my peers, I think I treat my boyfriend rather well. I believe in gender equalities too, and I don't expect my bf to treat me like a princess or be a slave. 

I don't need him to carry my shopping bags or wait hours for me while I dress up. When I'm out with him, I tend to avoid shopping or buying stuff for myself because I didn't want him to feel bored or wait for me while I shop for my own stuff. When we are out, we mostly go Dutch too and I dont expect him to pay for my meals. Sometimes when he pays for the meal I feel bad and I'll pay for the next one. 

I also don't expect him to send me home because it would be so late by the time he reach home. I don't have any physical requirements as well, he was just average looking and 1.63 tall. i also tried to understand everything he likes like soccer, where I tried to remember all his favorite players names, timings of upcoming matches and I also took time to understand his field of work, which was an entirely different field from mine. 

But after everything I've done, after all the effort put into the relationship, at the end of the day, I got dumped still. Lol

Guys talk about being friend-zoned, while i'm here being bro-zoned.. I told myself to never fall for any of these guys because i'm just a "bro" to them. 

I guess its because i'm tomboyish. My ex-boyfriend once told me his friends said that i am tom-boyish. I started wearing dresses since then whenever we went out. But i still prefer oversized shirts and shorts.

And.. I have more guy friends than girl friends. 
i only have 2 cliques of girl-friends but usually we talk about make up, which i barely know. However, I can click with their boyfriends instantaneously especially when we talk about how awesome Warriors is playing and how disappointing Man U is  - can LVG be sacked already? :(

Anyway, this has caused some problems with 1 friend of mine. His girlfriend is incredibly jealous and gives me the side eye whenever he's not looking. Trust me, i'm not even a threat to her because i'm in t-shirt and shorts/jeans all the time. Like, she wear pretty dresses and makeup, why should she feel threatened? I really tried making friends with her but yeah.. 

I don't know what am i ranting about - being single for 2 years and spending christmas alone? being too tomboyish? thats just my actual self. I like sports and i don't like makeup. is there any guy who likes a girl like that? please give me hope that i won't be single forever.

Sorry, this is a serious question.

Does anyone know where to buy benzocaine, and what is benzocaine for? My partner is suggesting I buy some for "topical relief". The problem is that I can't tell if my partner is joking or serious.

Anybody wanna go on a date with me this weekend? An average guy looking for an average girl to hang out with. Its really just a blatant attempt for me to know people from the opposite sex. 

P.S i understand that average is subjective. Hence lets loosely defined it as a normal human being with no defining traits (e.g rich, handsome, beautiful, ugly etc.)

Email me at AIRverageguy@gmail.com if you're interested!

Hi everyone, not sure if this is a very lame question, but just wondering if those fit people out there can help me. I've been exercising for a long time, hitting the gym about 2-3 times a week (I know it may not seem like much but to me this is something that is sustainable in the long run), but I really cannot reduce my size. I'm pretty sure the problem lies in my diet because I really live to eat. 

I've been reading articles online about examples of diet plans to reduce weight but a lot of it involves eating mainly salads, or eating healthy meals every 2 hours, which I find difficult and unsustainable because it's expensive and also due to time constraints (I'm no celebrity after all). I'm just wondering if anyone can advise a sustainable diet plan that has worked while you were in uni/internship/work (e.g. what kinds of food do you eat, how often, how much prep time) that you have gone on which I can adapt for my own usage. Thank you in advance!

With regards to , how am I suppose to figure out if he is interested when we meet?

To OP of 14165. 

To share with you, I was like you previously. Went for circumcision because my GF like me to be cut as she don't like the look when I am not cut. To cut long story short, went for the surgery at a ripe old age of 24 years old for my GF sake. After surgery is another good 1 week of suffering. End up we broke up and there goes my skin. Cut dick bring about inconvenience and the pleasure is not there and you need lube if u wish to pcc else it can be painful.  Well I learnt to live with it but my advice to you is think twice thick thrice before u cut. 

I think my bro out there who are cut Can relate to how I feel.

Hey . I think you're probably blinded by so much emotions that you're not making sense. How does "bad treatment by JC friends" relate to NUS students, even?

Ok, fine, maybe these JC friends moved on to study to NUS.  And maybe you met a bunch of not-so-nice folks during the orientation camps. I cannot deny that such people exist within NUS, but it isn't representative of the folks here. Sure, people here can be competitive as fuck or extremely clique-ish. Being someone who usually takes modules on her own, I've had my own share of being isolated in class since everyone else sticks around with people they already know. But I've met my share of friendly people as well, folks who'd have your back til the end.

Thing is, this isn't a thing you'd find only in NUS. You're gonna see the same types of people in other unis, or heck, even in unis in other countries. Heck, it even gets worse in the workplace, if you're unlucky. Some folks will just never be as nice as you want them to.

Point is, you don't need those people in your life. Deal with them if you must. If you must deal with your sadness, that's ok, but you can't dwell on that forever and be miserable for life. You've got a choice. Forget about them and move on. Reflect. Meet new people. Life's too short to bear grudges.

It's all up to you, mate.

Just curious, what if you currently have a relationship partner and you both broke up, and you have a one night stand with someone else. After that, you two got back together. Would that be considered cheating? 
-
 
Advice needed! I knew this guy from a dating app and he used to reply me much faster. Not sure if he is getting more busy with his social life recently with all the meetups or he got bored and doesn't feel like replying me as frequently nowadays. We still chat a bit on a daily basis and he still asked me what have I done today etc. Sometimes he will share what he has done (all those outings with his friends) and photos to me. I met him once and he is quite friendly and poking/tingling me. Is he looking for a friend or friends with benefits or actual relationship?
-
 
My boyfriend and I got to know each other not by the most romantic of ways-we met online. "Where did you guys meet?" is a common question and by no means unimportant, but I've learnt that how you met someone isn't as important as how you've grown together since. So it doesn't matter if you met your significant other in school, at a party, through a friend or via the internet, what matters is that you're both happy and doing your best to make things work 
-
 
Well, hope this will not get filtered out, would like to seek opinion and advice from the guys, I am intending to go for circumcision as my gf prefer me to be cut. Should I?
-
 
 why not try texting him or spending more time with him during the next sem ✌

As a sg guy still studying in nus, I feel really old and poor seeing people around my age all working already. In fact, some of them are even getting married soon and here I am still working hard for my studies.

I feel like i dont belong in NUS. i feel proud and happy to be a student here, but i feel so out of place. I always try my hardest during exams, but my results are nowhere near desirable. I feel like I simply blank out during exams. On the other hand, when it comes to mods that do not have papers, i feel so at ease and am able to score much better than the mods that do. I feel so lost. I dont know how to stay afloat anymore.

I am sad to admit that I get affected by a mean b**ch on social media. She likes everyone elses' photos (even lame ones like a photo of an empty plate) or status but never ever mine for 2 years already, yet she pretends to be cordial with me. She is highly active on social media. I try not to get affected but I haven't done anything to offend her. Everyone else thinks she's nice but she talks about them behind their back. She even stole her best friend's boyfriend and laughed about it. Anyone else has this kind of problem with certain girls or it is just me? I am glad the semester has ended but the next is starting and I don't really want to face her. I don't understand why she chose to target me. Why are some girls so mean?

 I know  already gave you advice but just want to agree as well! The pain is different for different girls. My boyfriend and I tried a few times but it was so painful I told him to stop. I asked advice from my girlfriends and they told me theirs wasn't painful. Eventually we persevered through my first time, and it was so painful I was kind of tearing, and we took about 30min. I couldn't enjoy it and I just felt like I kept needing to pee.

Even now, the penetration is sometimes painful, to the point where I can go from aroused to zero if he keeps going in and out, but the pain is less, and it gets better with time. If your boyfriend is caring he'll just take it slow with you and stop if you need to. Good luck! :)

NUS will never be as good as too many universities because the students have no compassion or eq. I broke up in JC, then I got ostracized by most of my classmates ever since because I was too sad to speak for myself or even stick around. They like my ex better and so I became the bad person. Barely anyone remember me because I couldn't make it to too many outings back then(maybe I was poor that I can't afford $50 a day? I used up all of my bursaries in jc eventually). I remember how I got bullied in camps because I was still sad but they decided that I don't fit in and suffered from anorexic. And because of my history, I can't move forward either. People have asked," why don't you have any other friends?" With a past like makes you a really outspoken person, I don't think I'm ever going to make any new friend anymore.

Hey, you are not alone! I am exactly in the same situation as you. Evergreen, dated but never worked out for almost the same reasons! I always wonder about the same thing too, and the sad thing is, I believe guys dont wish to be friends after they are rejected/pushed away. I have gotten emotional over this matter and wonder if there is something wrong with me. Although recently I have been opening up quite a bit, and actually calling up some of them to have a chat or something, and it feels great to at least be on good terms with them. So, you know, keep open-minded, and if you're ready to commit to a relationship, treasure the next one, or someone who is already in your life. :) Cheers!

Most guys get off on watching real-life porn. Some guys enjoy 2D ones by anime characters. Others just fap to any random girl on Instagram or Facebook. However, my confession is this: I get horny when I watch Sims flirt back and forth with each other. Yes, as in the Sims game. I find myself best able to jerk off to that. I have bought all the versions of the sims until the most recent sims 4 just for this sole purpose. This is not a troll, I wish it were.

I don't know what is happening to me lately. All of a sudden, my heart will start beating super fast, I will feel angry and my breathing will become heavy. But I don't even know what I'm angry at, and it takes super long to calm myself down. Just earlier this evening, I was watching a comedy show when it acted up again. Seriously, what is happening to me? Is it some mental problem? But I'm not stressed lately since it's holidays now. I really hate seeing any kind of doctor, so can anyone help?

 I don't know what that condition is, but I honestly suspect it is just the normal pain that some girls can expect when having sex for the first time. Different girls have different bodies and pain tolerance levels and obviously his size matters, etc. 

My first time was EXCRUCIATING. He actually took an hour to penetrate me completely, and this was after going real slow and being lubed up. Granted, he was huge. But it was also the first time I was being stretched out, so pain is inevitable. I was shrieking, struggling, sweating up a storm and whimpering throughout, ocassionally even asking him to pause because the burn was too much. I remember yelling in frustration, "How far in is it?!" And he was like, "Err...just the tip?" 

I was sore for a few days after and we didnt do anything then while I healed. 

The second time was still very painful, but it took a MUCH shorter time. So you can feel the improvement, so to speak. Third time, no pain whatsoever. I even asked him to go faster, and he was so surprised he laughed. 

And subsequently after, my sex life as I know it has never been the same again. :)

My point is, maybe you're feeling the same way I do. Maybe you just have to grit your teeth and pull through the first one or two painful times as you get stretched out. Make sure he goes slow and is well lubed (because you sure as hell aint gonna be wet in that much pain). All the best.

Usually I can tell, pretty accurately, whether a guy is into me or not, and I've never had a problem with that because honestly, you guys are pretty obvious. 
But not you. Are you just being nice? Or are you simply being a good friend?? Or do you also think there could be something here?? You are a complete enigma and it's driving me crazy!!!

Anyone know about the condition vaginismus? I tried making love to my boyfriend several times but it never succeed. There is an extreme pain to my vagina whenever he tried to penetrate me. I did some research and found out I could be suffering from vaginismus. Can I overcome this condition?

I am in love with my cousin sister. 
Before you hate me for what I am thinking, hear me out. Ever since the age of 16, I have felt an attraction towards by cousin sister. She was 15.
Unfortunately for us, we have ended up in university together. She occasionally asks me to hang out with her friends which includes a guy she likes. I hate myself for liking her and I am ashamed of myself. I also cannot stand that she likes other guys except me. Anybody ever felt like this? I really do not know what to do.

My last relationship ended a while ago, and I don't think I'm looking for a new relationship yet, but I'd like to meet new people just to get back in the scene. Also not looking for anything physical, just to clarify. Any idea how I can go about doing this? I don't think there is anyone around me interested, and I don't mind dating apps but any advice on which one might suit my situation better? I'd also like any tips you guys might have! Thanks!

To  Hello! This is #laoniang. Thank you for the compliment. But I would have to politely decline your invitation to meetup. Have a nice day!

There's this senior whom I have always treated as an amazing and fun friend to be with confessed to me out of the blue. I'm evergreen and do not know how to respond to this ~ Any advice?

I had just "broken up" with this girl I matched on tinder slightly over a week ago. We have never met in real life because she was not in Singapore. She won't be permanently back in Singapore until 2 years later. I have also never seen her face (She just posts body shots of herself) so I don't really know how she looks like. We don't have much in common but we have managed to talk over the phone almost every single day for the past week(like 6 out of 7 days and for 1 - 2 hours each time). I really did enjoy the times we chatted together, even when she was drunk. We decided to enter into an exclusive relationship together over the phone and through text, we confirmed our "love" for each other. However as the days passed by, I found myself tormented by the fact that she won't be around, that I don't know what she looks like, and that I don't even have a reliable phone number to contact her (she always calls me using a private number). Having had no previous relationships, I consulted my more experienced friends and I realized that this 1 week long virtual relationship is not real. I don't know whether I had really loved her. Now, I just feel slightly disappointed. Is this the beginning of a long heartbreak or was there no love that existed in the first place? Just a rant from an average guy with an average heart.

To that 笨女人

Good luck to you. I'M 100% SURE THAT YOU WILL GET GOOD GRADES! Don't forget we made a promise to hit at least 3.5, 输的人是乌龟。

Don't get me wrong! I still fcking hate you pretty much. I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU FOREVER!!!

ok...bye

I have a friend working part time job just so that he can afford his girlfriend's lavish lifestyle . He even pays for her rent . It's obvious that she's leeching off him but nothing we say can get through .

I was in the same boat too. I think it depends. I usually don't like initiating conversations, especially with someone I just met because I don't want to come across as annoying/burdensome. Generally it's because I'm not sure of what the other party thinks of me. 
But once the other party starts the conversation, I'd definitely try to reply, (plus because sometimes I've been waiting as well).

How many relationships would be considered too many ?
For me , the numbers are as given below : 
First relationship : for 2 years from age 20 -22 
Second Relationship : for 1 month at age 23 
Third relationship : for 2 months at age 24
Fourth relationship : for 4 months at age 24

Compared to other people, I feel I somehow find it easier to walk away when I feel like the relationship is not working out. People consider me fairly attractive female who is good at conversations. I do get a fair amount of attention from the opposite sex . I am also on good terms with all my exes. 

Am bad at relationships or just unlucky at finding true love ? Or making a lot of wrong choices ?
-
 
bumped into my ex when I went for a common friends' gathering recently. could tell that he was feeling awkward although I felt like I just bumped into an old friend, a really close old friend. wanted to talk to him but he was avoiding me and being really hostile. although we didnt work out I thought we could have been really good friends though. till date, I still think I know him the best 
-
 
Met a girl online and we've been messaging back and forth. Got her number and we started texting as well. But I seem to be the one initiating and maintaining conversations most of the time. Is she losing interest?
-
 
Is it normal to have sex barely once a fortnight with your long term boyfriend who you meet everyday almost, and when you are both only 24? I feel my drive is stronger than his, and am left feeling unsatisfied when there is no intimacy over a long period. I do try to initiate it, but we are working and go to gym on weekdays and have random social outings on weekends, which isnt a problem for me but he seems to not want it when he is tired. What do I do? I am worried for our future. 
-
 
I can do small talk with anyone, but find it difficult to move beyond it to more meaningful conversation, the kind that really connects you to that person. I see so many people who can just talk about things, which aren't as shallow as other people, or just everyday happenings. Any advice?
-
 
Recently I've met up with my long-time girl friends (clique I would say). We have always gossip a lot but recently, their gossips have become increasingly mean and insensitive that it's making me very uncomfortable and annoyed. I do tell them to tone down the meanness but that doesn't work and they just keep making mean jokes, like really horrible ones. Plus, they gossip indiscriminately, always generalizing groups and types of people. I feel that they are becoming increasingly toxic and I don't like it. Should I keep my distance a bit / get new friends, or just keep quiet and bear the incessantly mean stuff they say? 
-
 
I think I have problem communicating with people.

Whenever I try to help, people say I give TMI.

Whenever I want to prove my point, people say I kill their brain even though it is just one or two sentences.

Whenever I want to make sure something happens, people say I am siao on.

Whenever I say I relax by doing slow stuff, people say I am outdated.

You tell me, I should not be defined by people. But how can I live a social life if so many of the social circles I have hit so far are like this?

I just cannot feel less uptight, just don't see why people drink to drown their sorrows and don't know who to turn to to speak of my deepest thoughts, simply because "people" will "do" something.

I've been with my boyfriend for 11 months. He's very kind to me. I too, treat him with kindness and love as often as I can, but I'm very emotional and sensitive, and this has led to quite frequent conflicts with him having to placate me each time. There was once we were supposed to meet for dinner, but my period was approaching and I was feeling depressed and lousy, and I couldn't stop crying and feeling worthless. I called him to cancel last minute and cried even more when i found out he had already left home. He stayed on the phone till I stopped sobbing and kept telling me how much he loved me. There were many other instances when I cried over something silly, or worse, scolded him and got angry. He patiently calmed me down each time. I hope I dont seem boastful, I just want to say I'm very lucky to have someone who loves me despite being so difficult to love. Thank you dear, and thank you to all the boyfriends who treat their girlfriends with nothing but kindness.

 Opposite problem. I can talk about anything but was lambasted for being unable to "small talk". Didn't win many friends over.

I don't have any good friends in NUS.

What I mean to say is, I know people who are friendly towards me, will work on projects, talk about homework, and discuss ideas. If I say hi to them, they will smile and wave back. So, I guess I only have colleagues.

However, as soon as school is out, all of them disappear. Nobody wants to meet up and chill. Want to watch Star Wars? They have already planned it with their girlfriends, or just other friends. Want to go to this place? Sorry, I'm busy. Can't make it. Hey, check out this piece of news; sorry, I'm not interested.

Actually, I don't have any friends at all. In NS, nobody in my section has come to NUS. From my JC class, only a couple of girls came to NUS, and you know what NS does to these relationships. A few went to NTU, and other universities. The people I used to be very close with, simply drifted away. So now I go everywhere and do everything alone.

I could join a club, but I have no particularly strong interest in anything outside of the major I'm studying. It seems that nobody I know is in it for the interest and academia; the people I know are just here to earn that piece of B.S. paper. They generally don't want to talk about it outside school, so I don't really have anything to say to them.

So here I am, alone in the evening, writing this on my laptop over fast food dinner, and maybe someone will read it. Maybe you will say something nice, maybe you will say something nasty; but as long as someone has seen it, that makes me happier.

I find that people are more sociable to each other in the 80s and 90s compared to now.

My boyfriend and I have been together for several years, since our first year in university. We are still unsure about our long term career plans, and whether we are going to remain in Singapore, or work overseas, or in our home country (we are both foreigners). We have never really spoken about our future together, we love each other and are the best of friends as well, but we have just been taking our relationship as it comes. To be honest I am not someone who is open about my feelings. For a while now, I am so sure I want spend the rest of my life with him and know he is the one for me. I do not know if he feels the same way, or is ready to talk about it yet. We recently attended a friend's wedding, and the feelings grew stronger still. I do not know what to do? Should I talk to him? If yes, how do I approach it? I do not want to spring it on him, or make him uncomfortable.
-
 
Well, this is a little weird but I just wanted to get it off my chest.
I am evergreen, not sure by choice or not. I have dated a few guys but none worked out to become "official" in the end. 
Some didn't work out because the guy could not wait, some was just purely wrong timing. Sometimes I think back and I wonder, did I reject the right person? Is there really going to be someone that is worth the wait? Someone I would fall so deeply for and would do the same in return...
-
 
Hi Lao niang, you seem really interesting and i would really like to get to know you in person. Is there anyway we could do it without revealing our identities? 
-
 
I can't shake off the feeling that my boyfriend is cheating on me. I snoop on his phone every now and then but I find nothing. However I did find certain other disturbing things (not porn) on his phone that perhaps cause this feeling. I've brought it up to him before but he simply tells me I'm being needy and insecure but doesn't reassure me. I overread into the things he say to the point where I myself am no longer sure if I'm overreading or not. Please advise.
-
 
The term 'evergreen' is too generic. Basically there are 3 categories of people who claim to be 'evergreen' 
1. Evergreen by choice
2. Evergreen because no choice 
3. Liars. 

So... Which one are you??
-
 
We once joked that if we were still single at 30, we'd marry each other, live together and get a puppy. We were best of friends then. But time has not been kind, and I miss your company even after we drifted away.

I wonder if you still remember. Because after all these years, I'm still waiting.
-
 
I'm a really bimbotic person who tells strangers/acquaintances about her problems.
I need to stop doing that. I realise it affects your 'reputation'. 
Who do you tell your problems to? I feel like I don't have any to turn to. 

-
 
Eh #laoniang, your stories are interesting but... they're all very stereotypical leh. Nothing I haven't heard before from friends or friends of friends. Your stories are more about character archetypes than about characters themselves.

Any unique person anot? Would love to hear more. :)
-
 
Talking about evergreen. I am never green. Or at least green for a few months then red again. I am trying my best to stay single. That is my goal. But it is harder than you think. When you have more than one person trying to get your attention and in the end you somehow get involved in things. I think it is also partly my fault. I do fall in love easily. Not because I am love addict or something. I just wear my heart on my sleeves which means I get hurt easily. I just recently broke up. And I am so determined to be single at least a year. But...I have three people expressing their interests now. And they all asked me for dates. Two I politely said no but they kept trying. So I am just friendly with them. And they are really trying. Sending me texts everyday. Calling me (which is pretty crazy!!!!). One I went on a friendly date. I didn't like him in romantic sense. But he seems like the guy I could be friends with. I dunno if I am being too nice or too friendly but I don't have the heart in me to reject them so harshly or ignore them. I feel that it is not polite. But I wanna remain single. And I am scared if these people keep trying too hard and I give them a chance to get to know each other, there is a danger of falling in love. After all, they are not all bad. Fun personalities, caring and kind and bonus, attractive.  Interesting people. It just sucks I am not ready now. But at the same time, I don want to lose their friendship. Haiz, advice pls? 

-
 
Hi, just wanted to know if its normal to crush on your ex? Even though he/she is no longer your type.
-
 
Most people think I'm aloof and put together, but in reality I'm always very afraid people will judge me and think I'm uncool. I'm terrified of running into acquaintances when I go out because I have to say hi and make small talk, and I'm always afraid that during those 2-5min I'll come off sounding extremely lame. Plus I have resting bitchy face so people may think that I think I'm too cool for them when it's actually the complete opposite. Does anyone feel this way or hav suggestions on solve this? 
-
 
Sometimes I wished I had gone to NTU instead. My friends and classmates mostly went there, I am the lone person who came to NUS. Somehow, my friends and I started to communicate less and meet up less often. The last time we went out was....I don't even remember. NUS and NTU calendars are so different, when they have break, I have exam, when they have exam, I'm free. We used to go out so often as a big group of about 10 people, but now I really miss them. Recently, I realised through their social media posts that they still hang out as a group every 2 months or so, but I was never invited. I cannot bring myself to like the picture when I am not part of them. It depresses me that I seemed to have lost this bunch of friends. Uni friends are mostly hi-bye type, I doubt I can have any lasting friendships here. How can I somehow try to enter the clique again without letting them know that I am secretly jealous of their outings?
-
 
so that day i received an email saying that someone tried to reset my password on facebook. naturally i was freaking out. was someone trying to impersonate me? did i offend someone and they are trying to seek revenge by scaring me? or what?
naturally i told my friends about it. one of the response was so bad.  "you think got people want to hack into you account meh?" yes, thank you. thank you for reassuring me that i am safe from hackers since i am so insignificant. i understand that you always think that way but couldnt't you say something reassuring yet kind at the same time? 
-
 
I am chasing this girl for two months and I am in a dilemma whether to continue seeing her. She is someone that is nice and sweet in general but I feel that she listens to her friends excessively. She told me stories about her previous relationships and how her friends advised her on this and that. Listening to her stories made me feel as though she did not commit herself into those relationships. Has anyone dated such girls? 

-
 
Anyone is single because of social anxiety problem?

When there is a girl making eye contact with you, you will feel anxious and faster look away.

How to overcome it?

5. Poisoned Candy

Adam was Mr Popular. He was a floorball player, did well in school, had many admirers. Was from a wealthy family and his parents gave him whatever he wanted.

He knew the words to say: the words to make me melt, the compliments to give, the promises to make that would make a girl swoon. All this was done on Whatsapp. The strangest part about this whole story was - I had never even met the man. Yet he was talking to me like I was his wife and we had just gotten married.  I was slightly guarded when I noticed he was being too familiar with me although we were strangers. I let my guard down because I believed he was an okay person with no malice. 

 When we finally met in person, he turned out to be all talk but no real substance. Attempts to engage Adam in intellectual conversation failed as he did not enjoy talking about macro issues, even though we shared the same major. After our very underwhelming date, he disappeared. Blocked me from WhatsApp and all forms of social media. Didn't even bother to explain. Just said he was sorry and never spoke to me again.

I told my Uni kakis what happened, they encouraged me to channel my WTF emotions and anger into working out. I exercised every day that week.

It took me a whole week to fully get over Adam. We went from texting each other good morning to sweet dreams, to silence.

Lessons:
1. Never trust sweet talking guys who try to win you over with their words. Do not believe in the talk, unless they display the walk. Be cautious if it sounds too good to be true. In fact, if it gets too disgustingly sweet, my best advice is to not even go there girlfriend. Do not entertain the player. Don't let the poison infect your system or you shall suffer from confusion and heartbreak.
2. This one is for both the males and females: To make dating in Singapore more enjoyable, please tell your date if you no longer wish to pursue him or her romantically. It is sibei disrespectful to disappear, especially if you've made a promise to this person or even made another date with them. Leaving people hanging reflects poorly on your character and you should be ashamed if you always take the easy way out.

Till the next story, LN.

I haven't been able to tell my friends about the family problems I have. Not anyone ever. I don't think they can solve it for me, or be able to fully understand my state given that they all have a happy family. It's not like something that happened when I was young, it's recent, it's happening now. When my friends see me with either parent, they will casually ask where the other parent is, and I'll have to lie and brush it off because I'm not ready to explain the entire story to them. Or maybe it's just I can't be bothered to explain. I don't wish for them to feel uneasy whenever we touch on family topics, because I know they will try to be considerate and avoid that. I don't like lying to them, cause each time I lie, a part of me die inside. 

At times I do wish I could speak to someone about it, but I never have the strength to do so. But at times when shit happens, I tell myself to go head on with it, take it hard and get it cleanse out of my system with something good - like a banana (scientifically proven to help with constipation, no i'm serious) cause it'll be a sunny yellow banana day and thats the way it should be - looking at the bright side of life! #midnightthoughts

I know most of you may not remember me, but i posted several months ago where I banged a random girl who asked me to bring her back to my room when we saw each other at Utown and then I realise that all the details she had given me was fake. YESTERDAY, A GUY FRIEND OF MINE EXPERIENCED THE EXACT SAME THING AND DID IT WITH SOME RANDOM GIRL IN THE EXACT SAME SITUATION. Just that this time round she wasn't wearing the same thing (like duh), he cant contact her or find her fb either and the name given is totally different from what I got, but we are suspecting its the same girl. WHAT SHOULD WE DO????????

Re: 
Being fat is so frustrating. You have people who keep asking you to eat less. Whenever I hear people losing weight, I feel so jealous that they can lose weight so easily. ( though I do not wish to be skinny, just want to hit that healthy weight range )

The worst part is when people pick on you just because you look weak and incompetent. I get annoyed when people tell me that they can easily outrun me or that they let me off just because I look unfit. Wth you already picked on me, then you let me off as if I cannot also be physically capable? 

I exercise 3x/week minimum. I eat fewer than 2000 calories per day. I can out run my slim friends. I can swim farther, I can do more burgess, more pull ups, more push ups. My body weight is my concern, not yours.

I read about some of the posts confessing to finding someone else to fulfil sexual needs while being in a relationship. I can't understand it fully, though I'm not sure if it's because I'm female. In my own relationship, I feel physical desires to get more intimate with my boyfriend from time to time but I don't act on it/control myself because we have agreed to take things slow. That being said, while sometimes the desires get very strong, I cannot imagine finding someone else to fulfil that need because the person I feel those desires for is my boyfriend, and I don't really think I would be satisfied if it was someone else because I don't desire that someone else? Well, maybe I just don't know, I guess...

Hi. First I must apologise for bringing up "VH" once again, but I thought I must.

I used to be his friend back in HCI, where we were in SMTP. SMTP was where the brightest science and math talents came together to undergo research-like training. When I first met him he was known to be a very bright person and thus I enjoyed his company, even though he sometimes cracks weird jokes.

One episode, however, made me learn what a jerk he is.

I had been attached to a girl called "G" for 3 months or so. After Chemistry Olympiad, where I got nothing while "VH" got a bronze, "VH" was celebrating that he did well. We were all happy for people like "VH" and company who got good results.

One fine day, "VH" stopped me at the canteen while I was queuing up for noodles and whispered into my ear, "I will get G."

I was completely puzzled, but brushed it off as "VH" being weird. After all, he did crack the inappropriate joke from time to time, and like guys who liked girls, bitch about how he would never date certain types of ugly girls. Moreover, in SMTP, we guys were seen to be too nerdy and hence I intended my relationship to be low-key. Alas, sometimes we chit-chat over lunch and it inadvertently spilled, but not many people knew.

Thinking it was a joke, I jokingly told "G" that "VH" was being a usual joker and tried to taunt me. "G" and I shrugged it off until we noticed that "G" kept on getting prank called between 2 to 3 am each night.

Still, I didn't think much of it until "G" confronted me one fine morning. She asked me about "photos and a meeting at Coronation Plaza". I only remembered that another girl "X" asked me for chem homework help and I agreed to teach her outside school. "G" then quarrelled with me over this girl "X". "G" started to become a little more demanding, but I knew something was not right. Why would "G" be told of a casual homework meet-up and lunch, and be sent pictures of something seemingly innocent. I asked "G" for the pictures. Indeed, it was the homework meet-up, but I did not realise "X" was acting seductive and doing all sorts of hanky-panky! This was an obvious set-up but finding the culprit proved futile.

I wanted to keep this as secretive as possible, so I did not tell anyone about this except my best friends, who were not in SMTP.

It was all cool until "X" suddenly sent me a message. I deleted it a long time ago, but it was along the lines of "X" saying sorry for what she did. I asked what exactly she did. She then told me "VH" gave her $20 to do that. Apparently "X" liked "VH" and "VH" told her that she should do that to gain his favour. I told "X" that her moment of folly was forgiven, but the inconvenience she gave me was a problem still. What was confusing was why "X" owned up. After much hesitation, she said that "X" felt terrible for being a bitch and causing "G" and I to nearly break up.

Talking to "X" felt awkward, but I realised that day what a jerk "VH" could be. I guess that "X" was foolish at that moment, but I would like to say, thank you "X". If not for your confession I would never have learnt about my supposed friends.

Eventually "G" and I broke up, and on the very next day, "VH" suddenly approached me and said, "I got her, right?" I was fuming mad but he didn't know I knew what he did. I did feel like low-browing him but restrained. Someone like him did not deserve that.

I'm sorry "G". I also want to thank "X". But more importantly, I have vented my frustrations with "VH". I would never have vented if not for the fact that "VH" showed up on NUSWhispers.
-
 
I have always been a silent reader of NUSWhispers , but after reading all these posts about VH, I feel that I should post smth. 

Let me first establish some credentials (although I know posting this anon does not help much, but it's up to you guys to believe my words). 

I know VH personally, and have taken quite a few modules with him. Yes, sometimes VH says things that are unorthodox, and yes, some of these things may be offensive to certain people. However, after getting to know him personally, I've come to realise that he is actually a really nice guy who bears no malice whatsoever. He ALWAYS goes out of his way to help me whenever I approach him with questions regarding the common modules we take. He even imparts his personal tips and tricks [to understand certain topics] to me. Not once has he refused to help me/gave me incomplete/ill advice. He does the same for juniors; whenever juniors ask him for help, he'll go so far as to dig out his old notes to help them. Talk about effort, man!

Second, there have been past incidents of character assassination performed on him by certain individual(s) [you cunt(s) know who you are]. Although I'm not sure whether the HCI story is true [I'm from a different school], I am certain that the NUS incidents are/have been untrue/misinterpreted. I would also like to believe that the same person find it "amusing" to continually defame VH over and over again. I have only three words to tell him. Go Yuck Fourself.

Sincerely, 
Anon.

I know that I should not be living in the past, but I found out recently from a friend about something this guy I used to go out with (I won't use the term ex-bf, you'll see why later).

I met this guy B through a mutual friend, and after our first date I was completely swept away. This was a few years ago and up to that point I was always very awkward on dates with guys. I was starting to think there was something wrong with me that we didn't have any connection. But with B he totally swept me off my feet. After the second date, I remember speaking to him on the phone and he started talking about how it may not be a great idea for us to date cos we have different religions and it may conflict when we get married. My first thought was um ok aren't we getting ahead of ourselves, and I kind of freaked out. Maybe it's my awkwardness but up to that point, I did freak out quite easily when the guy starts to say something really serious so fast. But I thought that B was special so I decided to just reassure him (don't wanna go too much into this but it really was not a big deal).

1 month later and things started to go bad. I can't remember what exactly happened but we broke up. Then we got back together. That's when things got bad. He started telling me things like how he could never be serious about another girl after his first crush in JC, or saying things like "what if I meet somebody better when I go to uni?" (I was going for exchange, he was entering uni) when he called me at night (for the record, I never asked him to; I actually don't really like talking on the phone). After another 2 months I couldn't take it anymore and we broke up, but I immediately regretted it and asked him if we could start again. I asked him if he could be kind and just be with me at least until my final exams were over so I'd be in a proper state to finish then we could talk things out and have a good closure. He rejected the idea. I was so foolish. It was a very hard recovery from my first heartbreak but I thought that at least I came out of it stronger. I even thought that hey, I'm in a good place now, if he wants to be acquaintances I'd probably be okay with it.

Apparently during the break up process, B told my mutual friend that he didn't understand why I was so upset because we were never even together in the first place. I was so shocked when my friend told me about this recently, and it made me question if I was really justified in being so upset. Was it all in my mind that we were together? On the other hand, I'm also very upset now that he just brushes off what we had, when all along it did feel like a relationship.

I know I shouldn't care about this anymore, but I feel like B did so much emotional damage to me at the time, and even now when I think I'm over it, he's still affecting my self-esteem. I know that my self-esteem should not be measured by another person blah blah blah but we're all human beings and we've all felt hurt by others at one point in another so don't judge me.

My closest female friend ever has just gotten back her N level results. She missed out on PFP by 2 pts, and can either go to sec 5 or ite. As im worried she will mix with bad company in ite like how she did in secondary school as i cannot always watch over, i tried telling her to take the sec 5 o lvl route. Similarly, her brother thought the same as me, but her sister thought otherwise to go to ITE. Her parents dont give a shit. 

However, she insists on going to ITE to take business and go on with law in poly.

What do you guys think? Please help me by commenting bwlo which you think its best for me to convince her! Thank you

I'm jealous that my boyfriend has the latest iPad and I don't. I want to buy but I don't want to waste my money. I will never ask him to buy for me cuz I don't like to take others' money. I also don't want to waste my own money by buying just cuz he does.

Sem 2 is starting soon! How do I get my leave of absence for the sem? Do I have to talk to the counsellors? will they be available now? I feel like a mess ):

I once made a promise to my best male friend that we will go on a graduation trip together. But I complicated the whole thing by getting together with my current boyfriend last year. How do I tell my boyfriend about the promise I made to my friend? I don't think he will like it and I don't want to hurt his feelings. But if I cancelled the trip, my best friend will no doubt feel hurt and it will affect our friendship, given I've known him for so long. It doesn't help matters that my boyfriend doesn't like my friend. I don't know if I should go or not.

All these stories about being supposedly friendzoned makes me realise that a lot of guys may be friends with girls just for a hidden motive. I look out for friends who I can connect with, understand me, have fun with and go through hard times with regardless of gender or looks. I've never had an intention to befriend guys to take it to another level. 
Honestly actually I would find it creepy and upsetting if one day a guy friend confessed to having liked me romantically/sexually since day one. I would see our friendship as not having been sincere or real at all. It would also be really weird to realise he has been thinking of me in ahem ways all this time. Of course it would be different if he developed feelings over time. 
I would much prefer guys to express their interest upfront. Yes I believe I can give a chance even if he is not good looking or charming (but must not be ugly sorry) and if he seems like a sincere guy and is not a creep. We don't have to start a serious relationship or anything but we could still casually go out a few times to try something out. Actually I would also find it more romantic this way. 
Knowing someone has an interest in me does not make them just a friend to me. Its not what friends are. I just want to make this label clear in my life. And what's all this about being "zoned". I think friends are very important. It's not like i want to be friends with just anyone. 
I don't know why my thinking is so different from many people it seems. I guess I am old fashioned. I would not want to continue being friends with someone who has confessed and I don't feel the same way and thus in the term nowadays friendzone him. I would feel really sorry for him and honestly I would find him a bit pathetic if he hung around me just to be around me as a next resort. I can foresee some people disagreeing with me already but I needed to vent. I'm sure there are girls who feel the same way too, we view friendships in a different light. Also the fact so many people view friends like this is making me feel really insecure about a potential boyfriend's female "friends".

#datingstoriesbylaoniang

Laoniang is experiencing some inertia when it comes to writing this series of dating stories. How many more stories do you all want to hear? If you’re getting bored, I’ll just skip to the end. Please let me know. Anyway..….here’s one for the road.

4. The Gentleman

“Hello!” I said with a wave, as I walked up to Glenn. He was taller than I expected and had a boyish face.

“Hi!” he replied with a smile. “Where do you want to go for coffee?”

“I don’t know, I’m fine with anything really.” I shrugged, looking towards him for suggestions.

“Okay, let’s go to Dean and Deluca then. Their coffee’s not bad.”

Prior to our date, I had talked to Glenn for a month on WhatsApp. From our month-long conversation, I could tell that he was a very down to earth guy. He was family and friend-oriented, loved travelling and had a stable job. I really enjoyed talking to him, as I knew that he wasn’t trying to impress me or pretend to be some nice guy. This was really who he was. Naturally I was very nervous to meet him. After such a long build-up, after wondering what he was like in real life for such a long time, it was time to finally 
a) Have my expectations shattered 
b) Be blown away by Glenn in real life

We entered D&D and looked around for a table. Once we found one, he pulled out the chair for me with a smile. Not a weird smile. It was a genuine smile. The kind that moves from your lips to your cheeks, reaching the eyes. I know this sounds cringe-worthy, but in that moment, I felt shy. When a guy treats you like a princess through simple gestures of chivalry, it’s a wonderful feeling. Who doesn’t like being treated like a precious gem?

At the counter, I intentionally stood behind him so that he wouldn’t get to pay for my coffee. He very smoothly asked for my order before paying for his and paid for our orders together. I insisted on paying him back, trying to slide a ten dollar note towards him but failed.

“I’m already working, you’re still in school. Let me pay,” he said with smiling eyes, pushing back my note.

We talked about travelling, music, our friends and family, school, work. It was a well rounded conversation. He told me about his travels in New York. But despite him being such a nice and well-mannered guy with good principles, I did not feel any strong chemistry as we talked over coffee. You know what I’m talking about? How at some points in life, you meet people that you just click with and want to be friends with for a long time. The chemistry comes naturally, both parties feel it, both parties treasure the relationship and want to fortify it. It just wasn’t like that with Glenn and I felt disappointed. Chemistry is so important. When it’s not there, you just know it. You can’t force someone out of the friendzone. Some people just don’t fit well together romantically.

After the date, Glenn and I still talked to each other on WhatsApp. I did not want to lead him on, so I friendzoned him.

“I like you as a friend, Glenn. I’m sorry that we did not work out romantically though,” I typed apologetically. I turned off my phone, hid it in my closet and walked away. Half an hour later, I gingerly retrieved my phone to read his reply.

To my surprise, Glenn replied in an objective and positive tone.
“Thank you for telling me that. I’m surprised you told me so directly though, most girls are not as bold as you are. It would be nice if they were more forward! You’re a sweet girl and I’d love to remain friends,” he replied.

Till this day, Glenn and I remain friends. I’m glad I met him. Glenn taught me that chivalrous guys still exist. Glenn taught me about myself, that I like chivalrous men very much as good manners go a long way in life. Glenn is a type of guy that I would bring home to meet my parents. 

The little things go a long way. Something as small as holding open a door for another, pulling out the chair for something, paying for coffee – all these are small gestures that speak of a person’s character. Do these things and also look out for these things in others, in your pursuit of love.

 Till the next story, LN.

In response to , I read this and can't help but wonder if I love my boyfriend because he gives me attention and makes me feel special, how can I tell the difference between love and this? I admit I do love the attention he gives me but I also love spending time with him etc, not sure if it's true love or just me afraid of being dumped in the future

To the op of 

I wouldn't say it warrants a visit, for that is something you must decide. I'd suggest it, though. 

I've had that too, periods where i thought the world was all against me, that God hated me, when i woke up everyday and sighed. It took time and i did go to the counsellor at the uhc. It helped me a fair bit. 

Whatever happens my friend, stay strong! If there is anything we can do, let us know.

I know there is a saying "Bros before Hoes"

But...
What do I do when the perfect girl for me belongs to my best friend?
They have been dating for 6 years and I catch myself looking at the girl one too many times. I mean how could I not? 
She is a model and medicine student. (She doesn't go to NUS)

She is the definition of perfect to me.

I don't even know what will become of me when they get engaged or something.

Hi, just another lonely student here. Well I know this isn't the best place to seek advice but I just wanna seek opinions from people who have gone through similar situations, so that I'll know if this warrants a visit to the counsellor.

By nature, I'm a reserved, awkward person and I can't click with majority of people like my classmates. Although I sorta accept the fact that that's how I am, I still have periods of self loathing where I feel like no one likes me and I'm dysfunctional, that comes every few months. It has been going on since JC (3-4 years ago), but I always took it as just stress or simply a down period in life.

However, for the past year or so I've been overseas for studies and these episodes have become more intense and frequent. Maybe it was my messy breakup and subsequent loss of my closest friends that acted as the catalyst. Or maybe it's the lack of social support since I don't have any friends there. I do try talking to people, but they just aren't interested in talking and being friends with me. Everyone there seems to have found their cliques and they're always participating in activities, and going out, and being so normal.

Sometimes if it's a big group event and I'm invited (by default), I go home feeling even more rejected cos all these negative thoughts will just take over. Then I'll spend the rest of the week/month curled up in bed, alone in my room, with the heaviest weight on my chest.

Nowadays, I have a breakdown almost everyday where I think about all these things and I suddenly find it harder to breathe. Even if I try to think of positive things in life, it's hard to overcome the self-doubts, and I just wanna hide in my room. I also wanted to stop being selfishly mopey by doing some volunteering work, but I just can't bring myself to do anything..

Sighpie. Sorry for the rambling post. But I don't want to be that sad bummer that everyone avoids. I want to be a happy kid again.

Who do you guys turn to talk about relationship problems when your partner doesn't like that you talk to others about your relationship.

So I know this person in the same major as me who would ask really dumb questions over WhatsApp group chat, like why the prosthetic groups in the ETC complexes are not included in the overall equation. And when people in the group chat, including me, already told her the answer, she still doesn’t get it, like once we told her that Grignard reagent can be used for a particular synthesis and she asks where the alkyl substituent will come from. And at times when she still doesn’t get what we tell you, she would rebut in a rather offensive manner. And apparently her seniors find her rude as well…
And the best part is, she has a boyfriend who is a Chem major, but does not ask him all the questions for her chemistry module, but directs them to people, both peers and seniors, in the same major as her. And this boyfriend of hers attends lectures for her modules with her, which makes me really wonder why she is asking help over the WhatsApp group in the first place. Too much juxtacrine signalling I guess. And what I could say is that even though she has studied everything in advance, she is not really understanding what she studied at all. #postexamrants #whydoihavepeerslikethis

Hi, just wanted to know are there any transgender in NUS. Could anyone of you perhaps talk about the challenges faced in your academic persuit?

This would be quite a drama if only it could end with a happy ending. Im seeking advice on a situation which is causing me to lose my sleep and myself in. My parents have been very disapproving of me towards this guy that i have been keeping in contact with. I have lied to them countless times about going out with him and talkin to him through chats. They went to extreme extents to stop us from talking to one another (e.g changing my number so that he couldnt contact me). But even after all that they did, we are still in contwct with each other. Previously, they said that they did a background check on the guy as i told them that he had borrowed money from me and they find that ever since i met him i had changed which caused them to take such drastic measures. They claimed to have found out that he did some unacceptable stuff to girls but i dont know for sure if it's true but seeing as they are my parents i have to trust them. I know they are doing all these to protect me if case the guy tries to harm me and to prevent any unforeseeable events from happening  (e.g getting pregnant, lending more money to him, losing myself just becos of a guy i met through work). Now, we are at this stage whereby they have found out that i am still in contact with him and my dad is hella flared up and knowing his temper im afraid to think of the things he could do to stop us from talkin. Both me and the guy know that there is no or extremely little chance that we would still be able to meet and talk to each other like friends not like a couple but like friends. I would like some advice as to how anyone would deal with this situation or if they have been in such a situation because im really at a lost now. My parents are my priority but i don't want to lose a friend because of the misunderstandings that my parents have been causing to make me stop talkin to him.

I'm a mediocre, and I feel stressed and burdened about it. People say hard work pays off, but sometimes things don't work out and plunge into a vicious cycle, then I get even more frustrated time after time. Gradually, I lose faith and hope in myself for doing what is 'right' for my life. I'm at my last year in NUS. Holding onto the last bit of incomplete faith, I feel like..my future is a bleak. I think it's a normal feeling for us, before stepping into the working life and becoming even more independent, but well, just saying, because I don't know how to share this with anyone in person.

i dk why i need to feel so awful about studying in local uni engineering course... my mother and my sister feels its unnecessary and constantly put me down for having to study 4 years while my sister has been working full time while completing her 2 years part time studies at sim thus she doesnt need to get allowance from my parents since years ago... i had a huge fight with them yet i have no choice but to continue staying with them and endure their attitude towards me... nothing i said can convince them... i feel awful cos i guess that their acknowledgment means something to me... how i wish i could hack care...

Being skinny is so frustrating. You have people who keep asking you to eat more. Whenever I hear people gaining weight, I feel so jealous that they can gain weight so easily. ( though I do not wish to be fat, just want to hit that healthy weight range )

The worst part is when people pick on you just because you look weak and fragile. I get annoyed when people tell me that they can easily break my hand or that they let me off just because I look weak. Wth you already picked on me, then you let me off as if I cannot stand up for myself? 

Sorry for the rant, have to get this off my mind. Don't bash me for my lousy English. >.<

P.s. any advice on gaining weight?

When you said my story sucked i was okay with it. I felt like i deserved it. All my life i'd felt that i was worthless, and throughout our seven year "friendship" you told me that as much as you could. I was used to thpse insults from you. Even after i developed self esteem, i thought that was just you being blunt.

Until our mutual friend told me that you'd stopped writing because of a sense of indequacy compared to my writing. 
That made me reevaluate our whole relationship. See, in our relationship, all you did was delight in calling me "inferior", "fat" unattractive" "suaku". But you thought i was good. You thought i was better than you. And i trusted you. I took what i thought you believed of me and internalised it and all along, for four damn years you hurt me out  of petty malice. Out of a sense of inadequacy at yourself

man, that threw me. For four years, you treated me like thrash and justified it by saying i was weak, when all along, you were just feeding your twisted ego. 

I'm gonna say what i've wanted to say for years here: f**k you. F**k you to death. Did it make you feel good, making a girl who already believed she was nobody feel like even less than garbage? Did it make you feel good when i didnt fight back, when i crawled after you for your approval, when i was alone and wretched and all you did was laugh and say i shouldnt have hoped for more, i was too weak to deserve anymore?

over the next two years i worked my ass off partly because i was becoming amazed at what i was and could become, and partly because i wanted you to see me run faster than you will ever be able to. 

Well, the tables have turned. I've done everything you said i couldnt, and then some. I've shrugged off all your poisonous labels, "passive", "ugly", "untalented". I've taken flight. and you? Of our original group of friends, the one where you were queen, only your most precious lackey is left by your side. And you know what? I know for sure that all you will do is continue to tear each other down for as long as you can. Because thats all you are. Jealous, bitter creatures who'd rather mock othrrs for their inadequacies than admit your own inability to create anything of value. I know, because its already happening. She hates your boyfriend. She thinks you'll come crawling back to her one day. My my. 

And you know what is the best part? When ppl on our old cca's whatsapl group congratulate me on my achievements, and you can't bring yourself to spit a single word.

Watch me fly knowing you can't even run. 

That's all you've ever deserved.

Recently i have a few friends that got attached. These came as surprises to me because i didn't even know that they love or even like their new bfs. we have had heart to heart talks about guys and they didnt even mention any of those guys. this makes me feel that they will just accept anyone (they dont even like) that confess to them because they are afraid of being left on the shelf. I understand that feeling when someone confess to you. you feel important, special and wanted. but all these feelings are not love! it is just an ego-booster! i feel that it is rather irresponsible of them to accept these guys just because they want the attention and they will just leave them if the one appears in the near future.

We met each other back in sec 3. We went to the same overseas school trip and became really close. Partly because we had a mutual close friend. Texting each other was like a daily routine. 

O levels came and we receieved our school postings. I was devastated. I was posted to 'x' JC and you were posted to 'y' jc. I really wanted to attend the same jc as you. As a result, I went for an appeal. After putting in hardwork for my interviews, I made it. I got accepted to 'y' jc. 

I remember when I first met you in 'y' jc. You were shocked. "Omg what are you doing here?!" and I told her I got accepted through appeal. 

We ended taking different subject combis and were in different CCAs. We started to drift apart. I didn't really put in the effort and remain close with you as JC was really tough for me..

Fast forward to the time after A levels, I wrote a confession letter and place it inside your locker. Just had that 'yolo' attitude before i enter NS and you enter uni. You didn't reject me but you wanted to focus on your studies first.

And once again, we're both in 2 different unis. I'm going to NUS and you're in NTU. However, I'm gonna put in my effort to make something happen this time... Hopefully it will be good

Sometimes I'm surprised at how indifferent I can be. 
People call me an unfeeling bitch
"how can you be so heartless," they say
But I would like to think thats how I survived. 
-
 
Seeing the post on whether guys like pretty girls with average body or average looking girls with nice body.. I think they probably ok with both... Speaking from a girl who is average looking and overweight.. I do have a lot of friends and technically quite a bit of guys but I'm always friendzoned so probably size and looks matters? 
-
 
 you can't do much about the face, but you have every control over how you wish your body to look like, so change what you can

,
Seriously? You don't deserve your girlfriend at all! She saves it for you, (assuming she eventually marries you) and you're cheating behind her back?! The most outrageous thing is you don't even seem to be guilty at all!!

Relationship is about trust. Yes, some guys can be sexually needy, but do they ALL cheat on their girlfriends????? You don't respect your girlfriend at all. You don't love her. She deserves better. 

Your "totally in love with" makes me feel disgusted.
-
 
All my life I haven't had the best of luck with friends. I have my flaws, but I dare say I constantly try my best to be the bigger person in situations and wouldn't hesitate to be there for them. But I am starting to feel extremely insignificant, no one actually knows what I'm doing for them, it's like my presence isn't even appreciated. With all my closest friends in army because I'm physically handicapped, I find myself really lonely. There is no one I can hang out with, or just talk to about the emptiness I feel. It doesn't help that I get really awkward with girls and don't even know how to strike a conversation with them.

I have no special talents or interests, and that makes it hard for me to join a CCA or interest group to be with like-minded people. I just don't know where to start, or how to pick myself up. It's very difficult for me to open up to people, and I'm envious of how easy it is for some people to just get along with anybody. I know ranting isn't the solution but I feel like there's nothing I can do about this and nobody will listen to me about how I feel. 

Just another typical lonely NUS kid lamenting about his sad life.

Another one of those 'love' posts here....

I hold more feelings than ordinary friendship towards him, but less feelings than i do for a boyfriend. Do these feelings exist? i’m pretty sure its one sided and he treats me like an ordinary friend. He gets me and we have fun when we go out. We talk for hours almost everyday and have rather similar, but also different interests. However, i don't see us ever being together. i don't see us working out. There’s a lack of physical attraction, not that it isn’t there- it just isn’t enough. Its just comfortable talking and trusting him. I want to be together with him, but yet i don’t want to... 
-
 
noooo its has been two months since rejection but I still have feelings for you:((. I really want to be just a friend to you but I can't help it but wish you might change your mind. Although my attraction towards you is less intense now, I still constantly think of wanting to text you! 

Why did you reject me? Is it a matter of commitment or that you do not really know me well? But I know you are comfortable with me and trust me:(. Sometimes I thought maybe I should have asked you why you rejected me but I do not want to change myself just to make you like me. I want you to like me for who I am:(

You might not know but I have decided to wait for you as a capacity of a friend. I do not know why you rejected me but I will be there for you when you need me. I know you need your space. And if nothing come out of this, I might be really sad but I don't want to give up just yet. I hate not having control over my feelings.

All our friends said that we would be really cute together so why? I want my heart back:(((

This message is to all the NUS Alumnis who are now in the sg workforce , doesn't matter which faculty you are from , what your major is :

In the midst of working a 8-5 office job , have you ever stopped to wonder , how your life would be , if you had chose other majors ?

Is the job that you are doing right now everyday what you imagined when you decided to take the offer letter from NUS after your poly / jc ?

Is there a regret somewhere that you should have went for what you loved ?

Share your thoughts ! :)

They say University is the place to get a bf, but I guess it wont be easy for that to happen in a faculty dominated by girls. What's worse is that I am totally inactive on social media (I don't enjoy posting about my life) , joined a cca dominated by girls, and have girlfriends that are really low profile too (in real life and social media). It's my final year in NUS now, and they say, it will be harder to find the right one when I'm swamped with work in the future. This is depressing, especially during this festive period.

This is gonna be a disturbing post but I'm doing it anyway because I don't know who can help. I'm sure all guys out there love masturbation right? The excitement and pleasure of ejaculation. I have a problem. I can't ejaculate. Not with the usual masturbation method. I've tried several times in the toilet attempting to do it but after 15 minutes or more, I just couldn't. I felt tired and at the same time devastated. I feel that I'm not normal. 

The only way that makes me ejaculate is to apply pressure, and I mean relatively high pressure on my penis by clamping it between my thighs, and squeezing it till I get the feeling.

Is this normal? Is there any other way that I can ejaculate using the normal method and not my extreme way. My way is hurting my balls.

Two friends, Java and C, are sitting in a bar late one night having a chat. Intrigued by their exotic languages, a steady stream of guys have been walking over to hit on them. However, they're all paying a lot more attention to Java, leaving poor C stuck in a loop back and forth to the bar.

After a few more iterations, C's feeling a little tipsy. Eventually, she plucks up some courage and asks the next guy why he's so keen on Java and not her.

He replies: "It’s nothing personal C, really. I just prefer girls with a little more class."

i don't think this is a normal question but here it is. i am currently attached and sometimes i am wondering if there is anywhere i could do a fertility test just so that i would not get an utmost shock when i realise perhaps im not fertile when im married next time. is it even normal to approach a gynae at such a young age (22?)
-
 
I had always thought I was prepared enough for this imminent break up. I rehearsed so many times in my mind on how I should go about breaking the news to you. I thought I would be relieved that it's all over, and that I would not cry over it. As it turned out, I am not as strong as i thought i was. 

But the thought of hurting you guilts me so much that I thought maybe it was a bad idea to break up,  maybe we should hold on longer, that maybe a miracle will happen that would resolve our differences. 

Although I initiated it, there is still this tinge of sore heartache deep within me. 

I'm sorry.

Tldr: this post only directed to one person so I guess everyone else should skip this if you feel that nobody wants to tell you anything HAHAHA lol

Gonna post this here because I don't think there's a better way to get through to you??? I've been thinking and trying to piece everything together and I finally found the closure that I needed. I guess I told you my decision a week ago and to be honest, bulk of it was based on gut feeling, intuition and most importantly past experience that things will not work out in the long run. Remember I told you I had many question marks in my head? Yes now that I have the space and clarity to think carefully I realised why I actually made that decision. And I've realised it's actually so much more than just religious issues. Sorry I didn't have the time to think through all this carefully during the sem because I was so busy studying??? Like how I didn't notice you were into me to begin with LOL so dense my gosh. You said you were looking for someone supportive in everything you do. I cannot be that person and I'm sorry. 

We talked a lot about whether we want to wait for each other since we loved each other but I'm here to tell you, 放弃吧. And you should never change for me even though I may have made it sound like I wanted you to change - sorry again, but I did feel your sincerity tho. There will be someone out there who will love you for who you are and most importantly the things you do, someone who will fulfill all 4/4 of your criterias and you totally deserve her.

I will always be real to you and if you really want to find out the other reasons why I will tell you, but ask me in 6 months time ok, since we both agreed to distant ourselves. Hope you're doing fine now.

I think I've dropped enough hints (*hint hint*) to let you know this confession is for YOU plus this is the way I always type so you should know. I laugh in caps, HAHAHA.

No hard feelings, even after everything that has happened. I hope you don't hate me too.

If I failed my CS1010S, will any girls fall in love with me? I heard that girls are more attracted to those who do well in programming modules, is it true? *>_<*

I have always been a very sexually needy person, however my current girlfriend whom I totally am in love with, and wanna marry with, is not giving it to me. She only wants it after marriage, but I do not want to be married so early as I want to develop my career for at least 3-4 years. 

There's this two girls who approached me and tempted me to have a friends-with-benefits relationship with them. I managed to be more nonchalant for one, while for the other I eventually gave in, and we had sex. It was a good one after so long. I'm feeling guilty but satisfying, like a cheat meal. I feel like an animal, but it just feels so good.

Just wanna let out some guilt steam.

I don't think I'm ugly, fat, stupid, and/or annoying. I had guys liking me before. But why has no one confessed or liked me anymore in recent years?

I'm a 20 y/o evergreen girl, and I've been talking to this guy who is 3 years older than me. I've been asked out by several guys these few years, but I'm very introverted and somehow I just find it really difficult to get close to people, especially those whom I know have an interest in me - it's almost like a reflex for me to push them away.

We started off as friends, started talking randomly one day and we've been talking every day since for about 3 months now, and this is the first time I've ever wanted to see and talk to a guy as much as him. He makes me smile even when he isn't around, and he makes me laugh even when I feel like I'm having the worst day of my life. 

But I can't say for sure that I'm in love. Infatuated maybe, but not in love. How could I be?

I've been struggling with depression for 2 years (it's on and off now) and there are some days when bouts of depression will just suddenly hit me. Some days I feel like they're the best of my life, but at night for no reason at all, I think about how worthless I am and that I want to kill myself. The sad part is that he has never been there for me.

Whenever I show hints of unhappiness or looking like I need some cheering up, he avoids me and pretends he can't tell. His replies become shorter, as though he doesn't want to talk and it just hurts me sometimes. He just can't seem to talk feelings.

Yet, I'm desperately trying to convince myself otherwise. I tell myself, you haven't known him long enough yet for him to want to be there for you. He's afraid of showing he cares too much. But he makes you so happy during other times - do you really want to give him up? I say, give him a few more months. Maybe then he'd know better. But am I just deluding myself? 

My gut tells me he isnt the one (though my heart believes otherwise, of course.) The truth is, I'm scared. I don't know if I will ever find anyone who makes me as happy as he does anymore. But with my condition, I can't just have a "fair-weather boyfriend". I don't know how to feel anymore. 

Am I just being paranoid and jumping to conclusions to soon? Or should I pull away before any damage can be done to either of us?

@13793- I dont get it, so when an attached girl cheats its 'When you don't spend time with your girlfriend, someone else will', but when an a guy does it, its 'all men are pigs'? Also to OP, you can complain about your bf not spending time with you, but it goes both ways too, you could make time for him but you are not. You should have set the record straight and let that guy know you're attached. Nothing justifies cheating.

Delete Facebook and hit the gym? Nope...

I don't care about my partner's exes (gender neutral!), despite it bearing strong similarities to a United Nations meeting. I'll admit: I'm envious that he/she had those amazing experiences with all those different people across US/Eurasia while I've been stuck in Singapore with my hands :( 

I can handle that envy in the relationship. No issues at all.

But whenever I can't find the motivation to work out, I'll go on FB and see photos of my partner being happy with the exes all over the world. I will let envy turn into jealousy, and have it slowly build up inside me, pic by pic, until I storm out of my room and into the gym/track. 

All those negative emotions are released in a brutal, one-more-set-till-you-die training session. My team mates think I'm a driven athlete who's willing to push myself to the absolute limits. It's unhealthy but you cannot deny the results.

So I say, scroll through Facebook and hit the gym for maximum results.

A girl who hasn't really dated before, but is one who most girl&guy friends call "a good catch", had a very short conversation with a random stranger, and there may be a chance that they may have a common hobby. With no idea whether he's normal or what's his age or background like, should she give him her number and hang out?

#datingstoriesbylaoniang
Met someone on OkCupid. He kept talking about his toy collection and this female classmate that he was close to. Not just close to, but he kept talking about how all his friends liked to tease the two of them and pair them together, even though there was "nothing going on." Wts right he was going on and on about it!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why...? He wanted to hang out again but I turned him down. This guy had no game. Males, please don't talk about other girls in a romantic light unless it's your mom or your sister. And I have no issues with your toy collection, unless it becomes the sole topic of interest in your life. Moral of the story: Don't limit the conversation to one or two things in your life. At least ask yourself if you have any interesting stories to share beFore the date. Also try to leverage on a common interest that you share with your date, this information is readily available via text messaging before the actual meetup. This will avoid boring your date to tears. Dating takes effort if you want successful results and it is sibei fun, #laoniang swears by it!

I'm currently in a company with a high turnover rate. My boyfriend has been asking me about my career plans because he feels that this company is not going to be a conducive workplace for me to grow. He says things like 'Do u want to remain in your role forever and be a nobody or do u want to be an achiever?'. Thing is, for me, I feel that currently I have been given chances in my company, that many have not had, and there are still things I can do and learn in my company. He says that I'm not looking far, all I can see is what I'm going to do tomorrow, and not planning for the future. I admit I don't have a solid career plan laid out yet, so I feel like he's putting so much expectations on me and questioning my decisions while I've been nothing but supportive of his career decisions. And so these talks with him are not really unpleasant and he thinks he that I'm being petty that I'm not really happy when we talk about this. Any advice?

2. Worst Tinder Dinner Eva (heres a long one for the bored ones)

When #laoniang was a rookie to the dating app scene, I went on my first date with a male from Tinder. LN was first introduced to dating apps by my uni kakis who were swiping on campus with zeal. This was sometime last year and I tell you, I was sibei nervous to meet a total stranger.

Let's call number 1 Hao. When I first swiped right to Hao, I was ecstatic to be talking to such a hottie. He looked Japanese, with long twinkling eyes in his main photograph. His picture was taken in what I presume to be an office, with cubicles in the background. "So he's earning his own keep, very good," I thought to myself, giving him a mental checkmark. We starting talking on the app and later on exchanged digits.

"Do you have a pet?" he asked.

"Yes I have a rabbit. You?"

Hao sent a pic of a cute cat. Needless to say, LN was smitten. Girls love guys who love animals..........at least I do. He gushed about his cat, sending me more pictures. Awwwwwwww. I was sinking deeper into a puddle of feels and I loved every minute of it.

Hao started sending me "picture jokes." He took pictures of objects around his room and made witty captions about them. I was already sold when he popped the question.

"So.....do you want to have dinner sometime this week?"

I thought about it at great length. While he was cute, intelligent and pleasant to converse with, something was not quite right. Was this a date? Was he romantically interested in me? Tinder is a dating app, isn't it?

"Is this a date?" I typed.

"Nahhhhhhh, we're just having dinner. How's gimbap? I know this fancy Korean place with authentic gimbap in town. We can meet after I get off from work."

Authentic gimbap in town? Sounds expensive. If we're going as friends and it isn't a date, I can't blow $50 on a meal....presuming we're going dutch. I would rather spend that dough on duty free booze. Vodka with the girlfriends at the rooftop loft. Much, much better.

We ended up going to a cheaper restaurant on a weekday night. On Doomsday, I was sibei anxious. Now I know he said it wasn't a date but he was hot, so I had to look cute. My girlfriends came over to help me get cute. Hair, makeup, outfit, accessories, perfume. My CAP would be so much higher if I didn't spend so much time on being female. Haixz

We met in a crowded mall, he was really tall and slim, I'm guessing 1.8m? He was even cuter in real life........ I tried so hard play it cool. I didn't want him to see me flustered by his good looks. We made small talk as we walked towards the dinner venue. Things seemed to be going alright. We got a nice window seat overlooking the water. The view was pretty. I controlled my breathing to slow down my pounding heart.

This awkward tension started to build. Sexual tension????? Dream on!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the kind of awkward tension that Raj Koothrappali experienced when attempting to converse with females. Hao was looking out the window, thinking of what to chat about. 

Between extended pauses, we managed to talk about his job and how much he despises it. He went on a mad rant and grieved about how much he hated this, that, them. My heart started to sink. This was getting morbid. I felt his negativity rubbing off on the surface of my scalp, permeating my brain and colouring my mind a murky blue.

Apart from the rant, Hao and I talked about our experiences growing up. Somehao (see what I did there? lmao), we got into a disagreement about elitism. Something I said triggered an emotional reaction in him. He disagreed with my vocabulary on the subject. The discussion ended abruptly. Painful silence ensued.
 
Dinner ended, we went dutch, no surprise there. He carded it and I paid him back in cash. Now you may ask, why did I foolishly pay for my share? LN believes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. If you go on a horrible date, you never let the person blanjah you or you owe him/her one. Just. Pay. For. Your. SHARE!!!!!!!!!!!! No strings attached, sever all ties after the horrible date, sayonara.

The first dating app date was so horrible that I deleted Tinder the second we split ways. Traumatised, I bought some booze and headed over to my gf's house to dish out the dirt and drown my sorrows in my failure.

Moral of the story:
When meeting up with someone from a dating app, agree to meet for drinks, not dinner. If you meet a person you have no chemistry with, you can siam ASAP if it's drinks only. Assuming you're a nice date and will be paying for your own share, it will be easier to leave a drinks date than a dinner date. Drinks can be:
1. At a bar
2. Tea/coffee at a nice cafe
3. Michael Jackson at the market if you're sibei budget

Dinner on the other hand, is a commitment of an entire evening to a random stranger. You have to dine with that person. Awkward or not, you must finish your meal.............just don't.

Second lesson:
Be positive! Nobody likes a whiner. Yes, life is hard, but I wouldn't be your friend in the long run if you're going to dominate our nice dinner conversation with complaints. No. 

I'm glad I gave it one more try or I wouldn't have found him. Till the next story, LN.

I have a weird problem. I like to spend time alone and talk with this girl but whenever we are out together with mutual friends I will tend to avoid and ignore her. It just feels awkward to talk to her as some of our friends know about us. 

But when we are alone we will talk a lot. Anyway she already rejected me. Both of are us are introvert although I do feel that I am better at making conversation. When I saw her sitting awkwardly alone I really want to go over and talk to her but it feels awkward as hell. 

Although I am rejected, we still text each other rather normally. How would you feel if your friend treat you this way? I am still learning/trying to see her as a friend. It is hard to find a friend who understands you so even though it might be painful in the long run, I am still willing to give it a try to include her in my life.

To the OP of , ,  and 
I'm still waiting for you to keep your promise and write part 5. :(

On a side note, why are there so little posts on NUSWhispers recently? How disappointing... :(

Let me tell you guys my experience with the brozone. I'm a girl. About 5years ago i met this guy i thought was amazing and smart and such a good friend and i immediately dumped him deeeeep in the brozone.

Fast forward 2 years later, i realised he was the one for me and after 3 years of being so happy together i'm glad to share we are getting married next month. 

Just thought i'd share this as a little bit of encouragement for those guys who have been brozoned/rejected to not give up! (: been seein so many of such confessions lately so yeah. 
-
 
I got cheated on. 

I should have realised- how he always made sure his phone was angled perfectly so I couldn't see who he was texting, how he disappeared for hours at a time with no explanation, how he wasn't okay with public displays of affection and was never okay with calling me his girlfriend. He would always walk really close to me but we would never hold hands. He would call me terms of endearment but I only received text messages when he felt like it. 

I thought I was special.

We've ended things and sometimes I see him walking around campus with different girls. It's a different girl every two or so days. Sometimes they walk really close, brushing shoulders, other times they're touching each other here and there. 

I know he makes these girls feel special- like they're the only one he cares about, but I wish they knew the truth. I don't have the guts to talk to them, but I am genuinely concerned for them. This guy forcefully took my first kiss, touched me without my consent and toyed with my feelings. I came out of that relationship broken and I don't want this to happen to other girls as well.

I have been seeing many social media posts where couples in university are taking photos on the bed. Do most people actually lose their virginity during university days?

I fell in love with you. 
I waited for two years 
I confessed
It was one sided

Moving on was harder than i thought
People say that time will fly by and soon my wound will be healed; but how can it when you were the one who cut away its wings. 

It's been four months now and I still think about you and long for you. 
Why can't you see me? 

I still love you

Life never or seldom go the way we want it to. A very happy anniversary to the couple on this special day 12-12. Thanks for taking away what u shouldn't. I know I'm sore but I cannot help it. Reality is just so shitz. Just hope u remember, what goes around comes around.

So tell me why am i still waiting for you after so many months while you have been texting other girls behind my back?

I'm an attached girl but my boyfriend isnt in my clique in school because our timetables clash a lot. i spend more time with my friends within that clique than my boyfriend and i realised one of the guys in the clique likes me and i think i might like him too, is this feeling fleeting? :( should i be worried?
-
 
Do people like Facebook posts based on the person? Is it socially acceptable to like all posts posted by my close friends or will it make me look idiotic if I like everything, or doesn't anyone give a damn thought about it? Sorry if it sounds weird. I am a social media noob and curious about this

Anyone knows how to deal with a person who randomly starts rumors about you that aren't true but it annoys you so much to the point where you kind of want to choke the life out of that person ?

Do people normally go for summer school alone? I really want to go but my friends have either gone or can't go. I'm open to making friends, but I'm afraid that I'll find that everyone already has their own cliques and own friends that they came with... Being lonely for a month in a foreign country doesn't sound very attractive to me :(

So someone I know just tweeted a while back something like fat ppl who just keep on eating n eating then say they feel insecure bout their weight..

Seriously you will never know how it feels. My best friend committed suicide over self esteem weight related issues. She used to tell me how comforting food felt because it didn't judge her. And people who say mean things like this are the reason that society doesn't perpetuate kindness. 
-
 
Please teach me how to not feel anxious each time my boyfriend goes out clubbing without me? When he goes, I get very scared of something happening. Worse, something happening and him not telling me/me not finding out. Clubs in general seem to me like places people go to hook up, where attached people pretend they're single.

I know people will say to just "trust him". But he broke my trust once (though not girl-related) when he lied about something else.

 I recognize that this is a fault of mine. Please teach or advise me how not to feel this way? :( :(

Ah, all this talk about religion tempts me to post about my experience too.

I am a free thinker. My family are all free thinkers. My other relatives are free thinkers too. So I don't know much about religion. Since young, my family has been focusing on academics, so I have this mindset that things out there should be able to be explained by science or whatever. However, I also understand that we live in a multireligious society, so I learn to respect other religions too.

In fact, I have never been bugged by anyone regarding religion until I came to NUS. Previously, my friends will just go "ahhh" and respect that I have no religion, they do not try to force their religion on me. So I was taken aback when one day, this small group of girls claiming to be from dunno which society came up to me when I was waiting for my friend. They asked me if I know about Jesus, and I was like, "yeah sure, I heard from my friends before". Next, they sat down opposite me and started talking about how Jesus can save us, blah blah, all those usual talk which most of you should know by now. Being shy, I just nodded along and listened to them. But when they asked me to join their society, I politely apologised and told them that I don't plan on having a religion. One of the girls was like, "what?" and gave me a weird look. I told them that "if I wanted to have a religion, studying in an Anglican primary school would have converted me long ago". They were silent for a moment. Just then, my friend arrived and I excused myself. But when I was running to catch up with my friend, I heard one of the girls saying this:

"What the ****, she just totally wasted our time. Don't want then should have said earlier, *****."

Ok, I'm pretty sure Jesus will forgive you for saying that and send you to heaven. Meanwhile, I'll continue to believe that my body will just decompose under the ground after I die.

So to those who go around and spread the message, please watch your words and actions, you may indirectly ruin the "reputation" of your religion.

What do I do if I like an attached girl?I feel it's definitely wrong to meddle in a happy relationship but I can't seem to get over it especially because she's in my social circle and we talk and meet quite often.Its killing me inside someone help.... 
-
 
To  Hey there, I was sort of in the same situation as you before. I initiated the break because I didn't want him to waste anymore time on me. It hurt him of course but I didn't want to prolong the pain for him as it would get worse in the future. Right now, we are back as friends and we still go out with our other friends together occasionally. Initially, there was of course this silent period between us but it got better over time. I would say It's not really impossible or possible to be friends again. But I think right now the main issue is to settle the relationship rather than worrying about whether you guys could remain as friends. There were guys whom we completely lost contact after rejection even though we did say we hope to remain as friends. There's no sure answer to this so just let things take its own course. It's not easy to come to such a decision but do what you feel right. :)

i have a problem albeit not as important as the possibility of Donald Trump becoming a dictator in the world's history. The problem is I am pretty. It is quite embarrassing to praise oneself but it is the truth acknowledged by many friends and people so to those who are rolling their eyes, skip this confession please. Thank you. I think being pretty is a curse in disguise. Guys seem to be attracted to my looks and do not really try to get to know the me inside. In my past relationships, I feel like I am being treated like a trophy or a conquest. And it is sickening. I am tired of it. I am tired of attracting wrong attention. (I don't  wear skimpy clothes, not that kind of attention). And I don't know how to tell if a guy is simply attracted to my looks or my personality. I have been hurt like this more than once and this is making me scared of dating or giving chances to potential boyfriends. And this amounts to major trust issues which are not exactly helping me in relationships. And now I want to stop dating or just give up on finding love. I am just going to be a hermit and get CAP 5 next semester. I swear I am giving up on guys. Waste of my time and my brain cells.

Had you ever feeling afraid of asking for girls numbers because you are worried how others think of you in case you failed?

If the answer is yes, this post is for you.

Don't care about what others think of you. Why? Because others won't be thinking about you. Everyone has their own life. They won't be so free to be thinking about you all the time. If you don't believe me, try doing something strange in front of everyone and see do anyone care about you at all. They may speak about it once or twice but they will soon forget about it as they have their own life. If they don't, hat mean there is something wrong with them, not you.

So if you want to ask for girls' number, don't avoid asking them because you are worried about how others will think of you. Avoid asking because you know that asking for their number out of the blue will certainly get you rejected.

Does anyone ever search things like "how to tell if somebody is interested?"  I feel like a loser for not knowing if i am thinking too much

Dear Santa, 
All I want for christmas this year is for him to look at me, tell me he still love me and give me a kiss. I've never been secure in our relationship, never ever see myself in his eyes (maybe have, in the first month we met). I have never felt like his gf, probly I fit more as his good friend, his mother or his pet. I told him afew people say I am pretty recently. He just laugh it off. Making me feel like I'm not someone even worth looking at. 

Why are you still with me? I always ask myself this question. 

I have never believe in the existence of santa. But Santa, if you really exist, please help me.
-
 
You asked me why I insist on seeing you for the last time. I think you clearly know the answer. I want to see the smile and that pair of beautiful eyes I have fallen for for the last time. I wish to treasure and spend every remaining moment with you before you fly off to a new life. I know we can't be together because I will only drag you deeper into depression but she can bring you further in life. I hope, with all my heart, that she loves you more than I do and takes care of you more than I do. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the short moments we had and all the efforts to cheer each other on during the periods of depression. I don't know if I can ever meet someone who understands and cares for me like you did. I don't know if I can ever meet someone who gives me strength to climb to greater heights. I don't know if someone can ever light my path the way you did.

I just ask for one more hug and for me to say 'I love you'. As I turn back to the world of pitch black, I hope you fly to a place flooded with light and joy. I gave you every hope and dream I had; I hope they are not in vain. Goodbye, I hope you see this and remember that I always love you.

I now have three guys in my life. 

The first dude is the one I truly want. He is generous, ambitious and hardworking. I can see the potential in him though may not have the best start in life. However, I do feel his interest dwindling. He is no longer as affectionate as he used to be, though he still cares for me very much, and I could tell that he was willing to accommodate my requests whenever I sound out that could do better in some specific aspects. His drive is both a bane and boon to me. As much as I like his motivation, I would very much prefer that he spends more time with me like he did before. It hurts me greatly to see that I am not as important to him as I used to be. And I am very much aware that I am in no position to demand more than what he has been giving. 

Guy two on the other hand, is extremely sweet. He is very much unlike guy one in all aspects. He does not possess the drive to excel, even though he was given more to start off with. And unlike One's dwindling effort, Two has been nothing but nicer to me over time. I don't have any space left in my heart to even attempt to accommodate Two, for One has been taking up the space for a very long time now. 

And there's Three, who is just a little short of being an ass. I don't like him much He has been trying to get me to go to his place for while now. I have been tempted to accede to his request a few times now, and to nobody's surprise, One is usually the cause of the problem.

Is it true that for a Chinese Singaporean to marry at 20 or below is considered very young in Singapore context? I am 23 and when some of my westerner friends during my exchange ask if I am attached, I told them I am still evergreen and a virgin, they give me the unbelievable look. Btw, most of them are younger than me and some of them are already married and have kids.

Recently I am on a internship hosted by NUS... So there is this cute little girl that caught my eye. Let's call her F. She is not very pretty and I suppose she is not a local.(because of her accent) She has certain special dietary preferences. The fact that she only eats veggies and fish(and yes ONLY fish) is so amusing. It is such a coincidence that she just lives a few streets away from me, but I do not have the courage to ask for her accompany back after work. Can someone advice me how to approach her? I don't want to appear creepy but whenever I see her, I'll imagine her as a gigantic fish and I am so in love with that thought! I want to be her worm so that I can be inside her. Could someone advise me on how I should go about making a move and to make her notice me?

I just found out that my father was having a fling. My sister and I are in complete shock. The best part is that my parents are unaware that we both know about this. I feel so sorry for my mum. But I know she's being strong for the both of us. I can't believe what he did. Where was his common sense? You don't do this to your family. I just don't know how to face him anymore. He's behaving as if nothing happened cause he thinks we have no idea as to what happened. But I do! And every time I look at him I'm just filled with hate and anger. My mother isn't going to leave him. That's for sure. How am I going to stay in the same house as him? Face him everyday? I can't pretend. But I know I have to for my mum. I feel lost.

A month ago, an incident happened at work that made me realise I cannot stay at the company any further. Now i find myself dreading work and dragging myself out of my bed every morning.

do guys ever make a mistake asking for a girl's no.? what does it mean when a guy who asked to exchange contacts stops texting you?
-
 
I'm an evergreen girl; introverted and hates texting. No wonder why when I first started talking to him, I'd carelessly think each time - the conversation is about to end soon. But it never did. We've been talking every day, we go out for meals and we spend time together. It's been about 4 months or so now. But every time I try to hint or flirt with him, he pretends he doesn't understand. If I send him a virtual hug, he ignores it; if I say we should watch that movie together, he skips over that message. 

I don't really understand what's going on - have I been foolish and simply over-thinking our relationship? Am I just a friend he enjoys talking to? Or is he just playing around with me? I'm just so confused...

Today I happened to meet my friend's (who is of the same age as me) grandparents when I am at his house and gosh his grandparents are only 7 years older than my parents.

I went on a dinner date with a girl a few days ago, mainly to get to know her better as prior to that we only talked a couple of times. To be honest i was kinda surprised she even said yes to the date in the first place. So during dinner i got to know her a bit better, her likes, dislikes, hobbies, you know the usual stuff. 

The only problem was that she was really quiet, especially at the initial part of dinner where there were a few awkward silences between us. I was the one asking all the questions and doing all the talking and sometimes ran out of things to say or ask (i'm not the most talkative of persons either). To be honest i was got a little irritated since the conversation was 90% of the time one way traffic. But at least as the night went on she started to open up a little more and I could tell she was having a good time (I asked twice whether she was in any rush to get home or had any curfew and she said no). 

Have any of you guys dated such a girl before, whereby she was really quiet and shy? How do i get such a girl to open up more to me? Are there things i should or should not do for future dates? I really like her due to her character and looks, although i must admit her shyness and introvertness (?) are rather extreme.

It takes courage to ask a girl on a date, rejection is just part and parcel of life. Choose to face it and it will make a person stronger, choose to deny it and it will make a person weaker.  You don't only have one shot, instead you have multiple shots.

this is a reply to I suggest you sit down during the holidays and think about what you really want. I am in your situation currently and what i can tell you is that you might hurt both your boyfriend and your best friend in the end and you end up being unhappy as well. I would suggest that you treasure your boyfriend and not compare him your best friend, he is a best friend for a reason and eventually what i can tell you is that- there are not platonic friendships. Wish you all the happiness in whatever you do and make the correct decisions.

You think that toying with a guy's feeling is funny right? Remember, karma is a bitch and it's coming pretty soon =) . Continue to share your chat history with your friend and laugh okay? I'm just gonna grab my pop corns  and watch your tragedies unfold one by one. Now i know why you have a weak immune system and sad life. A player like you deserves no sympathy at all. Haha Bon Voyage!

That's was about 4 years back when we start to meet ... I remember we met on the 13th December 2011. Erm... This man (J) look so fierce , he was the one who interview me for my new job. But after knowing him , he was nice and though he always make me cry. Till a day , out of a sudden, Mr O asked me :" hey, (J) ask you do you like him ?" I answered yes as a friend. That's was such a nonsense. Can I say I like him when he already have a gf before we met ? He was sad , I can see his disappointment from his eyes. On the May 2012, he getting marry , we celebrated for him at k box. One of best friend tell him that I'm in love with him. ( I only got to know 3 years later.) After he was back from his honeymoon, I quit the job , try not to make myself fall.  2 years ago. He called me , asking me to go back work. I agreed as I thought the feelings must be go though I missed him for past 2 years (inside my heart which I only told 1 of my best friend). After I go back work , I tried to keep a distance with him. On the November 11 , he confessed to me and he told me if that time my answer is firm , we will not be in this situation. I decided to stay with him though he is married, because I love him and I know he loved me though we only last for 8 months cause we know if we continue we will hurt a lot of people. One day, we met again. He hugged me and kissed me, I know we are still love but to hurt his family and my family . We must choose to give up. But I really in pain cause ever since we break off or even when we know we should end. I can only sleep after crying every night and he look bad too when I last saw him. I can tell his eyes filled with desired and sadness.

 I would think that you should stick with your boyfriend. 

Not sure if your situation is the same as mine, but it is precisely because of the fact that I have a female version of me, that I understand, 

that there are principles and lines that we do not cross, 
that we respect, 
no matter how alike we are, no matter how many times others actually mistake us as a couple just from us standing next to each other.

I would not want to see my best friend break up and be miserable, just to be with me. I would not be happy,because of the fallout.

Observe your boyfriend more, pay more attention to him, because right now, it seems to me that you might be taking him a bit for granted, by shifting your focus onto your best friend instead.

From a person who is a best friend.

Do guys generally land a verdict in the beginning on whether they will like a girl or not, or is it possible for their feelings to develop over time as they spend more time together (even if he mentioned before that he will never like the girl)?

She is my first love in Uni and we are pretty good friends although we knew each other for a short time only. We are both pretty introverted but we got along just fine. I was rejected by her when she said she hope we could remain friend. After a month of mostly silence, we have begun texting each other again. I really like her and did not want to give up just yet. I am evergreen and I was not really interested in dating during sec/JC. I am happy being alone with my video games and friends.

All my friends advise me to let go because she has already rejected me. I am really trying to love her as a friend because I feel that we can really connect and I do not want to lose her. But still, I treat her better than a normal friend as I will try to initiate conversation with her. I might be naive and stupid to get myself hurt again at the end of the day. This is my first love and I do not know whether I am making the correct decision. I told myself I would leave if the pain becomes too unbearable for me in the future. Right now, I still feel that I am able to cope with the emotional up and down. 

I always feel bad because I felt that I am sticking around so that one day she might change her mind. When she rejected me, she barely knew me for few months but I was so in love with her because we click so easily. Even at this age, I found it hard to process these complex emotions. How do secondary school kids do it these days?

Procrastination. Sometimes i feel like hurting myself to get out of work. If i am hospitalized, they can blame me for not finishing my work.

isit true that easier conquests by the guys when chasing the girls makes them not cherish them as much later in the relationship? Feeling so this way... since me and my bf got tgt less than a month of knowing each other..

Hi guys, I was wondering what does it actually mean when your boyfriend is no longer eager to have sex with you? Or he's no longer into making out. Does it mean that he isn't sexually attracted to his gf anymore? 
-
 
I have a boyfriend but my best friend might be the one for me. My boyfriend and I don't have much chemistry although he's sweet to me. But there are a lot of compatibility issues that are hard to overcome and he doesn't seem aware of them. My best friend and I are in sync on so many levels- we think alike, share the same views, can have long intellectual conversations and share laughs but I'm not attracted to him physically. I love him as a friend but he likes me more than that I know. I don't know if I should stick with my boyfriend or be with my friend. Maybe it's just better to be alone. 
-
 
Just a question: Is it normal or does it mean anything when your partner bites you during woo-hoo session? My girlfriend seems to love it. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how should I feel about it. I'm a human, not a piece of meat. 
-
 
What does it mean when he says he needs a break from a guy's perspective? It was entirely my fault due to my huge insecurities. But i've been working on it after i realised how i've lost myself during the course of the relationship. 

A break's kinda a grey area. Does this mean it's a free pass for him to explore his options? Can i initiate a casual convo with him or? I just wanna take it slow and not cut off communication entirely. 
-
 
I want to get to know you better but I'm not sure if you'll like who I really am...inside and out. I wish we could take these feelings between us and fast forward to a time when I know I'm good enough for you...because I don't wanna lose you. I'm sorry
-
 
I met the boy of my dreams a while back and our relationship couldn't be better. The only thing keeping us back from progressing to the next stage are my parents. They don't know about him but I know they will never accept him because he's from a different religion and culture. In their minds, we would never be able to last because of vast cultural differences. However, we can envision spending the rest of our lives together, easy. I hope in the end they can find it in their hearts to accept him.

So I was rejected by a girl. (Basically I was friendzoned) I can still see her during some classes for one more semester. Should I work harder to attract her or should I avoid her as much as possible? There will be opportunities for me to talk to her but I can choose not to if I want. I don't think I stand a chance to be with her considering how deep I'm in the friendzone but at the same time I find it really hard to let go of this chance. (Even if it's a 1% chance)

How do you know whether a guy likes a girl or he is just the friendly type that treats everyone similarly?

We were primary school acquaintances. I knew there was something special about him when i first saw him. 3 years ago, we had a chance encounter at an event. As we lived near each other, we would walk home together from the train station before parting ways. On one occasion, we were confiding in one another when he started to throw himself on me. Shocked, I chided him abit and quickly walked away. We never met again.

2 months ago, we bumped into one another again and started chatting  through text. We caught up and i found out he was seeing someone on the side. He started seducing and getting intimate. I told him I was saving myself for marriage; besides, he wasn't going to break up with her. I walked away again.

A week after that on a Sunday, I let him over when no one was home. I was so infatuated i didn't know what i was thinking. I just wanted to be with him.

He walked out just before we did the deed. He messaged me once after that day, saying how he should have done me. I have never felt so dirty and violated in my life, and i will never be the same again.

P.S. I don't know what to do if he ever comes back.

I was an exchange student at NUS one year ago, and during my stay I really came to like Singaporean girls, which is something that I did not expect to happen. My home country is in Scandinavia, so there is an amble supply of very beautiful Nordic girls here, and as such I never really appreciated the beauty of girls in Singapore before I came (yes I am ang moh..). 

I liked this one girl in particular, and I saw her on a regular basis one time a week as we had mutual Singaporean friends and hung out often. She was very chio bu with excellent taste, and we talked really well together, although I felt like she was very shy (something that is true for many Asian girls I think).
I tried giving her compliments, with a wink of the eye, flirting, humour and the whole lot, and I'm sure she picked up on my desire to take it a step further - but she remained neutral, neither dismissing or accepting as more than a friend. 

Now, don't get me wrong - although I was on exchange, my motives were not purely sexual (but I was of cause physically very attracted to her looks and personality). I was ready to work something out for the right girl - maybe I could complete my master degree in NUS, maybe she could move to my country, who knows? I was genuinely interested in a relationship. 

I know Singaporean girls don't sleep as much around (compared to the much more liberated Europe I'm used to), but I still felt very frustrated that local girls did not pick much up on my signals. 

I am by no means and unattractive guy, and I have no problem with the ladies back home. I'm told I'm funny, intelligent and caring. I should think Singaporean girls would admire the same qualities, or am I completely wrong? 

Why was so unsuccessful with 'local' girls, can you guys help me? I am considering going back to Singapore to write my Ph.D., but I'm afraid it will be a very lonely time for me. :-)

What's with all the confessions talking about ppls longing for a person who made a choice to walk away from you? 

Like obviously they no longer want to be part of your life anymore so stop spending your own time and energy on thinking about those people. 

Yea I know it's hard but come on guys/ girls, have some self respect and self value. You guys are worth so much more than that. 
Let it go, love yourself and don't let them occupy your heart and mind anymore. They left. They are gone and they will not return. 
Turn the page, Build a bridge, the analogies goes on and on. 

Stop making yourself anymore worthless than you are already are. 
Sorry for the blunt words, but someone got to say it and I'll be the bad guy here who will knock this truth into everyone's head.

You survived years living by yourself without that person so you can definitely get yourself back up. 
Stop hoping and start living for yourself.

Thanks I'm out.

I came across a post yesterday regarding overly attached girlfriends. Although OP sounds a bit crazy in terms of the way she phrased her opinions, I got quite disgusted when I saw a comment left by a reader. She claimed that women like the OP are those whom are jealous of other women who have boyfriends.  Is that a fair comment to make? So, women who don't behave like overly attached girlfriends do not want to be in that relationship as much? Or independent women who make such comments are automatically deemed as being jealous when they share their opinions like OP did? There was nothing wrong with what the OP mentioned. This is coming from personal experience. Being overly attached to someone felt great at first. It felt like something I had to do as a partner- which meant devoting most of my time to him, cancelling plans with everyone else etc. But when it was all over, I felt so lonely. I never realised that I lost so many friends in that process cause I was so blinded. Even when they gave me advice, I would think they were jealous or had nothing better to do than to comment on my relationship. Sharing passwords was the worst thing we did. It made me paranoid and suspicious every time. I just wasn't myself anymore. I lost friends, friends that I was extremely close to. So like OP mentioned, don't be that kind of a girlfriend. It doesn't show how much you want to be in the relationship at all. Don't lose yourself in the process.  All I'm trying to say is that in a relationship you do need personal space. Otherwise you're both gonna suffocate.

I met my current bf who is also in NUS via a dating app earlier this year. We started chatting a lot and got into a relationship very quickly. However, I made a mistake and cheated on him with a guy whom I slept with before I met my bf ( I didn't do it on purpose). Afterwards, I felt regretful and I confessed to him. Even though he was really enraged, he forgave me and we continue to be tgt. But I started realising that he doesn't seem to be as sweet anymore. We are currently more than 6 months into the rs now but I am starting to feel that we drifted. I am not sure if we should continue anymore as I felt that he doesn't love me that much as compared to before, maybe due to me being too insecure and overly attached... however he wasn't really an expressive bf since the start. He doesn't really show his affections. Or maybe, he hasn't really forgive me for cheating on him. What should I do now?

Never thought that I would be caught in this predicament.. Oh well here is how it all started.... 

5 years ago, we first met in that restaurant. I remember that shy innocence on your face. Both of us were exchanging glances and secretly smiling at each other. As time passed by, we frequented that restaurant more often and became more acquainted and I plucked up courage and walked towards you, asking for your number. That marked the start of our 5-year relationship.....

4 years ago, I got enlisted into National Service. You were always there for me, never lamenting about the fact that I couldn't be there for you due to my busy schedule in the army. On weekends, you would be there at the MRT station, waiting for me with that cute smile. Whenever I am feeling down, you were always there to encourage me , giving me that ultimate strength to persevere and push through those tough 2 years. While the rest of my army buddies have failed the test of patience with their SOs, our relationship on the contrary, has grown stronger. 

2 years ago, on the very day of ORD, I felt liberated as I could finally spend more quality time with you. On that very day, we decided to buy a pet dog, called it Tracy. I remember vividly that this pet was a representation of our deep love and sacrifice for each other. We would go jogging in the park with Tracy, never leaving her out in any occasions. Whenever either of us went overseas and couldn't  be there for each other, we would confide in Tracy whenever we missed each other. Tracy has become a part of our life. 

10 months ago, you had to go for your overseas Community Involvement Programme. I remembered sending you off at the airport with that goodbye kiss, along with Tracy's tail wag, as though she knew we hard to part for some time. Thereafter, we would still be constantly texting each other despite the absence from each other.

As the days passed by,  the number of replies from you has declined. Well, I could fully understand that because you had to be on standby anytime for emergency situations. I began confiding in Tracy, our love representation. Despite not knowing whether she understood human language, I still talked to her as though I was talking to you, sharing with her my woes, like a best friend.

2 weeks ago.... I made a terrible mistake. A mistake of my life that is quite unforgivable. That late night, I returned home in a half-drunk state after drinking with my friends. As I opened the door, I saw you, lying on bed in that sexy gown. At that moment, I knew you had returned for me and wanted to give me a surprise, after having parted for 10 months. I began taking off my clothes and caressing you all over along with kisses.

The following morning, I had the greatest shock of my life, and felt as though the world was collapsing before my eyes. You weren't in my arms. I kept rubbing my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing wrong.... but I wasn't... What I was holding had a pair of doggy eyes staring at me, letting out a soft gentle bark.... I knew it was GG.com.

To the guy who was at SOC anniversary dinner in a dark shirt (siting at the somewhere in the middle). I regret not starting a conversation with you although I really really wanted to. You're really cute and probably didn't notice me cus Mr Popz was always surrounded by groups of friends. Really hope that we can become friends though.

Most of the Tinder profiles I have come across contains the disclaimer, "Not looking for hook ups".

The million dollar question is where can I find women who like hook ups?
-
 
I give up. I think I will never find a soulmate. To all those who will say be patient etc well I have waited long enough. I am a girl by the way. Maybe my looks are a turn off. Maybe I am the designated ugly girl in the group. I joined tinder and other dating apps and have yet to receive a reply from anyone and its been weeks. (i have been swiping right btw) I guess I am just meant to be single for life :(

Hi op of  here. Just wanted to thank all of you for your kind words of affirmation. Especially thank you to  for your encouragement! Means a lot and i am so glad to hear you're doing well now! Don't worry. Professionals are involved and yes. Me too. Actively seeking. 

Right now, I see my partner getting better day by day and it really warms my heart. When he texted me a lame joke i choked and teared up. It meant he was getting better. Funny how little things i took for granted mean a whole lot more now. I know the battle is not over just yet but it's the little things that encourage me to fight strongly and boldly by his side as he battles his inner demons.

You have prove once again that you are not a man who honour your words. 

During our last meeting, you were the one who suggest that we remain friends on fb. But after finding yourself another gf, you deleted me from your list.

It's fine with me. Just that I feel you are a heartless person. I have always been giving you face as a man. I let you initiate our breakup. So what did I do to warrant a treatment like this?

Although I feel it's unfair to me, I would still like to thank you for deleting me. I don't want to see your gf posting photos of both of you so diligently on your profile. I don't want to be reminded that you ever existed in my life with your occasional posts.

I just hope you could delete the post that dated 18/8. I could still see it. Aren't you scared that others may see it too?

I've been wanting to write about this for awhile and since it's finally the end of the semester, I have decided to. It's a cliche story but please don't criticize me too much because I just want to get things off my chest.

I reside in a RC and there's this girl that caught my eye early on in the semester. And as much as I would have loved to talk to her and all, I only managed to once. All other times she was always surrounded by other guys and when by herself, I was just afraid to approach her because she just emits a very 'cool' vibe. Not to say that she's unapproachable because I know she has many friends, and my other friends who know her have said she's very friendly and silly which I think is adorable. I don't know what it is, but she's just very unique and she's not like any other girl. During the start of the sem, I would always see her with this one guy so I didn't set my hopes too high and just admired from a distance, but halfway through the sem it seemed as if something happen because she and the other dude just stopped hanging out (i used to always see them together but then i started seeing her with another guy, and the guy with another girl so i figured they must've had some issue or something). 

Just when I thought the time was ripe to try and approach this girl and perhaps get her number, another guy comes into the picture and now i see her with guy  all the time. Now I know you guys might think she's a player or something, but interestingly she's only ever dated once before uni (yes, i did do my stalking...) I tried really hard to rid her of my mind because there was obviously no chance of getting her - she was simply out of my league. She's hot and pretty at the same time and has so many guy friends around. Now finally, the guy  comes into the picture and to make things worse, he's a year 2 and he's really 'cool' as well. How am I supposed to compete with that?

At first, I thought they were only just close friends, how she is with guy  and guy , but just before the semester ended, I saw guy  hug her and then kiss her while they were studying together. After that I started seeing them everywhere together. Even though my heart should have been broken right there and then, my feelings for her are only stronger and yet I can't do anything. How I wish i could be the one in guy 's position, i wish i could be the one making her laugh and making her smile the way she does with him. 

But now i can only put everything on hiatus, and wait for next semester. There has to be a way to break them apart and for me to get the girl that I've lusted and pined for for so long. I know this is wrong of me but I'm really going crazy, I don't know what to do when all I think of is finding some way to make her mine. even though it all might never ever become a reality, i still fantasize and i hate myself for doing that. this girl probably can't even remember my name but yet i am stalking her on social media and trying to memorize how her smile looks.

Just got to know this girl from a dating app. Since I only know her quite recently and I am probably one of the many guys that go out with her so I do not want to take it too seriously. Can anyone suggest a suitable and not so expensive place for a date?

I don't understand why my posts using lyrics to explain my sadness keep on getting rejected. Even my previous post about getting rejected got rejected.

To the op of 
Yes, I know I am probably right. You have not been seriously in love with me all along. Distant means no contact but why suddenly delete me from your list? You have found yourself someone new, so who believe in you saying you missed the old times? You are always contradicting yourself, don't you think?

And so, his wedding happened on Sunday, 2 days ago. 
I love him too, but I wasn't the bride...

But, one week before the wedding, he brought me to bkk for a week to celebrate my birthday with me. 
The night before the wedding, he rushed through his preparations just so that he could come over to find me. He said he wanted to fulfill my wish. But we had a fight over something stupid. He told me to leave him alone, and for the first time, I turned my back and walked away from him. But he did not walk away, instead, he followed behind me...
Ten minutes before his solemnization ceremony, he called to tell me that he will miss me a lot. I broke down immediately. 
That evening after his ceremony at the hotel, he came down to meet me again, leaving his wife alone in the room. He gave me a big hug and a kiss.. I broke down again... He returned the angbao that I gave to him through a friend, he said that it makes him angry that I gave him my blessings... 
The next evening after his wedding, we met again. He insisted on buying me a new phone (because mine wasn't working well)...

He is not rich. 

To the guys out here, what does this really mean? He does love me, right? Or am I deluding myself??? He refuses to explicitly say that he loves me. But all his actions point to the fact that he does. 
But, why did he still marry her? 
-
 
Is there such a thing called platonic friendship? At least for a guy's perspective. My girl friends deny all existence of it but my guy friends believed it exist.

I'm unsure of my feelings for my guy Best Friend. How can I find out what do I really feel? What do I have to do?
-
 
Need some advice here. I've known this girl for several months now. We dated a few times, hung out together and the usual stuff. I'm planning to confess to her soon, maybe this week or the next. 

Problem is I'm not yet at that stage where i can do whatever i like in front of her. I still have to check myself, making sure i'm doing all the gentlemanly stuff when she's around. I'm talking about those best friends you have where you can really do whatever you want in front of them and they won't really give a shit cos they know you inside out. 

So to all the couples out there who have been together for years, will this initial stage pass where we can eventually be more open to each other? Like for example farting into her face and stuff like that (just an example lol) and she wouldn't mind at all? Hope you all understand what i mean cos it's a little hard to put it in words. Appreciate any advice and thanks for reading!

I've been hurt in my previous relationship that lasted more than a year. I realised my then-boyfriend didn't love me the whole time but neither of us initiated a break up. I hung on to him but he hurt me (emotionally and verbally) in the end and eventually we drifted apart. Now, I have an amazing boyfriend and we've been together for 6 months. He is great and I have every reason to trust him, but sometimes I just get so afraid that he'll hurt me although I know he won't. He's not a rebound or anything, I was single for almost a year before finding him. Is this relationship anxiety/insecurity? How do I get over it? I have fallen so hard in love without knowing it and I'm so afraid at the same time... My boyfriend has done all he can to try and convince me that he won't hurt me, but the negative thoughts and feelings keep coming :(
-
 
I used to feel somewhat close to a particular group of friends, but they have a habit of making plans spontaneously. It is difficult for me to roll along with this because of various commitments including studies and work. Over time I started to feel excluded and eventually I drifted completely apart from them.

Is it the new in thing to keep the evening free for one's best friends, "just in case we decide to meet for dinner"? I notice my younger sibling's circle of friends operates in this manner as well, and it becomes quite difficult to plan family outings or even meals together because of some misplaced priorities.

The recent whispers about standing by your significant other when they’re going through depression reminds me of my ex-girlfriend. We were together for four years. From the start, I knew she had depression. She told me about it. I stood by her side at the time.

But a year ago, I broke up with her. I couldn’t deal with all of it anymore. My own sanity was at stake. I told her to get help; she refused. She said she’s tried, but it didn’t work. I argued that that wasn’t a reason to give up on other treatments. I told her, time and again, that there was only so little I could do to make her feel better. We stayed for a couple more months; eventually though, I got myself out of the relationship. I couldn’t deal with her shit anymore. I lost all respect for her when she refused to take responsibility for her own mental well-being.

As much as this is will make me to be an asshole, I never, ever want to deal with someone who’s mentally ill.

After much effort, finally got a few replies from you. shall think of more ideas to get more of your attention. Any pros got tips to share?

To op of  
I miss you too. 
My friend asked me whether I still have feelings for you. 
I said I got over you. 
And I thought I truly did, but as I went through my drawer today and saw the gift you got me two years ago, my heart suddenly clenched and twisted within my rib cage 

I still like you. 
Your absence has left a large gap in my life. Sure it is slowly being filled up but it still hurts once in a while. 

I'm saying all of this not because I want to be with you. I don't, because I know you and I can never be romantically linked. 
And that's okay. Even though I like you, I will not act upon my temporary physical desire to hug you or kiss you because I know you are incapable of loving someone. I know, I understand.
 
The connection we had was special and let's just keep this beautiful memory of ours untainted from animosity and hatred. 
Therefore I will not go back to being friends with you after my confession. Because we can't be friends anymore, You did not do anything wrong. I can't expect everyone to like me so I don't blame you. But I am incapable of rekindling our friendship.  

I still like you and you will be missed, but that's it. 

That is all.

After being rejected as a guy, has it ever paid off being persistent with the chase? I am not saying stalkerish behavior but rather on and off conversations of asking her out. RL experiences would be awesome.

Some women can be termed as being 'overly attached girlfriends'. And by that term, you can already assume that isn't a good thing. Oh and men can definitely be overly attached boyfriends too. But I'm a woman and I would like to share some advice to my fellow sisters. Please have respect for yourself, and stop behaving like a psycho! It's great that you show love to your respective partners! I mean why stop exerting effort altogether once you're in a relationship right? I get that. BUT there's a fine line that separates you from being incredibly sweet to being a needy and clingy girlfriend.

These are the signs of being an 'overly attached girlfriend'

1) You always want to talk to him for hours and hours even after you just saw him.

2) You hate it when he needs to be with the bros- Cause you think you're the only friend he needs in his life? LOL NO! 

3) You demand to join when he'a hanging out with his friends- Because you should be close to his friends too? Sigh

4) You get super jealous when you see a girl talking to him or commenting in his posts online- Your thought process when going through your boyfriends feed. What does 'hehe' mean? Why is that 'hehe' there? You're practically going crazy imo. 

5) You LOVE playing damasel in distress- Girl are you fo real tho? 

6) You ditch your appointments with anyone and everyone once he calls and makes plans with you. 

7) You ALWAYS demand for time and attention

8) You are ALWAYS suspicious- You need to check his phone, demand for online passwords. 

9) You think you love him more than he loves you- Is your relationship a competition? 

10) EVERY single plan you have involves him. You need to get a life, one in which your world does not revolve around HIM! 

So if you feel that you can identify with these signs, it's high time you start to change. Like I said earlier, where's your self respect? Where's your TRUST in this relationship? Why be in this relationship if you don't have trust? These signs just scream insecurity in the relationship! Aren't you tired of behaving like a possessive girlfriend? I'm getting tired just by reading the signs! This is NOT love. I've seen tumblr posts of praising women who are the jealous type and the 'my boyfriend is mine mine mine!!' attitude. This isn't CUTE. You look PLAIN STUPID. Please just stop this awful behaviour now and GROW UP. Learn how to trust your partner. If you can't, tell me why are you in this relationship again? I'd really like to know. And to women who are currently not in a relationship, please do not behave this way.

Hi guys,are u all willing to accept ur current girlfriend/boyfriend talking to their ex? It's been six months since we started going out together. However,whenever I am out with her,her phone will buzz non-stop and I know that the message is from her ex. To make matters worse,she told she hasn't move on from the past,tell me what should I do
-
 
Yes, you're probably right. I know and so I have been distant. But I do miss the times when we used to talk about everything under the sun... 
-
 
 You must be describing my girlfriend. I'm sorry if she is causing you distress. I promise I will take good care of her.
-
 
My boyfriend broke up with me. On a very rash minor decision. Our relationship was short lived. I am not contacting him now or at least a month. I am not sure he is completely compatible with me. But I want him back because I think we can really work those issues easily. Do you guys think I have a chance? 
-
 
Hey guys, I need advice...

Is it normal for your biological sister to suggest having sex and then laughing it off as if it were a joke? She keeps hinting and mentioning it and I don't know what to do, how to react. I don't think I would mind it because I am evergreen, so I could gain experience, but if I have misinterpreted it, it would be really awkward now. I don't know if it's all in my head.

How??
-
 
So guys, I just came back from a camp and I think i have a crush on one of my group's member. I feel like she is very kind and friendly but I think it is kind of hard for me to approach her since we are not in the same cca and we are not even in the same course. Sigh~
-
 
To 13564: Before you read this, please don't judge me... I'm just sharing my story because I saw your post about your sister being sexually suggestive.

First of all, - just for some background: My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's screwed up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so damn beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to f*** her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.

Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was screwed up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.

But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.

My boyfriend just told me he started watching girls on webcam. I never had an issue with porn, weve always been very open and watch it together... but webcam shows.... its such a different story. He can actually interact with them, and the fact that its "live broadcast" makes it so much more personal and intimate...
The worst part is that I cant even explain why it upsets me so much???
Do guys ever fall for girls on webcam??? Am i overthinking???

I am another highly introverted, socially awkward person who prefer to stay at home most of the time. The only time when I m out of my house is when I have to go campus for lab class, project meetings ( cos I cant hold back my group mates as it is very unfair for them ), mid terms or exams or have some very urgent stuff to settle. If not for my degree, I will have just stay at home most of my time. I am just someone who likes to be alone and needless to say, I don't have any friends. I just feel very comfortable being alone. My parents have always express worry that I remain single cos no girls will like someone like me or how am I going to work in future. I am not too sure why but I started becoming very reclusive after my NS. I have started wondering if I am suffering from any mental condition or is it just a habit of preferring to stay alone. I do feel that I have to do something to my life but I really do not know how I can start. I have been like this for 2 years and I know it is very hard to change now but I am still optimistic that I can be the same exact person as I am in the past, living a normal life. Can anyone advise me on how I can start changing myself?

Firstly I need to say that fb doesn't lie. Even if you have deleted some posts from your timeline, they do appear in searches. You and your ex met in 2010 and were in a relationship since then. But in the midst, both of you separated and then gotten together again in 2013. You were declaring that you were in a relationship (openly) with her on 25 June 2013. I could picture what happened on that day. But your happiness was short lived cos you separated with her in October the same year. When we first met, you told me you haven't been in a relationship for 5 years. I kept on asking you how you had been through these 5 years without a gf, and you told me work has been your harbour. But apparently this is a lie!

Another lie is: your relationship status with me on fb was set private (which I only found out now)! You didn't have the courage to tell the world that I am your gf! Considering the fact that you seemed so eager to post that status then, I feel that you are being so untruthful! 

Also a few weeks before we separated, you became fb friends with your current gf (who somehow unfriend you previously). She has been your secondary, ploy and uni friend all along! Then merely a month after we separated you have gotten together with her! I feel I am just a (3 months) prelude to your love life which is just starting right now. CONGRATULATIONS!

Anything that comes before "but" is usually ignored. "I'm sorry, but..." "You're nice/handsome, but..." "This is great, but..."
-
 
remind me never again to ask for friendly help/advice on here. why do some people see it necessary to make sarcastic/unfriendly comments. if you have nothing nice to say why say anything at all? why the need to be so mean or nasty? i don't care if i sound naive. i would never post anything that could potentially hurt people's feeling and i will never understand the people that do it.

one comment can make a difference. it can make a good day into a horrible day but it can go the other way too. Props to all those out there who never post a mean thing.

what the heck is this, im seeing friends getting married and here i am digging a cave in minecraft

I've just spent the whole week after my finals to clear up my facebook profile, deleting posts, removing tags and unfriending people.
I cringed every time I saw a '1 like =1 respect" and ranting posts I've made over the past 6 years. I have no idea why did I put myself over this psychological torture. Revisiting my profile, I realised I used to have a lot friends who were supportive of me during an important phase of my academic life, as well as some friends who used to post on my wall every now and then, but grew stranger as years past us. 

It's so weird to see people who used to tag you on every little silly trips to the malls and cinemas, became strangers that we wouldn't greet on the streets. And some ex-dearest friends have become people that I will try my best to avoid. I also have no idea why was I so angsty when I was younger. 

And now I am filtering my friend-list which I discover new 'friends' that I have no idea who were they. (who the fuck is nicholas?)

Social media is a weird time machine that lets me revisit my feelings in the past and try to re-evaluate the meanings behind my relationships, events and posts. Feel so weird and at a loss now.

While playing with my little nephews, I finally couldn't bottle up my feelings anymore. It was really embarrassing for me to cry in front of them.  

Shu Shu( uncle) , why you cry?

me: shu shu remembered an important jie jie.

Is she your girl girl? Why she make shu shu sad? She is bad girl!

me: No! She is a precious person in shu shu's life. But shu shu didn't treasure her. When you all grow up, don't be like shu shu! I only know how to say nasty stuffs to jie jie and made her cried.

She don't friend you le?

me: Umm. She probably will never talk to shu shu anymore.

I know! I know! Shu shu must pray to the night stars and jie jie will definitely come back.

Later on in the night, I prayed to the night stars. However, I prayed that you will live on happily and healthy. I have absolutely no rights to expect you to forgive me and no rights.....to love you anymore.

 it's better to spend your 21st alone, than with the wrong person. 

I spent my 21st with my then-boyfriend, who didn't love me, who made me feel guilty for "making" him spend the day with me and made me cry on my 21st birthday.

You're better off alone than with the wrong person :)

Being a partner for someone with depression is crazily tough. 

He has been having a relapse lately and all my spare time is spent worrying about him and doing my best to do my part in caring for him. Worst part is nobody understands it. People assume he is doing this on purpose to hurt me. No. He wouldnt hurt me like this if he could help it. He has never ever done anything to hurt me unless he is in relapse. 

People think i got myself into this situation and thus i deserve no pity. I dont want any pity. I need support. I need care. I just need people to understand and see him for the amazing person he is who is just battling this illness right now. I need someone to tell me this is temporary. He will get better with time and he will go back to be the amazing guy i fell in love with. I dont need people telling me to leave.

It has been 2 months plus since the mrt doors close, when i last saw you. 

I am still not used to this silence. I cant sleep without your GoodNights, i cant get out of bed without your GoodMornings. 

I miss you, thorns and all. 

I wish you happiness.

Today, I have just attended a wedding. It keep me up late thinking about stuff. Is relationship and marriage a happy thing? My point of view has always been relationship is tiedious and human can survive alone. Until i saw how genuinely in love the couple at the wedding is, I always thought love is only a mystical belief two people believe in. The moment they stop believing in that belief, they break. But today, I just realise how beautiful love can be. Is it too late to change my life goal of singlehood for life?
-
 
Dear OP of , i am someone that came out of depression due to the love and care of my boyfriend. During that time, i cried every now and then for no apparent reason and I feel horrible everyday. It was my boyfriend who encourages me all along and assuring me that everything is fine that made me walk out of depression. So what I want to tell you is that it IS temporarily and hang in there girl! (: Gambatte! 

Cheers!

I'm sick of being the nice girl. Being nice is a weakness. A weakness that people around you will take advantage of, regardless of their intentions. Including your good friends. Or whom you thought were your 'good friends'. But I'll just like you to know that when people like me see your true colors, yes we'll be miserable for a while. But ultimately you will suffer. And that's only cause karma's a bitch and you'll regret that you ever used a true friend like me. You're both going to be 22 soon. Time to grow up don't you think? You can't keep using people forever now can you?

Once upon a time, there was a girl who liked a guy and his laughter was a question she wanted to spend her life answering. He was cute , smart,funny, and has his own legion of followers. They could spend hours talking about anything under the moon. But with each moment passing, she hasn't a clue if she's really the one meant to find the answer .

I wish I was anorexic or suffering from some disease that could make me lose weight fast. I'm trying so hard, running and excercsising but at the end of the day I binge when I think about what a big loser I am. It's really painful. I'm tired of this. Sometimes I wish I had enough courage to just take the plunge.

I know I'm slow but I recently got into Game of Thrones and can I say how heart-wrenching it is!!!! I don't think I can continue watching the characters die one after another...

I am tired of guessing. So sometimes you are over possessive, yet sometimes you just ignore me. Tell me what you really want will you?

Just found out my friend who was rejected countless time by his gf continuously chased her for two years before getting together. Now they are getting married. Total respect I can't fathom how he deal with his own feelings over the years man. 

This sucks now I am thinking about the girl that rejected me 2 months ago. We clicked so easily why won't she just say yes:(((. Fucking hate love. Wish I could have a TED bear.

met a guy on one of the dating apps and was out with him on a date.  We were using his phone to search something and suddenly, a notification from the dating app popped up that someone like him from x km away. We both saw the notification as both of us were peering at his phones while i was typing in the google search. Now i have mixed feelings. partially i know that we arent officially together so he can cast his net, but at the same time, i feel very sad. Like now i cant tell if he is being true to me or just plain bored and want someone to hang out with. i am trying really hard not to fall too hard for him just in case we didn't get together in the end. Just needed a place to rant.

Had a chat in the hostel with my roomie late one night. Got up and took a drink, when I turned around and walked back towards my bed, my roomie asked 'Bro since when were you circumcised? You wasn't' last month right?

Have you ever felt this feeling whereby you fall for someone that you barely know but the feeling is just so crazily great? 

I can only trust that this feeling happened for a reason

Been together with my SO for about two months now. I consider myself selectively conservative as my personal belief is no premarital sex, and my SO is aware of it and respects my wishes. However, I recently learnt that my SO is not a virgin (though he told me otherwise before we got together). Furthermore, SO is very open to any form of physical contact with his female friends (sleeping on the same bed, hugging). While I understand all physical contact does not have any ulterior motives backing it, I can't help but feel uneasy about this whole situation, and I don't know if it is even appropriate or necessary to broach this topic since it might just be my insecurities. Any advice?
-
 
sometimes i dont understand how could you treat me in this manner. slowly i realised, it is because you dont even like/love me. you are simply not interested in replying me. you simply cant be bothered with me. .

sorry but i still cannot get over the fact that i am merely a replacement in your life, a person to fill up your free time. 
just an insignificant substitute.
a highly disposable figure in your life, or probably not even part of your life in the first place.

i dont know what kind of remaining feelings i have towards you.
i cannot stop thinking about you and our past memories although i know you are such a jerk and i am fully aware of the way you treated me.

there are definitely more bad than good.
more reasons for me to give up completely rather than holding on. but it is just so difficult for me.

i changed my lifestyle a little when i was with you, and now i have to learn how to be myself again.

every time when i try to forget you, every time when i try not to eagerly wait for your replies, you will pop up suddenly.

the cycle repeats.

i wish i could be harsh enough. i wish i could do more justice to myself. i wish i could treat myself better. i wish i could accept and face the painful reality that you are just not by my side anymore, 

and never will.

The OP of post  really needs help. Like psychological help. I feel so sorry for you.

I have separated with my ex for four months. We have made no contact within these period. Then out of the blue, I received this letter in my mail. It contained no words but a really long bundle of hair. It's definitely from her (she had super long hair when we were together) and now I could see from fb that she has cut her hair short. I wonder what does that mean? Should I contact her to ask?
-
 
This girl, my coursemate and I, we started off as friends. Eventually, we got closer and hung out with each other more often. I was happy to have made my first close friend of the opposite sex. I always looked forward to seeing her in school, and would constantly check my phone for her message, or the social media for her posts and updates. Unknowingly, I had fallen for her. I would love to bring our relationship to the next stage, but I'm not sure how she feels about me, and I am afraid to ruin our friendship if things don't work out. Maybe I'll just take it slow and see how it goes. After all, we are still going to meet up this hols :)

Many students have come forward to say that they have gone through the similar experience as the OP who is going through an abortion. And it is important that we all girls have to learn to protect our bodies and try our best from reaching a point in making a tough decision such as abortion. We should be well knowledged about the preventions if we are going to be sexually active. I am not some expert at this subject but I would like to give some tips to girls out there. Download a period calendar. Regularly key in your period. It will calculate your fertile window and your average cycle length. Do not have sex during your fertility window. Even with condom. Try to stay away from sex during this period. And at other times when you have sex, if condom breaks or leaks, quickly go get plan B emergency pill within 24 hours. If you really want to feel more safe, consult a doctor and get birth control pills and use it with condom to have maximum protection. Or you can just stay away from intercourse. Abstinence till you both are sure and mature in your relationship. You don't have to have intercourse to have a healthy sexual relationship. There are many other ways to please a partner. Talk it out with your Boyfriend and he will understand your concerns and paranoia if he loves you.
-
 
To :
Why don't you calm down a little? I choose to be something called 'pro-do whatever you want'. Having seen the posts about keeping you virginity, abortion, and such brings about quite some amusement as everyone tries to offer some sort of view on the issue. Obviously when someone asks for your opinion, you offer it, not try to convince someone to follow suit.  And since I'm replying to this particular post, guess what, I don't really care about whether the person has an abortion or not, instead, why not just analyse the flip sides of the coin yourself? It seems pretty dumb that we're all trying to make her do this or do that, when your opinion does not even matter, and neither should you try to use it to affect someone else.  
P.S. It seems like I have already encountered a conundrum where I cared enough to reply to this even though I preach about not caring. 

-
 
I really need help. 

I'm on a break with bf. He initiated it due to my huge insecurities and possessive behavior.

I know it's entirely my fault. I'm working on loving myself right now and to get my shit together. How long should it last? When can i make contact and how?? Is this a prelude to a breakup?

Today my mom told me something which made me rather unhappy. She said that one auntie from my neighbourhood said this to her "your daughter no friends right? Always see her going here and there alone." My mom also told me that a few days ago, another auntie who live next door told her "your daughter like no friends leh. I never seen her with her with any friends here". 

Ok fine, i would say that i don't have many friends, but not like no friends. Haven't they thought that some people meet their friends elsewhere but never bring their friends into their house? 

Perhaps i should let you all know some background about myself first and you all see if it's right for people to judge me like that.

I am someone who always had my earpiece on, always looking at my phone when i walk (to be honest, it's not because i am messaging, but because i do not want to look at people). I never look at people in the face when i walk on the streets. Never in my uni life had i joined any activities (no camps, nothing at all). I am not interested at all in knowing new people. The only thing i did in my uni free time was to go to the gym alone (sometimes my friends join me), only for 1 reason, to keep fit. I don't look at anyone there or talk to anyone at all. I just get my exercises done and leave. Each time we have class activities, the prof only need someone to volunteer to speak for the group and sometimes, i was nudged by some course mates to present to the class what we had discussed but every single time, i always reject because i am fearful of speaking up in front of people. The only time i truly speak up in class is when there is class participation marks and i will really force myself to overcome my fear because i just can't afford to lose those marks. Everytime on the streets, people approach me for doing surveys, i simply "siam" them without looking at them or saying anything because i do not like talking to people i don't know. I think the "siam" made some people angry because once, i was called rude and no manners.

During one of the chinese new year, according to my mom (because i don't know this was what i did and i don't know what really happned), when the relatives came, we did wish one another happy new year, after which i go up to my room for a while as i felt a bit uncomfortable with too many people. Then i came out to get some drinks and this was when my mom heard one of my cousins said "she so weird". My mom told me that i simply walked into the kitchen to get my drinks without looking at the people chatting in the living room. She said when i walk past the living room, i should at least look and smile at the people there. Really? Is that how we should conduct ourselves in a gathering?

I don't deny that i feel very uncomfortable every time there's too many people. I don't look at people in the face on the streets only because i don't see the need to make eye contact with strangers. I don't join a single thing simply because i am not keen to meet new people. Also i really disliked taking photographs simply because i don't like to and i am also not active on social media. I also felt that i am just shy. All these i felt, are characteristics of an introvert and someone who's shy, but my mom disagreed. She felt that my case was something worst than an introvert. I explained to her that if one is inborn like that, there's nothing much that can be done but she disagreed, thinking that i should put in some effort into changing myself. But is it really that important that i come out of my shell? I thought we should always be ourselves and not be influenced by what others think? If i chose to remain as what i am now, would the consequences be very bad? 

Is it a sad reality that people like me, tend to be judged by people as weird, no friends etc? So would you all classify my case as being an introvert, shy, socially awkward or perhaps all 3?

As a girl staying on a mixed floor in RC4, I enjoy being around you. You never fail to get the whole floor together bonded and having fun together at the lounge and you seem to be charming all the ladies with your long hair before you cut them. Only recently, I start to realise that I carry some feelings for you. I am unsure if it this is too late because the semester is ending and if you feel the same for me? Your bravery to fight for our floor rights from those people and your love to bond us all together.

Thankfully you will still be in RC4 next semester. and I hope you will continue to plan more stuff for the floor so that i can continue to meet you during the break :p I hope this reaches out to you, but I would still like to stay as your secret admirer for the time being.

PS: Thanks to the coffee boy's girl's boyfriend who posted here so that I get to know NUSWhispers~

 It is probably impossible because I doubt he would even know about NUSwhispers, but you really sound like my Prince. 

Throughout this whole time, I have been waiting for a text from you.

Princess

A few hours ago I found out that you lied to me. 

By implication, you didn't just tell one single lie but multiple lies to suport the first lie. 

Why? 
Out of pity? 
Out of duty of care?

I just feel so much anger and frustration. 

But more at myself and at the situation. 
How did our relationship turn that bad for you to no longer want to see me? 
What actions have I done to lead you to act this way? 
How bad of a girlfriend I was for you to lie about not being able to meet with me? 

You were free that day, you managed to travel a fair distance to hang out with someone. Yet you couldn't go with me to somewhere.  

You lied and I was the cause of it. 

Thanks for that memory and thank you for giving me a huge opportunity to finally move on from you.

Sometimes, you find someone who has every quality you're looking for in a partner. But life is a funny thing; either you just can't/don't love him/her, or the timing is completely wrong, or that both of you still have emotional baggage weighing you two down. I'm always wondering how do people find their soulmate. Or maybe I'm just over-romanticizing sadness and loneliness.

Hi guys. 

I was rejected by my crush whom I have known for 1-2 months. We really clicked it off easily and would go have dinner / explore tgt before I confess. That is why I really thought I might have a chance. She is a really blur girl so I do not think she is leading me on. I did not also ask her why she rejected me because I did not feel that it is relevant (it will be good to know tho). After the rejection, I was really cold to her for about a month because I was really hurt but now things are getting better between us. I started to put more feelings into my text and things slowly began to return to when it once was. Still I won’t randomly ask her out for dinners just to keep some distance between us. 

Is it wise for me to stay on as her friend? To provide some context, I would not see her for another half a year after my confession and we knew each other for two months only (But we really click easily). I wonder will that be one of the factors why she rejected me?

I will still help her/give her advices when she asks for it but I will not go out of my way to help her anymore.

So I finally had the courage to tell you, but as I expected I got rejected. Doesn't help that being mentally prepared did not make it hurt any less. Hope you find happiness with the guy you like.

 People choose to do different things in life. Sometimes these are the things which really separate us from each other. 

We tattoo our tits, pierce our nipples, turn gay, lesbian, have an abortion (or not). But why are you trying to guilt trip people who went for abortions? Because you did not, and you think it's wrong? 

Calm down man. Maybe what you did was the best thing for your situation, but that doesn't mean it would have been the best thing for the other OPs. This type of thing does not have a unique solution.

Scroll to the bottom for TL:DR 

Is being being single bad?

Does getting rejected by your crush mean you are bad?

What if  I tell you that there a greater concern that this?

If you think you are worthy and think that getting rejected by your crush is their lost, will you still feel as sad?

What you need isn't a girlfriend to prove that you are worthy. What you need is self confidence. 

With self confidence, not only will you not feel sad about getting rejected, you will have a lesser chance of getting rejected because confidence is a very sexy quality that attract many  girls.

How do one gain confidence?

1)Getting rejected doesn't mean you are bad. There are tons of girls out there. Many are more attractive than your crush. Getting rejected by one doesn't mean anything much.

2)Don't set self limiting belief. People tend to find fact to support their belief and ignore face that doesn't coincide with their belief. For example, If you believe that you are worthless, you will think any girls who are nice to you are just nice people instead of thinking you deserve them. On the other hand, if you think you are worthy, you will think any girls who rejected you are girls who are myopic and missed a Gem instead of thinking that you are bad.

TL: DR Confidence!

I wanted to believe that you were busy because of finals, but now that nothing has changed, I understand what you mean. Life goes on I guess

I keep thinking about other girls even though I'm attached. Does it mean I don't love my girlfriend or I'm just a fucked up person?

I have a particular set of skills, skills that make me a nightmare for people who post unglam photos online. 

I will find them, and I will post them

Have any of you felt like some people do things for you, because they feel like they are supposed to(like relatives)? Or they(friends) know how lonely you are so they think they're doing you a favour by going out with you or organising a party for you. Not out of care or love but just pity. I feel extremely uncomfortable in situations like this. Don't they realise that by doing all this, you're making me feel a lot worst?

One day I was traveling alone in a new city and I went to eat at a burrito place (it was really good by the way). When I was eating an Adele song came on; it was the new song Hello. I usually like Adele songs but strangely that moment I was just annoyed at her and rolling my eyes. I just suddenly remembered how I felt last time listening to her songs and being all emotional, sensitive and l felt like I was just living in the past last time, always so sentimental. I wanted to tell Adele to stop it, stop living in the past and stop her regrets. Stop singing about men who probably don't even care much about her anymore. I guess I was really telling myself to stop as well.
I am (well probably now was) the kind of shy girl who always prioritized being seen as nice, I loved community service, always quite naive about guys, always giving people the benefit of doubt. I felt like I just grew up in that moment; naive little girl who liked being nice to a modern woman who had her stuff together. The reason I was traveling alone? Tired of everyone, tired of my last travel buds whom I tried hard to be friends with and be nice to but they just kept being asses to one another and to me somewhat and didn't appreciate me a bit, never apologised for the hard time they gave me. The time alone also made me realise that I wanted to break my 6-year friendship with a close friend. I saw that she never wanted to compliment me, I remembered times when she was secretly evil and putting me down or just not caring about me, I don't know why I just ignored her glaring flaws for so long. Its the price to pay for striving to be kind everytime. Its not like I'm going to start being an ass but I just don't care anymore. I just do what I think is right, no need to worry about looking nice. It took me this long to realise that a lot of people just don't care so much. Its also not what the world likes the most and you can never get by being so nice. "She was funny/hardworking/outgoing/pretty/fashionable. I like her. Oh yeah and she was nice I guess". Its always just a little bonus. It's time to move forward in life, do things that make me happy, stop letting people step all over me, live in the present.

 Ladies, when you make eye contact with a guy, what are you actually think about? Is it like "wow I am so attractive until guys will check me out"?
-
 
Of course I miss you. I still think about you all the time. Everything I see, it just somehow makes me think about how you'd react to it: how much you'd like it, how ridiculous you might find some of it. But of course, I'd be the only person excited to start a conversation; it's been a while since we've last talked & although I know you're away right now so it might not be convenient to talk, I wish you'd treasure me more even as a friend & talk to me sometimes. Of course it's painful that I have a strong inkling that you're not into me but well, a girl can always dream. I imagined  was written by you but you'd never post anything on NUSWhispers. Oh well, good night and goodbye, I think it's high time this ended for me.

There seems to be quite a lot of confessions on this page about the falling in love aspect of relationships such as how to get your crush to like you or tell if they're interested or how to ask someone out. I just wanted to share some of my fears regarding falling out of love, because falling in love is actually the easier part in my opinion.

Based on past experience, I feel that I fall out of love for the same reasons that I fall in love. This post from the Artidote explains it much better than I ever could.
 
"A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is, or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights, or closed spaces, or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when I was 17 I took a class called Relationships For Life and I learned that most people fall out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover’s once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise and their one track mind is now immaturity and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain. Their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy, just another distraction in your busy life.

Nothing saddens and scares me like the thought that I can become ugly to someone who once thought all the stars were in my eyes."

So I'm just wondering if anyone has some advice on how to maintain a relationship and continue loving your partner in the long term?

Thank you!

You look so cute when you smile. When you talk about your project or about cars. When your friends tease you or when you see food. When you are trying to stay awake in lectures or even when you are dead tired camping in the lab to do your project. 
This semester has been tiring for me, But whenever I feel tired or lost, somehow looking at you and your passion gives me the energy and drive to keep carrying on. But I guess I won't get to see you anymore next sem as I'll be on IA while you would still be stuck in the lab doing your project. I think I like you, and I guess your friends sense it before I knew it myself. And was sorry I didn't handle all the teasing all that well. 

But with you being so busy with your work and me going to try out new projects, I guess it won't even go anywhere. Just happy seeing your smiling face once in a while, so please post on snapchat more often ahah. It sucks that I won't get to see you almost everyday and that I couldn't be a closer friend to you.

To 

For me, it's when you do the same thing with another person, and your first thought is not the past.

There are some r/s that you can get over entirely, there are some you never "get over", in the sense that you still care about the person and treasures all the memories you have made together. Nevertheless, you can still move on without having to trivialized the existence of your ex (or worse, hating him/her).

Sidenote: I feel that it is easier to let go of the past by appreciating the good things that happened. Acknowledge that, despite the failure of the relationship, you were truly happy in it. For me, it does weaken the negative thoughts/emotions, and maybe that's why I don't feel bitter about my ex. My 2 cents.

My experience taught me it's alright to never get over someone entirely. It just means you have once gave your all to someone and the memories, beautiful or not, is staying with you. The important thing is to learn to love again, and like I said it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. 

My gf and I talk about our pasts once in a while or when things are in context. We don't get jealous over each other's good memories, and we comfort each other over the bad ones. In fact, we like to listen about the good memories and learn from the bad mistakes. What we could agree on is that the past shapes us but does not define us. Loving each other means accepting each other's past, and we have the future to create memories of our own.

However, it is important to know that all these have to be based on strong mutual trust. If either party is insecure, everything can crumble in a day. There was this other post about truth vs white lie, I'm all for truth. Maybe it hurts, but it also shows trust. Trust that he/she can accept your past. If he/she cannot, I suggest you rethink the r/s.

Anyway, an interesting question, is it difficult for guys to accept if he finds out that his gf isn't a virgin (which happens before the r/s)? Does this differ for virgin guys and non-virgin guys? My ex and I lost our virginity to each other, while in my current r/s, both of us aren't virgin and we know that before we got together so obviously it wasn't a problem.

dont know if my post got filtered but im wondering if a guy will like a girl from an entirely different religion? i really really like him

Hi, I'm a different OP from previously. In reference to post , I have experience in which you are lacking in.
So, I went to the polyclinic, visited the GP. told him i was pregnant, and told him I wanted to get a TOP. You have to tell him this, straight up. Then the poly set up an appt at KKH a week later. Went to the first appointment, went for the ultrasound. Then, turns out the fetus died at 7 weeks. That was tough. As you are waiting to see the doctor at the end to sign some papers and confirm the date of surgery, they will take you in for some counselling. 2 stops. One to discuss an alternate method, they will try to talk you out of it. The second, to discuss contraceptive methods. Then you see the doctor. The day surgery was a week later. 

I remember the entire period being one of the most demanding periods I had ever gone through. Other than that, it was right smack during finals but I had no choice. That was tough. The nausea didn't stop until the day of the surgery. 

Try to stay away from home. Minimise physical contact with your family, at least until everything is over. They will sense that something is wrong. However for me, I went through the entire thing without my family suspecting a single thing. 

I paid $150 through medisave. The other $600 my bf of that time helped to offset the cost. Even then, it caused a lot of emotional strain between us. We are no longer together. 

I wish you all the best, truly. I have been where you are. There will be countless nights leading up to the surgery where you feel stuck and it feels like shit but trust me, it gets better. Find people you can trust to confide in. If you can't, you have me. Most importantly, know that this is what you have to do and trust that you will get through this. God bless.

Saw the post on the girl going for the abortion and quite a few confessions replying to it.  Thought of my own experience and would just like to share. 

I had been using protection consistently with my bf and we had only been only sexually active for about a month when disaster occurred.   I was shocked to find out from a usual doctor's visit late last year that I was pregnant.  I mean,  I thought  protection would be safe right?  So not!  It was quite shocking to suddenly have to deal with this,  as I come from a rather elite background and always thought that having a baby out of wedlock would only happen to naive teenage girls who didn't know better.  But alas,  this was me now. 

To be very honest,  there was not a bit of hesitation involved in making my decision.   I instantly contacted my boyfriend and told him the news and together,  we set out finding a suitable abortion doctor.  It was really more of a pracfical decision.  There was no way I could have a baby at that point of time.  Firstly,  my parents are very traditional and would probably kill me (okay maybe not literally but u get the drift) for having pre marital sex, what more for getting knocked up.  Secondly,  I was still studying and had no financial capability to raise a child.  Thirdly,  I had,  and still have,  no motherly instincts. I am young and would still like to have my fun and would not want to suddenly have to alter my entire lifestyle.   Lastly,  I have not been together with my boyfriend for that long yet.  If I were to keep the child and marry him (I don't want to be a single mum), I would be jumping into this decision to make this guy my husband and the one I will be with for the rest of my life.   This is definitely not something to be taken lightly.  Don't get me wrong,  I don't mean that abortion should be taken lightly.  But in my situation the pros weighed heavily against the cons.

Getting the abortion was kind of scary to me as I don't have a high pain tolerance and was not too sure what to expect.  Furthermore, I was in the second trimester already,  which necessitated a more complicated and painful procedure.  I was really self-conscious about what others might think too. As I still look kind of young I guess,  at the gynaecology clinic,  I kept thinking that people were staring at me and judging me for being pregnant before marriage.  Perhaps I'm just paranoid but this mental barrier was not easy to overcome. 

Long story cut short, I went for the abortion with my boyfriend's company and support.  He was really a great source of strength and I am glad that he gave me complete autonomy in the decision to make.   He also paid for the entire procedure which was really expensive as it was a second trimester abortion and one done at private hospital. My procedure caused  me quite a lot of pain but I was relieved when it was all over. 

For now life is back to normal.   Just occasionally I will have the fear that my parents may discover the truth someday.  I guess I will deal with it if it really happens,  but for now I prefer to hide this secret deep deep down.  And when the time is right, I will have a child of my own.

I know my crush is single but how do I know if she is looking for a relationship or not?

I have been talking to this guy on tinder. He asked me out for drinks on Friday. Should I go? I feel that I want to go out with him to know him better and not have any sexual relations with him. Am I giving him the wrong impression since I agreed to drinks? Or am I thinking too much?

I have a crush on one of my classmates. Just recently he confessed that he likes me but he has a boyfriend !! It seems like he doesn't want to know what's my answer will b since he didn't ask at all . I did a bit of stalking and it's true that he has a bf . Why did he even say he likes me then ? He even confirmed that he's not bi . I m confused !

Ps. I am a guy and my only intention is to help

 I've been camping at level 6 of CLB for this semester and I've noticed this rather tall, bespectacled and pretty (Korean/SNSD pretty) girl around. However, she tends to study with a guy (can't remember if it's always the same one) but I guess it's natural for a pretty girl to be surrounded by guys! Anyway, if you happen to be referring to me (I'm not sure how to handle being referenced as having a similar look to Justin Bieber though), I'll definitely still be hanging around level 6 at CLB! Hope to see you there next semester! :)

For OP  I'm here to help! I dunno how this would work but I would love to meet you and help.

Wasn't expecting it but i met my boyfriend off a dating app. He's slightly older than  me and possess qualities that i'm looking for in a partner. But lately, i've been thinking alot about his colorful past. He has used quite a fair share of dating apps prior to us being exclusive. And i know he has met a lot of girls from there, even going on some trips with girl(s). He mentioned that it was platonic as the girl(s) just got out of relationships. I didn't dare to probe much as i know that was his past and partly cos i was afraid of knowing things that may upset me. Though i must admit i was really quite hurt when i knew about it...

In a previous confession, someone said if you truly ove someone, you'll accept this past. I love him but the thought of his past haunts me every now and then. Maybe it stems from the fact that we met on a dating/hookup app? Him looking for someone new when he's tired of me. The fear of being easily disposable. (Though i think im a pretty good catch if i may say so myself lol)

I've tried bringing it up and he told me that it was all in the past and what truly matters is that he is with me now. And he wants us to last.

Should i let it go? It's like opening a pandora's box, do i really want to know. Anyone caught in the same situation and how would you deal with it? Guys' POV? Thanks!!!

Hitting it off way too well with X who has been out of touch for like 3+ years!

3+ years ago, we hit it off pretty darned well too, nothing happened because we were too young, too afraid to handle it

Now, I am single, X is attached

X seems to have been thinking about being single for awhile

I'm on exchange now but we would stay up just to chat and we're both clearly enjoying it

Muddy waters man, what's happening, help?

Hi, I am currently listening to our song. 

The song that we often danced to, the song that you used to serenade me with. 

Today I decided to listen to it again, and wow I realised how much I miss you. 

I hope you are doing well. 
Your birthday is coming up, yes I remember it. However instead of messaging you I will silently wish you a happy birthday to the night sky. 

People said that we can still remain friends but I realised that I can't. We can't be friends for each time I see you, it pains me as it reminds me how much we have lost, how much we have taken each other for granted 
Therefore forgive me for distancing myself away from you. 
I loved you, never doubt that. 
You were my world and each day I am reminded how lucky I was to have had you walked into my life. But it is time to walk away. 

Don't contact me because I will not answer. 
Don't search for me because I won't be there. 

Despite of all these things I do not regret meeting you, will I ever do it again? 

I will, but I will make sure that we don't make the same mistakes again. 
Be well 

Love you always and forever.

Sincerely, The one who got away

Hey op of , I understand that you are going through a really tough time and it would be great if you can involve your bf for support. It is important that you know that you have done nothing wrong. And I wish you the best. I would love to talk to you and offer you some advice and support if there is some way for us to get in touch? Meanwhile, take care. Abortion at an early fetal age is pretty straightforward. So don't worry too much.

I smile when I read about people being in love. I'm really happy for them.

Dear future husband 
Let love wait. Don't marry me until ten years later. Don't find me until I have given up clinging on to my ex. My heart is not ready for another hell of an adventure and my soul is already dead. Don't tell me to give hopes to a new relationship because I have once gave away all but was reciprocated with regret. I would tell you my darkest secret no longer because I told them all to him. I'm now but a sorry shadow of the past.

Give me space and time to travel around the world until I'm done. Give me time to help others, to contribute back to society. Perhaps, when I rise from my ashes, then marry me. For now, let love wait.

 Any kind soul can help out the lady? Preferably female? Just your company alone would go a long way. She doesn't have to go through this alone. :/ I would if I could. Come on people.

If I die, don't cry. I would have left living my life to my fullest. I may not have been in the best of health, or the happiest of states, but I know I would have died while doing all the things I chose to do :)

If I die, please come to my funeral. Don't talk about me, or the happy memories we had. Take this special time to catch up with the people you missed for the past few or even tens of years. Friendships never die, and I just gave you the best, most convenient excuse to ensure it doesn't :)

If I die, please don't bring gifts of bereavement or mourning. Don't bring 白金 or white gold. Optimistically I would have saved enough to pay off my own funeral and be of no burden to my family. Instead, use that money for something else. Something meaningful - charity, making someone happy, or even just for an act of kindness. I think dead me would like that a lot better :)

If I die, please don't hate me anymore. Between my life and death, I am sure that I would have done and said things that upset. I've moved on; will you? Maybe you'll see that from a broader perspective, there's no use blaming human beings. We make mistakes, we learn from it. It's not to late to reconcile with a friend/loved one whom you've been holding a grudge against? :)

If I die, don't leave my family with words of condolences. Help me. I never know when I'll move on from life, so help me. Help my wife and my children, with anything at all. Ideally I would like my kids to pick up some useful life skills, maybe expand on their interests in sports, games or whatever. If my wife is lonely, take her out sometime. Help me, because I no longer can :)

If I die, please don't love me anymore. I was a part of your life, and I no longer am. I've literally left! Channel all that into something meaningful, on something/someone living. In life, I hate being a burden or imposing on someone/others. I would very much like to maintain that stance in death :)

If I die, thank you. Not thank you that I'm dead. Thank you for having walked this life with me. Whether we knew each other for 10 minutes or 10 years. It's been great :)

Two persons : him and him. Both are now the toxic in my life. Hurting one, but couldn't bear the fact that I have to hurt him. Trying not to hurt another, but have to hurt him nonetheless. 

Yes, I am a cheater. And it is the skeleton in my closet. One of them knows, the other doesn't.

All it took was just a hug, and I felt the comfort and warmth I've longed for. I allowed him to kiss me, just because I want to be loved the way he does now. Oh, how I've longed for it!

And him? He wonders why we broke up so abruptly. 

I know you have opinions on cheaters. Yes, you who won't understand the pain of being under-appreciated again and again, the sleepless nights, the struggles to change into someone he wanted but just couldn't do it well enough (and we end up quarreling), the endless insecurities of being with him, and the countless times I cried. 

I just want to be loved.

Why is it as I get older I care less about my grades? I'm pretty sure my cap will fall like crazy this sem, considering that I gave up doing one of my core module paper halfway. I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life. I'm not sad or depressed I just don't care. Is it weird? I don't know why I don't care. I just feel so lost. Maybe I just don't like what I'm studying.

 UPDATE: # asked me for a night of sex, which I obliged, which was weird (why would # offer me sex so willingly?).

But since I knew # for a while, we got down to do the deed until # sudden shouted "S", "S", "S"! (referring to someone's else's name)

I asked who "S" is. # said that it was someone she knew from a few years back in #'s JC. "S" turned out to be a fellow friend I know in a special program back in the same JC too. At that moment I was shocked because I thought "S" was just an evergreen guy who cared little about such needs.

I asked more about "S". # revealed that # started asking "S" for such trysts whenever # liked it, starting from the weekends when "S" would book out. It turned out to be a convenient option; "S" had a sexual release outlet for free, while # had a dependable FWB. But things took a bad turn from August this year, when # complained "S" started to say he was too busy with lab work.

Is # making use of me to be #'s sexual outlet for someone else? This starts to feel super weird considering I know "S", never knew him to be like that, and #'s activities with him.

 I read your long post and let me tell you, please do not feel guilty for sharing this and do write part B. It will make you feel better. You must be having a lot of courage to be able to describe your sad feelings in words and share it. Also, no need to look for likes. Your worth does not depend on them. Write what you feel like and don't care so much about what other people think. There are some people (like me) who read your post but are too shy to like because they wouldn't want to reveal their identity.

I have been in your situation before. Exactly like that. From your text messages, I feel that you were normal friends earlier but after a certain point, you began to sound pushy, especially when you asked whether she got your message. She is not into you. It is  painful to accept, but you have to accept it. She may have figured out that you like her and she doesn't want to lead you on, so she avoids you. Girls are quite sensitive at noticing these things.

I know you feel sad because she prefers J over you. It has NOTHING to do with you dude. It didn't work out because there was no chemistry. Don't try to analyse further. Don't compare yourself with J in terms of wealth, looks etc. You are what you are and that is what makes you unique. Someday some girl will love you for who you are and accept your financial status.

Reduce contact with A. Don't text her so often. Let it go and move on. It is painful but you need to accept the reality. You have better things in store for yourself. This is not the end of the world. She wasn't the right one. Not saying she is good or bad, she just wasn't the one for you. Leave it to fate. Love will come and find you. You don't have to chase it. It will be very obvious when you love a girl and she loves you back and it will happen someday. Just don't lose hope. :)

In the meantime, don't feel sad about having crushes. It is very normal and it adds to your experience. Remember, the pain that doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In the future, you will recall these memories and pat yourself on the back for having the strength to overcome disappointments in life.

During the finals, I was kind of very distracted and I ended up screwing all my papers. Now with finals over, I am feeling very guilty and unable to enjoy my holidays. Anyone have that feeling before?
-
 
 After reading your post, I felt as though I am the one typing the story out, with the exception of J. I am currently in the exact same situation and still struggling to get out of it. A side of me wants to give up but another side just tells me to keep pressing on because a close-knit relationship like this doesn't come by easily. 

It hurts when both of you got so close together already and she just starts distancing herself away. Like, is there even any purpose of friendship in this world anymore, when someone whom you are so close with just leaves you like this? Thinking about this just makes me frightened. 

But thank you, at least I know I'm not the only one in this and probably I will get better at overcoming this.

I'm already a y3 student in NUS. But I've been feeling more and more like SMU is the right place for me (felt this for a year, and even more so recently). Each time I visit SMU, it just feels right for me. I've never felt that with NUS. I like their teaching style a lot, and I feel like the students there are more on the same wavelength as me.

I made a mistake not applying for SMU 3 years ago, but I think I will try next year. I don't know if I'll accept if I get it, but at least there's the possibility.

Do you think it's worth it?

To the coffee guy with the hairband in RC4. I hope this gets to you. Recently, my boyfriend broke up with me after he caught me looking at through your Facebook for the second time. I guess it was inevitable, but I have no regrets. I've never believed in love at first sight but this is the first time I've felt this way. I know it sounds cliché but i wish you would just notice me :( I don't think I will ever be able to muster up the courage to talk to you, so I guess I'll have to settle for what we have now.

Throughout this semester, I've had the privilege of hearing you sing a few times and I wish it was me singing 'Hey there Delilah' with you instead of 'her'. You even made me a cup of coffee once :) Over the past two weeks, I've caught a few glimpses of you, and you give me the butterflies each time I see you smile. 

I overheard you were going on exchange next semester and it just breaks my heart knowing that I'll have to endure 13 weeks of school without you around. I've contemplated withdrawing from RC4 just so I can cope with my studies, but the thought of being able to see you again has made me decide to stay :) 

If you do see this, know that stolen kisses are always the sweetest.

Sometimes i really wonder why people are so quick to judge people even before they know them . I am together with this Indian classmate of mine for 2 years. My mother always gave that stereotypical sentence of " Indian men will beat their wives" and " his mum will never accept you" Which is extremely untrue and discriminatory, He has been the sweetest guy on earth, who will always take trouble to drop me off at my doorstep and waited for my text before driving off. He will help out at family events as well and always treated me with care and respect. However, we do have out occasional fights as well, and she will immediately go " See his temper is so bad, typical". What nonsense, every couples have fights, not just a certain race. She was always going on about why i could not find a Chinese guy and she is also embarrassed about the fact that my boyfriend is Indian. Even during Chinese new year visits, she will always avoid the topic of boyfriends with my relatives, " just because he is Indian". Hey c'mon guys , race doesn't ever make anyone inferior period. Your attitude makes you inferior.And my boyfriend is a gem.

Since there are many relationships/sex/marriage/dating posts thus far I had the urge to write this post as well, since exams are over (for most now) please read it and let me know what you think. If you still have exams, it's really long and please read it only if you need something to read for a break.

I do not deny that it isn't easy finding the right partner. My brother has been dating many girls (depends on your definition of dating, some of you may define it as hanging out as friends) before he finally found the right one for him. 

I on the other hand, am in a different set of circumstances. I am not exactly very smart nor very good looking, and have faced numerous 'rejections' thus far by the opposite sex. It may be the case that my approach was wrong but these rejections were mainly by girls who were attracted greatly to the superficial stuff (nothing wrong with being attracted to it but Im highlighting the word 'greatly' here). 

I'll give a few examples, I used to like (or so i thought) these two girls, lets call them A, and B. A was like an ideal girl during that time for me, she was sporty, friendly and fun to be with, (note that if we were to talk about looks she isn't good looking). I hung out with her, studied with her and had fun in general with her, and I thought we had an exclusive thing going on between us. Soon later I introduced her to my friends whom she got close to as well. Long story short, a few months down the road, she stopped replying my texts, or our conversations would mainly end with a 'haha' or 'ok' from her. 

I was crushed, and curious as to why this was happening and I traced back hundreds of texts to start inferring what happened that could've lead to this downturn in our >friendship thing or even our friendship, since everytime i asked if something was wrong she would either not reply or reply with 'nothing haha' after 10 hours. I realised that there was this brief conversation that we had (which was like the marker for shorter and shorter conversations subsequently):

Me: Hey what're you doing?

A: Had pingpong training! soo tired hahaha, gonna go back and take a warm shower now :)

Me: Oh i had pingpong training also, but I didn't get to exert at all heh, the coach only let the main players train as its competition period

A: huh, you not school team?

Me: haha i not so pro lah

(sidenote: we were from different schools, but met in primary school and were in multiple tuitions together in secondary school, kept in contact on and off then, and then got close when we were about 19)

A: -noreply-

Me (2 days later, attempting to start another convo): Ehh how've you been? btw this weekend wanna have breakfast/lunch/dinner? Anyday is ok :) can go to the eatery near your house! 

A: Haha uhh maybe, see how? :) 

Me: ok!!!! haha are you doing ok? You told me your exams are coming and you're always tired from training

A: Ya haha, very tired lah wish someone could send me home instead of taking the bus everyday, then got more time to study lor. :p

Me: ohhh I wish I could haha, if i had a car :d. Next time when i get a car can send you wherever you want. :P

A: :P i thought someone already has a car then why never send me :(

Me: huh what you talking about? dont have haha!

A: Huh then that time after we all met (note: with the friends i introduced her to) at xxx cafe you sent your sis to tuition that car not yours meh.

Me: Huh ohh!!! that car my cousin one lah I help him collect from repair shop cause he overseas. 

A: Oh ok. haha

Me (the next day): so this weekend on? :)

A (next tuesday): oh sry my phone spoilt so i couldnt get your message.

Me: huh... ok

And that was where we started talking less and less. I asked my close friends for advice and they were like aya maybe her phone really spoil, dont think so much lah, you guys so close liao now, maybe thats her way of texting someone shes close to also (referring to the way she talks in general, not the MIA for a week). 

So we didnt talk for like... 3 weeks?

3 weeks later:

A: heyyyyy u there? :)

Me: haha wassup? yea i am

A: do you have jason (not his real name)'s number?

Me: huh what do you want his number for 

A: -noreply-

(Note: jason was one of the guy friends i introduced her to, he used to be my classmate.)

2 weeks later:

Me: hey how've you been, so long never talk haha, ok not

A: -noreply-

Me (2 days later): yooooo, got my message?

A: ya haha. 

Me: Free tmrw night not your exams end liao right! dont say not free haha

A (the next day): probly not, going out with friend.

Me: oh ok.

The next day:
I was scrolling through facebook and i saw her and jason tagged together in numerous photos, they had dinner at an expensive place (estimated $40 per pax (sorry my threshold for food prices is pretty low)), and they also went to gardens by the bay. Just the two of them. Garnering my courage, i texted jason.

Me: Eh dude how've you been man

J: ok la chilling now that exams end

Me: haha i saw that you went out with A ;)

J: HAHA how you know sia :PP

Me: On facebook lah, u guys together ah

J: no laa, but I asked her out she said yes lorrr :p

Me: haha gratz (note: im already crushed by this stage)

How could i compete with J? J came from a wealthy family, had his own car (a cheap mercs but still a mercs), and would always pick up the full tab whenever he went out with her (I always call for a split-bill as i do not think it is right splurging on a friend or anyone else with my parents' hard-earned money). 

Ok i havent gotten to the part about now (5 years in the future), and to girl B as well. But I will so, please let me know if you want to know more guys and I'll write because a post like this already took me 2 hours. It'll be painful to write more if I cant get a word of affirmation. thank you. (i know my language isnt good sorry)

So please like this post if you'd like part B.

One of my female friends was caught cheating.

She got caught cheating on her current boyfriend with her ex-boyfriend. She gave her ex-boyfriend the impression that they were going to be re-kindled (lol). Somehow, along the way, her ex found it strange that she was being tagged on a lot of photos with another guy (current bf) on facebook. Her ex then added her current boyfriend on facebook and they both starting to gather intel from each other, only to realise that she was two-timing them

Finally, when the two guys met up and confronted her, she said that all along she didn't really have any feelings for both of them. After that, she dumped them both and now she is seeing some rich kid. 

She recently shared with us this story about how smart she was that she managed to cheat without any repercussions and snagging an ah sia kia who treats her like a princess. Well done, I guess......

How do LGBT people find their partners? I've been in this category for quite a while but I can't seem to find my other half. Maybe it's because I've not talk to anyone about this, fearing that they will start seeing me differently. How do I open up to my peers that I'm bisexual without them shunning away from me? How do I find my partner?

WKW i really had a crush on you since union camp last year. please talk to me when we meet in school. -miss lovely

Three years ago, my mom said similar things to me too. Back then, my bf was still studying an engineering course, not having a spectacular GPA(he was in NTU), but I was getting pretty good results in my JC back then. He had no idea of where his future lies. He said he might want to take some fitness training teaching course and become a private trainer next time. He was just very uncertain of what he's gonna become in future. To make things worse, we came from very very different family background too. My family is considered wealthy? But he has divorced parents and his parent not earning 1/5 of what my dad brought in every month. Do no take my wrongly, just want to lay the background out to let you know how different we were, but I had never ever looked down on my bf. I do not believe in 门当户对 but what's more important is, a couple needs to have similar future aspects.

My mom told me not to be so serious. She thought my bf didn't seem like a reliable nor responsible person. She did not foresee us having a good future together. She thought he would not be able to take care of me(especially financially). We stayed in private properties ever since young, but my bf stays in a HDB flat. She told me, I would never get used to staying in such a small flat without all the facilities and bigger space and luxurious feeling. She was very very skeptical and it really broke my heart when she told me that. She had her points and I had to agree with her whatever flaws she mentioned about my bf were absolutely right. However, I had faith in my bf.

Three years later today, my bf got a scholarship and signed on. He is earning more than 4K per month now and I am very proud of his achievements. His family background is still the same but again, that's not important to me. His mom loves me and treats me very well. My mom has changed her view to him and unofficially agreed on my decision to take him as my future spouse.

I just want to say, the condition now may not be well but if you have faith in your bf, things will only get better. All the best!

As a person who is extremely passive, I didn't make any effort to befriend this girl from my philosophy tutorial class throughout the semester. During reading week, I realized that I would like to know her better, and so I gathered some courage to attempt to talk to her after the paper. 

The paper was a 2h MCQ paper which I completed fairly quickly, and thus waited outside MPSH1 while calming my nerves. When she came out much later, she started looking around, and while I was about to walk up to her, another guy joined her, and they started to leave the area. Not knowing if the guy was just a casual friend, I didn't have any guts to approach her, so I merely watched as they walked off. Since it was my last paper, I decided that this chapter has closed, and I should probably forget about it and move on.

My hopes of making my first friend since entering uni was crushed today... guess I will be returning to the daily lonesome grind in a month or so. I would like to advise the more introverted people out there to act decisively if you're trying to forge friendships, not wait until the end of the semester. 

This song describes how I've been feeling about my life in general.

Reply to ,

I am kinda in the same situation like you but in my case our roles switched. It's my boyfriend that went through the similar past that you shared about. However, sadly, his is worse. He gave his virginity to his ex too. He didn't want to tell me but, let's just cut it short, I found out about it. It was very very very, hurtful when I realised everything that he'd told me was a lie. To be fair, it was his past and I had no right to know if he didn't want to tell. However, now that I know about it already, the thoughts of him f**king his ex always appear out of no where and it's just freakin annoying. I honestly do not know when will all these thoughts stop coming to me. Maybe my whole life? 

My suggestion is, if your bf asks, you shall not lie. But if he doesn't mention it at all, maybe he doesn't want to know it. In that case just let it go. But if you are planning to go far with him, I don't think there should be any secrets between a couple. So, just tell him. Though it will hurt like hell. But if he does truly loves you, he will stay. Just like how I'm still together with my bf after 2.5 years because I love him though his past won't stop haunting me.

I am sorry.
I didn't mean to cause so much distress.

I did not twist a single thing. I really don't care what others think. You yourself know what is true and what is twisted. I am tired of fighting.

I never said that you are obliged to be my friend. I just wish that you could have told me straight so I didn't have to stupidly hang on to hope or go looking for answers. It wasn't easy for me too, you know.

Your fears are imaginary. And really extreme tbh. Go easier on the horror stories pls. I have found someone better.

When you grow up and look back, I hope you realize that all that happened, really, was that you hurt a boy who genuinely cared about you. A boy who promised to always be there to save the day.

I don't know why I am attending NUS anymore . Sometimes I feel like I m just spending a fortune to get a paper .

I had an interview a few weeks back, and I would like to share something that really struck a chord in me.

It was a skype interview for a career opportunity overseas. The interviewer asked me a very interesting question: "share with me a life lesson that you have learnt in university. I do not want to hear those standard 'teamwork' or 'time management', tell me something more personal. Don't worry, it doesn't have to be work-related." After clarifying what he wanted, I took a minute to think about it and this is what I to shared (or almost).

I learnt about hate. 
I learnt how people fight with one another over CAP, over the bell curve, at the canteen to queue up, boarding the ever-crowded NUS shuttle bus. I hated them. 
I learnt to hate certain professors for their style of teaching. I've learnt to hate certain modules as their content is incredibly dry and boring. 
I've seen how cliques break apart. I've seen how friends become enemies due to hate. I've seen how couples become strangers due to hate (a lot in fact). I've seen how people backstab one another just to get the better of one another. I've seen how people avoid one another because they hate another.
I've learnt to hate the flaws of our education system. I've learnt to hate the NUS negative academic environment and pressures. I've learnt to hate people and things around me.

Bringing this hate out of university, it becomes a reality in the working world. We fight with our colleagues for results, to prove that we are better, we hate them if we lose. We hate having to pretend to like our colleagues even though we dislike them.
We hate fighting with all other people to get to/from work. We hate the social pressures of having to 'fit-in'. 
We hate our bosses because we feel that they are unreasonable or terrible leaders. We hate the working pressures to keep your job. We hate having to meet the KPIs set by our bosses. 
This hate that I learn from university, it simulates the working world. This hate drives us. It pushes us to outdo one another, but at the same time it demotivates us. This hate, is powerful.

But at the same time, I learnt about love.
I love how people, just strangers, come together at the start of their university lives to become friends, forming cliques and going through hardship together. I love how lively and vibrant the university is with activities happening all around. I love the freedom when it comes to studying. I love the fact that I have the opportunity to have fun with my friends everyday at school. I love how NUS provides convenient transportation services despite the overdemand at peak periods. I love how we are all driven to perform our best during examination. I love the cheap and delicious food in NUS. I love the people around me, looking past their flaw and seeing their beauty, their sincerity and friendliness. I love seeing how people find love in school, a few of them (seniors) are engaged/married now. I love the fact that we are one of the most recognised education systems in the world.
I've learnt to love people and things around me.

This love. I will love it if I have the courage and ability to apply this to my future career. Will I be able to? Will I love my job? Will I love my colleagues and boss? How powerful can this love be? Only time will time.

I believe most of us hate readily, but I urge everyone to try and love as well. It seems to be easier to be a hater than a lover. A simple act of commenting on NUSWhispers, how many of you are haters and how many of your are lovers? 
How many of us will be able to say that we love more than we hate? I know I myself cannot say for sure. What about you? Do think about this and reflect and share your story if you want to. You never know if one day someone asks you this question for interview!

Yes your intuition is on point, I like you. I just don't know how  to explain it but there's something about you that has touched me even though I can't claim to know you so well. There are so many other people around, so many distractions, but none of them have made me feel this way. It may be naivety; it may just be a fleeting phase, but if its right time will show the way. Through all this distance between us.

Well I am an evergreen guy who is currently actively searching for my significant other now that my examinations are over. But I am still a absolute noob at dating, so I figured I should get the best advice from the best people here.

So anyway, they say girls always give off signals to guys they like, and usually it is a bad idea for a guy to confess straight away without noticing said signals. Can someone teach me how to look at these signals? What do girls normally do or hint at to let you know that they like you? Personally, I haven't noticed any signals from any girls so far, and I don't know how many girls I have disappointed already because of this. 

...Either that or I have received absolutely no signals at all. Well played.

I'm the OP of  and I think there may have been some misunderstandings.. I have no issue with other people being open to sex before marriage etc. I am just upset with myself for what I have done in the past, if y'all feel comfortable with it then that's really great! I respect everyone's individual opinion and I didn't mean to impose my views on everyone else. 

I still do feel troubled and conflicted as to whether I should let my boyfriend know about my past if he does ask me about it, but I've noticed that some people commented that it's best to keep mum about it. I really really don't want to hurt my boyfriend at all so I just might do that :) thanks guys!

I had a crush with this evergreen guy. *sigh* but I have no idea if he likes me or not. Dropped tons of hints but he seems to have no reaction T.T. I just feel maybe he's really not interested and maybe I should just give up bahh /:

He will reply my msg as soon as he reads it. But since the day we started texting he only initiated one message. And I sure text tons of random stuffs almost everyday, he replies to every single one of them, even the most random msg. We will say hi in school and he's fine being together with me eating meals, going to classes etc but he will turn all awkward if any of his male friends were around and become silent and distant. (Its almost like he don't know me if his friends are around).

Except his best friend. Somehow he told his best friend about me until his best friend always give me a hinting smile everytime he sees me.

I even attempted to asked him out but he either claims the activity sounds boring or asked who else is going. Whether if its someone he knows or he don't know he will most likely reject saying awkward. If I said oh i never invite anyone else he will have tons of other excuses to reject me. ): We went out once though, it was a common friend who initiated the outing but he thought I was the one who initiated it. And he was like so nice accompanying me home late at night 1 hour trip. And then he rejected all other requests liao even though he's still active in replying all my msgs );

I think the last thing I have not done is to confessed I liked him. o.o...but I'm still a very shy girl inside and I would rather the guy to confess. >.<

I hope if he ever reads this post, at least give me an answer? >.< Yes or No also okay bahh.

tldr: have a crush on evergreen guy, no progress after 2 sems. Feeling that I should give up. ): *sad*

She is called #.

Recently I got to know #. She was quite beautiful. I gained an interest in her looks and personality.

Two weeks passed and # actually asked if I fell for her. I answered yes. She said she'd only allow me to continue the relationship if I give her "one good night of fun".

I haven't exactly asked her what it means, but I've no idea.

Please help.

so i broke up with my boyfriend (with whom i've been tgt since jan) sometime in july and because we are in the same tutorial class i see him very often, and this makes it hard for me to completely forget about him. i still think of him from time to time, and i sometimes wonder how it would be like if we were still together. does this mean i still have feelings for him?

With the multiverse theory, there will be a universe out there where we are together.

We'd still be spending our days together, laughing about things we read on the internet and maybe relaxing in hall. Maybe we'll go out to dinner, somewhere significant like we always used to. We'd trade notes like we do every year, and I'd add it to my ever growing pile of gifts from you. On rainy days you'd shelter me from the thunder and we'd cuddle and play video games until it was over. In this universe, we wouldn't have ended like we did. They say time heals, but I say time helps us to forget. Forget how everything felt when we were together, forget the promises we made that we never kept. But we never truly heal.

One day I hope we can meet up, and we can talk like we used to. One day when the pain has subsided, one day when we stop hurting.

Serious question. Evergreen guy here wanna ask a girl out after the exams to get to know her better. I kinda like her but i wanna find out more about her personality, interests etc, nothing romantic yet. How should I go about doing this? Like should i ask in person? Or will a whatsapp msg do? Is it ok to say something like "would you like to have lunch with me on this day and time?" Anything else to include? Also, if she says no, does this constitute to rejection? Thanks for reading and appreciate your responses.

Look man... 

If all you did every time I tried to talk to you in the past was look at your phone and avoid talking to me, and ignored me when I tried just being friendly, I got the message.

These days down the road, if you'd expect me to say hi to you every time I walk past you, sorry man, I can do that to everyone else, but I won't want to waste being friendly to someone who didn't give a shit.

You took those es mods, you should know very well how to read others' body languages. You should also know very well that others are reading you as well.

There's this classmate of mine who takes CM2142. Every Monday he would saunter into the lecture hall and have a seat.

I began to grow slightly fond of this smart guy who I will just abbreviate as "VH".

However, speaking to other batchmates revealed the other, more perverse side of him. He would regularly make fun of everyone, be it lecturer or tutor. He would snigger at how easy the module is. He would also put on airs suggesting how smart he is together with his friend, who I respect.

Soon I lost interest in "VH" until I heard recently that he was into gay porn.

Today, I say for my CM2142 exam. The essay question was difficult. I know I can't beat "VH".

But it's all over now, for "VH" is gone from my life. At least I know I can beat "VH" in decency and character.

I am sick and tired of being the bottom of my friend's list. Every time i ask him to do something with me, he always seems to have an excuse to not be able to make it. I feel like i'm completely not even regarded as a friend, that he will gladly meet with his other friends but not me, rather play games than do anything with me. He's rude and never admits he's wrong. Or if he did, he always gives the "i'm just not this kind of person, so dont expect anything from me" kind of answer. 

I know i should stop contacting him completely, but i dont have much other friends. Tell me how do i get over him and make healthier friends? Esp now that i've alr graduated. Please keep your witty and mean comments to yourself, i am already feeling down as it is.

Confession time

Our mutual friends all pretty much think we have an ideal relationship and tell us how lucky we are to have each other.

All I do is cry when I'm alone because I don't think I'm with the right person. And they don't even know that anything's wrong...

I've been in a relationship with my bf for almost 4 years. Let's call him A. All seems well until recently when my mum had a serious "talk" with me abt how she doesn't think A is my "destined one". Reasons being 1. A doesn't seem like a man enough guy who I can entrust my future with... Yes I admit that A can be quite timid and unsure of himself at times, but I fully understand his insecurities and have always been encouraging him. I believe that it just takes time for him to mature. Reason 2. A doesn't pay for our dates...We like to split the bill, and mum feels that that shouldn't be the case in an official relationship. But given that A's family is not very well off and he has yet to start working, I don't think I should be imposing any financial burden on him now. 

There are also many other reasons that are too trivial to even talk abt :( but what my mom said really saddens me...I thought my parents liked him and I ve always been very sure abt this relationship. Despite his flaws, A has always been a very supportive, loving and doting boyfriend. And I absolutely loathed it when my mum insists that he is not the one for me. I hate myself even more for being affected by her words and casting doubt on my relationship. ;( I'm just...so sad right now...have been bottling up all my feelings for days! I usually share all my emotional baggages with my bf...but I can nvr bring myself to tell him all those hurtful comments from my mum.

And why???...just why did my mum have to pick the exam period to tell me all these ;( haiz...

What should I do? ;(

Well said. Then again, some girls love being 清高 by saying that they have saved it blablabla. Like as if it was such a big deal. 

Its already the 20th century, who cares whether you saved it or not. People lead different lives so stop putting yourself at a high pedestal by saying "oh im so ashamed but phew i didnt lose it, but i did other things". 

IMO, virginity is not only just about the hymen. If a girl has done any kind of sex e.g oral, heavy petting etc, you are already not a virgin. 

Saving your hymen does not mean anything. At the same time, losing your hymen does not mean anything bad either. It just means that they have loved and lost, or that they love their current partner and want to take it to the next stage.

Sure, you should not pressure a girl to give you her first time, but if it happens, it will happen. Virginity is just a social construct to prevent people from overpopulating. Before such constructs, people married at age 15/16. 

Nuff said.

Recently I got together with someone much older than me. So far, he is being a gentleman about everything, and I also read online that more matured men tend to be more affectionate and all. Thing is, I'm not really sure whether he is "preying" on me because I'm younger, or really thinks I'm interesting and therefore likes me. My gut feeling tells me he means no harm, but news around the world tell me I should be wary. How to be both carefree and careful about the relationship? Can anyone give any advice about this? I'm feeling quite tired from overthinking.

Well the thing is, how physically closer can you be with someone other than sex? How more "open" emotionally and physically can you be?

Personally, I keep it because I believe that I want to share it only with one person whom I love and who loves me so much that we have promised to commit to each other through thick and thin to the end ( i'm one of those who do not believe in divorce). Why would I share a special moment with someone who does not reach that level of closeness? I think that kind of love that requires commitment deserves to be celebrated. Our culture often describes love as merely a feeling or emotion. I think love is more than that.

Also, even if the notion that "sex/ vitginity is valuable" is a social construct, so what? what's wrong with that?( I do not think it is, though, I think it is there for a reason) Why can't I keep some part of me special and reserved? A VIP room is special because people set aside a special area for special people, and only certain people can come in. It makes it special. Why can't we reserve sex for a special person who deserve it? Sure we can save other moments, i guess, though as of now i can't think of anything better. 

Based on experience, I regretted that I kissed my ex. I shared a moment with someone that I barely talk to now. I do not regret it to the point that I see myself as not pure anymore etc etc or that it affects my self-esteem etc. Just that I wished I did not easily share that intimate moment with someone in the heat of the moment. Probably because I want to see it as more than just physical pleasure and I think it is an expression of love (and I think love requires commitment)

On the topic of rape, I agree that a raped woman is not of less value than a virgin. I know the pain and shame is extremely hard to bear with, but demeaning sex/ virginity is not the answer. Like, even children who do not even understand what sex means are traumatised by sexual abuse. Their tendency is to avoid the rapist. They sure do not like it. It is natural to feel sad/traumatised when you are sexually abused. 
Just like when people are slashed, they bleed, they feel pain. 
Would we say that "it's okay,the cut will heal anyway " and do nothing? 
No, we should recognise that it is a painful experience and try as much as we can to heal them, though we cant do it completely. There will still be unsightly scars that make them want to hide at home
People who look down on the victims are like those who mock the slash victim because of the physical scars.
 It is unsightly, maybe. We might have to admit that rape victims might have emotional scars that affects them.
Instead of dismissing their pain, we should show compassion, understanding and empathy. Each of us are broken in some ways anyway.

How do I delete conversations in Letterbox? It's getting a little cluttered in there. ><

Actually, I can relate to what the poster of  has said. I have used a couple of dating apps, and have gotten similar results. The bulk of my matches were with China, Vietnamese or Malaysian girls. There were a couple of Singaporean girls but they were much more closed off.

In uni as well, it's pretty hard to score a date with a local girl. I don't think it's about money or looks as much as it is about status and popularity. I guess I might end up marrying a foreign bride as well.

To  i have to disagree with you. It is sound advice. 

I've personally been through the same. My bf and i know each other's dark secrets. One night stands, cheating, yeah. It took a bit of time but we accepted each other 100% because we realise we love each other for who we are NOW and the past is just that. The past. Nothing can change it and therefore it shouldn't matter. What matters is the love we share and our current commitment to each other

Do you choose the person you really want but run the risk of rejection or choose the one who loves you a lot but you know you will not love as much as the one you really want?

Suddenly realisation that my current crush who takes a day to reply me might actually be interested in me cos my ex-crush who talks and hang out with me everyday also rejected me. Girls are complicated. Never ask never know. #positive mindset

Follow your heart, follow your heart. You told your friend to follow his heart, but what about you NATO!? You are just a hypocrite who don't dare to face reality and admit your love. In the past, we agreed to be truthful to each other, however you have learnt to tell lies now =( . If you don't cherish me, I'm really gonna disappear from your life entirely. My way of revenge is to become an attractive girl that is desired by many guys and live on better then you!

To  If your friend is not a b-baller, model or any role that requires height to be advantageous, he probably needs a gf to feel secure. That's likely his area of insecurity, if not, I am not sure why he is feeling so low. You can try narrowing down his insecurity to its roots to figure out how to offer a new perspective.

I am shorter than your friend, and my height has been stagnant since secondary 1. It has never been an issue of concern to me. It definitely helps to build up confidence in oneself, but I don't have any tangible advice to dispense. I always think I am smart, calm, funny, handsome, and have a whole lot of other awesome characteristics. Some people are just innately more insecure than others, and it is really hard to get them to man up.

Two other things for your friend to note:
1. The more you show that you are affected, the easier it is to attract things that affect you. Take things in your stride, and give the "hahaha c'mon shoot me more, like I give a fuck" attitude.
2.  Maybe it also helps to be politely vulgar to people who are mocking him. I always say "Fuck you lah" in a friendly/nonchalant tone to silly things, silly people, or mildly offensive stuff. Don't remember things turning confrontational, or anyone trying to step over my head. 

Your friend can learn to be comfortable with laughing at himself, and also be more confident in saying no. Grumpy cat is your best mentor.

Recently my boyfriend found out that I lost my virginity through ONS with a guy I met during orientation last year and is devastated. I really love him a lot and do not wish to lose him and even hope to marry him in the future. While I know it's my mistake for sleeping with a random guy but I really do think he is overreacting. If he really loves me so much why can't he forgive me? What should I do? 
-
 
If you are wondering how I'm doing, yes, I'm doing well these days.

They always say... When you meet someone new, you forget the hurt from the past? Once upon a time, you were the one who helped me heal. Now, someone else has taken your place.

One year later, I am happier. I, too, hope you are in a good place. :) 

NUS holds a lot of memories for me. Even after graduation, it brings people together, coincidentally. I'm thankful for this.

My exams are over, but I'm scared.

For every single paper the past week, I screwed them up badly. I lost so many marks across all the papers, and I'm so scared about how far my CAP will be bombed. I told my bf, and he told me to not care about it, that I can't do anything about it anymore. I understand, I understand. But I just can't help feeling scared. I have a scholarship hounding behind me. I cannot lose it. I just can't help feeling scared. I don't know why. I've already done my best. I know I can't do anything about it. I want to stop feeling scared. But I can't! I don't get it.

I have no one else to share how terrified I am now. My parents hate each other's guts, they can't even talk to each other properly without descending into an argument.  My mother hurled vulgarities at my dad this morning, while my dad made "she's crazy" signs behind her back. Sometimes I just wish that I can turn back time, to the time when the sky was never hazy, when life was biscuits and cookies and fun and happiness. And I just hate myself for being so weak.  There are many other people who are facing worse problems than me now. I can't stand being so pathetically weak, so scared, so tired. Screw everything.

Those who say that if you're confident, whatever you wear, ppl will think you look good. I disagree. I'm average, has a tummy, and nerd. You can say I'm confident. I speak loudly. I speak with vigour. I like making friends. Yet, what if I'm in admin pants and singlet. Compare me with a good looking guy in the same clothes. Which do you prefer?  Of course is the other guy because he's more appealing and delicious. People are always judgemental no matter what they say.

I know this gonna waste some of your time... But anyway if you guys bother to read... carry on. 

I have this year 1 friend here who sometimes rant about height issues.(He is around 1.7m). 

He sometimes tell me stuff like getting towered,feeling out of place when standing beside his friends or even some girls.

 I have given him alot of advice such as height is not everything and that what matters is one's character, yet he does not fully accept it, or just take it with a pinch of salt.

I do not blame him for lamenting because he himself has been mocked by several " tall" classmates about his height and this has hurt his ego over time.

This has become a point of my concern because he is a good friend of mine. He is a nice person, just that he is bothered by this issue lately. I would like to help him get over this issue (if possible help him to grow) but i know that the latter is largely attributed to genetics.

As such, anyone of you here have any better advice to help him? He is only year 1 and I do not really want this good friend of mine to be bothered by this issue for a long time.

Thank you readers for your attention. (To those 'tall' people mocking my friend, dont be cocky, what goes around comes around).

Response to the comment in 

You are contradicting yourself here, saying that you are not insisting on  OP "having any other contact" while saying that she "should tell the guy".

I would feel really creeped out if I were the OP. There aren't enough facts here to assume that a 5 min talk will resolve the problem, like you seem to believe. I'm actually curious as to what makes you think a talk will straighten things out. Certainly that is one possibility, but we can go to the other end of the spectrum and say that he might be so enraged as to hurt the OP when the OP tells him the truth. 

Staying quiet is not something that gives that guy the right to do all that. Like you said, there are many reasons for acting a certain way. The same can be said for the OP as well. You seem to presume that the OP is behaving like this for no particular reason. You may not understand why the OP is staying quiet, perhaps the OP is frightened, perhaps the OP has a traumatic experience, there are all sorts of possible reasons. 

I don't think there is a need to tell because this is obviously just a problem to this guy, which is why he has been disturbing the OP. In fact, I think it is an issue he needs to resolve by himself, by reflecting upon his actions and not just the author's behaviour. If the guy doesn't understand her silence, he probably won't understand even if the OP explains it. 

Nonetheless, even if there is a strong case for OP's obligation to tell the guy, it doesn't justify his actions or words.

I cheated 
 
Yes i did. I should feel disgusted, terrible and remorseful but somehow among the guilt and shame, i felt the longing for intimacy once again, the passionate foreplay, cuddles, and the hot sex..

It still bothers me that we are so different - in terms of sexual longing and desire.. he hates foreplay and cuddling but I on the other hand yearn for it every single time.

Gone are the holding of hands, the whisper in the ear, the loving gaze, the embrace, the stolen kisses and the hot sex. They simply vanished, lost in the pursuit of other seemingly important life's goals.

I'm messed up. Help me.

My life is in a freaking mess right now! I got into a rebound relationship after being rejected by my crush. She isn't my cup of tea to begin with but I took away all her first time, in the name of loneliness. I don't feel anything for her, yet I kissed her passionately and I don't find her sexually appealing, yet I stole her virginity. When she woke up and hugged me as if I had became her prize possession, I felt disgusted by the thoughts that I will have to spend the rest of my life with her.I just want to avoid her right now. But she is spamming 30 over missed calls every single day!

Hey girl, if you see this post, please forget me because everything is a mistake. Don't drive me to the edges, I will really go crazy....

So here's the guy's side of the story (long story ahead).

I met her earlier this year, when we were still freshies. There's something about being a first-year that I miss: the magical feeling of having a whole uni life ahead filled with promise. 

Anyway, I was really attracted to her and asked her out. We hung out quite a few times after that - lunch, llaollao, escape room.. I remember how we texted everyday and supported each other through midterms and finals. How, despite our very different courses, we found common interest in horror movies - sharing and discussing our favorites late into the night. 

We talked about everything. We talked about the ideal number of kids to have in a family. We argued over the correct way to express a facepalm using emoji. When she ran a fever I rushed to bring her medicine. But what I remember the most is how we agreed to go on exchange together - I even asked her to cook for me, and she responded that she didn't mind!

I guess I will never know if that meant anything to you at all. But it meant the world to me.

Fast forward. The new semester came. Year 2. When the workload starts piling up, it's easy to lose touch of the people around you. By the time I realized, we had become more distant than I ever imagined. Every conversation ended abruptly with my texts going unreplied. When I asked her out to a special event, she told me to ask another girl, a mutual friend. It cut me deep.

As the weeks went by I became increasingly confused and upset. 
"Why are you ignoring me?" 
"It hurts."
Nothing seemed to move her. That's when I decided I would have to go and find her in person to get an explanation at least. 

I found her sitting in the LT after her lecture. We had small talk but I couldn't bring myself to ask her the questions that had been suffocating me for months. Just when I thought I had maybe started things going on the right track again, she texted me afterwards that it was uncomfortable for her and never to do that again.

I was crushed.

What was I supposed to do? If you didn't want to be friends anymore, just tell me early. Yes, it would have hurt, but I would have been fine after that. Leaving me hanging was such a cowardly thing to do - absolving yourself of responsibility at the expense of someone else.

I won't lie. Things got a little ugly in the end and I swore at her (through msg). Judge me if you will but I did what I had to do.

Judging from her whispers post, it's evident that she treats friendships as disposable: something you can neglect when you don't feel like being a friend anymore, and reconnect when it suits you. I guess that's where our similarities end. I can only hope that she treats her other friends better.

We were together for awhile, though it seemed like we've known each other for ages. 

Even though we've had to part ways, and I'm now almost engaged to someone else, I dont regret knowing you, I dont regret any of the things we did together. 

I have always been in the nosexbeforemarriage boat but right now, my only regret is that you will not be my first. It sounds crazy to me, and I know if it really comes down to it I wont actually do it before marriage, but perhaps in a noreligion world, I maybe would. 

Despite not being able to be together because reasons, despite me getting married to someone else, I wish you would be my first. But you cant, and can never be. And i will try to live with that. 

I miss you. And I love you. Always.

I am a Singaporean guy and I have been using Chinese dating apps and been talking to many Chinese girls (girls from China). I have went out dating different Chinese girls (going for meals, movies and parks) for more than 10 girls already. Most of them are quite friendly and they are friends to me now. If I'm not wrong, I haven't even dated a single Singaporean girl yet. I have also been using other dating apps like Tinder and Paktor, but I say that it is much harder to ask a Singaporean out for a date. This is because I feel that SG girls typically have much higher expectations, and I also tried asking female classmates for lunch and stuff before or after lessons in school. The problem is even if they are free, they often rejected me. I just get the feeling that they are quite skeptical that I am trying to chase them, so they give excuses that they have something on and quickly 'siam' from me. This explains why I resort to dating Chinese girls as I think they are friendlier, despite having cultural differences.

So I have 3 questions here:
1: Do you see anything wrong asking Chinese girls out for dates? (I don't do any hanky panky, it's just a normal date)
2: Do you agree that SG girls are harder to chase than other nationalities?
3: What are the implications if I eventually get together and married to a foreigner? (e.g. what happens to their family overseas, her citizenship, buying houses)

With reference to  
This isn't really a response to the post, but I identify with OP fully. I feel like I am in the exact same situation as you, my ex pressured me a lot and my new/current boyfriend is more conservative and respects me way more. He treats me as if I'm really precious to him and he makes me feel very comfortable around him.

However, in my past relationship, my boyfriend used to force me to do things... I am a bit embarrassed to say this but let's just say that I gave him my body and everything but not my virginity. I'm so glad I didn't give him my virginity, but now I feel immense regret that I gave him all that.. I don't dare to tell my current bf about my past because it'll definitely change his impression of me. I want to keep it in too but sometimes I feel so much pain and anger with myself and I feel guilty for keeping secrets from my current bf. It's easy for people to say 'if he truly loves you, he'll accept you' but this is probably a big issue to him, as it is to me :( should I remain quiet about it? If he asks me about my past should I lie? (it could be a white lie..)

This might sound a bit over-whispered but I'm really so affected/upset by it that I need some opinion on what to do/rant it out. 

During my 4th paper, I found out the guy I was having a thing with admitted he just wanted the sex but not the emotional intimacy. I noticed he had been keeping his distance from me for a while now. Initially, I thought it was cos he was busy with sch but he continued this behaviour even after I knew he submitted his paper. This prompted me to confront him about it. He said he didn't want to hurt me and he has no space for emotional intimacy at the moment. 

I admit, I felt really hurt. But I didn't know how to break it to him that I was using him for the same reasons too. I think we're on a cold war now. 

Should I try to find him and talk to him in person? Or should I just let it be and not talk to him until the situation cools off on its own? (I'm sorry, I don't really want a feminist response to this cos, let's face it: men are just interested in sex. I've never met a man who wasn't so yeah, don't bother trying to "protect" me from him in that sense.)

I am really down today. Today was suppose to be a fun and happy day, we had plans to go on a short getaway. The hotel tickets were already booked when we broke off with one another. Although we didn't make any contacts with each other ever since then, I could still see from social media that he still carried on with that trip. I don't know if it's with a new girl or a buddy. I know whatever the case is, it's none of my business anymore. Please don't tell me to forget about him and let go. I am trying my best to do that! I am just very sad, I have no one to talk to about this. I let want to let this out and feel better. Sorry for ranting!

My boyfriend got an invite to a wedding recently and he's gonna go by himself. We've just got together for a few months so im not sure if i should expect him to bring me along? Does it mean anything if he doesn't invite me or am i thinking too much lol  
-
 
A lot of ppl use the saying "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take" when it comes to chasing after guys/girls. But i dunno if i should carry on pursuing my crush, especially since he's not really that responsive to me whenever i whatsapp him for module related stuff. Dunno if he always texts like that or it's just for me only, as a sign that he's not interested. But he's a really cute and funny guy during the few times i talked to him in lecture and tutorials and i really want to get to know him better. I know for sure he's single (don't ask me how, i just know haha). I probably won't see him again after exams next monday so should i just yolo and ask him out for a meal or something? Halp plz! :(

I lost my virginity to a random girl I met on Tinder. Worth it.

What do you call a guy who is in love with a girl, willingly doing many things for her out of love, despite knowing that she is attached? Stupid guy? 
-
 
Feeling really confused...i just got attached to a wonderful guy for a couple of months and hope that he's the one i can share the rest of my life with. I've met his family and his close friends know of my existence. However, i have no presence on his social media. I'm not asking him to be facebook official, just thought it'd be nice to post pictures of us together once in a while. And btw, his relationship status is still single but it could be that he forgot to change it. Not sure if i should ask him about it?

Granted, he's not the type who's active on fb and instagram but i can't help to feel that he does not want to let others know about me. And he did tell me to wait for  a while and to give him more time. Does this mean that he is still unsure of our relationship and keeping his options open, or should i stop being so bothered about something so insignificant?Afterall, i guess it's what happens offline that's more important right? I mean he did say that he was serious about us and hinted at marriage too....

To  
I am a girl, and because of an ex-boyfriend who kept pressurising me to have sex (but was unsuccessful; this constant pressurising was the reason why I called it off), I viewed my virginity lightly then, and even considered just giving it to him when I was still with him. His constant pressurising made it seem as though it was nothing much (which I believe that's the opinion of many - we all have the right to our own opinions). 
It was only when I met my current boyfriend (after breaking up with my ex) that I was so relieved I kept my virginity, and I now see the value of it. I guess I can call myself a convert on this issue. A few days ago I literally looked down there (self sex ed lesson I guess - sorry if it's TMI), and I realised that I have never seen it properly before. It dawned on me how precious and private these parts are, and many of us (virginity believers or not) may not see the beauty of it. I feel that we should have more self-love, we're beautiful creatures. Treat yourself with care.
My current boyfriend is very conservative, and does not take kissing lightly as well, so I guess that also influenced me. I'm actually less conservative than him and has initiated things that he wasn't ready for yet. (Maybe my boyfriend is a special case)
But what my past relationship and my current relationship have taught me was that there's a reason why you should keep your virginity until marriage (but of course you really have to love the person when you decide to marry him/her, else, the marriage will probably fail). It is mainly because sex is an act of love, an act of the deepest connection you could ever have with someone, and you really want to do it with someone you love very much, because you will remember it forever.
While I have not lost my virginity yet, I lost my first kiss to my ex (and a couple of other acts), and from time to time I get reminded of it, and I regret it. In fact, sometimes I even feel disgust (obviously it didn't end well - I'm not speaking for those whose past relationships ended well) that it happened. I'm sure I will remember it forever, and regret it forever. My current boyfriend is an absolutely great guy, and I wished I never had these bad memories from my past relationship, and have saved it for him instead. Of course I can't undo these things I've done. Now I'm certainly saving my virginity for him on our wedding night (or if anything happens which I hope not, the next person I will love). 
So, you will certainly remember your virgin experience as well. So are you sure you want to give this up to someone you may not be together forever/love forever? (not saying that marriage lasts forever either - that's why you really need to marry someone that you really love and can foresee yourselves building a life together) You are going to remember your first time forever (feel free to disagree with me on this). And what if... Just what if, it doesn't work out between you guys? You will bring this memory with you forever, and you just can't erase it, and this regret may follow you for a long time to come. If you can't bear this thought, don't create this memory.
And if after it falls apart you meet someone fabulous and someone you love even more than your previous, then now what? Whenever you both engage in sexual acts, you will always be reminded of your first time with someone else. At that point in time, would you have wished you have saved it for this perfect person instead? There's no "start over" then.
I have to stress that I'm not coming from a religious angle (sorry if the part on beautiful creatures seems so), and that I am a free-thinker. I'm just highlighting how because we always keep those parts private, we may not actively see the beauty of it, and how we should really let only someone we love very deeply handle it. We all have private parts, something that belongs only to ourselves - we're equal like that, I guess. Something we can truly call "our own". It should be something personal, something vulnerable, something you reveal to someone you really trust. This is something I really disliked about my ex - the fact that he's always so open to giving something so private to him to others and that he even influenced me to think like him. 
I don't see how virginity should not be held onto even when someone is 24. Love yourself enough to acknowledge that your current relationship, no matter how great it is, may not be your last, and it is a risk to create a permanent memory of something that may be temporary. Choose wisely. 
Believe me, I have seen virginity lightly before and I didn't realise how precious it could be. And now I do. To have a self sex-ed lesson only at 20 is a tad late, and I can already imagine how inexperienced I can be on my wedding night and just how much I really don't know about sex, but hey, I think it will be a sweet (albeit awkward) memory to learn along with your partner - it's going to be sweet if you guys really love each other. 
PS. I'm sorry if this post has offended anyone (virginity believers or not/religious or not) - I certainly do not mean to, and I'm just sharing my thoughts and my own experience. Feel free to disagree, it's a free world.

There is nothing wrong for couples to celebrate monthiversaries. I, as an evergreen "celebrate" my monthiversaries or sometimes weeklysaries of being single.

In light of all the discussion on "sex before marriage" lately, I thought I would just offer my 2-cent.  
I am a girl. I went out with a guy on Tinder ( undergrad from another school), told him straight away that I can only be friends with benefits, we lost virginity to each other on the third date.
My point is that people have wildly different interpretations of sex. Some view it as an emotional act, as it rightly should be. But at this stage in my life, I consider it as a biological act, to simply satisfy natural urges with a respectful consenting partner. Besides, I really cannot find time at all to connect deeply with a guy loh. I feel suffocated by the bell curve and scared to death by competitors every time I walk around Biz. ( I might be paranoid but Biz really humbles you to the very core)

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

Why do some couples find the need to celebrate monthiversaries? It's lame (and you're not 12). I mean anniversaries are completely fine. But months? Why would you even celebrate being together for a month or two? What's so significant about it? You're just showing people that you lack confidence in the relationship. And you think it stops after the first year? No. It goes on to 16,17,18 months. Anniversaries are suppose to be special. Celebrating it every month isn't. It totally defeats the purpose. Is your relationship so TENUOUS that you need to celebrate each successful month? Sigh, has this what relationships have come to? Oh and please don't leave comments about how people have different ways of celebrating their love. Totally aware of that. But this is just beyond stupid.

To  dk how but stunningly I feel like im in this same situation (of the receiving side of the silence) - couldn't it be basic courtesy to like inform him/her that you made this decision so he/she can understand and respect your choice instead of "hey i think its the best for both of us" in your own mind without him/her knowing what happened or what went wrong? He/she might not be able to tell if you want to dump him/her or did he/she make you angry or its just exam period. Its painful to let you know on the receiving end.

Dear my first love,

I just realised that no matter how much time has separated us, no matter where we are and how far apart we are, my feelings towards you will not fade. The moment you locked your place in my heart, it will be there forever. I thought I would soon forget about you but I was lying to myself. You are like a tattoo who is forever imprinted on my soul. 

Sincerely: a hopeless romantic just for you

Your finals are ending soon.

You are filled with DETERMINATION.

hang in there, guys. :)

I come from a pretty privileged background and this is something that most of my friends don't know. Since young, I've always told people that I stay at Clementi despite having a Upper Bukit Timah address. Only a handful of my closest friends from secondary/jc know about this, and maybe some people from army since everybody's address appear on nominal rolls every now and then. Despite entering uni, I'm still having trust issues, I continue telling people i stay in clementi and pray that they don't ask for the exact location. Also, despite having my license 2-3 years ago, I haven't driven any friends around, for fear that they'll judge me when they see me driving my dad's audi. Sorry, if this sounds like a humble brag. But what I don't understand is why some people can be so open to show off their wealth when it is not something they work for. And because of this lack of trust, I've not made much close friends in uni, since its always hard to connect with others when I'm deliberating hiding part of my lives from them. Do you all think this is the right thing to do? Just to clarify, I'm not hiding my wealth because Im humble, its merely because I don't feel that I should be proud of wealth that it is not earned  by myself. PS: I would happily drive audi around school if I earned that with my own ability.

Man, being single during exam period really opens your eyes. Call me a passive loser, but I have never pursued any girls before in my clique because 1) I am afraid of rejection 2) don't want to spoil the group harmony and 3) don't like being fake and ingenuine to the rest just because I want to chase a girl. Thus, when I see my fellow friends pulling a number 3 on me, I understand the urge to fuck is real, and on the same side of the coin, everyone is doing it. But on the flip side of the coin, I feel angry towards him for disregarding my feelings and the group harmony just for his own desires. I may sound like a sourgrape here, but who can blame me after witnessing the death of 2 of my study groups after this sort of thing happening. And now I am always studying in school alone, because all of my cliques are all scattered because of dumb politics like this. I am also angry at myself for noticing such things and not following the crowd, and as such I am still a miserable single at 22. I am angry at myself, for not changing who I am, to be manipulative and obnoxious, so I can get pretty girls like all the other way less good looking guys do. I am angry at myself, for not pursuing my own happiness, and caring too much about others' feelings and being too passive for my own good. If only there is a magical pill that can automatically turn off my regard to inconsequential things like 'group harmony', 'who I really am' and 'my moral values' and turn me into the same obnoxious , inconsiderate and loud person I vowed to never become, just so I can get a little happiness of my own.

Whenever I text my crush she takes forever to reply!? She will flirt with me occasionally and would text in a cutesy way. Like adding extra letters like helloooo, yeapppp!(lol I dk).
I am so sick of waiting for so long for a reply.

The loneliest period is reading week and exam weeks. 

You see groups of friends studying together in the library, sometimes staying overnight to chiong and have dinner and supper together. They can have so much fun even while studying in school, while you study alone or study at home because all your friends have closer friends and you can only study alone forever...

Dear op of  , or to whoever needs an opinion on the matter that their bf/gf doesn't allow them to have interaction with the opposite gender. He/She is just your partner for now. Assuming that things doesn't go well and both of you decide to go your separate ways, the person controlling your interaction with the opposite gender is going to hurt your interest in the long run.

Assuming that you are more than likely to get attached after a break up, you will definitely have to know people of the opposite gender and you just eliminated yourself out of the competition by keeping to yourself because you oh so love your current partner so much that you are afraid to hurt his fragile feelings.

To come up with a pragmatic deduction for his actions, he is likely to be knowing more people just in case things turn sour. He will still have other people that he chase after. So why not just do the same thing that your partner is doing?

 I might not be the best of people to provide advice coming from an evergreen, but here's my two cents as a fellow bro: That's an obvious no-no. 

It might not feel like it, but it's a short-lived infatuation. You might be attracted by her looks, her personality or anything really that caught your eye. Don't let that confuse you. If you don't even know her that well, you might find that she's not the one for you. 

Worse still, if she doesn't have an interest in you beyond friends. It may end up making your current friendship awkward or even end it if she's the type who avoids dealing with these awkward situations.

Not discouraging you from going for her though. Go out with her a few times for lunch or something, the simpler the better. Avoid movies unless you'll spend time talking over a meal afterwards. Use that chance to talk to her and get to know her personally. Engage in some htht once she's comfortable enough to share it with you and learn more about each other.

After a few one-on-one outings, if you still feel the same way as before, then go ahead and confess. Better yet if you can "sense" that she likes being around you. Don't rush it. There is no time limit to getting into a relationship. You have your whole life ahead of you so just enjoy the process. All the best~

NUS meetme is such a failure. Could future cs3216 students come up with a similar app for ppl to make new friends / find ppl with similar interests / plan group outings etc? I would be the first to sign up!

I realise I am a very attention-seeking person. I expect to be the centre of attention and want to be praised by my friends, or at least want to be the topic of discussion. Subconsciously I wish that people who are close to me make their lives revolve around me. I hate this... Makes me feel that I am so selfish. My self-esteem is so low and I constantly look to others for validation. 

I find it hard to accept not getting what I want and I feel desperate to have company and be around people. I feel jealous that everyone except me has a better social life. I overthink for most situations and am too emotionally sensitive. For example, when someone doesn't reply my texts I assume they are angry with me. When others don't include me I feel as if I'm not important in their lives. I always need other people to tell me I'm good in order to believe that I'm good, and I have this bad habit of believing everything that others say.

I can feel that I am overanalysing situations. Once it so happened that a friend A agreed to study together with another friend B. They were studying alone. Another day the 3 of us were studying together and B left after some time. I asked A whether he wants to stay back to study with me but he refused and said he will study alone. This made me feel my friend hates me and I have been ruminating about this. None of the others probably even give a thought about it.

I want to stop this behaviour. I am scared it will spoil my friendships since my friends already know that I appear desperate and perhaps they will stop being friends with me. I would really appreciate some advice on how to stop being so needy and feel happy about myself.

 No wonder I see so few girls on Letterbox :O and the only reason I go to apps like Tinder or Letterbox is to look at other girls' photos to know roughly where my appearance stands :c

My boyfriend constantly talks to other girls and he seems to like the attention a lot. He doesn't allow me to talk to other guys as he thinks that all of them are trying to hit on me. It has come to the point where I no longer have any close guy friends - either they are attached and i tend to stay away or that they're not attached and my boyfriend disapproves of me talking to them. Recently I met this guy on letterbox. I'm not interested in him or straying from my boyfriend but i do enjoy talking to him and the attention that my boyfriend fails to provide. I've mentioned it to my boyfriend countless of times but he just brushes it off as me being overly attached. I've no idea how to deal with it. Please help.

i really find it very distressing that girls would only talk to me when they require help with work. after exams or when the sem ends, they would just disappear :( any attempts to steer conversation towards non work topics would just be ignored. Im not trying to sleep with you, im just trying to make a friend :'c

I agree with , although for a different reason. The issue isn't really about sex, it's about what each of you want in the relationship. We all want different things, what you want may be different from what your partner wants. But more importantly, what you want now may conflict with what you want in the longer-term. For instance, wanting sexual pleasure now may come in the way of wanting a sustainable long-term meaningful relationship. May. 

So it's about the relative importance you place on your current wants vs future wants vs partner. If you place so much importance on your current wants and your partner compromises, then all's good. But if your partner doesn't, then you have to weigh how important your wants are vs how important your partner is to you. If your current wants are so important that you would seek other means to fulfill them, then perhaps you guys are not suited for each other after all. Or put another way, since your partner views her wants as far more important than yours, then maybe you guys aren't suitable for each other. 

Not saying either of you is "wrong" or anything, just saying that we all have to make decisions about what we feel is most important. If we can't find a compromise between conflicting desires or work things out, then maybe it's time to find someone else who has the same wants as you or is willing to compromise.

We have not been in contact for a long time. There are times when I really really cannot resist sending you a message but eventually I resisted it lol. Because I know it's not a good time for you. Perhaps you are wondering why there was sudden silence, that's because I decided it's the best way for both of us now. 
I hope we will be back in contact soon after u finish ur important exams and I don't mind initiating. I just hope u have not lost interest in me. If u did, I hope you can find someone nice who accepts you for who you are. You are truly an amazing person, don't forget that :)

I hope this gets posted.
to the op of  , you're not the only one, I'm exactly like how you described, only difference was that I got into a relationship cos the guy chased really persistently, and I felt I could grow to love him. Once in the relationship, I couldn't feel anything, no attraction no love. I spent exchange Sem trying to run away instead. I have a fear of being alone for good but now I don't seem to have any attraction to any guy, however perfect. And once someone starts chasing and getting closer I lose the attraction to him and start running away.It's conflicting really, the fear of ending up alone, yet really enjoying time going out and being all by myself. anyone else like this too?

People often say, we need a lot of time after a break up for healing even if we're the one who initiated the break up, especially after a long one, mine was about 3 years.

I thought I'd take some time before anyone can make my heart flutter again, it took me > 1 year after my previous one ended.

But now it only took like 2 months and it feels like I'm all ready again, heart also start fluttering liao, but the wisdom of the masses say it's just me being lonely?

I'm surprised myself but really not sure how, should I trust my heart or trust the opinions / advice of the masses?

To 12968.

I was like you. My gf refused and respected her choice. Afterall it would be meaningless if one is forced into it. We all that the hand does substitute the real deal but rather just delays the need. So let me just share with you my solution. I consulted professional help in satisfying my urges. Their services are easily found.

Take your protection, hold your head high and charge into battle. Do what you have to and leave. Dont look back, dont have to let anyone know about it. Satisfy ur needs and done deal. 

Dont have a hook up. It creates unnecessary risk.

Also. Tell your friends you two are still virgins. Nothing to be ashamed off. In fact she will appreciate it. The last thing a girl wants is for her friends to imagine her in bed with her bf.

you say you like me. i also like you. but you don't know that. is it just me making life complicated for both of us? if so, i am sorry.

Sometimes I really don't know what's wrong with me. I can't sustain liking someone for more than a few weeks. Should someone whom I find sufficiently attractive and likeable shows interest in me, I will probably get excited and flattered for the first few weeks, and possible "like him back" for a while, but after which I will not feel the attraction anymore. The worse part is, out of those guys who show interests in me over the past 2 years, I have only felt attracted to 2 of them. The latest guy is near-perfect in terms of maturity level, sense of humour and looks, and I did like him for a while, but right now I'm starting to feel unattracted to him. It's as if I'm getting sick of the same person even though he is actually quite perfect for me. It's been only around two months. Yes I'm still single. I have no idea why I can't seem to love people properly? D: Is anyone facing the same problem?

How do you know when you are missing someone? Is it when you think of them almost all the time? 
How do you distinguish between infatuation, fondness, proximity?

I think I fancy this girl. I really wanna go up to her and just introduce myself but I'm afraid she won't acknowledge me because of the way I look - fat, short, and pretty much not good-looking at all.

Forget all the politically correct  advices.  Those people have no idea what's it's like to be stucked in a relationship with no  physical intimacy. 

It's not pleasant and the worst thing,  it's not something that you can fix (if possible).  You'll be miserable your whole life trying to make things work till you start giving up on it.

Gridditors often use confessionID during chats as a reference point to the confessions, yet NUSWhispers could only search using keyword :(
Just wondering if anyone else feeling annoyed by having to search up down left right for the confession post if no keyword other than confessionID was given?
Would the NUSWhispers developers be nice enough to make the confessions searchable by confessionID please? :D

Just wondering why can't love be as simple as enjoying each other's company while doing simple stuff like watching a drama or walking on the beach.Must it be so complicated that the guy must be the source of entertainment,crack his brain everytime they meet,good looking and tall?guys must be tall,handsome,rich,entertaining.looks like its hopeless for a average looking guy and not even tall(slightly below 1.7m).oh well looks like such thing can only happen for me in dramas

Mugged so hard for a module only to realise that anxiety always gets the better of me. I had my worst paper today. Questions set were supposedly do-able. Tried to plan what to write but when I attempted to do so, ideas started to fly all over the place. I ended up just writing out whatever that came to my mind:( I tried to salvage what I could but I doubt it could make any difference. To make matters worse, the mod has no bell curve. Sigh, why do things always turn out this way for me:(

After one semester, I felt quite sad with myself. Seeing people attending lectures, tutorials, having lunch together makes me feel bad emotionally. I am afraid that people who saw me doing things alone would call me a loner. I hate that feeling. It keeps on affecting me emotionally. Sometimes, I am unable to sleep at night and am afraid of coming to school as I do not want to have that feeling again. Who can advice me on what I should do? I know that studying is the priority here, but this feeling keeps on affecting me. I felt terrible! :(

A girl T has been flirting with me for the past 5-6 months but I did not take any concrete actions and will only flirt back occasionally. I am shy and awkward so I didn't know what to do. She's popular and is always with her very 'outgoing' friends and that is also one of the reasons why I did not approach her. I sort of like her too but theres like no chemistry between her. I always do not know what to say to her when we are alone. 

Whenever I am at her house I would play with her pet dog instead of talking to her cos I dunno what to say. Back when she started flirting with me by saying I am cute etc etc I know I am not. I was a skinny and scrawny dude with zero game. Fast forward now I would think I look very much different because I started working out and taking care of my appearance. Other girls would comment that I am cute but I am still the same zero game guy. 

During the course of time I also fell in love with another girl because we had so much chemistry. I confessed to her and she rejected me. I was devastated. I feel like shit. Girl T has been asking me about my status previously with that girl and I kept telling her we were just friends. I don't even know what I am driving at now. Just confused I guess.

Now that girl T has asked another mutual friend to travel with her instead of me, I don't feel good. Am I selfish? I just wanted to be a good guy and not hurt anyone. Haizz

have you ever been so used and didn't realize till the entire thing panned out? there was this guy who became quite close to me, jioing me out for 1-1 study dates etc. at the same time I was best friends with this girl as she was my first friend in a new environment. fast forward one month, I found out the girl had been bitching about me behind my back to our mutual friend and her current boyfriend at the time. I gave her the cold shoulder and started ignoring her. imagine my surprise when the original guy I thought liked me started ignoring me. like literally when I asked a question directed to him, he will just stare at me and look / walk away as though I never even spoke. at first I thought the girl had bad mouthed me to him as they were still on good terms. 2 months later she was tgt with this guy. felt so wtf when I finally realized all along he had been using me to get close to her until we were no longer friends he had no use for me. and now I yhink the same thing is happening again... sigh
-
 
To  Yes you're selfish. You sort of know/hope girl T may still have an inkling of liking to you, so you know you have someone to fall back on in case things with other girl(s) do not turn out well. You hope that she'll stick around waiting for you and chase you (it gives you an ego boost), but you do not like her (and you know it). Contrary to what you said, you are not a good guy, and you just don't want to hurt/embarrass yourself by being alone at the end of the day.

Here's a lighter note, she probably didn't invite you to travel with her because (and I'm assuming) you're not really part of that group of travelling friends and it'll be awkward. Just because you have mutual friends, doesn't mean you're part of that group/clique. Either that or she just hasn't asked you yet.

I feel really hurt by what my own mom can say sometimes. I can imagine how my sister feels too. Both me and my sister boyfriends aren't that good looking and she just have to keep saying in front of our faces in a regrettable tone that she is fated to have ugly son-in-laws. As for me, I don't really bother about looks. However, she just have to keep repeating this same old mantra every time and keep saying how fortunate her other nieces are to have very good looking husbands. She also say she is fortunate herself because she got a good looking husband... Well, I do admit my dad is handsome, because many of my friends who see him also said so. But that doesn't mean her own children must get handsome husbands? And I also hate the fact that she desperately wants grandchildren. Whenever she sees grandchildren on the streets, she will go all hyper and crazy over them. Or even my cousins' babies. The more she does this, the more I dislike kids, and the more I don't want to get married. I absolutely hate this aspect of my mom. Plus, my brother recently got a pretty girlfriend and she will be like 'You see your kor kor so lucky to have such a pretty girlfriend. Their kids confirm very good looking.' She just have to keep REPEATING this. It gets on my nerves. This is the reason why I hardly introduce my boyfriend to my family. Its because I could sense that my mom doesn't like him because he is not good looking -.-. I sometimes really want to live on my own and get away from all these nonsense. Must my mom be so spiteful? Sometimes I wish she will be more accepting of him. It can sometimes affect my mood too because I am still coping with chronic depression and taking medication. She just said this comment just now and my mood suddenly plummeted. Sigh. I don't know what to do. Sometimes this makes me rethink about my relationship with my bf and drives me crazy. Sometimes I just want to do things that make me forget about everything... and I still got a few more papers to go. Must she say this again especially during the midst of my finals? I can't wait to grow older and live on my own. I think that will be the most awesome part of my entire life.

I had a slight relapse of a health issue/condition. It made me realize the importance of my friends. I mean, my friends had always important to me, but this relapse just heightened that, so I'm chatting and messaging my friends randomly just to say hi and stuff. Of course I didn't tell them about the relapse. I just hope they don't think I'm weird or went into insurance because I suddenly initiated the conversations.

Btw for those critical readers (there are always some), I didn't mention family because they've always been above all else. So cheers.

As a girl who decided to check out letterbox yesterday, I don't think letterbox will work. 

Firstly, most girls do not like to take the initiative (some may disagree but I think this is generally true for the majority). So girls will not answer the question for the guys. Okay so the guys can answer the girls' questions, but then it is up to the girl to initiate a conversation, which again, most girls will not do/are uncomfortable doing. Maybe it would be better to allow people to write a note together with the answering of questions, so that the other party can reply instead of initiating something. 

Secondly, do most guys just try for all girls? Since I don't think there are many girls on the app in the first place. Fishing is a bad first impression. I am not very good looking, yet I've got my fair share of letters in one day. Don't know if the guys are genuinely interested or just trying their luck. 

Just my 2 cents worth on a new app that has been gaining many positive reviews on NUSWhispers from goodness know who. 
-
 
To  Just posting because I can totally understand how you feel! Wish you could meet me haha I'm a girl then I can love you hahaha.
Sometimes when I read sad and lonely posts by sad and lonely guys I will be thinking why can't we meet one another and then we won't be sad anymore. That's if they don't mind a sad and lonely and abnormal girl as well.
(nuswhispers be nice and post this can hahahah)
Oh wells that's all jiayous for finals everybody!:)

Is it actually common to not have sex with your girlfriend before marriage nowadays? My girlfriend and I have been together more than a year now, but whenever I try to approach this topic, she will always tell me how it is not right to do it before marriage. The thing is, I am a virgin, and she is my first girlfriend ever, I am not sure if I want to jump straight into marriage without even knowing if we are compatible in bed first or not. I have no idea how she looks naked. Whenever my friends talk about sex, they will usually assume I am having lots of it, but I find it to be embarrassing to confess that I am still a virgin, especially when I am already 24 and have a steady girlfriend already for one year. I think people will go 'what is wrong with this dude' if I tell ever let them know about this. Recently I am getting more horny due to exam stress, and I have begun to see my female friends in a different light, and seriously pondering about hooking up with them. I think it is a sign that I need help. Any advice?

To , my gosh, I felt like I might've written that status myself. Do you also sometimes realise how similar some people are to yourself, and end up disliking them as they remind you of yourself? Cuz that's totally me right now. 

I haven't gotten out of the problem completely myself, but I have found some possibilities that I'm trying right now. 

1. Try to build your self esteem by getting really good at something. Actively test yourself on it and make it your thing. For me it's my piano skills. That way you have other things in your life to occupy your thoughts other than how lonely or insignificant you are in the lives of others. It'll also make you more interesting and have something you can tell/do with others when you get to that point. 

2. Resolve to make a change in your life and do something you thought you might've wanted to try. For me, I was always a math and science kind of person, but I've always wanted to try philosophy and literature. Was never a sporty person, but wanted to try a martial art. I ended up taking mods like PH1102E Intro to Philo, and GEK2020 Film Art. I also joined an introductory TKD course at a dojo outside of school. Some of these ventures worked out, others didn't, but I felt happier engaging in things I liked. More importantly, I felt like I was going somewhere, unlike my relationships with people, because I was making decisions in my own life. An added benefit of this is that now I have the general knowledge to talk with people interested in these aspects to some extent. 

3. Realise that people don't really judge you thaaaat harshly (as long as you observe good general social conduct), and relationships are actually more durable than you might think. In social situations people are probably more occupied with coming up with things to say and worrying how other people judging themselves than how much of a weirdo you are for saying / doing something. The important thing is, to be there, and be seen. Those who are never around are mysterious, silent, and thus weird. Once you have a relationship, people are typically willing to entertain some quirkiness, and it can be something that people relate to or joke about. So don't be afraid to show your flaws. (Disclaimer: this doesn't apply if your flaw is something that imposes on others. People will find it annoying really quickly and... shit happens. Fix it quickly.). Also, watch this video: https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en. It helped me a lot.

To get things going quickly, you could perhaps try to tie 1 and 2 together and find something you're even mildly interested in, join a related group and just go at it. You'll be able to work with like minded people and grow alongside each other, which is always a worthwhile experience. 

My advice dies though at this point though cause I'm still stuck myself, albeit in a different way. I've made good friends through my interests, so I do have people I can talk to, and relatively deeply too. The loneliness in the day is thus more manageable. But bridging this over to having people interested in you enough to evolve into a proper BGR (or whatever your inclination is) is still something I'm lost over. My attempts at love all end with a feeling of needing to sacrifice my dignity just for face time, and I am just getting increasingly frustrated. I am, seemingly, always the only one working on the relationship.

Since there's supposedly a lot of you out there, if you have overcome these problems and is willing to share, I'd gladly hear them.

Can anyone give me a crash course on how to be less awkward and passive in my life. I need proper social skills. I am so lonely now it is not even funny. After seeing all the lonely posts on here, I am on one hand, happy to know that there are similar people like me, but on the other hand, aghast to know how much I am similar to these people. After a recent bad encounter with my crush, I am very inclined to think that I am doomed to be lonely and single for life.

Maybe it was due to the bullying I endured in the past, but I can never seem to hold a proper deep conversation now with people. I always constantly feel that I need to hide bits and pieces of my life so everyone doesn't know how much of a loser I am. But I completely understand how this is actually jeopardizing my own chance to form real relationships with people. I don't want to get judged by letting people know the real me, but yet I want people to know the real me so I can form closer relationships with them, in particular in my endeavor to get a girlfriend. I want to get to know more people and hang out with them, but yet hanging out with people drains me and I wish to escape minutes after meeting them. Because of this, I am always the weird quiet dude in the corner who everyone thinks he is some psychopath.

My life is a living paradox, and I don't why I am so fucked up. My last close friend I got was in secondary school, and after which we all lost contact. In the past, I have always dreamed about having a girl to help me open up and love me for who I am, but after many smacks on my head by life, I have wised up. Such idealized people don't exist, only broken ones do, I am the prime example. And my brokenness somehow fucks with everyone and everyone gets weirded out by me. My JC days were terrible, and I really don't want the rest of my time in NUS to be terrible too.

How do I get people to like me? And be less shy around girls? I see these popular people, people with many friends, and they have girls confessing to them, rather than them confessing to girls and get shot down. They are so ahead of me in terms of getting their life on the right track, while I am still trying to struggling even finding a close friend, a decent girlfriend, just because of my personality. Sigh life is unfair like that.

Man I don't know what's wrong with me for writing this. I have always thought I am a loser, but actually typing this out and asking for help just reaffirms the fact that I am a loser.

 My boyfriend mathurbates to random variables as well. When I confronted him, he said I am not having stats with him.
-
 
My friend just told me that she broke up with her boyfriend over the issue of him wanting them to stay with his parents after they are married. 

I wonder if this is a dealbreaker for many girls, and if many guys expect the girl to live with his parents?

Mugging for finals and suddenly it hit me what he meant when he said he was hooked to "Thinking of You" by Sam Smith and kept replaying it... more than half a year ago when he was courting me...

omg how dense am I

My boyfriend masturbates to pictures of random girls on Instagram. I confronted him about it and his reasoning is that it's because I'm unwilling to give him sex. While I understand where he's coming from, I feel extremely uncomfortable and disturbed when ever he does it. Help?

Regarding , well, you probably mean well, but have you thought that it might make whoever you're talking to feel really creeped out? I mean, personally if that happens I'd be wondering if you are a psychopath who is out to kill me one day ):

are guys really not that attracted to nice girls? Do they find them boring? 

Do they prefer someone who is not humourous but is compassionate? Or they lean towards girls who are funny and outgoing but sometimes aren't that nice and can act like a cold heartless soul? 
I know all guys are different.... But for you readers are guys generally attracted to fun girls rather than stable girls?

I don't understand why attached people even sign up on letterbox. I mean, even if they are matched with someone, they can't do anything also right, because they already have a boyfriend. So why do it? To boost ego? To cheat? 

If you are attached and just want to make friends then don't get people's hope high when they match with you, at least tell them in your bio or straight up tell them you are unavailable. It is a waste of time for real single guys to sieve through these ambiguous profiles, and be let down when they find out through their facebook that they are already attached. What's worse is when you find out the guy they are attached with looks way less compatible compared to you if you are given a chance to be with her...

If I'm a girl and I'm into girls, if I do use letterbox, does it allow me to find other girls who are also interested in girls?

always reading these confessions about people quarrelling with family members, and thinking, it's hard on them. but this morning when my father threatened me and we had a really huge quarrel it is when i realised how terribly messed up i can feel after that. at least there was someone on my side at home. feel like a Jon Snow all this time when people talk about family struggles and conflicts. so messed up and have an afternoon paper... damn.

 Hey I understand how you feel. I am also going through this lonely with no friends/gf phase right now. I am terrible at keep relationships as well, and I always wait for the other party to initiate contact with me. To make things worse, I am really shy and introverted as well, so getting to the real me is really difficult. The result? I only have one close friend from secondary school that I am still keeping in contact with, and he's attached as well.

 In classes nowadays I am that guy who is seemingly friends with quite a bit of people, but they are basically all acquaintances. So I guess we are quite similar in this respect. I wish to become closer friends with them, but I am too socially inept and awkward to do it. Even though I am acquaintances with them, I still sit in lectures alone. Have been this way and always been ever since I stepped into NUS 3 years ago, because I don't know anyone at first since I didn't join any orientation camps. I was so desperate for companionship and a girlfriend last academic year that I delved deeply into the PUA (Pick up artists) teachings and I almost flunked one semester because I was too obsessed with it.

If there was anything that I can take away aside from the many Cs and Ds I got last year, was that in order to form closer relationships, you have to be assertive and be open in relationships. If you aren't assertive and taking initiative in relationships, you will be living a very lonely life. Being a popular girl is quite advantageous in this respect, as usually guys will initiate contact with you, and from there you can decide whether to accept them or not. (Hooray to you :) ) But in order to form a deeper connection, being assertive is one thing, and being open to people is another thing too. The latter can be quite difficult for shy people. Personally, I am struggling with both right now, and I am trying to change myself by being less passive and be more outgoing and receptive to other people. From your posts I think you are ready to be open in relationships, but I think you have to be more assertive in initiating contact with your friends. 

I hope that you don't feel too alone in this with my post, and I hope that my experience can help you somewhat. Cheers :)

Is letterbox a dating app??? I'm looking to meet new friends in NUS but not interested in getting into a romantic relationship, any advices on what other apps I could try? ps: I don't have enough time to join CCAs to meet friends so that is currently not an available option for me tks!

btw, all the best for finals for everyone who's reading this!

To  I am the OP of 

I don't want to brag or anything but i am considered 'popular' (at least in my faculty). I have participated several camps since freshmen year and I got meet really great seniors, friends and freshmen. I am also actively involved in my faculty-based activities. 

But who is to say that a 'popular' friend can't be 'abandoned'? 

Maybe it is because I know many people such that my attention towards my friends are spread thin. I do feel bad as a friend. I was not able to spend time with my friends or give them my attention when it is needed. Sometimes i am overwhelmed by my CCA workload. Sometimes I feel so tired after school that i need some time alone, sometimes i just need my own space. 

BUT there are days when i crave the company of my friends. There are days when I need to share my personal problems with someone that i can trust. But when i look around, there is simply no one that i feel i can talk to. And keeping all my feelings in is really making me feel terrible. Thank you NUSWhispers for this platform. 

And to those who had commented in my first post, thank you all. Unfortunately, I am comforted that I am not the only one feeling this way. People around me all seem to be able to stay close with their old friends. (and no bf because..... i guess i am not ready for one)

tl;dr - my first post is definitely authentic. Popular does not mean that you won't be abandoned. 
-
 
I do not understand this guy I met from a dating app. I asked if we want to continue chatting outside of the app and he is fine with it. He added me on fb then we started chatting a bit. Then he kind of stopped replying to my msgs. It is only a few days. :( Can't help but to think that I got eliminated though. Oh well.
-
 
To  hey buddy, if you don't try, you'll never know. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm a girl that fits your description, too. (Just that I'm not on letterbox). 

Just want to say that not all girls look out for "high fliers" and guys out of the ordinary. Just be yourself and who knows, she may like you for who you are! 

I currently like someone who seems so ordinary, but yet is so sweet to the people around him and myself. 

You don't have to be the most handsome or charming, nor the most intelligent or eloquent, neither do you have to be rich or famous, to catch someone's fancy :) 

All the best and have more confidence! Girls like confident guys.

I once joined a whatsapp group chat owned by a group of friends who met in orientation camp. I did not go for the camp but met them because we are from the same course. The group chat was very active at first. However, around 2 years later, the chat has died down. Now, no one mentions anything in that chat. Later on, I found out that they have been communicating in their own og chat instead, as they went for the camp and are from the same og. Whenever I sense something interesting going on, I have no idea about it as they often reference to their og chat. This is making me sad because I thought I am part of them but now it seems like they have moved things within their og. What are your opinions about this? Has anyone encountered the same thing? 
-
 
To the OP of  Hi buddy, you're sooooo lucky I want to come out to my friends like you. Tbh I think my friends will support me. But I am scared that words will spread out then everyone will know. I don't have many friends yet in uni, I think I will try to make more friends, who I can really share this secret. I am very happy to read your confession as I feel that there is someone like me. And about my buddy, we are still hanging out and doing gay jokes everytime now and then. I think he is gay. I tried a higher level of gay jokes on him but he just laughed and didn't feel annoyed or wrong. So I think I will keep doing this until he comes out to me hahaha.
Btw, all the best for you and everyone for finals.

I think CAP is important. Yet I also think it's not everything. I have my friends who think higher CAP = more success in life, and I have friends who think CAP is a worthless number that "all typical Singaporeans just chase for 'cause the government said so". I have disdain for both groups of friends.
-
 
 I feel you. Can't help it thinking that I can't match up either. I may be contradicting myself much here but well I hope you find your true love soon too! And I hope you don't lose hope yet. Letterbox does work, and you're gonna make it work!

One guy answered my questions on Letterbox. I started the chat with a 'hello' and he never replied. If he is not interested to talk, then why would he answer the questions in the first place?

Hi all, I wanna know others' take on this so here goes.
I have this good friend of mine who's in the same course as me. I've known her since JC so we're quite close. Only problem is, she seems to be so unmotivated in her studies & it's indirectly affecting me. For example, whenever we're choosing mods to take, she'll want to take the same modules as me. Then when we eventually get the same mods, she'll choose the same tut slots & even want to be in the same project groups as me. It affects me because she needs so much push in doing her parts for the projects & only nearing deadline she'll have it up. However, it's still lacking. Not saying i'm the perfect groupmate either but I just really want her to be more serious. I don't have the heart to tell her that I don't want her to be with me because apart from academics she's a loyal friend. 
But now that finals are coming, I find it so so hard to tell her to buck up and study. She prefers to take long breaks & watch her shows like a few episodes consecutively at a time. 
She suggested us studying together & I thought it'd be a good idea. BUT when the time comes for us to discuss, it ends up with me having to spoonfeed her with information because she claims she's 'not ready'. It's really frustrating. Up to the point that whenever she gives her input in group discussions, I'll tend to shrug it off or double check with others. I know it's not fair to her but I feel like she should prove me wrong. I have tried many times to stop her from being distracted (ie taking her phone away while studying) but it doesn't work. I hate it that she's taking her studies so lightly. 
I really want to try being independent and make new friends by taking mods alone but I can't bear to tell that to her. I mean, I have an idea of what I want to do after graduation but till now, she has no clue of what she wants to do. 
I've discussed this with her and the answer she always gives is 'yes yes i'll do that later' but on many occasions, her 'later' never comes. 

How do I help a friend who doesn't want to help herself in the first place? 
-
 
 If you would just spend more time trying to get to understand and know him, you'd realise that him, as with everyone else are never really closed off to relationships even if they appear to do so. It's human nature. Can you foresee the future? Is it just a career, or something a lot more than that? Have you truly tried to understand him, his past, his present, his family, his friends, his feelings, his thoughts? What exactly is he to you?

Pardon me for my tone but it just seems to me as though all you are concerned with is what you yourself want and expect for yourself out of the relationship.
-
 
In response to  I just really need to get this out.

 I have a stinging suspicion that your post is not authentic (sorry haha I had to point it out, being cynical and all) 

Which 'abandoned friend' made this post LOL - I'm intrigued by the guilt-inducing way this post was crafted. Well done, just look at that final sentence. And not to mention these excellent bits: "Maybe i'm a selfish person", "Maybe I'm a horrible friend". 

Someone has a grudge against their 'popular' friend...fosho. Who is it? Own up now, haha!

Slightly more than a month since I was rejected by my crush. Longest record of not texting each other in 6 days. Every day that passed I felt that I have made an achievement. The pain is even lesser now when I look at some of her photos. I still feel a bit sad tho:(

Subconsciously hoping she would text me and yet afraid of falling into the whole cycle of despair again. life sucks...

I hate my sibling. 

Wanna do something wrong already then cry and complain about it. My parents alr told not to touch anything mechanical because my dad is good in these stuff but then still wanna anyhow do then blame other people for nothing. 

When i wanted to tell my parents to help then end up getting scolded for nothing because end up is i tell stuff to my parents like wtf??? Crazy. 

Cant wait for the day that i can be free from this place.

really need to vent. there's this guy in my clique, throughout reading week he's basically been coming to sch every day from morning to night to study. but then when we are discussing exams and stuff he's like it's just CAP, don't understand why you all are so stressed about it. CAP only isn't that impt. then I feel like turning around and saying to his face if that's the case then why are u studying even if IT'S JUST CAP. ugh cannot tahan.

Here's 3 mins of your life you're never going to get back ,

With all the hype with Letterbox , I tried it , and met this girl . We met up and I fell for her charm instantly .
Energetic, very smart , hardworking , cute and can hold a conversation for a long time ( I'm a very passive guy ) . What more can a guy ask for ?
Although the first met up went well , somehow deep down inside, I know that I will never be good enough for her . I suck in academics and sports . I don't look good enough . I come from an average income household . 
Sure , we can try it out, see what happens, but in the long run, someone better is going to come by eventually . Someone as brilliant as her shouldn't be with someone as mundane as me because I don't deserve it . But still , I do feel really sad about it . Hope she finds her true love soon .

P/s : Letterbox does work

-
 
How much of your past relationship(s) should you share with your current partner? If one isn't proud of it, how should one initiate the conversation? Any advice from anyone?
-
 
 If you are really in love with the person, your love for the person will be selfless? He or she comes before you. I don't find it difficult at all to not love a person who keeps doing nice things for me. You may feel this way and think you love him or her because you enjoy being loved and doted upon, or enjoy the attention etc. whatever it may be; you may in some sense be insecure, uncomfortable or unsure with yourself etc. But at the end of the day, if you don't love him or her, he or she will still only come after you. Ask yourself if he or she stops doting on you, will you still love him or her the same, love him or her for who he or she is, even his or her flaws and past, even if one day things turn bad for him or her.

Do spend the necessary time you need thinking, less you hurt any innocent party, if any. Think about what love means to you.

Just needed to rant. I'm not sure whether it's just the guys or what they just don't seem to understand the things girls are going through. They are not that great as a listening ear as well. I'm going through a period of emotional turmoil but he just keep trying to avoid talking about it.
-
 
After my morning paper, I found out that I had lost my most beloved girl to a road accident. My deepest regret is not being able to confess my love to her before she left this world. Because of my inferiority and many complicated circumstances, I missed the chance to tell her, "How much I love her and how much she had changed my life for the better". I hope that everyone don't repeat my mistake, if you have someone in your heart... please gather up courage to tell the person your true feelings.

Life is fragile and unpredictable. Treasure your love ones.
-
 
I have never needed advice on how to chase girls. I have only ever needed advice on how to chase a specific girl - all girls are different, as are all guys.

Sure, most girls appreciate it if you do something thoughtful for them or show that you care, but everyone is different in their beliefs, their hobbies, their strengths and also what they are afraid of. What i'm trying to say is, if you think you like someone, rather than asking for generic advice on the internet, you should try to find opportunities to spend time with them and get to know them better. Only then can you be sure that you like them for who they really are.

Dedicated to all the people bothered by the love bug. Also, all the best to everyone for finals :)
-
 
How can you tell whether you are really in love with the person or with the idea that you had of the person? Isn't it difficult for you to not grow to love a person who keeps doing nice things for you?
-
 
I have been an active member of the NUSwhispers/Griddit community since its beginnings. I have an image as an outgoing and funny person, but in reality, I'm quite introverted and shy. With all the talk about arranging a meetup, I'm worried that I will be a disappointment when we actually get together in person. I want to stay anonymous behind this screen, but everyone else is so enthusiastic about meeting. If I don't show up, I'll miss out on the fun. If I show up, I won't be fun. 

Haiz.

To the developers of Letterbox, keep up the good job!!!!
 I had a short chat with this really sweet looking girl. But sadly she stopped replying, hopefully its due to finals

Thank you for such a wonderful app!!!

After all these years I've reached a point where I'm generally comfortable with being alone. Yet it feels like maybe I've only reached this level because nobody ever gave a fuck about me all along. I don't know how to describe it, it's like my state of independence ("It's okay to do stuff alone") is just a lie that I have to keep drilling into myself to console myself that I'm an outcast.

Hey , it is great that you are out there socialising, and that you have been proactive in befriending that person of interest (POI). You seem distressed and it is frankly not a good idea to be bogged down by these feelings during such a time- presuming you are a university student with exams imminent.

Perhaps you could cycle back on your focus on "finding the one"...now, and even later when you are about to join the fray again, advisably when you are more ready- emotionally, psychologically and if it's your thing to be, spiritually as well. I don't know you personally but it could be that your eagerness to connect presents itself as desperation, and desperation often doesn't sit well with people- whether you are looking to befriend someone or looking for something more. In more contemporary language, "chill".

Invest in your own potential OP, and harvest your own swag. Find "your thing". Refrain from adopting a fishbowl perspective- you said that ''apparently everyone finds (finding romantic partners) easy''. That sounds very much like a sweeping generalisation- people have different priorities, and if you can scroll through previous whispers you can see that NOT everyone finds it easy. So, ''chill".

You mentioned that POI is avoiding you. Well, perhaps POI does not feel comfortable with your advances, and/or is making an effort to reduce interactions with you because POI is not interested. Respect your POI, everyone has their limits. 

Lastly, your life is NOT worthless. Please do not ever peg your worth on the acceptance of your self by someone else- in ways romantic or otherwise. 

post-script: really disagree with GHY's advice of "acting like you don't care" and/or ''like you rejected them". You and POI are the ones who know most what the fact of the matter is. Don't swaddle your ego further because then not only are you deceiving yourself, you are hindering your growth. 

Be vulnerable. Be sincere. And "chill".

Now go listen to "We are young" by fun. Have fun. Studying.

a friend of mine has some great qualities. but he is very focused on career. being career-focused is not a bad thing, it just shows me that he's very driven and passionate about it. but to the point where he seems completely closed off to relationships. i know such choices are personal choices. the only problem is that i've developed feelings for him. and it is quite painful cause it's quite clear to me that nothing special will happen between us so i just have to wait for these feelings to slowly fade away. it's sad. oh well ):  
-
 
What do you call a friend who becomes sore when you share your experiences (travelling etc) but expects you to be really happy for her when she shares hers? Is she insecure? She's the kind of friend that wouldn't invite you to something, but would brag about how fun her trip was without failing to add, "Aiyah you should have come leh! It was so fun!" Erm, you didn't even invite me? Oh and she always has to show off how she has more friends than me. Oh and after finals, she loves to compare grades too. Oh and god forbid I get something expensive for myself. She would turn into a green eyed monster. I mean I would be really happy for you if you  could learn to be more humble.Why can't you just be happy for people? Must everything be a competition?

Now, having gotten used to the uni life and all.. I remember i asked my mom before, whether i could take a gap year before going into uni to think before pursuing anything, and she said no. That no matter what i had to go to uni. So i went. 3 years down that road, i am okay, still surviving but it made me think about how trapped i am right now. How i am so trapped in this rat race, and that even after graduation I wont get the kind of freedom that i would like. 

Im not blaming anybody, but i am quite.. tired. I wish to have my own life, my own everything..

I have been rejected multiple times by different crushes in the past. Recently my crush indirectly rejected me and although I didn't confess, I guess it may have been obvious from my behaviour. 

I feel depressed now and when I see couples holding hands my eyes fill up with tears and I feel like a worthless loser who failed at something apparently everyone finds easy. Every night, I am unable to sleep peacefully and I have nightmares where I dream that every person whom I have feelings for leaves me. At the end of the day, I am all alone. 

I find it hard to concentrate nowadays, I have lost my appetite and I don't feel motivated to get out of bed in the morning. What's worse is that my crush is friendly with everyone and is avoiding talking to me only. This is even more painful than getting rejected. Now I feel as if not only do I not deserve to find love, I don't deserve to have a friend too. 

I am probably thinking too much but this is how I feel. Can any kind soul give me advice on what I should do to get over this? Please, no sarcastic comments. It's gonna make me feel worse. I already feel that my life is worthless. Would do anything to trade with the happy couples I see everywhere. :(

I'll become a happy butterfly, and ride on the glittering wind
I'll come to see you soon
It's best to forget the unnecessary things
There's no more time to be fooling around

What do you mean, wow wow wow wow wow? I wonder if we'll reach the skies
But, wow wow wow wow wow I don't even know what my plans are for tomorrow

In other words, Digimon Tri is out, in case you've been too busy mugging to realise :')

It's funny how whenever someone acts clingy to me I try to brush it off, however when that clingy nature stops I miss it... Now I think of it I'm actually quite pathetic... Why try to act cool and stuff? 

 if you want to talk to her then go talk to her WHY NEED TO ACT ALL MACHO. Stupid me.... 
Now she is gone, and I'm just a pathetic soul who misses her presence. Come back to me Kristal!!!

To the OP of 12042: Hi, A! Sorry this comes so late after your confession. I'm a gay guy in NUS as well, and I know how you feel. Like you, I'm a typical guy who likes some sports and other guy stuff, exception being that I prefer the same gender. I see myself as a typical guy who happens to like other guys. In fact, some people to whom I've come out didn't believe that I'm gay at first. 

Initially, I had no plans to come out to anyone while in NUS. After all, my orientation doesn't affect my academics or my performance in group projects, so why should it be anyone business? And I was also afraid that it would give people even more reason to ostracize me. But when I was in year 2, I got to know an amazing group of friends. This group is made up mostly of straight guys. Being in the same major, we attended class together, studied in the library before finals, and basically hung out together a lot. Eventually in year 3, they noticed I was single and not looking, so they kept asking me if I liked anyone. That led to me coming out to 4 of them over dinner one day during summer break. And as things go in this particular group of friends, the word spread. Everyone's ok with it, and I'd go as far as to say they're supportive, helping me cope with bad dates, heartbreak, and all that. Because as they've told me, it's my life, and there's nothing wrong with being gay. If being with another guy makes me happy, then they shouldn't judge. To this day, I maintain that they're the best thing to happen to me in NUS, and I wouldn't trade their friendship for anything. 

Moral of the story is that your friends may be more open-minded than you give them credit for. But having said that, please also do your own due dilligence and really think about whether you feel comfortable about coming out to a particular person or group. Although it's rather cowardly, I'd say to err on the side of caution. If you don't feel totally safe telling someone, don't do it.

As for finding buddies and friends, I'd say to keep your eyes open. Sure, you could resort to certain infamous apps if that's your thing, but if not, there are more "legitimate" ways of making friends. Please also bear in mind that you don't hav to pretend to like girls. A possible approach would be to use the "single, not looking" thing like I did, or just refrain from participating in conversations in which your friends are rating girls and all that (Incidentally, I personally find that quite distasteful).
 
The situation with your male best friend...it's tricky. Not knowing much, I don't feel that it's my place to advise you to confess to him or anything like that. Just bear in mind that he could be super comfortable with you as friends, or he might be hinting that he wants a deeper relationship with you. If you're best friends, I believe that the both of you should be able to have a serious talk about this.

Hope all goes well for you! Remember, it's never as bad as it seems. Hang in there!

I just really need to get this out. 

People might think I am the popular girl and all but... I don't have friends. Or rather, I can't seem to keep my friends. Maybe it is because I am a horrible friend. 

I had a best friend in primary school. We drifted apart in upper primary due to change in class and later on, due to different secondary schools. We got to meet new friends and also had different timetable. 

In secondary school, my closer friends did not about my family situation (single parent family) because I was not able to accept it to share it. As we moved on to different JC, we drifted apart. New friends, new lifestyle, etc. 

In JC, i met a few friends who brought me out of my shell. Some from my class and some from my CCA. Same thing happened. Change of classes in J2, stepping down from CCA, drifted apart. J2 friends were good but J1 friends were better. Again, drifted apart once we graduated. 

Entering university, I met wonderful friends from camps and also got to know some really great course mates. But friends around me seem to be attached / getting attached. And over holidays, everyone have their own plans and we don't really meet. 

Maybe I'm a selfish person that doesn't care enough to keep my friends. Maybe I am not putting in enough effort but my mother have this mindset that there is no need for me to meet up with my friends so often and that there is no need to text them etc. Is it my upbringing or am I simply unimportant in my friends' life? 

For example, watching a movie, I don't have anyone to ask. All of them have watched the movie with their other friends or other half. 

I might seem like I know a lot of people and all but I truly have no one. There is no one I can talk to when I am stressed out. No one to talk to when I am having a bad day. No one to study with, no one to watch a movie with, no one. How can I change so that i can keep my friends?  T.T

Don't bother with letterbox. I realized i actually cycled back to the same few girls again.

If i can completely browse through the app's female userbase in like an hour or so, it's really not a big userbase..
-
 
Why is it that on letterbox, the guy will say hi to me, then I will say hi back, but then after that its dead silence? Is it the app broken or is it they realise i'm ugly. It's been 4 guys like this already :-(((

I'm putting this here at the start: This is a not a confession asking for advice, I just want a place to post and pour my feelings out. Thanks for listening NUSWhispers. It may also be what some comments deem as 'pathetic', I may trail off and not have a completely 'so what?' conclusion, but if you're still sticking around for this long post thank you for just taking your time to read this. Certain numbers are going to modified in case people I know figure who is it out, but the ratio will be around the same. She's too busy to use NUSWhispers so please don't tag her here.

Yes, it's a romantic confession. And please don't turn it into a debate about medicine, she just happens to be a med student, you can take her as any other stressed uni student and what I say would still apply. 

I have had romantic feelings for a girl for 5 years. Known her for 6years. 

I guess I'm hesitant to use the word 'love' because I believe love to grow out of full mutual understanding AFTER someone has tried out a romantic relationship with the person in question. 

Her looks won't be the most striking thing about her. I've heard most of our mutual friends call her 'pretty' (So objectively she's about 6.5-7/10, hardly a head-turner on the streets) but she's gorgeous to me with all bias intended. During the six years I've known her she has always been the smart one in the group. She worked really hard for A levels and managed to get her dream. I think she's going to be great at it. She was never one of the social butterfly type of girls, but she's a good listener. She's the type of girl who won't be the first to organize an outing for our group of friends, but if someone in the group is facing a crisis she'll hop down no matter what, beer in hand and just sit and listen till 2am even if she has assignments due the next day. And she gives pretty good advice. Not perfect, but she has a knack for reading people. She's not the most cheery person around, but she's someone who turns all her mistakes into motivation and continue working to her goal, and is always encouraging to others. She's extremely driven but still takes time to be a great friend and show compassion, she helped me out a lot during A level revision period, basically went through the entire syllabus of a subject with me when I was getting S for prelims even whilst being behind on schedule for her own H3 revision. 

With all due respect this may sound like I'm viewing her through rose tinted glasses, but I truly believe she is someone who has her life figured out, and is suited for the career she has chosen. So why the confession now? 

Well it just feels that in university she has become more anxious. I'm not sure if it's the drive to be perfect with her peers around her, but she's becoming increasingly stressed. Initially I dismissed it as what all uni students go through, but it goes deeper than that. She has always had high standards for herself, but now she is constantly hard on herself, blaming herself for things that aren't her fault. And remember when I say she uses her mistakes to motivate herself? Well, she's now taken it upon herself that every patient who dies on her (even though she was not in charge of treating them at all) is somehow another driving force behind her having to know absolutely EVERYTHING so that next time she won't harm a patient because of something she didn't know. 

She's getting good grades but the prospect of her grades dropping slightly causes her to shut herself out from our close group of friends and just work. She increasingly feels that she's ugly, stupid and a failure and confides in me from time to time that she feels inadequate next to her med friends where anything less than an A in a posting is something to be ashamed of, when her own parents are telling her it's okay to get B as long as she is happy and healthy. And they are pretty typical asian parents, so even they can see how hard she's been working. 

I really wish I could offer her the same thing, listen to her and make her feel better, but she's always been the mother of our group of friends, and to her we're all her little brothers/sisters and she feels weird burdening us with her problems. In fact it's almost as if she lacks an implicit trust in us to not judge her for seeming 'weaker' than she appears. She trusts us enough to tell us there is a problem, outline it for us, but always ends it with 'but I've dealt with it myself, so there's no need to worry! Now tell me more about...' 

 I like her no matter how insecure she feels but I do miss the old confident girl who would just chill and play Skyrim on the couch next to me instead of curling up into a corner and trying not to cry when she does badly in an assessment. It's not that she's become toxic or distant from all this, not at all, but even amidst more listening and more advice giving as the guys entered uni and faced new problems I can't help but feel that she needs someone to listen to her, for her to stop trying to be so selfless for her friends and stop penting her own feelings up. 

I guess I just feel helpless. I have never made my feelings known to her because I know she sees me as her brother, and she's always been too focused to be dating anyone. I used to be happy that there's no heartbreak involved in her being with another guy but now I just want her to be happy. I know the type of guy she likes, her 2-3 crushes have all been people who made her feel safe, whom she felt could protect her, but I'm unable to make her feel the same way, perhaps because our dynamics have been the same for so long. Even if I can't be the one for her, I'm content to watch over her. I don't need to burden her with the knowledge of my unrequited interest. 

I can't tell her this directly without revealing my feelings, but I guess to all the similar people out there, guy or girl, I want you to know that it's okay to not be perfect, that it's okay to be anxious/cry/mope over this without moving past it too fast, and it's really, honestly okay for you to allow yourself to feel down and vulnerable. To quote her own words 'You should take what life throws at you and do what you can with it, but never be mistaken into thinking that it is wrong to give yourself time for grief, despair or rage. It is because life is too short that we mustn't focus just on happiness. We need time to be simply human.' 

I hope you remember your own words from before university. But it's alright if you don't. I'll be there to listen if you get hurt, I'll be your guardian even if you don't think I can, until you find the person you entrust your safety to. 

Tl;dr I like/love a girl for 5 years, and I just needed to vent about me feeling helpless in her increasing problems and anxiety.

My bf separated with me and told he "he is sorry to have wasted my time". What does that mean?

I am at my final year and realise that all the girls I know of that is close to my age (within 2 years of age) are already attached. Look like I really have no choice but to go for younger girls.

I feel like I have the need to get through to the people reading on this platform. PLEASE be mindful of the things that you have posted online, be it on your privatized Instagram account, Facebook, or even Dayre. Be responsible for the consequences that may arise from what you have posted.

There have been countless times that people post/talk about me on their social platforms, and most of the time I'd brush it off. Recently, I finished 2 of my presentations for a module within the past 2 weeks, and I have noticed how this relatively "Instagram-popular" girl have talked about me on her dayre, dissing me on my behavior and my attitude towards my work, and resorted to calling me a b****. I tried to put it off my mind, but I just can't, for I think she went overboard in shaming me on her blog. Yes, she did not reveal my identity in any way, but she has crossed the line this time round. I know I mentioned how "I don't mind and you don't matter" but do you know I was NOT talking about any of you.

We are already in our final year, please, talk it out with me, deal with me, but never ever post it online and garner agreements and support from your other instagram/dayre-famous friends.

Actually quite interested to use letterbox because I found the concept pretty cool, but I'm not exactly looking, which makes it uncomfortable to seemingly expose myself to potential misunderstandings should people I know see my profile. Totally understand the need to show profile pic but really just a personal discomfort

To all the couples out there, you don't know how lucky you are.

Having been single all my life, trust me, i know what it is like when i say i am lonely. sure, i have tons of friends, a great family, but there is just a hole inside me that can only be filled by a special someone. my significant other.

You have no idea what it feels like to just go to the shopping mall, and see a plethora of happy couples, holding hands, laying in each others arms, while you walk alone, longing for a special someone to hold your hand, to feel the warmth of another person.

What it feels like going to the movies, with a couple sat beside you, the girls head on the guys shoulders, and you're sitting there by yourself, thinking, fantasizing about what it would be like if you had a girlfriend/boyfriend.

When you are done with school, and your friends all have plans to go out with their partner, and you go home to an empty room, and stare at 4 walls. trying to shake off your loneliness, telling yourself that one day, you will get someone.

I am smart, funny, and a 'guai kia'. i don't smoke, don't club, don't fool around. people keep telling me that one day i will find a great girl, but i am still waiting for that day to come.

I know, there are going to be people saying, you only see the good side of relationships, you don't see the quarrels, struggles, fights they go through. but hey, ask any guy who has been single for a long time, having someone is better than having no one at all.

So people in relationships, count yourselves lucky, there are plenty of people out there who long for what you have.

I'm noticing that a few well-performing friends are feeling very burnt-out as the semester or candidature ends. Are there any more of you out there? We should find or share good channels to vent or recover before something worse happens to us.

(I wrote this because I felt that current counselling programmes deal more with exam stress or anxiety than what we face. It's also not as simple as telling people to take a chill pill or that they will do well as they always had.

I have no intention of putting anyone down with this post be it those not doing as well or those currently seeking psychiatric help. We need help too.)

 you've changed. you didn't need me when i thought i'd found someone who'd needed me. i was turned off by the times you initially showed how independent you were, to the extent that i often wondered if you ever needed me? who was i to you? why were your words so strong, so firm, so perfectly rational, when i had gone from a rational being to an emotional baby after having you? i tone my expectations down, of you and of myself. we've been through so much on our own, maybe we shouldn't change things too much when we're in a relationship. maybe, just maybe. and then you change; suddenly you need me, and next moment you say i'm never there.
i'm lost and confused. call it incompatibility, call it bad timing, but everything's a mess. maybe we can salvage this, but we can only hope for the best.

What are the kind of things that admins on nuswhispers filter? Because I don't understand why I've been repeatedly filtered when I don't think I said anything insensitive. Sigh, as if all the rejections in life aren't enough already, want to post a confession also gets blocked

I'm attached and I tried out letterbox for fun. As a dating app I know my boyfriend wouldn't approve. But I just wanted to try it out for fun. The first guy that talked to me was a friend of my boyfriend. We talked for awhile before I ran a Facebook check on him. Should I ghost him?

If I'm genuinely not interested in a relationship during my uni years, is it fine to just go around calling girls "bro" so they get the idea instead of misinterpreting other things I do? 

Just thought it'd be a bit weird to bring up the topic, "hey this is random but Ithought I'd just  let you know that I'm not looking for a relationship..."

How??

I m trying my best to study for my finals tomorrow but my parents found this the best time to battle out on why they even married each other...Why cant they give in? So much of ego..

to 
maybe by the time he loosened his grip, it's only because he's decided that you're not that into him after all.
i get it that some of us like to be independent, but just perhaps, if you don't help them get around their insecurities at a stage when they're clingy, and instead act as a polar opposite, you're losing them before you even know it.
-
 
I don't get it. If you want the posts to look "organic" and real, then don't leave a common identifier such as smiley face.
If a common identifier is what you want, then don't post as if there were several different persons using your app.

The lack of trust, the lack of knowledge of your true status... even your close friends know nothing of who you really are.

But I've hidden so much from my friends.

I don't want to work like an undercover and continue covering up my life in layers of deception. I can seem happy and smile, and am excellent at deflecting attention away when people probe deeply.

I admit, I have been hurt before. But because of that, I've started to protect myself from even friends. I think people can betray me anytime when it is in their interests. Even when sharing secrets, I share just enough to satisfy them, yet not let them be able to cause significant damage with secrets. Often I place the parts in completely different friend groups so that the probability of piecing together my emotional pent-ups is low enough to not expose me.

I don't want to cover up anymore. Yet I don't want to lose my friends.

Tell me how. I don't know.

I just want to be a good person. I want to start my life afresh.

All of you please use Letterbox, I have cycled the app so many times and there are always the same people. On that note, can the developer please prevent the same profiles from appearing?

Reference to 

To the OP who mentioned that your bf thinks you're too 'clingy' and so pushes you away. 
I have a bf and our role is quite reversed of yours. Maybe you might find some enlightenment from my point of view (which your bf may be feeling the same too) 

Though im a female, my character tends to gravitate towards a male personality sometimes. 
My bf used to be very clingy to me as well. It's good for couples to bond & spend quality time but its also important to have a balance & to respect each other's space as well. The reason why your bf push you away may be because he realize he needs more space/time as an individual to grow and there are some things he prefer to do alone. He could be someone who enjoys freedom but is too choked by your constant presence. During times when he is not around you, why not find time for urself or for your family and friends? its good to take a break too. 

Spending too much time w your partner may not too healthy anyway. You may find yourself running out of topics eventually. Your world & self may run a risk of being just defined by u and ur partner eventually. (Some people may be fine with that but not everyone is to be defined like tat. Try understanding from this point of view) Have some trials and errors e.g. loosing your grip here and there, maybe he will be running back to you again. Besides, absence do make the heart fonder too! 

It took some time for my bf to loosen his grip abit. I felt much better and closer towards him after that.

I was in a relationship with a guy for a year and we broke up last year. He was a foreigner and it would never work out for us in the long run anyway. I was never truly happy in that relationship and I'm a bit happy that it's over. Now I have a new boyfriend and he's an amazing guy, but when I think of my ex I get this weird feeling. I'm very sure I don't love him anymore, but I get upset when I think about my past experience. Is it fear? Is it regret? I just hope it doesn't affect my current r/s... (my boyfriend knows about my past r/s)
-
 
People speak of getting together. I'm genuinely happy for them.What I almost never tell people is the pain I am still going through from my breakup one year plus ago. I keep on telling people quite insistently that I am willing to change for them. 

I was rightfully told three things:
1. I need to simplify my thoughts.
2. I need to recover from my pain.
3. I need to start chasing.

I can do all three. I can be more succinct. I can heal emotionally. I can be proactive.

The problem is: I do not even know how to love.

I don't know how to say any sort of sweet nothing; I'm too straightforward. 

If she is pretty, I will say so. If she is sad, I will ask why and find out, but I do not know how and when to place the concern for best effect.

I don't know how to appreciate the fun the common person has. The common finds it fun watching a movie; I find it fun understanding how a movie is created. She finds it fun to play Pokemon; I prefer breaking Pokemon.

I don't know how to understand triviality. She can laugh at a stupid joke, and expect me to laugh at it too. I can laugh, but only because she laughs. She can read a magazine and wow at it, but I will jump straight for a reading material of more value.

She can enjoy music because she likes a singer. I like music that illuminates more than just lyrics or singer, but the context and complex undertones a musical piece brings.

But even these aren't the problem.

I think I am too hurt and numb to even think how to give love to someone who I trust. But the often acrimonious breaks have left me completely devoid of trust. The woulds occasionally re-manifest through seeing her friends who now give me cold stares.

I know I want to love, but I completely lack the energy and skill to do it.

I'm tired. I just want to have a break, but my wounds won't let me.

My friends and I were talking about the male alpha beta omega theory, and it actually is pretty dam accurate after some contemplation. Basically alpha males are the popular guys, who get a lot of girls attention and admiration, while beta males are the rest of the guys. With a few handful being the omega males, who are usually so socially awkward they draw attention all for the wrong reasons. From our observation, these are the characteristics of these groups:

Alpha: Supposedly loud, confident, and 'jerk' seeming. They are so confident, they are always surrounded by girls, and it usually doesn't matter whether they are truly kind or a good person or not, girls just flock to them. They can usually be seen with different girls at different times, and they make relationship issues seem like a joke, because they have girls lining up for them. They are the cause for bitch fights. Usually in sports ccas.

Beta: The majority, normal, functioning male population. Since they don't have the alpha-ness to command girls' attention, they usually settle for an average girl. Usually nice and understanding to girls, to their own detriment. Being sensitive to a girl's response somehow makes you seem weak, and not as confident, and girls being girls, they can sense it, and thus your alphaness is reduced in their eyes. This is the reason why they say not giving a fuck is the way to succeed with girls, and in life. Sounds ridiculous isn't it? But that's how the world works. Being the majority, normal socially functional male population, most in this group would eventually find their soul mate. And usually this 'soul mate' is someone who they simply settle for subconsciously, and not the ideal girl that they truly want. This is simply because they don't have girls on a silver platter for choice like the alpha males. Beggars can't be choosers, right?

Omega: These group of people, are the one of the most courageous I must say. As they bring the phrase 'Not giving a fuck' to a whole new level. They literally don't care about what others think about them. Either that, or they have an inability to associate with social norms. Personally, I don't have anything against them. I actually have quite a bit of friends who belong to this category. The sad thing is? Well, after getting to know them, they are usually the nicest and intelligent people I have ever met. Yet they are shunned by people, just because they are weird. No girls would ever like them, just because they are weird, or have obscure hobbies, like being an anime otaku or a video game addict for example. In this sense, most girls can be rather superficial, though I understand there can be exceptions. Sadly, all of my omega friends are still single still, so I can't say that I have actually witness an exception before...sorry girls.

I just find it to be so unfair- the people who are seemingly 'jerks', get awarded for their 'confidence', and while people who are really nice, but slightly awkward, get outcast, further perpetuating the idea that they are weird people. After all, how many of you would actually go and make friends with a guy who everyone shuns? 

If you think about it, omega males are actually really confident individuals. Like mentioned earlier, they 'don't give a fuck'. So if girls are really attracted to confidence, like they do to alpha males, why aren't they attracted to omega males? 

The answer? Well, it is because, everyone thinks that the alpha male is cool. That's right. Girls dig alpha male, because everyone thinks the alpha, is alpha. Both omega and alpha exudes confidence, in different ways, but only the way an alpha exudes his confidence is deemed as cool, while the way an omega does is uncool. 

And how do you define cool? What is coolness? Well, it is simply a social construct. EVERYONE THINKS the alpha is cool, therefore, the alpha is cool, and thus he is attractive. ''Oh the guy there has so many friends, he must be someone incredible. My friends were talking about how cool he was just now. How great it would be if I were actually his girlfriend. I would have a cool boyfriend to showoff.'' How many of you girls out there are actually guilty of this train of thought?

Well this post might seem a little sexist, but this was what we came up with during the discussion, and I thought that it has some truth in it. I just want to confirm if our line of thinking is true or not, and that's why I am typing this right now. Personally, I am not a buyer of girls having such a shallow crowd mentality, but the arguments made really made quite a bit of sense coupled with my own experiences. So, thoughts?

So my birthday was yesterday. But my best friend didn't even post a picture of me. She does that for everyone else, people she's not even close to. Why not me though? I know it seems like a stupid thing to get upset about. But I can't stop thinking about it. I mean we're best friends. Aren't we not? I don't want to bring this up cause I don't want to appear sensitive, but I'm really hurt. I mean she did wish me, but am I not special enough to dedicate a post for? I guess things like this happen for a reason.And I thought you were different. Yet again, I'm the disposable friend.

I'm attached but I want to try out Letterbox :(

Have been using Letterbox.... Have yet to receive anything :( 
THIS IS DEPRESSING sighpie

If you answer the questions for someone on letterbox but didn't click send can the person still see your attempts? I was too shy to send off a letter for this cute guy I was checking out (ok maybe not cute to previous confessors but my type) but he just sent me a letter! Feeling nervous to initiate a chat!

It's more effective to reject guys by saying "sorry I have a boyfriend" rather than "sorry I'm not interested in you" because men value the worth of another man above women's opinions.
-
 
Sometimes I see really funny comments on some of the posts and I would really want to like it. Then I realise I'm the only or the second girl who's gonna like it. Is it weird that I find supposed 'men's humour' hilarious? An example was the comment from Mikhail regarding peeing in the shower. Cracks me up every time!

I showed my friend the CS3216 photo after STePS yesterday.

Instead of praising my efforts, she saw the Griddit.io sign, and the QYFC sign, and said that they were awesome. Then I realised she was somewhat popular on Griddit.

I feel a bit sad inside; looks like her heart will never come to me.

One of the most cruel thing that could happen in a relationship is the promise that your SO will never have to be alone. But overtime you realise, that you have re-learn how to be comfortable with being alone again. In other words, you'll been pulled out of your comfort zone, but gradually left to sink back in again. And he speaks, 'but you've always been an independent girl'. But no, that was me before I knew you. I want someone to rely on, I've been looking for that all these while and I found you. I feel protected, I feel secure, I've never felt happier. Initially you spend every moment with me and though it took me quite awhile to get use to such a constant presence and support in my life, I really enjoyed it. And I finally felt how love is suppose to be like. But as time goes by I become too 'clingy' to you, as you put it, you start to pull away from me. My messages are getting increasingly ignored by you; you've smiled more and looked happier when you are with your gal pals than with me, looking entirely bummed when I appear in front of you when you're having a good time laughing with them; you get easily irritated by me when all I wanted to do was to share my day worth's of happenings with you, rolling your eyes and just chuckle without commenting. Have you gotten tired of me already? You need to know, you were the one who successfully found your way into my heart and my life, but now you just want your 'independent girl' back. You changed me, but now you just want a refund and get the old me back? Or are you planning for an exchange instead? It doesn't work this way. Just what am I suppose to do?

Downloaded letterbox today but I don't really understand the concept of talking to people who have answered my questions. So I can only reply to people who have chosen to send me a letter? Shouldn't they be able to answer my questions THEN send me a letter/chat straight away? Seems like I have to get the ball rolling and as a girl I'm still not quite comfortable with that idea. I've sent guys letters by answering their questions but they never seem to chat me up :-(

Just tried the letterbox app but there are no cute guys on there. Are they all taken or is the app just not that well known yet?

My guy friend keeps telling me that I shouldn't give my number out to the guys who ask for it. Not sure if he has any agenda saying that, but it's besides the point as I've kinda friendzoned him since I don't feel like we are compatible.

Anyway, he says that many guys just try their luck, and it's not like they'd 'lose a piece of meat' if they fail, but they'd certainly at least secure a chance to get to know me better if they succeed i.e. minimal loss, possible 'great gain'. On the other hand, I feel like won't they be nervous, uncomfortable and scared of rejection too? When I imagine it being me, it's kinda scary and intimidating to go up to a stranger and hope they don't judge you or think you're weird.. 

I guess it depends on the guy, and it's not like I can accurately judge what kind of person he is, just casting a wide net and approaching many girls periodically or someone who is just intrigued and wants to get to know me personally, on the first impression right? For now I guess I'll still be wary of these guys, since they are really strangers you know nothing about and whether you can trust them or not vs someone you meet in school who I'll at least be able to find out information about more easily. 

Sad thing is, I don't really meet much guys in school since I'm in a major that has a small cohort size and is pretty exclusive. ): Anyway I wonder what motivates guys to approach girls they don't know. I feel like there're loads of pretty girls out there, so there must be something aside from looks that pushes you to go up to one particular girl to make a move? Unless you're the kind who would go up to all of them regardless. Maybe it's the type of look or style that would appeal to you.. I happen to think the girl next door or cute style really attracts loads of guys. Unfortunately I'm not in that category, more of the mature kind. Which I feel is just scaring guys away sigh.. 

Not sure where this confession is going or what point I'm making haha, guess I'll end here. Good luck for finals everyone! Apart from that, this year is coming to an end real soon so make the best out of 2015 while you can~ Hopefully 2016 will fare better in terms of my love life hahaha

Forever alone. Wanted to chat up with people. I tried letterbox, but till today, I still have no luck in getting a chat via letterbox :( So I went over to griddit and managed to have a htht with the awesome people there. Hopefully, the regular would talk to me again tmr :D

Remember the leaf story? 

Once upon a time, a random wind brought 2 different leaves together. We spent so many happy and memorable times together. As time goes by, I started to fall in love with you, little by little. Whenever, i wished you good night after our late night texting, I will always drop a tear or two. I hope that you will block me soon enough, because I knew that I won't be able to control my feelings for long. "Block me please! Block me please! If not I will fall in love with you!"  

The random wind blows again! And this time round, we are finally gonna be blown far apart. During our short meeting time, I don't remember  breaking any promises. However this time round, I finally couldn't fulfill one single promise. I thought that I brave enough to accept your rejection like a man and stay as a friend. I was so wrong.... the truth is I'm just a coward who tries to put on a brave front only. All those empty big talks....

But then again, although things has to end this way. I never regretted knowing you! You are not as evil as you thought you are. The fact that you didn't shun a ugly duckling like me, proved that you are a really kind girl. 其实我不只是爱上你的美貌，你的好我都爱，你的坏和瑕疵我更爱。If time can be reverse, I will still walk into utown to buy "feng you" for you, send you home even when I'm not feeling well, do it a thousand times, a million times over and over again and I won't complain. Because I don't wanna let the headache torture you and I don't wanna let loneliness touch you. 

This is my last farewell message to you, by the time you read this message I had already unfollow NUSwhispers and embarked on a new journey. 对不起，笨猪没有用，笨猪没有守信用  ,笨猪让你伤心了，忘了笨猪吧。Everything is just a bad dream, everything will be fine once you wake up. 笨猪永远爱你，不是样貌而已，我爱你所有的一切，原谅我吧。

Not in nus now. Its a few weeks to my ord. I feel like my life is getting very dull. Boring mundane. Im starting to find no meaning in life. Why am i doing all of this? For what? Its so BORING. I dont like this feeling. It makes suicide seem so plausible. I hope i dont do it though.

Today is a special day for my ex, it's his first day at his new job. Before he became my ex, I accompanied him for his job interviews. He had told me that he was more motived for his career after he met me. But our relationship was short-lived. We separated shortly after he had submitted his resignation. And on the day of separation, I told him I will avoid all contacts for at least half a year. I am very tempted to 'like' his current fb status but the rational side of me is telling me I should just stand by my own words and avoid contact with him. My words and presence are not important to him any more.

Why must you be nice to me? I know you treat me just as a friend. I know you are attached. I am in love with you but I know that this love is forbidden and would never be reciprocated. I feel very agonised and sad every time I talk to you. I want to move on, but I just can't :( Sometimes I really regretted choosing those modules. If I hadn't chosen to take those modules, I would never have known you.. Sometimes I wished that you were cold and mean towards me and maybe I wouldn't have fallen in love with you. :')

I'm a typical handsome guy from the school of engineering. Recently, I had fell madly in love with this hottest girl, who always comment on NUSwhispers. Although we had went out for a few hot dates, I still couldn't garner enough courage to confess to her. I've done a lot of sweet stuffs for her like walking all the way to Kent Ridge MRT to buy sanitary pad for her. When she asked me, "why did you treat me so nice?". My reply was, "Because I'm a stupid pig" instead of "I love you".

Lately, I had heard rumors from some sources, that she has a fetish over me and would like to french kiss me. Yeah! I knew that I hit the jackpot but what should be my next move?

I'm together with my gf for a couple of years. We always quarrel over the same thing and recently i seem to have fallen for another girl. The girl said my feelings for her may not be real because I'm having a problem with my gf or that I'm just seeking a replacement. She asked me to sort things out with my gf first. what does that mean?
-
 
Someone I know just said that 

"In life, we all have that one friend that plays a part at each an every stage of our lives. However, only some are lucky to have the same group of friends at all the stages in their lives. Surely there may have been 'leap stages' for us. But you guys still make me feel lucky to have you in my life until now."

I hop this person understands that it is change that make us strong and help us grow... Perhaps, the one that hasn't grown since we broke up, is you.

I was always looking for a family in Singapore. When I was in JC, I thought I finally found one. I thought my friends and I would stay together forever. However as my uni period started and they started their army life, the family that i was so proud of slowly broke apart. I was heartbroken, but determine to continue my search on somewhere i really belonged to. This semester, I finally found what i was looking for, a group of friends with the same culture and background as me, a place where I thought i belonged to. However, I slowly realized that this is not what i really want, as I am not the person I used to be. I have changed. I have lost my root. I am not ashamed of how I have abandoned my roots, instead I am proud of how I have adapted to the new environment i was given. It is inevitable that the change occurred and this is who I am now. I used to feel really lost and lonely. However, now I realize that home, to me, is everywhere and nowhere. I wasn't lost completely, instead I am someone that can exist everywhere.

I think something isn't particularly right with me. 
                  
I was feeling down one night over some guy issues. I nearly agreed to hang out with this Tinder guy who offered to bring me to a "romantic spot", quoting him.     
                                    
Why does "my guy" even have so much hold on me for me to want to do that? I have had a few guys since he has stepped into my life. And no, he does not know that I am doing this. I would have killed my chances if he did.    
                                    
Tl;dr: I fuck guys because I cannot get the guy I want.

To 

Are you kidding us? you confessed to the girl and expect her to get into a relationship with you while you're still attached? If you're not intending to two-time then I don't see why you can't understand her asking you to sort things out with your gf first. You simply don't deserve any of the two girls and I hope she's not dumb enough to get tgt with you if you broke up with your gf.

sometimes i have already thought through all the logical aspects and i have sorted out my feelings.
i know how i should react, i know what kind of feelings i should have when such things happened.

but at some point in the day, i cant help but to feel sad all over again. when i thought i have gotten over it, i realised i didn't. 
i didn't move on, not even an inch.

my level of sadness should be a decreasing function, it should decrease as the number of days increases.
yet, some point in time i cant help but to think about you, think about things that will never happen.

i know how a person you are,
i know you have found someone else.

you won't be here whenever i need you,
you won't appear on my phone's notification as often as before.

you disappear for hours without replying me, and when you finally replied, you didnt even bother to tell me why you disappeared for hours.
yes, you are not obliged to, and i know that.
that's why it hurts.
i have no rights to ask more, you have no obligations to tell me.
I have to live with it.

in the past, you wanted to see me so badly, squeezing all available time to meet up, staying back in school, having meals together, etc.

now someone else has taken over my job,
but no one is here to take over your role.

i dont wish for more,
but i really want you to hear that
i miss you.. 
alot.

Facebook has been making me so sad lately. It seems like my friends are all doing well in university, look good and have amazing social lives. I know this is a sign that I should get off Facebook, since people only post the good stuff online, I don't know what happens behind the scenes etc. But I can't seem to shake off this feeling of dread and loneliness inside of me. 

I just feel so alone and sad. 
-
 
There was this post I came across the other day about how people mistake your independent tendencies for you wanting to be alone. I couldn't agree more. It's been two years in NUS and I have yet to make friends. Yes I've become more independent, but that's because I'm lonely. I am happy that I've become this independent woman but having no friends really sucks. The days are fine, since you are pre-occupied with things. And you tell yourself that it's great to be independent. Then the night comes and all these strange sad thoughts start to appear. You then start to realise how lonely you really are. It's a cycle for me. It's not like I'm a bad friend either. I've always been the positive 'therapy friend'. The friend you go to when you want a listening ear or advice. But when it comes to my issues, no one wants to listen. Oh and why is it that mean people are always surrounded by tons of friends? And here I am with no one to talk to? I guess I should get off Instagram. Looking at all these fake people with tons of friends especially when I'm this lonely doesn't quite help. Life is truly unfair. Good luck for finals!

Part 4 (Continued from the #palemandiaries)
I could not believe my luck. Whilst I had secretly admired her over the one last year, here is a guy who got the chance to be with her squandering it away by messing around with another girl.
I am gonna destroy him, I thought. I will expose him for what a philandering fool he is and she will thank me. Thank me for saving her from him. Thank me for opening her eyes. And perhaps she will be mine forever.

I needed to find the right time to reveal it to her. The setting must be perfect. I was chickening out. What would her reaction be? Would she even bother to believe me.

I remember the day i tried to tell her what I had seen. I needed to ease her in. I could not be like "hey your boyfriend is cheating.....so screw him and be with me." What am I ? Brad Pitt.

We sat across each other in the science canteen. I started with " Are you still dating that PhD guy ? I mean are you still together ?"
She was like "Yah ..it is pretty good." 
Wow this is going to be hard. I looked into her big soulful eyes and it was almost like shooting a kitten point blank while it was mewing at you.
But I cannot back out. Fortune favors the bold, they say.

" You know I saw him with some other girl behind the central library".
"What do you mean ? " she said as she looked up from her food.
I explained to her what exactly I saw. I could not give her the gory details. As much as I was thinking about myself, I could almost not do this to her. Is this was true unconditional love or infatuation felt like ??

She listened to me, got up and said "You must be happy then, now that my relationship is destroyed. I always knew you wanted me for yourself."

Instead of thanking me, she had turned this against me somehow me. She got up angrily like I had done something.

Two days went on, I tried to message her on the phone or MSN messenger (this is 2005 we are talking about). She had blocked me. Somehow shooting the messenger seemed to have been the best way for her to deal with her anger.

Few months later I got onto a 95 and she was there. She completely ignored me like I did not exist. How would I fix it ? How could I get her back.

Few more months passed, my 4th year had jus started . I asked Joanna about her . Is she still around ?

"Ahh she did not tell you....she graduated end of last sem. needed to get out of uni and start working." 

I think I lost her forever. I did not even get a chance to even express my true feelings for her. All I got was resentment and anger for a crime I did not even commit.

(Keep reading. this will continue for 10 years, involve a phD, a marriage and a divorce, I shall try to post once per day).

“I thought of all the others who had tried to tie her to the ground and failed. So I resisted showing her the songs and poems I had written, knowing that too much truth can ruin a thing. And if that meant she wasn't entirely mine, what of it? I would be the one she could always return to without fear of recrimination or question. So I did not try to win her and contented myself with playing a beautiful game. But there was always a part of me that hoped for more, and so there was a part of me that was always a fool.”

if you mom tells you repeatedly that one of your best friends is not truly your friend, do you think you should believe her? many times I have ignored her advice on former friends only to find myself getting backstabbed or betrayed by them. I think so far she has never been wrong about any of the friends who she says are not my friends. but Ive known this friend for many years now and I feel like I can trust her? should I believe my mom's words?

I am so intensely jealous of people who were allowed to learn music when they were in their teens. I used to learn the piano when I was a young kid, but had to stop due to financial reasons + I lost interest. 

I started being interested in it again when I was in primary 5 and asked to resume my lessons, but the answer from my mum was " No. You are already so busy with schoolwork." I asked again every single year from primary 5 till JC1, and every single year I got the same answer. 

It is only today that I realized what an awful excuse that was. We only get busier as we grow older, so does this mean that I will never ever get to learn the things I'm interested in? I'm not trying to blame my mum here, but I feel that it wasn't the right thing to tell a child, to use lack of time as an excuse not to do things. Furthermore, if the financial burden was her true worry, I would have appreciated it if she had told me the real reason. 

Oh well, that is all in the past, and just want to say: those who had a chance to pursue your interests outside of school, you're so lucky and do cherish what you have! As for me, I have since took the initiative to teach myself piano instead :) (But that doesn't stop me from being envious of those who play well!)

What is the best way to seek revenge against someone who rejected you?

Imagine one day where you find a girlfriend who is better than your previous crush. You will be so glad that she rejected you then. If not, you wouldn't be able to find your current girlfriend.

Better yet, she had broken up with her boyfriend and think of how different it will be if you were her boyfriend instead.

The best way to seek revenge is to make yourself happy.

To the all the groupmates I've had this semester:

Thanks for the eye-opening experience. Never have I been so challenged and have my patience tested to its limit. I've never had to state the obvious multiple times - heck, I've even learnt to stand up for myself and point out what's blatantly wrong. Also, I've definitely learned what it means to have grace under pressure. 

I've had my grammatical skills put to the test. All those nights trying to phrase your disjointed sentences better, correcting every misspelled word, and cutting down all the fluff just to meet page/word limit - thank you for all that. If I didn't work with you people, I don't think I would have been able to finally understand why run-on sentences were bad.

Without you guys, I've never would have forced myself to initiate things; to get shit done. I've certainly learned to be less of a passive member and be more proactive. So thank you for that as well.

So overall, thanks for the experience. It was definitely great working with you folks.

Adios, and I wish you good luck.

I don't know how you feel about me. I don't even know how I feel about you. But the idea of us being together is so good I can't help but wishing you would make a move.

Does anyone ever feel alone and isolated, like no one ever understands you? I have always wanted to do a PhD, and I thought that it was the only thing worth doing. But it has been a bad semester so far. I feel like whatever I've done so far isn't worth it, and I feel like giving up. (And I'm only just starting out :( )

I have friends whom I think will get me through, but I'm afraid of telling them how crappy I feel, and I am very afraid of getting close to them (in fact, afraid of getting close to anyone) because I'm afraid of becoming very clingy and too reliant on others when I get close to people. 

All in all, I feel so lonely, and even isolated sometimes; as if no one understands me. Just wanted to rant, and see if anyone feels like it too.

When I tell my friends I am "testing CS3216 apps", I am really just either finding dating partners on Letterbox or admiring Quanyangism on Griddit.

Whispering here counts, too as "testing CS3216 apps".

The griddit thing is surprisingly good. Each day I feel like I have something to look forward to and people to chat with. Also didn't expect to find that the guys there could turn out so cute :)

For those who have gone through bad breakups:
Did you ever find closure? 

I got out of a relationship several years ago... I'll admit that I was the one who broke her heart. We still follow each other on social media sites to this day but we stopped talking ever since we broke up. I dread the day I bump into her on the street. Singapore's so small it's bound to happen one day.
-
 
you know what.
the best way to deal with you.
is to be better than YOU.

i don't have to let you taste your own medicine, 
shall leave this job to others.
one day, you will see yourself wallow in pity, being treated like how you treat others insignificantly, toying their feelings, etc.

you are not worthy of my time, you are not worthy of my feelings.

but nvm, thanks for doing all these to me,
thanks for letting me see your true colours.
thanks for destroying and hurting me so that i know i am not that vulnerable.

anw, i shall wait to see your day coming =)

if you dont know how to love someone,
please dont.

please dont hurt girls who are putting their whole heart to love you,
when you dont have that intention to love them right from the start.

please dont date so many girls one after another just to test which one is more suitable for you.
you'll end up breaking their heart, shattering their confidence..
including mine.

why do you have to be like this.
why did i take your empty words so seriously.

i still miss the times we were together, i miss how you showered concerns over me, i miss how you save that last bite for me, i miss how you hold my hands, i miss how you hug me, i miss every inches of you..

but i have to stop lying to myself.
you are just not someone i imagined you to be.
i miss the memories, not you.

yeah, if only i could register that into my brain.

I'm the guy who wrote . To put it into context, the close group of friends I'm referring to are amongst my oldest friends (7-8 years) and one of them is who I regard as my bestie. But the fear is still there. And I really dread the day they leave me behind, because all of them are achievers of so much more than me. My family is falling apart, my dad just moved out of the house without a word, and I don't think it wise to put more worry on my mum.

Can people stop commentating that I'm fat and I need to lose weight. It's extremely annoying and uncalled for. It could be from depression that I'm facing. Could people be more understanding? And like I would something if I'm not so stressed from school.

To all those white knights who comment on posts where a guy complains about how he no longer finds his gf attractive cus she gained weight/changed in some way, you all need to go outside and stop dreaming about how u would be so much better at being a boyfriend than that OP. Chances are most of you are evergreen, and when u get urself a gf u'll understand. Nothing hurts more than the pretty girl u had liked slowly becoming less attractive, and worst still not doing anything about it. Call me and OP visual but the minute this same thing happens to u I'll see how long u can stay on ur high moral horse about her personality being most impt. Sure, you'll still love her but u'll always be thinking if there are better partners out there. And to the girls who are gonna comment on this too saying how much of a jerk I am, really think hard as to how u'll react too if ur cute boyfriend started dressing like a hobo and smelling bad. Appearances are just as impt as personality and you'll only be fooling urself if u think it's any less.

Hi OP of , you are not alone :)
I understand how you feel like you are not passionate about anything in life anymore. I was exactly like you, and it lasted for almost 1.5 years. You just don't feel the energy in life, and nothing excites you. I clearly know sleeping whole day won't help, and I will hate myself even more if I continue this way. Like you, I sought many ways to help myself. And after 1.5 years of trying, I'm finally feeling much better, much happier with myself.

My suggestions for you! I hope it helps! :D
(1) Stay away from social media
Try to not look at social media so often. I deleted my Facebook and instagram app, so it is not convenient to check so often anymore. It will just make you feel more and more terrible seeing others' "good life". You have to understand, what ever you see on Instagram or Facebook are all positive stories of people's lives, so you never know what's going on. But disclaimer: I still go on these social media, but just less often! because it's more inconvenient without the apps. 
(2) Be disciplined
Same like you, I tried to save myself from trying many new things. Take different faculty modules, exercise more, take up new interests, etc. But it all failed. Why? I WAS NOT DISCIPLINED TO KEEP TO THE NEW INTERESTS. I didn't give myself chance to get acquainted with the new interest. Try to keep to it! For example, sign up for 8 classes of Dance classes instead of just going for 1, unless you really hate it lol. The friends you meet during these 8 weeks will keep you going for more, and love the activity! Don't be lazy and keep yourself busy. Winter holidays' coming, it will get worse if you have nothing to do. Go take up an internship! Earn some bucks and learn at the same time, better than lying at home feeling useless. There's plenty of internships on talentconnect.
(3) Look at the brighter side of life
Stay positive my friend. You are much luckier than many people. Don't indulge in self pity anymore! 
-
 
You bastard. just because you are attached, it doesn't mean any shit. you are not any better than the rest of us. it just happen so that one stupid and unlucky guy decide to fall for you, you feel that you are so much better don't you? even the way you talk to us is different! Do you spare any thoughts to any of us when you talk about your happy relationship? do you realize that only one of us is replying to you and the rest of us is already tired of your nonsense. is there a need to tell us what you guys talk about last night and everything you do on your dates?

NO. I HAVE FUCKING ENOUGH OF IT. IM SICK OF HEARING WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY. I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT KARMA I JUST WANT YOU TO BE DUMPED. AT LEAST IT WILL BE 1 MILLION TIMES MORE PLEASURABLE YOU WHINING ABOUT HOW SAD YOUR LIFE IS.
-
 
I vividly remember I once said to you that I'll never ever regret confessing to you. Maybe I was too blind at that time, too optimistic, so naive in thinking I might get together with you. I actually do regret it now. I regret confessing to you because those experiences we had together are so hard to forget now. I tell myself that I'll move on and that it's over and that I don't need you that much actually and it sometimes makes feel happy for awhile. But that feeling is over as soon as I realise how I actually still can't really forget about you. Or maybe I don't actually want to forget about you. Guess it's the mind vs the heart again? Like in ?

My parents are divorced and I am staying with my stepmother now. Long story short, my step sister has a crush on me. How should I approach this problem? She is the rebellious type with tattoos and dyed hair and although our relationship are fine, I do not feel anything for her. I have a GF too and she knows it.

Regardless of that, she would walk into my room with just her bra and undies whenever my parents are not at home. It sorts of freak me out because I do not know what she will do to me. I already made it clear to her that I will never like her but she said she does not mind and is determined to "eat me". 

I think she just sees me as a trophy which has not been conquered yet and I am afraid she might take advantage of me one day. I have not spoken to my parents about this yet because my step sister does not have a good relationship with them. I don't want to put my sister or parents at a spot but one day i think i will really lose it and do it with my sister.

Hey guys need some advice here. I just found out that my crush, who is more of an acquaintance rather than a friend, has a boyfriend. Needless to say I'm pretty badly hurt inside but i'm willing to move on. Question is do I still keep in touch with her once in a while? Or do i cut all forms of contact?

I used to talk to this guy (A) in fb. Being a shy person I only met him once. He was really a nice person tho i didn't trust him (just to be safe + i don't trust ppl that easily) .he confessed and I told him you are going too fast in this. And there were arguments etc etc cos I didn't want to be in a r/s. He eventually found a new gf and then yet he still message me. He apologise and was nice to me. What does that mean?
-
 
I'm just curious to know - will guys ever forget their first love? Or get over their first love provided they have already left that r/s and found new ones.
Want to hear more on you guys first love.

I know how you felt about me, I've read the NUSWhispers post.. It's so blatantly obvious that it's me you're referring to - number of common modules, sitting together, occasionally eating together and studying together. When I picked that up, I tried to hint to you. So many of the commenters of your confession encouraged you to do something but you never did!!! I was growing weary of hinting to you.. I let it go. 

I've always had a sort of a good vibe with you and it was easy for us to click. I felt comfortable with you, but I never knew whether I liked you enough to consider the possibility of us being together. 

I continued reading the posts, and I eventually even wrote a confession of my own to seek advice. Some were pretty legitimate and I followed those.. Through all these times, you never did anything! Although I did try to initiate stuff. I'd be the one asking you for meals between modules, but nothing! Why!!!!!!!!

Eventually, I decided to tell you how I felt about us, and then you dropped it on me. You like someone else.... 

Gosh I was so stupid :(

To , yes it is possible to still be friends. Even good friends.

I fell for a close friend of mine back in JC, and got rejected a couple times over the 2 years. I daresay, aside from my (ex-)girlfriends, she's the only crush and the first girl I ever loved. Eventually, she got together with another guy, but we had a long talk and agree that we should do our best to preserve this close bond that we have.

I'm in my second relationship since then, and we are still close friends. She would still call to wish me happy birthday every year, or to HTHT about life, or simply just to cry after a breakup. We still meet up for lunch/dinner on random days in school, talking about the ups and downs in our relationships, our future career plans, discuss life philosophies, or just gossiping. Sometimes, I will walk her home after dinner because we are so caught up on a certain topic so we just want to keep on talking about it (texting feels different). There could be a semester that we didn't talk to each other at all, but still meet up after finals to catch up about each other's life.

For those who wonder if it affects my relationships, my ex used to get jealous sometimes, but it wasn't a major issue (we broke up over irreconcilable difference over our lifestyles after 2 years). My current girlfriend has close male friends, and thus very understanding of me having close female friends.

So yes, while the initial period after rejection is tough, but after a couple of months it is really about how much you treasure the friendship and how much you effort you are willing to put into maintaining it (and not fall back into it). For me, it turns out that she became the one friend that is a constant in (the past 5 years of) my life. Sometimes we will reminisce about JC times and laugh it off. I would laugh at (after comforting) her when she broke up and state my awesomeness. She would lament about how guilty she was for rejecting me and how afraid she was about losing me as her close friend. It is a wonderful form of companionship that is totally different from the more passionate feelings, the care and concerns that I have for my girlfriend on a daily basis. 

tl;dr. Yes, assuming you are really over it, and treasure the friendship.

I don't have a father. I am not close with my siblings. I don't have a good relationship with my mother. She often blame/scold me for not caring for the family, not smiling at her, not talking to her, not talking to my siblings, not caring about the cleanliness of the house. She blames me for not spending time with my family and all. 

Why? My friends doesn't use my words against me. My friends understands my stress. My friends dont add on to my stress by scolding me. My friends talk to me without the conversation leading to and argument. 

Sometimes I just kept my mouth shut when my mother is scolding because I don't want to further aggravate her. However, she takes it as a sign of disrespect, saying that I don't want her at home because her presence at home makes everyone unhappy. She will say how I prefer to spend time with my friends and how we are better off when she is not at home, etc. 

I never said that. I never ever not want her to be home. I just don't like the fact that any conversation that we have will eventually lead to an argument and sometimes (most of the time) I dont even know how it escalated so quickly. 

I don't want to hurt my mother. She is my everything. But I just can't meet her expectations. I can't be her perfect child. I can't. Sometimes I just want to run. Run away from everything. Sometimes, I wonder if my family will be happier without me. Since I don't care about the family, my presence doesn't make a difference anyway.

I just fell out of a relationship of almost 4 years at the start of the year. We were each other's first love. I thought I would have taken forever to get over it. 

The first few months were definitely terrible. For 3 months, I could not help but cry every time i think about it and cry myself to sleep every night. I had trouble concentrating in class whenever my brain chose to think about it again.

The 3 months that followed was better... I started to focus on other things like finals and was kept busy with important things during summer. I thought i was really getting over this.

Everything was fine until July when we met up again. I was conflicted because... i thought i was doing so well but all i really wanted to do was  to give it another shot. But the feeling wasn't mutual.

So after that i was renewed with determination and somehow magically i got much much better. Maybe i finally came to terms with the fact that there is no longer any hope in this relationship.

You'd always hope that it is just you overthinking and things weren't really that bad. That love can conquer all. Only after the relationship do you realise how blinded you were and how many ways the relationship was actually going wrong, and how it was built on unhealthy grounds.

Fast forward to now, i find myself opening up my heart again, although i still find it super scary to be so vulnerable and exposed once more. After all, it took a year or so to completely break down all the walls in the previous relationship. It is still pretty unimaginable to let someone in again, to the deepest corners of your heart and soul, and to potentially be crushed again.

I think I've found someone i am willing to open up to... but i can't help but be terribly afraid. I guess love is always a risk, ya?

I don't know if anyone would be able to relate to this but i just wanted to share this somewhere. No matter what each of you are facing, I wish all the happiness to everyone in the world. :)

I was a friend with a girl since secondary school and recently I had a crush on her. I wanted to confess to her but I didn't dare to. Hence I start complimenting her looks periodically and wanted to wait till I get into uni and directly confess to her. I asked her a few times whether she has a boyfriend in uni but she say no. One day I realise that she doesn't took a long time reply to my text and when she replies, she give short and unemotional answers. A week later I realise she had a boyfriend in uni and they were close enough for her to put her head onto his shoulder.

By the way, I'm in army now and I'm feeling so helpless. Any advice?

I've lived in perpetual fear that when I am no longer useful to my close friends they would all leave me. I also fear the same if they know about my insecurities. And recently, I've begun to feel that sometimes, I don't matter to them at all, that I am dispensable, replaceable. And I don't dare to voice these out. I don't know what to do.

Met this guy on an dating app and realised that he is actually currently attached. Yet, he still join the app pretending to be single. Poor girlfriend who happens to be a nursing graduate from class of 2014.

My first love. 

Is it bad that small things still remind me of him, even after exactly a year? I don't miss him or want to talk to him but sometimes I see something that reminds me of him and I'll think about him? Does this mean I'm still not over him? Or does this mean I'm lonely?

I posted previously about wondering if I am slacking. Frankly, I still can't get the guilty feelings out of me. I understand that it happens often but I guess it just feels abnormal during the first time. Yesterday night when my group finally submitted our report through ivle, I had this inner thought that I am thankful for once for no peer evaluation. Previously in JC, I have always been the main contributor for projects and it saddens me now that I cannot contribute. Gosh, I hate arts modules sometimes. Thanks for listening to my rant. No need to comment or anything. Just wanna let some steam out.

I considered myself an introvert. I feel comfortable to be with the same group of people, however, in university, hanging around with different groups makes me feel uneasy. Yes, it definitely widen my social network but I just don't feel comfortable with it. Sometimes I hate myself for not being an extrovert... Someone please help me! 
-
 
I could feel the chemistry when I was texting her and she is really fun to talk too... She is pretty as well and I am sure there are a few who are interested in her. But I do not know how to start conversations with her and I am afraid she might find me a nuisance as it is exam period now. I am also worried I might say lame stuff.. Any tips from guys here?

Hi guys, I need some help because I don't know what's going on.

I've been feeling awfully down since the start of the semester, and people are starting to notice. 
The things I typically love to do, I no longer find any satisfaction doing. I used to love studying (don't judge), and I don't anymore and I find it such a chore. I liked going out with friends, and that too has dappened my spirits although I put a smile for the sake of being social. Even food has lost its appeal, chocolates no longer has that euphoric effect. There was nothing to trigger it, no traumatic events, no breakups, nothing to make me feel this way. 

On the plus side, Im not suicidal and I have no want to do so. I just feel that life is no longer meaningful and nothing I do makes me happy. I've tried a lot of things to get me out of this hole I seem to be digging for myself, trying new things, watching funny shows, visiting animal shelters (because animals can be therapeutic), exercising, eating foods I used to love, telling my friends about it etc, and it doesn't seem to work.

All I want to do is sleep in bed, and do nothing, and im not even tired! Not that my schedule is hectic or anything, but I just want to shut myself out from the world.
Can anyone help me? Am I depressed? Is there something wrong with me? Am I really just "burned out"?

I have graduated from NUS a year ago and am now overseas doing a 4 year masters with a small class.

Unfortunately, I didn't get off to a good start. I wasn't exactly fond of being with my clique and I can't get along with my flatmate, who also happens to be in our course and part of this clique.

So naturally after a while, I broke away from them and was pretty much on my own or just sitting with random classmates. Hence, I became distant with that clique and even more distant with my flatmate (we had a quarrel last sem that wasn't really resolved).

Fortunately, we are moving out to our own new apartments after this sem so there won't be this tension at home anymore. 

Problem is, how do I go to class without having to feel awkward seeing them? This clique is pretty big, and I'm aware they have been talking behind my back (I'm close to someone from that group who told me). I just feel kinda uncomfortable with them. I know that studies come first and I'm here to learn more than anything. But sometimes I can't help but feel weird and out of place. I don't really have a group of my own but I do have other friends whom I'm close to in class. How do I learn not to care? 
-
 
 putting her head on his shoulder... isn't that like the least kind of close amongst all the different kinds of close?

Let me start off by saying that I love my girlfriend. She's smart, funny, generous and has a great heart.  However, since we got together, she has been eating and eating so much that she put on about 10kg in weight. I guess it's partially my fault that we eat so much nice food. But I can't help but feel like she is getting more and more unattractive to the extent that I can't even kiss her anymore without feeling slightly disgusted. I have tried to encourage her to exercise with me or start a diet, but she is incredibly reluctant and never wants to commit to losing weight. What do I do?
-
 
To the OP of 12427, don't be so gloomy and sad! It can be that the girl isn't really good in text messages or whatsapp, so hence her replies appears to be cold and short. I get feedback from my close friends saying that my replies on text and whatsapp are quite business style - no emojis when i first started texting, straight to the point replies and no fun at all, but in reality I'm not like that at all. I'm a girl btw. Continue to have your sunny sessions with her, and see how it goes! Just my 2 cents. :)

hi seeing all these relationship confessions has somewhat urged me to do one.... 

I like a girl who was my best friend. We were really close and I felt that maybe some day we might end up together. 
But I kept it in because she wants to focus on studying. 

And then on the last day I confessed.... And the ending was predictable for any typical one sided love story. 

"Oh sorry, I only saw you as my best friend," 

Yea... I cried that night. I couldn't stop thinking about how stupid I was to confess. 

Fast forward one year I am in a loving, harmonious, exciting relationship with my current girlfriend. I honestly didn't know perfection existed until she came into my life. I sound like I'm bragging right? 

But seriously to those people who have been rejected by their crush. I am telling you, don't let it beat you up, sometimes it's not your fault, there are times when two puzzle pieces just won't and will never be able to fit together. So stop being so harsh on yourself. Moving on is actually quite easy if you BELIVE it is. 

Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. Sooo cheer up guys !!! and it's actually true there will be someone out there who are 10x better than your crush and will give you the love you rightly deserve so persevere!!! 
-
 
I confessed that I confessed to my gf about making a confession about making a confession about my reaction to a confession my ex made about the confession I made a bout her confession on this confessions site. 
-
 
Hey D, I know you go through my facebook timeline often. Come on, just message me already. I promise I won't bite :)
I hope you are not feeling lonely, I saw you sitting alone..
Good luck with your finals!

To  OP: I've had my fair share of (inappropriate) crushes too. Some in the workforce. And I always dread lunchtimes or even toilet breaks when the chances of meeting my crushes would appear, afraid that I might flush or look loserish. Yet at the same time I want them to notice me. It eats me up to be so self conscious and wary of my environment. At times, I will take note of what time they come in, sometimes even stalking their public profile online. My only advice is to nitpick on your crush's character or personality, and associate him with a trait that you dislike in a partner. Whenever you think about him, you will remember an attribute that turns you off. It has worked for me (temporarily). It could help you too.

To  What constitutes as flirting? Sometimes I invite a friend, who is a guy, to my room to study. But we are really good friends, and we honestly just study and talk in the room. However, we don't really text as we see each other almost everyday because of cca. I also feel that it is better to have conversations in person. To be honest, I would consider a relationship with this guy and me asking him to hang out is so that I can figure out if he feels the same way or if he is just being a good friend. I don't want to fall too deep only to find out my feelings are not reciprocated. You ask her not to play with your heart? Guys are guilty of the exact same thing. Girls will be equally confused about feelings especially when the guy is super nice to her. If you are not interested please indicate that you only want to be friends.
-
 
I asked her: "why is she letting herself fall back into the traps set by her ex boyfriend" 

She is aware of his dark past, his spontaneous bursts of anger and hatred, yet why does she still choose to ignore those flaws and continue to stay by his side?

She tries to justify her actions by saying that, "he is not as bad as everyone says he is, he has a caring and compassionate side too," 

I scoff every time. I try to remind her of the times he has played with her feelings, how he has the tendency to exaggerate about his past and his experiences, I tried telling her that he isn't safe, stable nor worth her time. 

She always retort "no it isn't true," with such conviction that i have no response. 
I just offer her a supportive smile. What else could I do? 

My friend, wants to stand by her "bad guy".  
The sad thing is that it isn't because it is thrilling to her or she finds it suave of him to have a dark past, but due to her bigheaded confidence in thinking that she, out of everyone this guy has ever met, has the ability to thaw the cold and hard heart inside her ex boyfriend. 

It is sad because the only way she can rid herself from that confidence is having to have her pride being shredded into pieces over and over again till she reaches an epiphany that he is not worth it. 

Her pride has been torn to tiny pieces twice already. I wonder how many more times does she need to go through before she realise that the guy who showers her with hollow "I miss you" "I love you" "you are special to me" is not worth her time anymore. 

She can do so much better. This whole thing is so burdensome TBH.

In October 2011, my then girlfriend sent me a message on Facebook. We had plenty of argues initially but over time, she somehow fell for me. We met for the first time and after a few meetings, we got together in November. Things went pretty well: we spent meaningful times together dating, hugging and occasional kissing with what limited time we had. My mum imposed a curfew on me. 
Like any other relationship, we also bickered over who was right and wrong over many matters, but we always got back together.

In the second year, shit happened. I found out that she got to know a guy friend through her CCA from another school. She sent him hugs and kisses through her Facebook messages, which she brushed off saying she "confused me and him". Unbelievable isn't it? However, i decided to let the matter rest and carry on with our relationship. 
I have to admit i too was communicating with other girls behind her back, but it never went to the extent of her sending heart shaped emojis and kisses to someone she hardly knew. 
Long story cut short, things went turbulent and we broke up in 2013.

Two years later today, i found out that three chats in her Facebook messenger in 2011 had plenty of sex related stuff with guys she have not even met in real life. She even asked a guy to strip her, finger her and much more. I'm at a total loss, i wanted to kill myself for doting so much on a girl like her. What should I do? Confront her? Can someone enlighten me? I'm worried that I will turn back to cutting to relief the unbelievable tension that is in my head...

does a jc influence how a person character is like? i realised that those from better jc's tend to be studying harder than others, whereas some people just dont seem to bother and i notice that they come from 'lousier' jcs.

Sorry for the long chinese post, it's the best way for me to express what I want to say and I really need to get this off my chest.

这几年来我一直过的得过且过。孤孤单单，对什么都没兴趣。谢谢她的出现让我有勇气找回自己。因为她我才是现在的我。周围一直围绕着一群能一起开怀大笑的朋友。

虽然我一直都觉得她不怎么漂亮。身材也不怎么样。妆还化得那么浓。裙子有时穿得那么短。即使这样 我还是很喜欢她。我喜欢她说话随意 不经雕琢。我喜欢她举止温柔优雅。我喜欢她做事认真尽力。我一直相信如果我能更了解她，一定会发现更多更多让我喜欢的地方。让我更加更加喜欢她。

但也许爱情需要的巧合真的比我想象的还多。也许真的需要像幸运信般给予的幸运。 这就是所谓的缘分吧。与其一直追究不可能知道的为什么，不可能分清楚的谁是谁非，还不如就这样以无缘为由算了。现在的我只想好好的做我自己，等待下一个她的出现。

我一直希望能再次看见她为我露出的微笑。虽然事与愿违 我会带着她微笑的记忆，让心慌 让心痛 让心碎 都成为纪念。我希望现在的她过得很好，心里是开心的。我也会带着她让我找回的笑容，等待一个会因为我而笑的女生。

“对不起我心里那个位子要空出来了。你不能一直占着。 但你也一定要幸福哦。”

To 
Did you talk to her recently about her love life? Some people just don't like to announce their relationship status changes but wouldn't mind sharing if their friends asked (Admittedly, I'm one of them). It's also the reason why my friends keep asking me about my love life on a regular basis to keep up with the news.  In fact, instead of being angry at me for keeping secrets or accusing me of 不够朋友, they were happy that I got attached/got out of an unhappy relationship (even though the news was already 4 months old). So instead of being angry over small matters, why not take things with a bigger heart? Understand that being good or even close friends does not imply that they must tell you everything even their secrets (they may not even see it as secrets) but rather, you know them well enough to know their preferences and habits. Of course, if you asked and she lied to you.... then it's another story altogether. Or if she tells everyone else but you (self-initiated without external factors like probings).
-
 
To , yeah I've been rejected before but I still remained friends with my crush. 

What happened was after 3 months or so of chatting I found that I really really liked him, and I confessed, knowing that he probably didn't feel the same way (I hoped, of course). Obviously I got rejected, but we still continued talking, although I felt miserable every day but I couldn't help but want to chat with him all the time. 

Gradually we grew closer, although there were the periodic confessions from me and the continuous rejections from him. As a result I tried to distance myself from him, but I always ended up giving in, which made me feel useless and pathetic. He kept claiming I was one of his best friends, but I didn't feel that he treated me that way. 

We had a huge falling out eventually over that, over my insecurity and his pride. Getting close again after that was a very long and prickly process, but in the end it was worth it. 

Because we're together now :p
-
 
A guy stared at me then smiled when we made eye contact eventually and the eye contact lasted for about a minute. I thought he was attractive and I think he could tell that I was attracted. I also got a feeling that he really liked me a lot. So I kept staring back waiting for him to walk over and perhaps talk to me but he just kept smiling at me. So when he didnt do anything I just walked away awkwardly. I think he positioned himself there on purpose as he knew I would be there for me to notice him.
Perhaps he just wanted to show that he thought I was pretty but is it wrong for me to feel like he was playing with my feelings? I mean his friend was there observing my reaction. Could I have been just a test subject for him to have validation that he was attractive? Or was I supposed to have walked over to him?
Really didn't need it as I was still recovering from another guy having toyed with my feelings. I'm feeling pissed off as I think he may have just been using me. That would be 2 cases consecutively. Sometimes I just get so sick of people giving ambiguous signals and I may fall for them and get my feelings hurt when they are not serious. I mean I wouldnt look at someone like they were the world to me when I wasnt going to start a relationship. I just don't really care anymore. Maybe I should just let my parents find a husband for me. I can't play nor do I understand these games. Neither do I have time for it anymore. What am I doing so wrong.

Would it be okay for a girl to ask a guy whom does not really know her that well out to get to know each other? How would guys typically feel about this?

How many people would be up to lobby for a designated smoking point in NUS?

For non-smokers who hate smoking and are about to bash, consider that should we have a legal place, we won't have to find random nooks and crannies where the smell may get to you. You have your needs, so do we, and as much as you don't want to smell smoke, we assure you we don't want you to either, if we had somewhere we know we could go to and you know you can avoid.
-
 
, if you want to know the other person better, you could start by texting him some interesting things/ things that you 2 could relate to, or have sort of talked about before (e.g. real funny or relatable memes). I think from the person's reply you can gauge if he also wants to know more about you. If he's also interested to know more about you, his replies will tend to be a more open-ended one instead of a convo ender. But that being said, you have to initiate the correct kind of convo that can be maintained. I would say start small, to avoid giving the wrong signal, & ALL THE BEST.

When you introduced your boyfriend to me, the first thought that came into my mind was " A flawless girl is wasted on a ugly freak ". From that day onward, the urge of snatching you away continued to grow stronger in my mind. I'm like an emperor who is willing to wage a war over a pretty damsel。为了得到我心愛的女人，我会不擇手段，就算血溜成河 ，也值得！So what, if the whole world condemn me for being a 3rd party? As long as I'm able to conquer your heart and hold you firmly in my arms, all these insults are nothing. I will decorate you with jewels and perfume and make you my empress. 我可以为了美人，放弃江山. My effort to sow discord between you and your boyfriend is showing progress. Yes! Dump that useless fool and come to me. You are mine, to begin with. You belong to me, ever since the start.

I am an alumni of NUS for a few years and now in the workforce.
This is a story about a simple girl that happen to crush on a man in the work place. He is so capable and charismatic. He make falling in love with him easy. But, he is married. Can I ask for advice on how to forget him? I met him every day in the office. It is very difficult to control my feeling. I am sincerely seeking kind advice to make work slightly less torturous. Thanks in advance

I feel tired, sick of this nightmare. There are people out there who achieve with little effort but I'm those that achieve nothing with maximum effort. Studies, relationship, family etc. Putting in so much effort, I can't even do well in a course that I liked. Putting in so much care and patience, I lost my crush to someone he barely knew for half a year ( I know him for almost 2 years now and we have been through a lot). Putting effort to spend time with my family more, I watch others having fathers teasing them while I lost mine. Life is unfair; you don't get what you always want. I used to believe I am the one in control of my destiny; now I am uncertain. While others are studying hard for their finals, I'm just staring at NUSWhisper page and wishing to graduate. Alas, life is not an equal dice. And whether or not NUSWhisper will post this becomes irrelevant; I just need to rant and escape this nightmare.

I disagree with the random allocation of project group mates for cross faculty compulsory mods. I am a year 3, while my other half just orded and is a freshie. Due to different timetables, we do not meet each other as frequent as when he was still with saf, plushe is really friendly, goes for many freshmen orientation camps and joins many ccas makes me worried that he we will ghost n drift apart. My bf has way too many girls around him and I will be graduating soon and we don't have plans to get married. Commenters or advisors don't talk about trust k. I do trust him, but some girls just like going for attached guys for f**k sake ={

Do any girls out there feel that their boyfriends are too good for them? I do. Although he doesnt think the same, I cant help but to feel inferior at times.

To  No one is really all that busy. If you really wanted to make something happen, you would find the time for it. The fact that you decided to not free up some time is enough evidence that you are not serious about it.
-
 
 I am currently in this situation myself. If there is still a glimmer of hope, go try for it. Even if she finds someone else eventually, you have one more friend. Take it as a transition phase, it hurts even more to avoid instead. Be forewarned: you will be overwhelmed with grief and disappointment. For you see, I never confess to my crush until he had a girlfriend. I told him then that we can remain as friends. Although it was heartbreaking (we were so close), I  treasured every moment we have. At first sadness overwhelmed me and crippled me so much I could not do anything. But I realize it was I who decide the outcome: to make it the best memories or the worst. I chose the former. I controlled my grief and pain so that we can still be friends and I can still have a beautiful memory of him. Love does not need to be returned but one can hope. Be strong, my friend. And yes, I still do love him very much but I can only do what is left. There is still hope. I cross my fingers and pray. T.T

I've been with my current girlfriend for 7 years now and I always receive comments like "Wah! How you last so long?" or "You not tired/bored of her yet?" and I am always incredibly incredulous towards their thinking. There isn't really much of a secret formula towards being in a long and lasting relationship - love, commitment, constant effort - but what cause many relationships to fail is not the unawareness of what is necessary, but rather the fact that either/both party fail to deliver it after awhile. It gets tiring to put in constant effort day in day out with the same person when there are so many "better" girls/guys out there, but if she is the right person it shouldn't be difficult at all because all you really want is to constantly make her the happiest she can be.

One other belief I hold true is that if it is something that you feel the need to hide from your SO, then you shouldn't be doing it. You should be able to tell him/her everything and if its something you can't or that you have to delete away then maybe you should consider if what you're doing is right/harmful to the relationship.

As the saying goes: falling in love is easy, staying in love is hard. Personally, I feel that there isn't a need to constantly be on the search for your SO as true love will come looking for you. All the best to everyone be it for matters of the heart or for finals :-)

Having been through hard and depressing times myself, sometimes I realize that I could distinguish a face that went through such experiences from the crowd. Most of my instinct judgement are right; I also knew when my friends need a supportive hug and a listening ear. Being through such times myself brought immense pain and also an empathy for others. It has also made me stronger. And I hope, when I could leave these misery behind, I could help others to leave theirs too. I have been suicidal a few times but I always remember, I have responsibilities I need to commit to. Thanks for listening to my rant.

I'm going overseas for 3 weeks.

I am really shy around this girl. I don’t know what to do when she flirts. She has been flirting with me on and off for several months already. She’s quite a likeable girl while I am the typical awkward shy quiet guy who is always alone. Recently while we are at the walking up the stairs with other friends, she pretended to lose her balance and tried to fall towards my direction. It was a wdf moment for me and I did not know what to do. So i stood there awkwardly and she was like should I fall anot:(

After that while we and our friends were having dinner (i am the only few not staying in campus), those not staying in sch asked if we could crashed. Then she told me I could go to her room!! I was panic stricken and kept quiet. I know this is obvious flirting but I really don’t know why is she like this. She does not text me but will flirt with me on-and-off. So do girls actually do this type of stuff?? All the guys in this clique are pretty charismatic/humorous/sweet-talker except me. She always tell me not to become like them. I feel very intimidated around them because they are so witty and eloquent. 

 If you do not like me please stop playing with my heart!!!

Tldr: i need advice whether or not i should continue pursuing my crush after initial signs were not good. 

Ok so here's my situation (dont worry this is not some "first letter of every sentence" bullshit)

I had a huge crush on a girl in one of my modules. Every lecture throughout the semester i would sit diagonally up from her so i could steal glances at her. But the problem is that she's always with her friends, which makes it difficult to approach her. Plus being an introverted and shy guy did not make things easier. 

Our last lecture for the semester was on tuesday and i was hoping to God that perhaps somehow all her friends would pon lecture and she would be sitting alone, but obviously to no avail. As the lecture ended i watched with a sinking feeling as she climbed the stairs up to the exit at the top of the LT, passing me on the way up and not even glancing in my direction as she was busy with her friends. I knew  that  that was probably the final time i would be able to see her  as she's not from my faculty (i'm from engineering doing an arts mod and her t-shirt says FASS). A short while later, and with a heavy heart, i made my way out of the LT. I did consider for a brief moment whether i should follow her and see where she goes, but changed my mind. 

On Thursday, I was at Utown bus stop waiting for D2 when by some stroke of luck i saw her there, alone! I knew very well that that would be my last chance to get to know her. It was now or never. My heart was beating like a jackhammer on steriods as i approached her. "Hi you're doing xx1234 as well right?" I asked, trying my best to hide my nervousness and putting on the best smile i could muster. 

We made some small talk while waiting for the bus. I asked typical questions like how do you find the module xx1234, where are you heading to etc. Turned out that she, like me, was going to science faculty. She was going to the library while i had a lecture. 

It was all going pretty well. The only thing that bothered me was that she hardly asked me any questions. I was the one doing all the questioning. But at least her responses were not one worded. Maybe she could sinply just be shy?

When the bus came, we boarded and continued our talk. I asked if we could swap numbers and she said sure. When we reached science we parted ways and needless to say for the rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about her and the conversation we had, though i had this niggling feeling that she wasnt interested due to her lack of asking me anything about myself. 

That night, i texted her to say hi and she didnt reply till the next day, despite her "last seen" status showing that she did go online at night. I asked if she wanted to study together for that mod today (Friday), but she said she's busy. The conversation ended there as I didn't want to disturb her. 

I really don't know what to make of this (i'm an evergreen guy so i'm not good at reading girls' body language). I keep thinking that i'm only bothering her with my whatsapp messages. But perhaps she was indeed busy considering it's only a week before exams. Should i continue texting her? Or should i just let her go (reluctantly)? Was my approach too hasty? After all i asked for her number like only 10 minutes after getting to know her. For all the experienced guys or girls out there, what do you think? Serious advice only please! I'm quite bothered by this. And lastly thanks for reading this super long post!

Do platonic friendship between a single heterosexual guy and a single heterosexual girl really exist? 

Because so far in my lifetime I either: 

1. I either catch feelings or they catch feelings 

2. The only time we don't like each other is when we aren't even close to begin with 

3. We both have partners. 

Otherwise I haven't encountered a close friend of the opposite gender who can be my best friend and b there for me under genuine premises. 
Thoughts pls?

Just saw Ben Leong's post on another CS3216 project called Letterbox (http://getletterbox.com/)? Downloaded and tried it. Really awesome app. Why would we use another dating app if we have this? No need for tinder and nusmeat.me!

The app has really good ux design there. Now I understand why i got rejected from CS3216, I'll never be able to come up with such a product.

I have a serious problem involving masturbation. I feel myself getting too involved in it to the extent that I do it three to four times a day. It is seriously affecting my grades and stuff and I'm beginning to lose focus in everything related to academics. I don't really know who to turn to. Like everyone thinks its something funny but it's not. It's really a serious matter and now I feel that the situation is beyond repair .

I'm a Christian while you are a Muslim and we both know and respect each other beliefs. Is it really stupid to carry on building on this relationship or should I stop. You came into my life suddenly at the right moment inspiring me to hang onto my dreams and at the rate this is going, I think it is going to be quite hard to become just friends. It's just so hard meeting people who have the same dreams as you and I really don't want to lose you even as a friend.

I'm feeling so frustrated. Today I just found out someone from my clique is attached and it has been like so many months? Basically she told everyone in the clique except me?! It's really not a fucking big deal getting attached. I don't see why she is so secretive about it. It's not like I will go and steal her BF. I don't even give a fuck about that stupid guy. I honesty regret treating her as my friend because that is evidently not reciprocated.

I feel so fucked up, I keep imagining how it would feel like to french kiss my close guy friend. He's not exactly super hot, but he's cute! To me hahahaa. Goshhhhh :/
-
 
Got attached to a wonderful guy recently. And he's my first. He, on the other hand, had multiple exes and slept with them. I understand that this is normal but i can't help but to feel insecure about his sexual past? Like i'm obsessed with knowing every detail but yet i don't wanna know at the same time. 

So guys, is a sexually inexperienced gf a huge turnoff? He enjoys it when we get frisky together but how can i better satisfy him??

I have a confession to make. 
I'm not from NUS
But I absolutely love reading these posts and I wished there was something like this for my school too.

Alright. So first off, I have generalised anxiety disorder (was diagnosed with it when I went to psychiatrist last time and am on medication). This means I get anxiety in many situations, including and especially in the social aspect.

I'm in a class with 100 odd people, and these are people I'll see in the next 3 years of my time at university. And I must say, they're quite an outgoing bunch, throwing birthday parties or just get togethers pretty frequently. But me really disliking such social events and being in big groups, I have declined almost every invitation so far. Plus, I'm not particular close to this class, so being at an event where you know people but aren't too close with (or even fond of) them makes it all the more painful for me. 

But I can't help but feel bad at times. Is it rude to always turn down invitations? Since it's a relatively small class where everyone knows each other, I just get the feeling they'd talk about me being really antisocial (I mean I am but I don't wish to be thought of that way in a negative light). I do talk to people in class, but for most of them, I just keep my relationship with them confined to the classroom. And I don't want to disclose my anxiety problem to them either as I feel it's not just a mental issue but also a personal one where I just prefer my 'me time' a lot.

To  : This may sound crazy but I have a weird thought that you may be referring to me. Or so I hope cos I am also missing someone badly. :(  I am curious are you a guy or a girl? 
-
 
Everyday I hope that someone will care about me, to initiate conversations and chats with me, hope that someone will at least wish me good morning and good night everyday and ask about my day.
I have many workmates and friends, yet if I do not initiate chats or conversations with them, no one will bother to do so to me unless to ask for help or etc. If I dont start the chats, it can go on for several months without me receiving any texts at all.
I feel so lonely, rejected and left out. What is wrong with me? How do I get others to care about me? Sigh 
-
 
Can someone tell me why guys just text and dont make any further moves and after a few weeks/months we stop texting? And also, there have been times guys try to hint a date but somehow when that happens, Im always busy, hence I turned them down and then they didnt try again. What should I do? Am i destined to be alone? 
-
 
The general advise to someone who is rejected is to move on/forget about your friend. However, has anyone stick through the pain and finally manage to become good friend again? To move on/cutting contact seems like the easier option but if you clearly know that your crush could be a very good friend in the future because both of you click so easily would it be worthwhile and stay and get over the rejection phase?

Of course, meanwhile you are still open to dating.

Recently befriended a NUS graduate and he is one of the nicest guys i know. Thanks a lot for listening to my crap and enjoying my straightforwardness. Jiayous for all your stuff and your ultra busy schedule!!

I'm on the feminine side for being a guy. I'm fair, skinny and gentle. But once there was this fellow intern, and we were casually talking about NS when she said, "I see you like that I also wouldn't want you to protect me."

Lady! How has it come to pass that you are in a position to say so?! I also wouldn't want to do NS and protect you if not for the law! Why don't you do the NS yourself then. Angry leh

I used to be the more enthusiastic one in the clique of friends who will initiate and plan gatherings, but it always frustrate me that other members were rather unresponsive on our Whatsapp group. With unresponsive and uninterested replies, the planning was tough but at least they do materialise in the end. Recently I was too busy and our clique had not met for months. A member of the clique voiced that out and everyone agreed to meet. However with no one "taking initiative" and "in charge" this time round, the meeting was eventually cancelled, especially when the venue and time of the meeting was not even confirmed until the very day everyone agreed to meet. Having responded that I would not be meeting them on that supposed date due to other commitments, I can only watch in anguish "behind the scene" through the messages in the Whatsapp group. If only everyone showed a little more interest, responsiveness and effort, then there won't be this kind of awkward cancellation at the last minute that even left a few members angered as well.

Been attached to my gf for a few years now, but we have never gone past 3rd base because she's uncomfortable with it. I respect her feelings, so I've never pushed her for it other than the first time I tried. That being said, I have needs too, so let's just say I've resorted to paying for... services. I know it's wrong, but that being said, I really have to satisfy my urges sometimes, and I know it's something I cannot force my gf to do if she doesn't want it. These conflicting emotions have caused me to be stuck in a dilemma, and I also feel guilty cuz it feels like I'm sort of cheating. Any advice anyone?

Hi everyone, another sleepless night for me... I just wanted to hear from others how you go through your worst days, and why (: if you feel like sharing, either anonymously or in the comments, some honest thoughts would really be nice. 

I guess I'm at a place where everything I've held on to doesn't quite feel enough to overcome what I'd like to be away from. Feel being a relative term of course... I'm not ungrateful for what I've had in my life or emoing, I'm actually quite a happy person. I believe in God too, so I do really feel that not everything in life is meaninglessness. I know God loves me. I'm not quite sure how I've gotten to this place now... 

I guess we all have our own struggles, big or small, and we need to just keep going moment by moment day by day. Good job for holding on, guys. I know some of you do it in spite of the toughest situations imaginable, and others will do the very same when their turns come... 

I hope I can understand why as well. I know everyone has to have their own personal reasons. I wished I'd grow up and have mine.

I confess that I identify as bisexual but honestly the only guy I've ever felt attracted to is my current boyfriend. 
We have a close-knit relationship however I'm beginning to think that I find women more attractive than my bf (I've always been attracted to women, it's just that these thoughts have become more intrusive lately).
I don't doubt that I love my bf but I just get this feeling that I'm incomplete. 

OR MAYBE I SHOULD JUST STUDY FOR FINALS AND STOP THINKING ABOUT ALL THIS BS.

Went cold turkey for probably a month or two. When I saw a friend 'liked' a post, I started reading NUSWhispers again. Interestingly what I immediately did was not so much to read the content of the posts, but the comments. In particular, who the commenters are. To be more precise, if the regular commenters are still around. Even though we never really interacted much, and you may be trying hard to be witty, it feels like an integral part of this place. Familiarity breeds fear of change. As I scrolled down the reverse-chronological news feed, I felt my worst fears coming through, but I persisted and  loaded more posts and finally I see a familiar commenter, then another, and another. Ah, it seems like this place is still the same. But I know that one day, these commenters will eventually graduate from commenting here (happened to many a forums). Never mind, for now (probably at least until the end of the academic year?), it's the same.

I hope everyone who reads this is happy and healthy. If you're wondering whether or not to start catching up on your webcasts/studies, the answer is YES. If you're heart broken, compartmentalise it away at least until your exam is over (sorry I'm not a love guru). Don't forget to check your thumb drives and laptop when moving from place to place. That's all, kohais.

funny how it's during days like this when you realise how alone you truly are.

maybe on other days you may be perfectly fine with spending time alone, but sometimes you just realise that there isn't someone you can turn to. the people whom you think would be there for you, were never there to start with. sometimes I wonder if it's because I am the one who's not putting in effort in my friendships/relationships, but I know I've been trying. maybe it isn't enough. people say I'm a very positive, friendly and energetic person; very independent as well. perhaps it's my independence that make it seem okay to leave me alone, but I'm not okay at all. I might be cheery, outgoing and all, but you don't see the times when I cry in my room alone. the sadness just consumes you whole, and you just find yourself falling deeper into the hole of emptiness.

and of all days, it's my birthday today. thank you all for reminding me how worthless I truly am, how unimportant I am to all of you. today, I slipped off the minds of every single one of you once again. happy 19th birthday to myself, and you all wouldn't notice when I'm gone.

If you asked your crush to go out with you and they did not say yes or no. What's on their mind? (25m)

Saw a post on getting ghosted sometime ago and thought about my past experiences. 

I am a girl who is slightly above average in looks and have attracted quite a fair bit of male attention when I head out to the clubs.  Being young and eager for excitement, I was happy when many guys asked for my number.   As long as the guy didn't look horrible I tended to give out my number.  We would then start the texting and the typical cycle is that after a week or so the guy would ask me out. 

However after all the initial excitement,  I realised that 90% of the guys ghost me after the first date.  Until now I still don't get it.  I don't think it's my conversation skills as I have quite a lot of friends who enjoy hanging out with me.   Can't really be the looks also as I put on as much makeup as I did when I first met them (so they already had prior warning you know). 

It's not like I was super into these guys but getting ghosted just made me feel lousy about myself.  I started to question what was wrong with me. 

Then I got out this whole cycle and started to meet normal guys who didn't ghost me like that.  I know people would say I was stupid to believe the random strangers from clubs would work out but I had the glimmer of hope in me.  Now I realise perhaps this was a misplaced hope.  Can anyone enlighten me why they are like that?  Why ask me out if they weren't interested in the first place 
-
 
how are you doing lately? Are you eating and sleeping well? Are your legs still bothering you? 
I wish I could ask you these questions, but I can't. If I ask you these questions, a conversation will sprout between us two, and that is something I don't need right now. Forgetting you is harder than I thought. I want to talk but I also don't want to. First world problems ... Sigh
-
 
Thank you OP . You may not know it but your post appeared just in time for me to snap myself out of a really dark place with my really dark thoughts. Thank you for giving me a timely reality check and stopping me from being stupid. Your post worked wonder.

I find myself screwing things up and not doing anything satisfactory. I feel really useless and I don't know how long this is going to go on.

i think my crush knows i like him. 
anyway he asked to borrow my lecture notes instead of his friend who was actually writing down more than me. 
I wonder why is he doing this... does he want to talk more or is he exploiting me???
-
 
all the lecturers should mix things up more. throw more group projects and randomly allocate groupmates. would be nice if nus helps its students network, or make more friends, or even... possibly meet their next SO. i mean like else you join a class then also mix with own friends right, that never helped anyone widen their social circle? although some people would say can find by other activities, but isnt it good to have as wide a network as possible?
-
 
Girl who rejected me wants to remain as friend. However, she only text me when she has something to ask me. I would reply in a formal way because I want to get over her. She does not say thanks or continue the conversation. It is so weird. On one hand I sound so cold yet I get upset when she does not continue the conversation.

We used to be really good friends. Few days ago was my birthday and she asked me another question w/o even wishing me HBD. I am so disappointed and sad and did not want to reply her. My wishful thinking is that she is trying to ask me a qn and start a conversation before saying HBD to me. 

What are the odds?

I have a confession to make. My girlfriend's good friend(let's call her A) and I coincidentally took up the same modules this semester. As a result, we have been attending the same classes together. Needless to say, I ended up spending much more time with A than with my girlfriend (who is working currently). From eating, studying, sitting together in tutorials, doing projects, we are practically doing everything together. To be honest, I really enjoyed her company. Even so, I do update my girlfriend on the stuff I am doing with her and I always make the effort to clear up any insecurities she may have. 
Initially, I did not make much of it as I love my girlfriend a lot and I didn't think much of taking modules with A.

 But after almost spending the semester with A together, I'm getting the feeling that she has somewhat developed some liking towards me. (Btw, my girlfriend doesn't join us for meals and stuff as she graduated a year earlier than me and she's working already.) For example, A recently started writing handcrafted notes for me, saying stuff like "lucky to have you in my life", "loves". I told my girlfriend about the notes but not the content inside it and she told me that A only wrote such notes for her on special occasions such as birthdays. (I have received 2 in 5 weeks already lol). 

Also, I am starting to feel that A is trying to come between me and my girlfriend as she has been texting me stuff to try and sow discord between my girlfriend and I. Her texts to me have been increasingly frequent and bordering on flirtatious. I have been keeping such texts a secret from my girlfriend as I fear her reaction. The problem is that I don't know what to do in such a situation. I feel bad to reveal this to my girlfriend as I don't want her to lose a friend and I still treat her A as my very good friend. 

This situation just became stickier as A just jio-ed me to watch a movie with her this weekend (just the two of us) to "celebrate" going through the end of the semester together. The funny thing was that my girlfriend wasn't invited and neither does she know about this.  A has really become a best friend to me, not just my girlfriend's friend anymore and letting my girlfriend know about this surely would mean the end of our friendship and also A's friendship with my girlfriend. I don't know about my feelings for her but I am certain that given a choice now, I would still choose my girlfriend over A. 

I really don't know how to go about with this, and I know continuing this will only make things so much worse in the long run. Should I maintain the status quo or just tell A to stop flirting with me without letting my gf know about this? Or am I just overthinking and she just treats me as a friend :/

Hi I have a confession to make. I feel that some of the regular NUS Whispers "commenters" here are trying really hard to give witty comments just to garner likes and fame... Does anyone else feel the same?

I don't really know if they deserve the likes sometimes but... Deep down I feel like they just deserve a punch in the face. 

And I'm guessing they will probably comment on this too if admin doesn't filter it heh.

the word "love" means different things to different people.
some people treat the word "LOVE" lightly, while others treat it seriously.
you said you love me, but not long after you cut me off.
so what does LOVE means to you? do you treat that word with light importance?
how could you said you love me, when in actual fact, you don't.

when i finally let down my guard to trust someone again and throw away all my insecurities and uncertainties, you had to leave.
you built me up and then i fall apart.

why do you have to make me feel so used to you being around me, then one day, you decided that all these should end.

you left suddenly.

it's like.. i am reading a book and  it ended off with an incomplete sentence. abruptly.

i know i could be just a choice of yours. disposable.
but i tried hard to evade such thoughts, i tried to be positive, i tried to believe your words.
i came up with all sort of irrational excuses to defend your (eccentric) behaviors at times.. thinking that i am the one who is overthinking.

at the end, i am back to square one.
because of this, i felt that, i shouldnt be that optimistic, i shouldnt be so hopeful again.

After several days...

You: "Sorry! I was too busy that I forgot to reply you!"
Response: "Don't worry, you can reply me whenever you're free :)"
In reality: "YAY OMG you've finally replied! I've been dying to hear from you, waiting since the moment I texted you!! I wanted to text you so badly but you haven't replied. How have you been these days?" 

There are days when I really wish we could go back to the times when I didn't have to be careful with my actions; when I could drop a random text or a call without the fear of bothering you. And today is one of those days. I don't want to appear clingy but truth is, I really miss you.
-
 
To , I totally know how you felt. He only needs me when he needs pleasure. Many times, I tried to break away from him but I just couldn't. I texted him only for him to text me back without any initiative from his side. I wish I could be heartless enough and move on. But the fact that I love him more than he loves me, has hurt me deeply. He is a rational and logical thinker, which also means to say if anything is amiss,he recognise the problem and could easily be considered as a red flag. He definitely love himself more. He felt that I couldn't be what he wanted and that is when he stops trying and gave up. While, I am still holding on.

A few questions to couples out there: do you often shower your partner with affection/attention? (e.g. constantly saying how much you like/love the other person, texting each other everyday to talk about your day/ask about the other person's day). How often do you meet up? (especially for the couples who have busy schedules)
-
 
We met through one of those dating apps about 2 months ago. 

Slowly but surely, she became my best friend. I talk to her about anything, and she would always offer her voice of comfort. Often, I find myself having a strong sense of happy obligation to drop everything just to be with her. 

There is one small problem though, we have never met in person. I'm afraid I already love her more than I can ever imagine. 
-
 
  "...but I am definitely going to find someone who loves me more next time...The one who loves more will confirm get hurt more." - That's not love.

"It's almost impossible to find a person who loves you and you love him equally." -  Maybe, but is that important? If it's important, it ain't love.

Would you choose someone who loves you more or someone that you love more? - Both because in either case we love each other and love goes beyond calculations. Is love and it's expression even quantifiable?

-
 
Never had I thought I would fall for you the day you stepped foot into the tutorial room. I had to admit, you were so vibrant looking that I was attracted to you. Knowing that it's my last semester in school, I plucked up enough courage to speak to you.

"Oh hi, you are an Econs major as well?" Only then through further conversations that I found out you were taking this module alone as an elective.

Coming from a disjointed family, it wasn't easy for me to open up to you but I did. Soon after, we looked out for each other during lectures and we always sat together for tutorials. I looked forward to every tutorial as I miss your cheerful personality and yearn to talk to you on every occasion. Kindred souls, that was what I believe we were, sharing our lives with each other.

Commencement soon happened, I graduated while you continued with your studies. On the surface, it seemed that nothing was different as we still met and spent time together.

"Really??", I thought.

Even the dumbest fool could tell that something had changed, is it you or me?

Half past eleven one night, you broke the news that you found your other half. Time stood still for me, but I would rather it reversed. That day onwards, life wasn't the same anymore. All the things we did that I thought were precious moments to remember turned into painful memories. "Have I done anything wrong to deserve this?", as I kept pondering and pondering.

Work back in office was lacklustre, as I battled my emotions from within. Lingering thoughts in my mind seemed to always break any momentum that I had. Loneliness crept in once again as I began to retreat back into my shell. Every once in a while when I see your pictures with your the other half, a part of me dies. Maybe we shouldn't have met at all, so that I wouldn't be hurt so deep.

Suddenly one night, my phone rang and your number appeared on the screen. After some deliberation, I picked up the phone and said "Hello". You said "Sorry, I found out my other half has been unfaithful to me, I need to talk to you, now." 
Fortunately, I had mentally prepared myself for such scenarios during those sleepless nights and this is what I said.   

"I will like to tell you this phrase from the bottom of (my heart) this post, 1st letter of every sentence." :)

Sian. Everyone around me keeps using Whatsapp Web and is trying to peer pressure me to use it as well. Thing is, I'm poor and I'm trying to cut down on unnecessary expenses. I am using iPhone 4 which can't support iOS 8 and above, and so I can't download Whatsapp Web. I know the phone is supposed to be obsolete or something but it's still working pretty well so I don't see the need (nor have I the financial capability) to change. My dad's been taking up a lot of loans just to make ends meet and pay for my school fees and living expenses, and little things like people urging me to change phone or download unnecessary new stuff just irk me :( But then again I don't have the guts to tell them because I may sound defensive to them and that's the last thing that I want :( sigh why am I such a yes man. 

I'm pretty sure the Earth will still revolve around the Sun even if I don't get involved with the latest gadget/software right. #midnightrambling So please guys before telling people off about how they're so not up-to-date, I beseech you to try to keep the comment to yourself. You won't know how much your remark will leave a deep impression on people like me :(

My parting letter to you. 

Missing someone is painful. Missing a special moment is even worse.

Today was one of those days. 
Did you know I walked by the park that we once roamed? 

The walks that we embarked on, the funny conversations that we shared, the smile you gave me when I told you a joke. The memories and the pang of emotions bounded to it all crashed upon me when my gaze settled on the footpath that we often liked to walk on. 
 
It was not till then, that I finally realised that I have lost you. 
There is this void inside the cavern of my ribcage that can never be filled. Your absence has left a huge gap in my life. 

Waking up to your messages, seeing your smile in the morning, hearing your voice in the afternoon were all something that I have grown accustomed to over the few years of our friendship but now it is just me and the looming reality that you are not here anymore. 
The realisation that I am going to live the rest of my life without you by my side frightened me. 
...So I ended up tearing up at the park. 

Why am I torturing myself like this? Why can't I just move on? 

Isn't this pathetic? Maybe.... but moving isn't an easy task- no sh*t. 
I am not a computer that can instantly erase all of my feelings nor am I a whiteboard that can wipe out all of my memories with one single stroke. 

Even now despite of it being two months since we last talked, I still struggle to feel less empty, now that you're gone.

 Perhaps the most funny thing is that we were never something to begin with. 
You were not my lover or anywhere close to that, you were just my close friend who eventually left my side. 
You said that leaving me was for my best interest. 
I'm not going to say anything to that because cutting ties with me may have been the right thing to do but it may also been the wrong thing to do.
I don't care. My true purpose in writing this isn't to put any blame on anyone. I just want to say thank you. I wasn't able to thank you last time because I was so wrapped up with my feelings and I don't plan to say it to your face any time soon because I know I might return back to square one, so I am going to take this chance to express my feelings so I can achieve the closure that I have been desperately trying to get. 

J. 
Thank you for accompanying me during my final year. Thank you for teaching me and opening my eyes to this big world. Thank you for giving me something to look back to. Even though we are mere strangers now, I will always remember you. 

J. Do I regret befriending you? Do I regret confessing to you? Do I regret getting so close to you knowing that I might get hurt one day?

The answer is no and I don't think that answer will ever change. 
J. I miss you terribly but I am also ready to move on. It has been a pleasant ride with you while it lasted. 
I guess it is finally time for me to wake up from my dream ay?

 thank you for the memories and I admit sometimes I do question myself whether I have fought hard enough for our friendship that night? 
But maybe our story is at the point of no return. We are so apart now that nothing can be done to amend the gap. 
And So it shall.....

Goodbye J, wish you all the best. Stay Gucci. 

Ur S: h.y

<Part 1> 
I met my first bf through a gem module. We got together 6 months later but I wasnt "into" him. I had this feeling that he was not the right one for me even though he treated me very well.
My mum is traditional and stubborn and didnt like him at all. So, I never brought him to my house because my mum dont even want to meet him at all. Because of my mum and some other issues, we broke up, patched up a few times until it was emotionally draining for me.
I initiated the final broke up with him after 3 years because he wasnt the one that I would want to spend my life with.
Yet, I want to thank him for the 3 years standing by me even my mum disapproved him. Btw, we still remain in contact, and he is happily attached!

<part 2>
I met my 2nd bf after I graduated from school for a year. He is 6 years older than me, has stable income and job etc, but he is a male chauvinist. He wanted to settle down the soonest, but I was not mentally prepared to settle down. Again, my mum is traditional and stubborn and didnt like him. My mum felt that he was looking for a wife and rushing through the process. Indeed, I could sense that he didnt love me much. Within a year of relationship, he pressurised me to get married, proposed to live with his parents etc, followed his orders.
I wasnt happy in this relationship. Before he initiated his breakup with me, I couldnt sleep at all for 5 days as I had been thinking alot about this relationship and became ill.
He broke up with me and found a gf after a few months. He married a year after he met his gf. 

<part 3>
I met my 3rd bf through online chatting. He is local, but he was pursuing his further studies in USA when I first got to know him. We chatted everyday and decided to meet in Singapore after 6 months of online chatting. It is kinda risky for girls to meet random guys through online chatting. But he was sincere to fly back to meet me and of course visit his parents in Singapore. Everything went smoothly, and we entered into a long dist relationship. I hesitated alot before I agreed to enter into this relationship because he could only complete his studies in 2.5 years. He promised to fly back 3-4 times a year just to accompany me for 1-2 weeks in Singapore because he was a busy man and had to complete his studies and do research etc. It was a tough time for me because I need to be independent in various aspects. It was tough for him to take 25 hours of flight and overcome jetlag etc, just to accompany me. We also skyped every weekend.
Finally, he came back in mid of 2015 and starts his career in Singapore. Having a long dist relationship is different from the "normal" relationship. We have to learn to accommodate each other, get used to seeing each other every weekend etc.

Break up is part and parcel of my life because needs and wants change at different stage of my life. I grow and learn alot throughout my 3 relationships. 
This is my love story. How about yours?

Sometimes the world is just too small. 

Recently my company had this mentorship programme where I had a mentee.  Being a mentor for the first time I tried to maintain my professional image as far as possible. 

Thought I was doing well until one day my mentee came up to me and asked me whether I was at fclub last Wednesday.  My first reaction was like wtf how did u know.   He then showed me a picture his friend sent him.  It happened that his friend just happened to boast to him that he was with this group of hot girls that night (and one of the girls happened to be me). 

Obviously the more embarrassing part was that I was in my slutty clubbing clothes and with one of the guy's arms around me.   I almost wanted to find a hole to hide myself.  Professional image gone. 

Now I am more wary.   What if it was my boyfriend's friend instead?  Maybe the moral of the story is not to take photos.  The less evidence the better.

I fell in love with a bad girl, a really bad girl. When the people around me warned me about your player identity, I stood up to defend you. Are you serious with me? Perhaps, deep inside my heart I already knew the answer. Even if you are a player, please lie to me. Tell me that you ain't toying with me, because I will believe in whatever things you say. I'm just an evergreen guy, you can crush me easily with the tip of your finger. Make it quick and painless for me.

Having a crush is normal I guess but somehow if you let it get to you you will paint an ideallic mental picture of a relationship with that crush and that will devour your heart from within.

can someone wake me up?
i know i am doing it all wrongly,
i know i am constantly lying to myself.
i know this shouldnt be the way to treat myself,
exposing myself to further damages.

i know what i am in for,
i know i shouldnt.
i know all the logical aspects to it,
but my heart does the call.
my heart erases all the logical decisions that my brain told me to do.
my heart told me otherwise, it told me to do things that are "irrational", my heart and mind are fighting with each other with opposing thoughts.

"you should treat yourself better", the voice in my head said.
"you should hold on longer, maybe better things are arriving", my heart told me.

love has no logic, so most people end up following their heart.
of course, it doesnt mean that those who follows their head don't love that someone at all.
is it because they dont love that someone strong enough? or their determination is not strong enough? or they love themselves more than that special someone?
or they are just doing justice for themselves because if they dont help themselves, then who else will?

but, who is there to help me?
which route to take.

my mind told me: 
"you should know that he isnt serious about you and you have tons of evidences to prove it. he is just treating you as a "spare". he wants you only when he needs you, and he needs you not because he loves you.
you should know love isnt this way. you know he wants your body over your heart. 
he isnt suitable for you. he is constantly destroying you, internally. 
he ditched you the moment he found someone else to replace, but still tries to keep you by his side so that you can always be there when he needs you. but he wont be there whenever you need him. 
you wont have him wholeheartedly, because in his mind, there is someone better, someone whom he wants, not he needs.
simply put, you are there because he has yet found someone to replace you entirely, or maybe he wants more choices to choose from.
stop being silly, stop giving yourself ridiculous excuses to explain his weird behaviour.
you know the outcome, you know the consequences, you know how much tears you have shed and that's enough.
some people arent as good as you imagined, some people exist in your life to destroy you and you should defend yourself."

my heart told me:
"even there is 99% chance that he is a jerk, there is still 1% that he may be serious in me.
if he is really serious about me but i decide to let go first, then i will regret in the future. 
probably he needs more time to think through, probably all this will shed light soon. 
it is okay to get hurt, so hang on. 
you might see the rainbow after the rain."

how?

i had my first kiss on this day 4 years ago (11.11.11) and since then I felt like my life changed though we aren't together anymore.
Here's to change and Happy Singles Day!

Some time back I had the unfortunate experience of witnessing a guy asking to marry a girl, and then getting rejected. I had to pretend that I was engrossed in doing my work when I was actually eavesdropping over the entire conversation. 
-
 
I am a girl who just broke up with my bf 1 month ago. He is very respectful and super sweet. I was awed by his chrisma and I totally fell in love with him. But due to some issues, he chose his parents over me. He didn't even have the guts to meet me to communicate the issue face to face. I didn't fight his decision because what's the point of staying with him when he always make decisions without my interest at heart. This really broke my heart and the only reason I could think of is he doesn't love me as much as I do to him. I don't know when I will get over this but I am definitely going to find someone who loves me more next time. 

Would you choose someone who loves you more or someone that you love more? It's almost impossible to find a person who loves you and you love him equally. The one who loves more will confirm get hurt more.

It's been quite a while, but I keep getting reminded of this these days. 

"When someone's been gone a long time, at first you save up all the things you want to tell them. You try to keep track of everything in your head. But it's like trying to hold on to a fistful of sand: all the little bits drip out of your hands, and then you're just clutching air and grit. That's why you can't save it all up like that.

Because by the time you finally see each other, you're catching up only on the big things, because it's too much bother to tell about the little things. But the little things are what make up life." 
From Jenny Han's To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Anyone feel the same way about relationships with family, friends and love?

I'm a guy. I made a really bad decision a long time ago which resulted in my nudes being on the internet. I've tried to request sites to take them down but I always seem  to find them somewhere on the web. Recently I was a Bash contestant and it resulted in the resurfacing of some of my photos. What do I do?
-
 
Its seems like I am chatting more to online strangers than my friends and family. Is anyone in similar situation as me?

What does it mean if the guy asks for a breakup, yet still initiates meetups (lunch, dinner etc), still text sometimes? Im confused right now:(
-
 
This girl in my biz sch class. Got to know her last semester. Our limited interactions have left a deep impression on me and I can't stop thinking about her. Seeing her first thing in the week just chases the Monday blues right away. We are both attached, but I can't help but feel that she feels it too. Anyway school is ending and I'll probably never see her again. I just want to put it out there, that every once in a while, you meet someone special and there is that deep connection. These people are few and far between. In another time and in another place, perhaps.

There is this guy, A, i met him in poly and we became really good friends, or so i thought. Then, almost a year after we graduate he confessed to me. We started texting daily and soon we went out on 1 date, and he MIA. Which i spam call and texted him, to no valid. After a couple of months he came back, apologising saying that he shouldn't have MIA and stuff like that, and he requested that we meet up again, which i couldn't cos it is during finals period. when i rejected him, he started ignoring me again. and this cycle repeat itself a few more times. And he usually take hours to days to reply a simple text. This been going on for a year plus already. 

How could i forget someone like him? I know when you fall in love, there is no worth it or not. But really he make me feel that my love is so cheap and like I'm unworthy of him. Personally, i even degraded myself by finding a FWB so that i could be really 'unworthy' of him. But then this doesn't change the fact that i love him a lot. what should i do? :(

I wonder if it's common in Singapore to not keep in contact with your extended family (cousins, aunts and uncles, grandparents etc.) . I only ever see and talk to them once a year during CNY when the entire clan comes together, and even then interaction is limited at best because I have no idea what is going on in their lives, nor do I have the inclination to find out. Is this normal, or am I simply being a lousy relative?
-
 
I feel so tired. The cohort size of my course is relatively small and we are all just bitching about each other. So tired about all these nonsense. Feels so much better being alone.

I'm a lucky person. I've sailed through life so far, I'm graduating soon from medicine, I have my own car and live in a nice house and never needed to work or want for material things. I'm beautiful enough that I'm tired of the boys throwing themselves at me. 

But. I can't hold a conversation with my mum without it ending in screaming fights. My siblings are spoiled and seem determined to fail every exam. I don't like any of my relatives.

My dad died when I was 21. I was his favourite child. He drove me everywhere and doted on me the most. He gave me the choicest bits of chicken and cracked my crab and deboned my fish and peeled me grapes; a language of love expressed in food. He brought me to tuition, to school, on shopping trips. I never got to say goodbye to him. I still can't seem to get over it. I can't bring myself to tell anyone.

I'm so, so jealous of all the other normal students who are merely worried about grades and BGR. It makes me want to scream sometimes, the triviality. I would trade everything to get him back. Was I not good enough? Was I not pretty and clever and witty and charming at his company parties and family reunions, the perfect child to show off? Did I not do him proud? 

(tell me why you didnt love me enough to stay)

I'm still bitter that he won't be coming to my graduation.

Dear D,

Thanks for always being the one listening to me, and letting me be the one to listen to most of your rants off our busy schedule :) To more good times.

To all the people trying to find someone to date, and feeling crazy. You know, it's not easy to get someone to love you. The only way possible is to make yourself lovely. I have no idea how to do it, though there is an entire industry devoted to this matter.

However, there are definite ways of how not to. Meet, Eliot Rodger. A frustrated virgin dickhead who shot up a sorority house in University of California, Santa Barbara. Luckily for us, he wrote down his manifesto, and some poor souls turned it to a 10 hours long audiobook.

I know it's kinda long, but I use it as a white noise generator while I'm working. And you might ask why I am propagating the message of a killer. In the same way that you would read Mein Kampf. First, it's a guide of how-not-to. Second, give this to your friend, see his reaction and whether he agrees or not. If he does, well, that's someone you should stay a bit away from. Third, I might face criticism as this can serve as a "trigger", or "initiator" or other copy cats, but look, if there are really such people, they would have gone insane and some point; better to spot them earlier than later.

Recently got dumped with my ex after 3.5 years together. It's my last year in uni and they say when going out to work, you won't be able to find a nice guy or any guys for that matter. Feel very jaded and depressed. My BF was like my best friend and a huge source of support. I don't know what to do anymore. Marriage and having kids together was what I always pictured would happen to us. It's so scary to be all alone. Especially since all my friends are attached or getting married or flying off elsewhere. Feeling so alone and upset that I really can't quite breathe while studying for finals sometimes. How to recover from this? I don't know.

I have a huge crush on my project groupmate who I never really got to know, also partly because I'm so shy around him.....how do I stop crushing on him? He's very friendly to everyone so I wouldn't know for sure if he's interested in me. Also, it's my last sem. Maybe i'll never see him again for the rest of my life! Feel so tortured.....and also, feel a lil too old to be having a crush....

We met on one of those apps. I had the vague inkling that it wasn't going to last, but you know, hope springs eternal and all that. First came the usual pleasantries - desserts, long texts, how's-your-day - amazing how small little things like that still made me so happy. You used to ask me to come out to meet every other day - just because you wanted to see me.

Slowly, the texts decreased, and the interval for an reply stretched from minutes to hours. We met once a week, then once every fortnight, then hardly at all. Scheduled dates became hurried texts late in the evening asking to hang. Busy, you said, in explanation for why you took days to reply a simple question. Work, family, friends - they all demand a lot of time.

After we talked about priorities and respecting each other's time, things improved for one week. The next week, total radio silence.

And so we went on for a month, trudging through this sad, undefined, half-dead unlabelled relationship. It's been four months in total, and not once have I been introduced to your friends, nor had my hand held in broad daylight. The latest explanation for standing me up? No apologies, but just a blanket 'was busy'.

Enough is enough. To those lovelorn folks out there, hope on but remember, you get the love you think you deserve. Today I lost someone whom I thought would be worth the care I could give, but in return, I regained self-respect. No one deserves to be the call girl or the back-up plan at the other party's convenience and precious time. Remember - you deserve to be worth the effort :)

TL;DR: You deserve to be with someone who treats you like you are worth a damn. And maybe I'm pathetic and stupid for holding on so long.

I'm hoping I'd get a GF with anime-like personality... So much idealism, they all look so perfect :( Perhaps a monster girl would be nice

Hi, everyone at NUS. Just wanted to say thanks. 
I'm an international student who arrived here in late July. As a student from a country where Singapore is not such a popular study-abroad destination (no offence, not so many people manage to get in, that's why.), I was scared at first. I was terrified of not being able to get along; I couldn't understand half the things my friends were saying, and they couldn't really understand me either. But now I think I'm getting the hang of it. Not perfect = not even close! - but getting their slowly. Now I find myself using Singlish from time to time, loving the food, and even sharing some values that my friends consider important. I whatsapp like my friends now, too! It was all possible because everyone welcomed me with such warm smiles and gestures. Not just my close friends, but everyone I came across at NUS. Most of the time, my expectations are never met but NUS is beyond my expectations (getting cheesy!), I'm thrilled to come back in January for the next 7++ semesters here.
Oh and yes, I'm coming back, still got people asking me if I'm an exchange student. (after all those classes we've had together!)
Yup, so... nothing special, just wanted to say thanks to everyone who helped me get along. A <i>huge</i> thanks. ;)

Not going into nitty gritty details as the identities in this rant might be revealed.  

I have a really close guy friend whom I have known for about 3 years. We have impeccable chemistry and we always have lots of fun together. I admit that at times, it feels as though we are dating. But 6 months ago, a close friend of mine got close to him through me. She teases and touches him whenever she has the chance. 
I was blamed by her for being too close to the guy, and ignoring her feelings. But in my point of view, I really felt that I didn't. In fact, I felt that she was seducing my close guy friend and throwing me aside. I tried to shake it off by telling myself that I may be overly sensitive and tried my best to mend the friendship between her and I. 

However, recently during one of a group gathering - she started it again! Almost everyone thought why is she suddenly so close to the guy! And asked if they are dating or something?! When it happened, I thought 'omg, this can't be happening again??!!' 
First, you blame and deny that you have any intention of seducing my guy close friend. Then, you put the blame on me for being too close with him. Now, with everyone's judgement from that day, I think it's safe to say I wasn't too sensitive about what happened previously.

I'm feeling so upset and affected by it. It feels as though I am losing two friends in one go! And I feel like I am being betrayed emotionally by her. 

Should I play dumb, and continue the friendship with her? 
-
 
I don't even know why I'm writing this. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest, so please bear with me.

I'm falling for a good friend of mine, but at the same time, I'm afraid. I've had failed relationships before so I know how it's like to be so happy and suddenly lose this happiness when I'd least expect it. Thinking about this friend makes me so happy as we do have some chemistry together.

Yet there's also a huge part of me that's so afraid of what's to come. It's like I would feel excited at the thought of him having feelings for me as well, yet at the same time, I'm so scared that he would. This ambivalence is so distressing.

Most of the time I just want these feelings to go away so that I'd never have to let these walls down again.

What are the odds of a couple getting back together after a breakup, if they decided to be friends, message occasionally, go out once/twice every 2 weeks?

You, my angel, entered my life a day before Valentine's and sadly, you only exist in my heart a day before the festival of lights (in my hometown, Deepavali is celebrated tomorrow). I don't have family here and there would be no crackers. But Diwali is the festival of lights and to be honest, you do illuminate my heart with your memories. I would love to celebrate the festival with you, but it is not my place. Just because we are not together doesn't mean I will stop loving you. If thoughts have power, I will entertain you, over-protect you  and help you till the end of time. My friends always called you a bitch and said I was stupid. But the time spent with you was one of the happiest times of my life and I will be eternally grateful. So yeah, wish you a very happy Deepawali! I will consider my wishes fulfilled if I do figure in your thoughts. I probably don't even want to be together with you; but somehow, in my happiest and saddest moments, I can only think of you and thats says a lot, I guess xD

I know this probably sounds like me whining, but it's really more of a harsh reality that really hit me more in uni and woke me up to a few changes I need to make. So when I first entered uni, I got to know quite a few girls and we would have some pretty amazing conversations, but when I finally met them in person, we suddenly stopped talking (and this pattern kept repeating itself again and again). So this forced some introspection and made me realise, that no matter how well read you are, no matter what a great personality you may have, in the end it really boils down to how you look. I don't mean to generalize the entire NUS female population and claim that they only look for good looking guys, but I guess if you don't having amazing facial features, you gotta at least get fit. Just wanted to get that off my chest, and acquaint myself with the UTown Gym. Give chance please!

When my boyfriend goes out with me, he is usually not paying attention or scrolling Instagram to look at pictures of girls. I pretend to not know and give him chance but he continues. And he is always seen texting or distracted. Sick and tired of the shit he gives. He should go f**k himself.
-
 
Rejected guy over here. Got really close with a girl within months and confessed but was turned down. Although we can really click and become really good friends if not for my romantic feelings towards her, I decided to move on. Gradually minimising contact with her and would only reply when she texts me. I block any forms of social media that will make me see her photos. Previously I thought guys who did that are immature but that is so not true. It just hurts everytime when I am reminded of her. 

It has been nearly a month now and I would still cry randomly when taking a walk home. I hope I do not not look like a jerk to her.I was never mean in my reply just that I would make it sound as emotionless as possible. I would not be able to see her for another half a year soon and hopefully when I see her again we could become good friends again. 

She knows I will be leaving soon. Should I tell her how I actually felt or just leave without a word? I don't expect her to change her mind or anything. I just feel better about myself if I could tell her that I was not purposefully trying to be cold and distant but the fact I am trying to get over her. I would be lying if I said I totally do not care about what she thinks of me. So conflicted and this will make me look beta as fuck.

Would girls just prefer me to leave quietly?

Happy Deepavali to our indian friends and have a good break to the rest of us too.

read about the anxiety angel in  to realise it's such  a beautiful thing to be able to make a positive difference to someone's life. ok no i realised that all along. thing is, how easy is it to do that? these are such spur-of-the-moment things, catching someone before they fall, helping someone in the middle of a panic attack or medical emergency, cheering up a crying stranger. i would do all those things, if i knew how to, if i were there. i would do good too.

I'm a Singaporean girl in an overseas uni, and I'd like to rant. I'm currently in a clique of other Singaporean girls. Among all of them I'm the plainest-looking (seriously, I'm really average-looking, I've accepted it). This sem, a cute guy joined because we needed one more person for a project. My friends roped him in because he's hot.

Now the thing is this guy keeps teasing and flirting with me throughout our meetings and everything. At first I really enjoyed the attention, but now I hate it. My friends are now subtly ostracizing me and making jokes behind my back. He goes out with them one a one-to-one basis from time to time (I can see it via fb) but NEVER contacts or replies me AT ALL.  It's so obvious he's using the "shower attention on the plain jane" trick and it infuriates me that all my friends are falling for it and they are starting to distance themselves from me. I am also afraid to treat him coldly during meetings for I don't wish to spoil the atmosphere or do something that results in them (my "friends" included) all ganging up on me.

I've really lost faith in humanity.

After entering NUS for about 3 months now, I have finally found the love of my life. Never have I ever feel so loved by someone before.
Entertaining as a comedian, my boyfriend definitely should have taken a degree in mass communication as opposed to civil engineering. Could not believe the awesome feeling from my first sexual experience. No man on Earth can ever make me feel the same way as he did. However, I will most likely try out other man as well, so as to gain experience and boost my confidence. Only after I have tried, will I then know whether he is the best, and that he is fit to be my future husband or not. Just in case you are wondering, his name is the first letter of every sentence from the bottom up!
-
 
I'm a few weeks away from leaving NUS and here's a small piece of advice for my fellow students who still have some way to go. When things get tough, step outside and look up at the night sky. Put things into perspective. Grades and results are not everything. Trust me, I know because I've gotten every single grade from A+ to F. Try new things, meet new people, everyone has a story. That is what made my time in NUS memorable. 

I happened to be in close proximity to 2 suicide attempts during my time in NUS. One was unsuccessful, the other one unfortunately was. Just remember, things always work out in the end, even if they seem hopeless at present. Take a deep breath and look up at the stars. All the best my friends. 
-
 
 
To OP, i know some of the signals can be very misleading. He might be acting as such because you are best friends with each other and he feels comfortable acting all touchy with you. But then again, he might just be talking about girls in a group to "fit in" to an all guys group. Don't take it as he is interested in you first. What i will do is, the next time he does those actions again, i'll do the same actions back to him or casually say gay statements like "eh, don't fall in love with me leh" something along these lines.  :) Whatever you do, don't just come out to him. The risks involved are too much. Or maybe the next time when there are girls in the group, just casually take note of his body language with the girls maybe? Hope it helps!

To the guy who approached me at AS5 today, sorry we had to cut the conversation short as I was in between classes!

Any fellow year 4s having a tough time job hunting? I'm two mths into the search and sometimes I really feel really fatigued by it. :(

I have been texting and talking to this guy frequently and he always tries to initiate conversations. Is this a hint that he likes me or are all guys generally open to talk to females? How do I know if a guy likes me and is chasing me? (I know I should be focusing on studying for finals but this is bugging me and I need to let it off) 
-
 
To  bro, you were the one who missed the opportunity, not your lady. I think I went on the same trip to India as your lady (hall Ocip). In the day we interacted with the kids, at night there will be activities for us to do so sometimes we are too busy living in the moment to reply. I mean, we flew all the way there so should make the most out of it right? So just because of this you gave up on her.

I don't think you were madly in love with her. If you were, you wouldn't have given up on her and fallen in love and gotten together with another girl within 6 months dude?

Dear readers, 
I have put off getting stronger and fitter for way too long. Recently, I have been thinking that I will never do it, if I don't start now. But I am clueless as to how I can start my fitness journey! Is there a way for me to get a mentor, or do fitness clubs help? How can I start at all?

Looking at NUS posts, sometimes I wonder why some people constantly look for dates, bf and gf. I have seen some of my friends going in and out of relationship, some desperately searching for one. To them, relationship has became a need instead of want. I understood, I have been there too. The constant need of someone to love you and it gets even more unbearable when the person you love most leaves you. But now I realized; in the search I have became foolish, desperate and disappointed. I have love all along. I have my family and when there is a need, I have my second family. My friends. We meet every week in one of our houses and we share our problems, play, buy gifts, go out etc. Things that you would do with your date, albeit minus the intimacy. We do the lovey-dovey style too, saying babe, praising, 'confessing' how much we love each other. I think that itself is beautiful enough. No need for commitment but still we took care of each other. No need for disappointment but still we argue and scold one another. For now, I will stop looking for dates. Until someone comes along, I am already attached to my second family.

To the lovely commenters of  who are itchy to know who the girlfriend is...
The answer is in this excerpt, you'll know if you get it right cos its pretty darn obvious:

"Sometimes, when I eat a cup of jelly, a little jelly goes down the wrong pipe so I begin to hiccup. Same thing happens  when I try to do my eyelashes while eating Doritos."

There, that should do it. Now shoo, go fish.
-
 
I'm sooooo stressed up over school in general (year 4 you see). Every time (many times!!! D:< ) I try talking to my BF about it he'll just brush it off or simply laugh it off. Which is just not helping at all. To the point it gets me really annoyed (stress plus additional anger, imagine that!!). Is there some kind of platform (other than here) for all the stressed people out there to come together to talk and support each other through it? Could really use some support from people who actually understand what I'm going through right now. 
-
 
What do you mean with all your innuendos? Always pushing and pulling. I can't read your actions and I don't know what you want anymore. Just be straightforward with me. If you don't want me, don't play with me. I know you can have much prettier girls than me so just stop teasing me like that. 
-
 
Finishing my first semester. Never once did I have so much time for myself, to work on my hobbies, participate in online communities, film and edit youtube videos, write reviews. 

Of course everything comes at a price. Close to no interaction with my peers, having little new friends, but all that pales when you're quietly chasing your dreams. And that alone time, solitude is so peaceful; I'm not dragging others down, nor getting held back.

To OP of 
Hi buddy, im the guy who post  here. You can call me A. Ty very much for answer me.
This is my story.
I knew im gay for 3 years alr, and sometimes i had a crush on my male friend. We are each other best friend. He keep giving signals that he is gay. Like we sit on each other lap, hug and hold hand. We cuddle, tickle each other. Sometimes he even pull my panst down, then saying he want to know my "color".  But the thing is he did it in joking manner. But then he talks abt girls when we hang out with our group of friend. So idk if he likes me the same way i like him or not. 
Whats your advice on this guys.

I've made so many wrong decisions in my university. I'm still regretting over almost each and every of them. Thinking of taking an LOA to take a break both physically and mentally. What should I do?
-
 
I currently have 5 boys chasing me. It's annoying when you have to keep replying them when you have no interest. How do i reject them without telling them i like girls?
-
 
I'm really paranoid about some things and have to get it off my chest. Recently I introduced my girlfriend to my male friends and there's this male friend of mine who started flirting with my girlfriend. As I told my other friends about it, I found out that he had history of going for his friends' girlfriends. This is totally against the bro code held in all men. What should I do? 
-
 
I was wondering if someone here could tell me on how to deal with a friend who is cutting themselves... Especially since they're not your family and you can't make them get help..

Joining the week 13 confessions to crush bandwagon!

I'm a straight girl attracted to this guy in class. Like the other post, only reason why I'll even look at the screen is to look at him sitting in front of me. How can anybody so perfect not have a gf!?

BUT... I've got this crazy suspicion that he might not even be into girls. The friend he's always with definitely isn't. How now brown cow?!! :'(
-
 
I know there have been plenty of confessions in the past few days and weeks about approaching your crush since next week is the week 13 already. But just to add one more, do you all think it's normal to approach a girl whom i've never talked to before and start a convo with her? I do kinda like her as she's really pretty so I thought of getting to know her. In lectures my attention is like 70% on her and 30% on the screen lol. If you were a girl would you be uncomfortable if a male stranger comes up to you and starts chatting?
-
 
I'm willing to bet most of us are tired of seeing posts about introverts using their introversion as an excuse for not functioning well in project groups, for having crappy resumes, for not putting their best foot forward to pursue their goals, because somehow or rather it is linked to their being shy and awkward around people.

As someone who also identifies as far more introverted than otherwise, I wish people would stop confusing introversion with being shy and being an awkward wreck in social situations, and more importantly, to stop using introversion as a crutch.

Most of the time when I listen to my older brother talking to his girlfriend on the phone, I seriously admire his patience. How he can tolerate his girlfriend of 4 years, I'll never know. Btw, I'm a girl, so honestly idk why and how some girls can be so difficult. And sometimes when his girlfriend comes over and I overhear them, the conversation goes like:

Bro: What's wrong?
Bro's gf: (pissed voice) Nothing.

Gurl, obviously something is wrong so just say out instead of letting my brother (who is a GUY) guess and figure it out, because 70% of the time, they (guys in general) are never going to get it. I just don't understand why you are so difficult and expect my brother to tolerate you. Just be direct and tell him the problem instead of going all passive-aggressive. Gosh, lady, it's not that difficult.

To OP of 

I think many guys fit into your description and it will not help him identify you. Can you provide more specifics like exactly which module did you meet him etc?

- One confused guy who thinks you might be referring to him.

My groupmate and I became quite close during this sem as we see each other nearly 5 times a week or more. He is quite comfortable around me and teases me a lot but how do I tell if he is really interested in me or just treating me as a good friend? 
-
 
I've always been "the smart one" among my group of friends, and it's always flattering for them to keep describing me as "so smart" and all, but deep down it's also kind of disappointing.

Because at the end of the day, "smart" is a characteristic and not a personality trait. It's like being known as "the tall one" or "the good eyesight one" or "the run-very-fast one". It makes me wonder, if pressed to describe me based on who I am rather than what I can do, how many of my friends will be able to come up with anything at all.

And it's not like I can talk to them about it without getting rightfully judged. "I'm sad because I'm good at studies" has got to be the firstest of first world problems there is.

To OP of 

Hi OP, i know the feeling of loneliness, at times it is alright, at times it will just hit you at your face. At least for me, when that happen, i will go online and research on things like "should i come out to my friend" etc and the most common advice that i will see is "if they mind, they are not really your friends". Truth to be told, it is not really that simple. We treasure the friendships so much that we are not willing to risk it even though we really want to tell them as we are tired of pretending and we really want them to know the real us. It's not easy to make a decision whether to come out or not. I could share with you my experiences if you want :) But what i would like to share for now,  the safest route would be to tell your closest friend that you have known the longest and is the most comfortable around with. Try to build up experience so that you will not be afraid to come out to people. Up to now, i have received no negative reactions from people although many of them were shocked.

Well, i could be that buddy that you can share your feelings with. I surf nuswhispers every now and then. I don't know if the admin does the "leave contact with me" kind of thing but if you need someone to talk to, just submit a confession :) i'll do my best to reply to you here :)

Some think that living in this new age world of gender equality (or the pursuit of it), being chivalrous is pointless. However, I would like to say to the guys out there that still open doors for girls, help carry our stuff when we've got too much on hand and just make sure we get home safely/walk us to the bus stop/train station...thank you so much. It's the little things that make us appreciate someone more, even more so when they don't expect anything in return and do it because they want to. (:

Just a story I wanna share with people reading this. 
I was madly in love with this lady. She was a mystery to me. At times, she would be really sweet and at times she would be very cold. Many times I tried to confess to her but wasn't give a clear answer yes or no. 

I reached my limit when she once went to India (which I am really not comfortable the security there), I tried to text her every day to know if she is safe there, but she wouldn't reply me (even when she read it) which made me very worried. I thought maybe she wants some peace over there. When she's back, she did not text me or anything until a friend told me. I know I can't blame her since we are not an official couple and then I told myself, time to forget about this one-sided relationship. Because I know I won't be happy when such situation happens again. 

6 months later around now, I found a girlfriend. And I thought we forgotten about each other until she texted me again saying wanting to get together and missing the things we used to do. I've told her straight away I have a girlfriend now, but she's still texting.

I am not asking any advice since I know I love my current girlfriend. And I will still tell her straight its not gonna happen. However, to guys and ladies out there, I know I'd sound like an asshole, but please, if you think opportunity will always be waiting for you, you're wrong. If you think you like someone, please let the other party know, else you'd regret the rest of your life.

I am a person who spends a lot of time with my friends. I watch movie/explore different places with my friends. I do spend time with my family but I just don't watch movies or go out often with them. Recently, a lot of my close friends got attached and they are spending time with their significant other half while there is me, single and lonely. I no longer have them to watch movies with because they will watch movies with their other half. My friends and I don't spend much time together anymore as they are always spending their spare time with their partner. I have friends who are not attached but they are in different faculties and/or different schools which makes it difficult for us to meet up and it is difficult for me to keep in contact with them with the increasing workload. Sometimes I just feel so lonely.... :(
-
 
I'm from the batch that recently graduated. Recently I can't help but feel that time is ticking, almost all in my social circle are happily attached with some even seeking to settle down for good- engaging whatnot. Where oh where is my prince?? I'm not picky, but we must have the same religion and beliefs. Whenever i lament to my friends they all assure me that it has nothing to do with my looks, my character is fine, and i just need to wait for the right time and it will all fall in place.  but... what if there isn't any Mr Right for me? or if Mr Right only comes when i'm like 90?? Is there even anything i should do? Or even try going out to meet new people?

Through a mod I met this friendly guy. I did the mod alone and he did it with his friends but he never failed to smile at me every time we met. He was the only guy I talked to (actually no one else even smiled at me) from our tutorial except my project group (he was from another group). Tutorials have ended now and I thought we could be friends. But as we walked off from class from our last tutorial last week, all that happened was a "bye". 

- sad tutorial mate :(

How do you know if your partner wouldnt cheat on you again? How do you know your partner has really changed? Why can't the third party just have some conscience.

Hey guys, Hope everyone's preparation for the finals are going well :) This is a rant, please skip it if you don't want to take in negative emotions. To the admins, please let this through... I would take comfort in the fact that I have not become completely invisible and non-existent yet.
That said, let me let out some of the causes for my lying in bed crying alone.
With my self-esteem having hit an all-time low,
Having developed a habit of screwing up everything,
Feeling like the best scenario is to merge into the background and fade away,
Feeling ashamed to be me for the first time in my life,
And I cannot even point a finger on the reason for being so miserable and negative
Feeling like I do not matter at all
In the grand scheme of things, if I were to die, the world or even the people surrounding me would not lose anything.
I have always been ambitious and dreamy but now I feel like everything I have ever thought to be true about me is being torn down, tested and annihilated. I just don't know who I am or what I am here for anymore and it is destroying my soul a bit more everyday.
I am trying my best to hold on to something, to hold everything in (haha, not even like I have any true friend I can confide in), to hold everything together and not fall apart. Why do I have to be so damn defensive?! How easy would it be to break down and let go of every single thing that is eating away at me?! But no, in my heart of hearts, I know that I will never be able to do that, because I suck at expressing myself, because I will never ever be able to look them in the eyes if I ever broke down to someone.
To all my project team mates, I am sorry if you think I did not contribute more to the projects. I assure you, I did everything that you asked me to and the things I felt were left out in the discussions, it is just that I didn't update you on what I did and didn't do and remained silent when you agreed on something which I personally didn't agree with because I was afraid of being judged and shot down (what is the point of being a one-person minority anyway?!), that you got the impression of me just slacking. 
From experience, I am tired of being shot down in team projects, admittedly because of my inability to express myself clearly. Why does every single damn thing have to be done in teams? Where would the introverts among us seek reprieve?! I wish our education system would allow all of us to shine through, then again, who the hell am I kidding?! Uni education tends to the career prospects and when the world is so damn extroverted, OF COURSE, they are looking to develop extrovertedness and team skills in everyone. Sigh... I wish I did not have to pretend so much in my everyday life... Introverts, shy people and socially awkward people out there, Touch your heart and tell me, you have not pretended to enjoy teamwork because that is what everyone looks for, in our careers, for our CCAs, in the EXCOs...
How I wish I could just die without a care! What is the purpose of living in a superficial world?! I cannot sense anything other than scheming, planning, pretending and tailoring in the air. How I yearn to experience love and acceptance in the environment around us... It is not to be. God, I never thought I would ever lose hope before, but now, I realise how easy it is and how close I am to doing so...

I am sorry that it was such a long, probably incomprehensible post. Just one more request to the commenters, save your snarky comments please, I have enough crap to deal with on my own. Thanks.

Guys always ask girls to make a move, but as girl I can say that it's not as easy as it seems. In society, it is normal for guys to be hitting on girls and getting rejected. In fact it kind of shows that those guys have balls. But if girls were to do the same and get rejected, her worth is diminished. This is what most girls feel and that's why even if I like a guy I won't make a move until that guy shows me that he's interested first. In fact to me, it's better this way since a guy who would bother to go through all that trouble to show you he's interested despite possibly getting rejected is probably more worth it than a guy who is interested but not enough to come after you

just two cents from a girl for all the guys out there

I never post. First time on this page. But I thought I might, as I see some posts on lonely people. Here's my take:

I spent 4 years of my uni alone. I made no friends from my course. I refused to have any obligations to people. Never went to any camps. I have never felt more free in my life. Facebook is good enough.

Don't feel negative about being lonely. Embrace it. Go for a 6hour hike by yourself. I do that. Its fun. You learn about yourself.

Don't feel pressured by the "need to be socialised". We are the ones with the wild style. 

Safe.

To OP  who wrote about being 'ghosted', just want to say that you are not alone in this. My case is even worse, because I was actually attached to the 'ghost' for about 3 months before he disappeared. He's a very nice and sweet bf while we're together. He always said that I have an amazing personality, brought me to many 'atas' places for dinner and drinks,  gave me hugs when I needed it most, bought gifts for my family, even talked about how happy our future family would be, basically giving lots and lots of false hope and got me thinking that he's 'the one'. But then I flew off for a few days, that's when he started being cold, and gradually cut off contacts with me. Before I left, he promised to pick me up at the airport when  I'm back. But in the end he didn't. He also unfriended me on fb and blocked my WA/calls. Anyway similar to yours, I also met my ex on a dating app. I guess it's not a good platform to find a proper SO yeah? There must be a reason why the people there are still single, despite some of them having above average looks and good career. A shoutout to all guys and girls out there who are thinking of 'ghosting' their dates, if you know right from the start that you're not that into them, please don't drop any hint that you're interested and after that disappear like nothing happened. For those already attached, take some time to sit down and talk to your bf/gf about what has gone wrong that leads to your decision to end the relationship. Because being 'ghosted' hurts so so bad. Breaking up sucks, but knowing that you're not even worthy of a proper breakup is a lot worse.

We are so much more than normal friends, but definitely not a couple. Ever since you told me not to treat you as a kid anymore, I have been confused about how to define our relationship. Wish I could have a good talk with you about this but what if telling you about it makes this weird friendship even more confusing?
-
 
My friend asked me. He want to have serious relationship with me. We already know each other 7 years and in my eyes he is just like a good friend. Right now, i dont want to stay in any relationship, my last relationship was nightmare to me and i also dont want to lose friend like him. He said i'm still childish and innocent. I dont care about his feelings. I dont know what should to tell him. I care but i dont want him misunderstand about my feelings to him. I need advice

Hi. i think i may need help. All these studying makes me really horny. Isit just me or anyone else experiencing the same thing.

Today I learnt a very important lesson: The kind of person your boyfriend is when you're not around is far more important than the person he is when you're around.

When you're not around, he can easily cheat and flirt with other girls even though when you're with him in person he is the nicest and most caring boyfriend ever. Recently I wanted to surprise my boyfriend at his hall and I overheard him telling his roommate about how he felt his ex was more loyal and loving as compared to me because she was willing to have sex with him even though she didn't want to. Whereas I didn't want to and was also unwilling. I didn't even bother going in to surprise him and I just walked off. I haven't texted him since but he doesn't seemed to be very concerned. I think my relationship is falling apart.

I am currently single but have been hanging out with 3 ladies. Hanging out as in doing things together, meet one on one, makan, drinks, etc. I am not bf/gf with any of them. 

Would like to ask if this is socially acceptable, or is this considered cheating? Of course, if I become bf/gf with one of the girls, then obviously I will be committed and date exclusively. Any advice?
-
 
Hi guys, need some advice here.
Im a guy, freshies. I do sport, play dota, and do what other guys do. But Im attracted to guys, not girls.
Sometimes I want to come out and tell my friends the truth. But its so hard I feel like they will hate me and stay away from me. My family will kill me also. Sometimes I feel very lonely, I really need a buddy to share my feelings. Im tired of pretending that I like girls, that Im straight. But Im scared of coming out.
Guys do you have any advices for me on this problem what should I do. Just want to know if you guys accept a gay in your group.
-
 
OP of  here! When is doing things with girls one on one considered hanging out and when is it considered dating?

There is some intent from me to see if one of the ladies will be someone I will be in an exclusive relationship with. Is this casual dating [1]? 

Would like to hear some opinions from both girls and guys! Thanks!

Recently I got to know this guy from one of the dating apps. One day, we decided to meet for dinner, and everything seems to be going well. Conversations went on smoothly, we seemed to have lots of common topics to talk about, he's a good listener and has a good sense of humour. When the date ended, he told me he was really happy to have spent time with me, and asked if I'm free to hang out on the weekend. I said yes, and he seemed very pleased with it. He sent me home and then gave me a long hug, saying he looked forward to seeing me again soon. He really made my night, and I was actually quite hopeful that this will work out. But the next day, he stopped contacting me. Not even a single text. The following day, I tried texting him to confirm if we're still meeting on the weekend, but my text didn't deliver (single gray tick), and I could no longer see his WhatsApp picture and status. I suspect that he has blocked me! I am so confused, how can people behave so strangely! I mean, why would he bother to ask me out for the second time if he's not interested? And why must he resort to blocking? Anyone has any idea what's going on here?

Hi I'm a gamer girl or rather just a girl that enjoys playing games. I currently play a lot of dota but enjoy rpgs like final fantasy a lot. 

My problem is how do I get a guy who isn't just interested in the games I play? Whenever I tell guys I play games most of them just scoff at me thinking I'm trying to get them rather than just making friends. And those who believe I do play games? They seem to care more about the fact that I'm a girl playing games rather than just a girl with a hobby. Like, I play and enjoy games sure, but it doesn't mean my whole life revolves around games yknow? 

It just feels so frustrating and I feel like no guy actually takes the time to know me as a person. My previous "boyfriend" loved how I played games but when I stopped playing over the holidays for other interests he started to stop talking to me. 

Are my relationships doomed to be superficial? Or should I just stop telling guys I play the same games they play? It seemed good at first but idk what's better now please help ):

I met this guy at an orientation camp and we had been talking a lot for a while such that people in our OG thought that the two of us were going to get together sooner or later. Our interests and viewpoints were similar and we hung out one-on-one a lot for study dates and suppers and those times were really comfortable and enjoyable. However, one day he suddenly got attached with this other girl from another OG who is our mutual friend. Now everytime I see them posting lovey-dovey photos on instagram and facebook, I just get this really sour feeling that it could have been us.. How can I get over this feeling?
-
 
I know I should really be studying, but I can't help but thinking how much of a loser I am. For the past 24 years, I have always been single. Heck, I don't even have any close friends whom I can confide to. I don't think I am repulsive to people, but being such an introverted, shy and quiet guy for the longest time, when people start to get close to me, I inevitably close myself off, alienating others unknowingly. I believe the reason for that is because I am afraid for letting people see the true me, I am afraid of getting judged for the weirdo that I am, even though I know this is a highly irrational and self defeating thinking that I have.

Recently, I have been reading up on massive amounts of self help books, in a bid to better my interpersonal skills, and though I can see slight differences, I still can't help by being depressed when I see I am so many years behind my peers socially. People I know have close friends since young, bonds built upon one another, and eventually finding their soul mates by now. Some of them are even getting married. Heck, some of them already have kids! Meanwhile I am still trying to crawl, trying to find friends and trying to find a girlfriend.

The former, well, I have quite a few of acquaintances now, but I have no idea how to become close friends with them. But I do have a few friends now though. The latter, man I am still a wreck. I get so nervous and awkward when I talk to girls that I have practically zero female friends right now.

Right now, instead of studying, I am thinking about how great it will be if I have a girlfriend right now, thinking about the future possibilities together. Thinking about future possibilities is what kept me going for so long without intimate human contact, but recently dark thoughts about how I will end up forever alone is beginning to depress me. I have read that to be attractive to a girl, you must be confident and not be desperate. But how does one be confident and not desperate when you have spent 24 years single, with no girls ever seemingly giving off the much-mentioned ''signals'' to you, and when you have no prior dating experience to start with? And also not to mention being such a nervous wreck when I am around the opposite sex, and I have read that girls want guys with lots of experience.

After typing all of the above and reading through, even I am cringing at my own inability... Why is life such a struggle? I am trying hard to prevent falling back into the victim mentality I had long ago, but when life deals you with such shitty personality it is really hard to be positive.

I am sorry that this post is so depressing, it came out kind of in a different way I wanted it to, just wanting to ask for relationship advice at first. I guess my inner feelings just came pouring out. Well I guess relationship problems and self improvement takes a long time, so right now I should really focus on my studies considering finals are in 2 weeks time. Anyone has any good method that I can use to concentrate on my studies and keep my mind off depressing thoughts?

How do girls get so comfortable around guys, especially when they are in a male-dominated faculty and probably have no idea the dirty thoughts racing inside of the guys' minds? If there is a girl or two hanging out with my group of friends, I don't think we'll be able to focus in lectures. Also, some of the guys do not know how lucky they are to have people of the opposite sex hanging out with them... I so wanna be part of them ):
-
 
Since week 13 is coming up and it's the last time some of us will be classmates, I just wanna say something to the guy whom I think is interested in me...just ask me out and I'll say yes :) or ask your friend for my number. I like you too.
-
 
Just wanted to ask if there's really such person who will be the "right one"? Personally, I always thought people have to work towards being compatible together? Also in light of the rising divorce rates and single rates, is it still possible to find everlasting love and remain married "till death do us apart"?
-
 
Came to know this girl last semester when we were in the same group for lab. See her during lecture every day. Most of the time she would sit one or few rows behind me. She is always surrounded by her friends. Didn't have any feelings on her until this sem, but didn't dare to approach her directly. The more I see her, the stronger my feeling towards her. Tried messaging her a few times but the conversations always ended within a day. Apart from saying hi, good morning, that's all. I love the smile on her face whenever we say hi to each other.

The sem is coming towards the end and from next sem onwards, we will not have the chance to meet each other easily unless we are taking the same technical elective. Will definitely miss her, but I don't have the courage to approach her again, because if she doesn't have the same feeling on me, it will be very awkward when we see each other again in campus.

The only thing I can tell myself is Love is Mutual. One-sided relationship will not have good ending. Probably this is one-sided, as I don't think she has any feelings on me. But, good to know her in my life, at least I know what is the feeling of liking someone.

If time can returned to last sem, I would have talk to you more during lab. Not sure what will happen next, but hopefully one day I would have that courage to confess to you.

This is the OP of  here. I wanted to thank ,  and  for sharing your experiences.

This problem has plagued me for over 10 years now, affecting how I interacted socially with the classmates around me when I was in school and JC. Army, things seemed to turn for the better for a bit, then it went downhill again. Maybe that's why I've never really had a close friend. I ever wanted to tell my family members, but it wouldn't be easy for them to understand (I tried it once, the only response I got was "why are you like that?"), so I've been dealing this on my own for a long while.

Come uni, I met a few friends who really understood what was going on and didn't force me if I felt uncomfortable, which I'm grateful for. I've never looked to an SEP, NOC, or internship, because I felt I wouldn't cope well to the new environment I was in, given my inability to eat out.

I've always been an optimistic guy, but it gets difficult at times, especially when thinking whether this would be how I'll be for my remaining life.

Being a Year 4 student currently, I've missed out many opportunities because of this, and it sickens me that my mind's so weak that I haven't conquered it yet. But I'll remain strong, seek help and find ways to get over this. I really want to go on that grad trip with my friends. I really do.

Thank you for your words of encouragement. It means a lot. :) All the best to all of you as well.

Constantly finding myself lonely. But that's not what I want to be the basis of getting into a relationship. I need to get comfortable spending time with myself and learn to love myself first. The thing is, I am comfortable but it's been a while and now I'm just lonely. I constantly find myself seeking cheap thrills from one-off rendezvous. Giving me the excitement but leaving me empty afterwards. Where do I sign up for the lonely hearts club?

Uh, hi. I’m quite worried that writing here would just result in getting snarky replies, but no harm trying I guess. Are there any NUS girls out there who's interested in friendship/ maybe something more with another girl like myself? :P I've been feeling quite rundown lately, what with schoolwork and assignments piling one after another that I just want to have a girl friend I can randomly text/ call while doing these frustrating late night studying… or while in happier times, of course :D  I can’t exactly find girls from my own faculty, because my faculty is really (agonizingly) small and isolated and I know most girls in my faculty are not interested anyway (I’m from Law btw). Will be nice to befriend more girls from the main NUS campus!

I recently got to know this cute boy from one of my modules, and we hit it off well in person. We exchanged numbers and he texted me a few days later, in a more or less platonic way although there were some flirty jokes here and there.

I found out that this girl on my level also has a class with him, and he did the same to her too. Texted her after getting to know each other, and he initiated it too. 

Then we both found out he's actually attached. Is this normal for an attached boy to do? Of course I think attached boys and girls can still talk to people of the opposite sex, and maybe he's just friendly, but I kept thinking maybe his girlfriend doesn't know he's doing such a thing. So, is it normal?
-
 
How do you tell that a close guy friend is treating you like a really good friend/sister or is showing interest in you? Any actions that may allow some inference? Of cos the simplest is to just ask him la but I won't do that till I'm sure that he is dropping signs that he is interested!
-
 
To be honest, my 21th birthday is also a very pathetic one. Neither do I have friends or a girlfriend to celebrate with me. What make it worse was that my parents were quarrelling so badly on my 21th birthday. I ended up celebrating my 21th with my bedroom door locked the entire day. 
-
 
This sounds freaking bad. Sometimes girls whom I am not sexually attracted to (you know what I mean) will ask me out but I will turn them down nicely. I will feel like my looks are in the same league as them. I mean normally you won't ask someone out of your league right? Not to say I'm handsome...

Dam i feel so bad.

My guy has a gf outside nus. She's the "official" gf and I'm the third party, or others label girls like me as sluts. I don't hope for any recognition or whatsoever, just hot sex whenever I have the urge for it or some tender loving care (be it sincere or superficial) whenever I need some. I am happy, at least for now, and I don't care how "my guy" may think of me. My only worry now is that my future boy knows about my current relationship.

Dear OP of ,
Funny how the same thing actually happened to me last year. The details are a little different (I met him in NUS when he was on exchange, and then I went on exchange to his home country and we got together). What followed after that was more than a year of LDR (with very expensive 2 visits in between, once he visited me and once I did). Now I'm a postgrad student in the same country as he is, although we're in different cities. I have been very fortunate in that he is willing to put in as much, if not more, effort into this relationship as I am. My advice: let it be, and if you can do a postgrad in his country, do it. It will give you time to think. A relationship takes a lot of effort, especially when distance is involved, but it allows for a lot of room for self-improvement and growth. Do not be afraid to be hurt. Do not let go of something that could be wonderful because of fear. After all, you can't stop loving someone just because of geography. Take care.

To the op of , your problem sounds similar to mine. I'm not sure how to categorize my own issue, but it seems like I'm suffering from public eating anxiety because I simply couldn't eat in public. It started 3 years ago so I sort of became a loner as I felt uncomfortable joining groups of friends for meals. It was probably the lowest point of my life (it was during JC) because I didn't know what was happening to me. I fell in and out of depression because of this. I've seeked help from psychologists but it didn't help me at all. This problem started to manifest into other problems such as my social interactions with people and I had great difficulty adjusting to uni life, especially in year 1 sem 1. There may be some days when you feel really down, but as for me, I've made a mental note to myself to be optimistic everyday. Fortunately, though not many people know about my condition (seems ridiculous and people probably wouldn't understand either), I'm fortunate to have a supportive family as well as a bf who doesn't mind about my problem. That really keeps me going and especially motivated to do well in my studies. Initially, 3 years ago, I wasn't able to eat in public even with people whom I'm familiar with. Nevertheless, I begin to make improvements gradually, and I'm even able to enjoy simple meals with my bf outside. Hence, you shouldn't give up either! It's good to have a trusted friend with you to help you through this journey of recovery and remember to always stay positive! I haven't fully recover from my own problems yet, and I'm still rejecting friends' offers for meal outings, but I am still hoping that one day I'm able to overcome this. :). Perhaps you could also look forward to the happy things in life, such as sep, summer programs etc. All these probably kept my sanity admist all the deadlines and upcoming finals! Jiayou and good luck!

It's funny how looking at other people's code can reveal so much about the way they think about a problem...

To  you are worrying too much. There is no right one. Even if there is, its hard to tell plus people do change. The person might not stay right forever. The person right for you in the future might not be right for you now. You however can try to make the person the right one by changing yourself(Depends on situation). Maybe its your personality. You might have a nice personality but too shy people to know your personality.

I wonder what an angel is upto right now...Kinda hate Fridays because I see people excitedly leaving work to their families, but my family is in a land far away, and my heart's resident only lives in my heart. I do multiple projects to get myself so busy that I don't have time to remember her, but yet she returns, infrequently but surely...I am lucky to be doing what I love and being well fed and everything else, but I fell for the wrong girl lol

I will miss you forever, angel. You did hurt me a lot, but your absence hurts me more, so I guess I still like you lol

But after finishing writing this, I will lie down on the couch and imagine you rubbing my forehead and smiling at me. That would make this world a happy place again :D

I've always self-imposed strict laws upon myself to be a good girl and a well-behaved student. I've never had a boyfriend and am of course still a virgin.

But lately I started to feel lust. It was so overpowering that it literally made me cry at 4am yesterday. I lost control of myself to this new feeling of utter emptiness of the soul. I was shocked and ashamed of myself.

What should I do now? I am far too shy and embarrassed to talk about this issue with anyone face-to-face. I detest the idea that I would attach my identity to such a confession. So would anyone here please help me? Shall I get a boyfriend? If yes, how? I've been treating male peers as friends all my life (and my speculation is they've also regarded me as a friend only in reciprocity), how can I signal that I'm now romantically available? I don't party, or for that matter, even go out much. So the possibility of getting a boyfriend from outside can be pretty much ruled out I guess? Or shall I just accept the new reality that at this age there would be hormonic activities and strong physiological reactions which overrides reason?

Please help me out!

I have a huge crush on this girl in one of my mods. I don't know her and she doesnt know me but we're taking a few similar mods together.  Next week is week 13 so its now or never. Dont know why i keep procrastinating about talking to her. Maybe it's cos i keep thinking what if she has a boyfriend already... What if this, what if that. I need advice from all the relationship experts out there. How should i approach this? 
-
 
Am I worrying too much? Sometimes i worry if no one will ever truly like me or find me interesting, or will i even be able to get a partner. People have constantly reassured me that my looks are not an obstacle, my personality is fine, and i just havent met the right one. but what if there wasnt a right one to begin with???? or what if the right one belonged to the past century ? or what if I'm 90 when i meet the right one?  please tell me that these thoughts are not mine and mine alone

Is it very pathetic if you do not have a party on your 21st birthday? Tbh, I always tell ppl i don't care about birthdays but deep down, it actually matters? Like I do not want to spend my birthday alone. This year however, supposedly one of the milestones to achieve, my family members are away in overseas, I do not have a boyfriend to spend with, I am too embarrassed to ask my friends if they have plans for me, hence I end up thinking about how sad and lonely my birthday will be.

Anyone out there shares the same problem? Any solutions to my sadness? :(

 Hey OP, I was in the same situation for a few months. My appetite was shit for almost every meal, to the point where I felt weak almost all the time cos I wasn't eating enough. It just felt really hard to swallow the food, and sometimes I would feel like there is a lump in my throat that is preventing me from swallowing, and making me gag alot, especially when I am in situations that make me more nervous. I eventually went to CHAT and got a referral to see a psychiatrist, and was diagnosed with mild depression. Tbh there were some pretty big changes in my life at that time and I was simply overwhelmed and emotionally drained. After going for some counselling sessions and taking life one step at a time to adjust to these changes, I am much better now! What I mean is that there is probably an underlying reason that is making u nervous or anxious, and I suggest booking an appointment with CHAT, where they will help u assess ur situation and help u find out what is the reason for your anxiety. Don't lose hope!

To those girls who think they are ugly, I am sorry if this offended you but I am actually trying to do the opposite which is to to give you hope.

Being less attractive isn't necessary a bad thing as some male doesn't have much confidence as those attractive girl are out of their reach so they end up having to choose those less attractive girls.

This mean that being less attractive doesn't mean you have to be single forever.

Wonder why different faculties seem to have different norms when it comes to dressing. Dont you all find it so uncomfortable to dress up for lessons. Or is it something where the pride you take in your image outweighs the discomfort and time spent on the image itself.

Hey guys/gals I'm in need of some guidance here I'm a year 1 student (F) in Law and have been having interest in a ITE guy.

We've met on omegle a couple months ago and have since then talked endlessly about our lifes through Skype/calls/messaging however he isn't interested in a date because he felt he's social status would hinder us from getting into a relationship.

I've done all I could in telling him that I don't mind where he was from but rather hes goals in the future but he's still reluctant to give it a shot.

How do I go about it?
-
 
I'm an attached guy and I sometimes fantasize about having sex with these other girls in the same group both my gf and I are in... or even better, with all of them at the same time. ;) But deep down inside I know I love my gf the best and she's the only one for me so I would never act on these impulses. I just wanted to say I think it's normal to have these kind of thoughts, just like how one of the commentors always mentions how men weren't meant to be monogamous biologically, what does everyone think? (Though that's the conclusion my cognitive part came up with, I cannot help but feel slightly guilty for having them)

Have been confiding to my friends a lot about being forever alone. I think they got fed up and ask me to think positive and face the problem like a man. Little did they know the difficulty of facing the problem when the problem is my face...

Every time I get an invite out for a meal that I cannot reject (e.g. reunion dinner, family birthdays etc.) I always panic inside, because I know I'll be a total wreck due to anxiety destroying my appetite. It's probably going to be the same cycle again; me looking around for escape, finding excuses to not eat, acting like I'm actually eating when I can't.

It's not that I can't eat out. I somewhat can, in takeaway boxes, although I still gag from time to time for no reason. What I really can't do though, is eat in public areas with massive amounts of people around. Eating on a plate. With people nearby. That scares me, and I don't know why.

I don't want to disappoint anyone, so I just go along with the flow, but I really wished that I just never received any meal invites at all so that people won't know how weak I really am mentally.

People say that you need to want it bad enough to work for it. Guess I'm just not wanting it bad enough, because every time I want to try to break out of this cycle, I crawl back into my shell again, fearing the possible consequences of what may happen.

Has anyone had such issues and overcame it? How did you do it? I really want to know, because I'm slowly starting to lose hope and accept that this is who I will be for the rest of my life.

It is funny how it is the very things you declare never to do that you end up falling into doing, tripping you up and messing everything. 

I was lucky enough to go on a year long exchange this year and am almost coming to the end of it. I remember before leaving being all excited to check this place out (I've been thinking of doing post grad studies here too), enjoying the new education environment, and meeting new people. Before I left, my friends would tease me saying I should come back with an angmo boyfriend, to which I would reply that I'll only date Singaporean guys because I want to come back home even after all the possible years of being away from it.

Things have been amazing at exchange, even made more concrete plans to do post grad here. But I met someone a few months ago and for some weird reason that maybe only a Taiwanese romance movie can explain, I ended falling for him despite knowing that we can't have a future together unless I decide to eventually make this place my home.

Initially I thought this was just a phase of crushing on someone, but as I got to know him better, I started falling for his quirks and nature- the way he smiles with such kind sincerity at everyone he meets, the way he chuckles with the patient resignation at some joke that I can only pull off by rolling my eyes, the way he furrows his brows as he explains how worried he is for the people he works for but cares so deeply about, the way he looks at you as he tries to understand what you're finding so hard to articulate, and god, the way he sings could steal all you young maidens' hearts as he has taken mine. I realised also that we have quite some things in common- interests, values/beliefs, and even mannerisms (goodness, he will be saying something mid way and I would somehow suddenly see myself in him- the better side of me). After all those years of being with good, but incompatible people, this is the first time I can say I think I may found a better half of me. 

I'll be back by winter this year and it aches me to wonder what will come of us. We aren't officially together, and it's really only the beginning of whatever love story that could come out of this, if any at all. I'm afraid to come to a stage whereby we are in the position to speak about our future together, and then realise there is none. It'll be tragically painful to go through. I don't know if I should let things take its course and let my heart take me as I go or if I should rationally deliberate my actions. Even if we do take our relationship further and I come back here in a year to do post grad, then what? The only way for us to have a future is if someone moves. I'd hate to sound blindly patriotic, but I really love Singapore and want to go back to do what I can to make this a better home in the years to come. He has his whole life here already and I can't hope to have him move- besides, this place is beautiful and if not for this odd patriotism I have and all the friends/family back home, I would love to live here. 

All you wise and strong souls of my wonderful school, what should I do?

I'm chubby and I'm going crazy out of mind cuz I used to be very slim just last year. My boyfriend says I'm still pretty, but I can't help but feel insecure when I see a lot of other slim girls around. I know I'm prettier than normal cuz I've received compliments before and I didn't care back then. Even if I'm still pretty, guys mainly notice the figure first, isn't it? I know this is superficial but it eats away at my self-confidence and makes me moody. I shouldn't care about what other people think but it's easier said than done.

Feeling really bummed after the Mafiaso lost the game because of role-block. Guess what, got to be Godfather 2nd time in a row!
After making the critical decision of killing the jester and lynching the last townsfolk, we won the gameeeee! I smiled to myself and looked up. 

And realized the Prof was sitting right behind me. 

Heng it wasn't his lecture this week.

To the OPs of  and 
Hi-five girls, I thought I was the only one around who was facing this sort of problem! But I managed to find balance with myself after realising the real problem was deciding between only two guys. The trick is to have a different guy for every part of life, or even NUS. So during the weekends I go out with my boyfriend, I have a guy for my biz mods, another one for my language mods, and another one for my classes in UTown. I suggest that you try to find another a guy who's in some hall or residence because that's really the best way to enjoy the best parts of having boyfriends in NUS. Hope you can get on my level, girls.
Cheers!

feel so shitty when these girls post about their guys being too involved with their games to spend time with the girl. I also play games but not to that extent. Why not just give me your girlfriend instead
-
 
 OP, What you are facing is social nervousness. In the past, I had a hard time dealing with it as I do not have confidence in myself. What i felt was that I am not good enough to be around and often i lost my appetite to eat as I am too nervous. Probably you should seek a doc or solve the problem that causes it. I do hope you can recover from it.

to the person who helped to pull me into the shuttle bus in my last-ditch attempt to get to class on time... glad to know that amidst the crazy rat-race and shuttle-bus-craze there are some people who make this place a little warmer. thanks girl!

[heck i dont even know how to classify this] I'm in year 2 and i've got 4.5 cap. I'm always worried about not being to maintain this standard. It doesn't help that I'm in a super competitive course either. And sometimes, this worry gives me panic attacks. Perhaps deep down i don't really acknowledge myself as a first class student? I don't even know anymore. I guess i've just got to keep trudging ....

We used to be great friends. We clicked off well and had many late nights talking about everything under the sun(or moon). But why is our group now so fragmented and rife with backstabbing? I find it so scary how someone can have so much control who is "in" or "out" of the group. Gurl, take a chill pill. Nobody is after the guys you like in the group. We all just want to be friends. Maybe it's time to leave before I become the next victim... But when I think back on all the good times we used to have, I can't bring myself to put an end to this.

To the OP of 

I was in the same situation. What I was advised on, was similar to what the comments to your posts were. "if you can like another, you were never really strongly in love with the first one anyway."

The second person, B, was chivalrous, and too, couldn't leave a person like me alone. 

And so after months of going back and forth, I left my JC bf of 2 years, for someone I knew for 4 months.

After honeymoon  period, we both saw flaws in each other, and chided each other about it. Conflicts came, just like most relationship, and there were times our r/s was rocky. 

During one such time, 8 months into our r/s, halfway through settling problems, I brought up the issue of me being pressured into mild sexual abuse in my workplace (stupid tired me at that time didn't realise I could just run away for help). The issue was eating me up inside for more than a month and I had been finding the right time to tell him about it (I wasn't sure how he would react to it.).

He was angry? I'm not sure. His face just turned red and he just started screaming. He asked how can he ever trust me again? I don't even know the answer myself. But inside, I was deeply hurt. 

He had confessed to me one month earlier that he almost left me for another girl because to him she was very hot. There were also many instances where I felt emotionally blackmailed from his actions(long story). And at that time, after talking it through, I forgave him completely.

But this, we were both victims right? Shortly after I had to go to work again, and he sent me to the station, and told me he needed time to think.

There was no reply from him since then. I called him about a week later, only for him to answer "We broke up already, we are finished, you are free to do whatever you want."

This time, I never shed a tear. I simply hung up and carried on my way to work again.

I eventually slowly became friends with my very first bf, I picked up gaming and we have been close friends since. There was never an instance where we deliberated about getting back.

Did I regret breaking up with my first bf? Yes, BUT we were bound to break up anyway. We got together just cause we were close, but we wanted too different things in life, and expected different fundamental things from each other. We just broke at a wrong time.

Did I regret starting a new relationship with this new bf? yes, cause it was only by being close in a r/s with him, that I realised he was very different from the person I thought he was even after spending months with him. I was deeply disappointed in who he really was. Looking back, I was deluded by his words and lonely from my bf's limited time.

To OP: I understand how hard you are trying to reason your heart with your brain, to maintain your initial relationship. 

There is still strong attachments with your first bf. But because of NS, your bf's time is limited, it gets lonely, I know.

And also, 4 months may not be enough to know a new person deeply even if you meet everyday. 

Have you tried talking to your current bf about it?
If he left it up to you, can you hold on a bit longer? 

If I were in the same situation again, I would request for a week of no contact with B. And I would wait until weekend to meet my bf again, at his house to talk it out, don't make any commitment promises. And see his response. 

If he decides to spend what little time he have with you or left it up to you, then I would maintain being friends only with B for one more month at least. During this one month, I would try to understand why am I feeling this conflict. Is he really the type of person I want to spend my life with? Do I really know B deep enough? Or was it because I was just really lonely and he just happened to be there to provide me with company(for both)? Am I even ready to end it with my first bf? If both of them told you that there is someone else that is interested in them, who would you want back more?

When you are ready, make that choice in your best ability, brace your heart and pray. And know that you already made the choice in your best efforts, despite being hurt months later.

Good luck

Okay guys need some help here. I (typical engin boy here) was having a small talk with a female friend in the bus and it was pretty okay. We talked about CCAs, dining places in NUS... and then we ran out of topic. To break out of the awkward silence, I said smth nonsensical like talking about the foodcourt in YIH is kinda rundown, blah blah, then I observed the disinterest on her face. Fortunately, her stop arrived and she alighted, saving me from embarrassing myself further.

Disclaimer, I'm not romantically interested in her or whatsoever, I just don't want this to happen to me again. so... What would you do if you were in my position?

Is sex a very casual thing in uni? 

My friends are losing their virginities like it means nothing and hearing all the weird stuff they do with their partners/ONS or boyfriends. 

Honestly, my hormones are raging but I don't think I'll ever do that.

Give me the courage to forgive this psychopath. You know what you did. All these years of psychological abuses before putting all the blame on me and leave. All these shame and pain. I want to start a new life but even that you would want to deny me. Claiming to authorities that you are the victim instead. What do you want? really. You are exactly like the girl in Gone Girl...

I'm still waiting for the day I can say that I love myself and truly mean it. Still waiting for the day I won't be ashamed of my own body. Still waiting for the day I can eat a satisfying meal without the sense of guilt and that feeling of being a undeserving person. Still waiting for the day I don't have to justify to myself why I'm eating lunch.

It's already been on-off for 6 years. I'm still waiting.

Hello hello. Sorry no juicy news. Just really need some advice. I got offered NOC Israel today. Although I am really really really excited about doiing NOC, I am having a lot of trouble convincing my mother and I myself have much doubts about going Israel as well due to the geopolitical situation. If anyone knows anybody who went on NOC Israel before or am going, pls comment below I would gladly hear from them. Also anyone else who have advice about the country feel free to share if you care to do so. Thank you!

I'm at a lost of what to do right now. I'm not sure if I'm in a relationship for the right reasons. I understand that sometimes it's not only about love, but it needs commitment and effort to keep the relationship going.
And I'm not sure if I'm able to commit to this man for my entire life. On the surface we seem to have the perfect relationship. I have never had any bad experiences with my boyfriend, but at the same time, there is no excitement either. I'm starting to question myself on whether I love him anymore. I worry for the day I meet someone potentially better... what would I do then? It's scary that I actually have these thoughts.

It been so hard to talk to ny boyfriend. I have issues I need consult him, but he is always not there. He is forever playing either stupid maple or stupid dota. 

I really hate it. I hate all gamers. I dont know why one will choose to play game rather than properly talk to girlfriend or do activities together with girlfriend. There are so many better things to do rather than gaming. Waste of time.  Waste of youth. To all guys that are out there, stop your game and notice your poor girl beside you. Notice it before its too late. Don't blame your girlfriend if she cheats.

Hi , I will rather be kept in the dark.
My GF went with her colleagues to a hotel room to watch soccer match and I eventually found out. My trust in her totally broke off despite her reassuring that nothing happened and that she lied because she expected me to be unhappy about it. (I think find such bullshit incredible)

Should I still trust her?

Ignorance is indeed bliss.

I watch alot of romance animes and i have a story of mine which is so similar to many of these animes i watch. However, i always see myself as the supporting character and cant help but sympathise with the character and start crying because all the pain comes back. Although it has been so long, i still cry every time. It hurts so much. This is the one thing time hasn't healed for me. Being a guy i cant help but feel like i am just a little bitch who cant let go. Any Advice for my condition? If there is any advice at all. I am at a loss now. Help me stop this pain and forget

About nearly two years ago, i started talking to this girl i really liked a LOT, we started whatsapp-ing each other and talked for months and then i finally met her, sent her to school, played games together. And then she led me on, not sure if she was lying or not, told me that i'll be loved by her, she also cared a lot about me.
And then one day, i realised there's another guy that started talking to her, going out with her. Insecurities started kicking in. Since they were both from the same school i guess they got to spend time with each other longer? That's what i'd assume. The day i confessed was the day i found out that she was already with the guy.
I don't know what went wrong but, i can only say cherish the one's around you while you can. It hurts a lot to see the one that you truly loved go on with another guy to only see him breaking her heart and there is nothing you can do about it. It seemed like as if i was an option to her. But whatever makes her happy.. then i can only wish her happiness while i'm still trying so hard to get over her.

Is it me? Or is it him? My boyfriend is currently in the army training now(let's not go into details like which camp he's in). We have been together for more than a year. He always tell me how difficult the training is and his temper just became very very bad. Not that he is shouting at me, but he gets pissed super easily nowadays and i really don't know what to do. I understand that it is really difficult, and very stressful for him. But, you should deal with all these emotions on your own right? But ended up I always had to be the one comforting him, telling him it's just gonna be a few more months, be strong, you can do it, etc etc. I honestly feel very tired? Like why do i have to deal with your personal emotions. And because of this his friends that are training together with him, they are quite unhappy with him? I think my bf irritated them as well cause of his really bad temper. 

I feel like I have the obligation to comfort him and deal with all these because I am his girlfriend. However at the same time, I feel like he should deal with his own emotions like a grown-up. 

What should I do?

I'm biologically female. I believe I do not have body dysmorphic disorder/gender identity disorder. But yet sometimes I cannot erase the thoughts in my head about becoming a man. I've always wondered what it would be like. I could probably turn out to be quite handsome IMHO. I simply can't shake off this curiosity. Could it be a form of "penis envy" as Freud liked to call it? Ironically what I envy most is not the penis part at all.

Hi. The B77W speaks once again.

I find it remarkably amazing how  stirred my heart.

I currently have a girl who I fancy (no, it's NOT the A350XWB). But I realised I lack confidence after my past failures at courtship.

Lust is easily identifiable; one knows this when one asks "what do you see in a girl" and you answer "because she's really pretty" and little beyond.

You see. I'm a plain (plane) geek. I enjoy engineering. I will probably be building something eventually. People say engineers are stable but unromantic. I guess that's also the reason why I like the B77W: an extremely versatile aircraft but one that people won't fawn over unlike the A380 rival (darn whale) or A340-500 (because it looks nice, but gulps fuel like crazy).

I can talk about all sorts of things, but I realise I'm notoriously bad at small talk. I suck at talking about the latest movies (despite having the latest IFE). Neither can I understand what makes Trump so entertaining (I think he's bullshit). I mean, I see the joy in things, but it's a different kind of joy... I see concepts like efficiency, versatility and extremely long range, for instance, as beautiful. I see anonymity like NUSWhispers as beautiful because it allows for the experimentation of alternate identities.

Unfortunately this conceptual view of the world exposes myself badly to trivia because I will just summarily claim trivia is a "clickbait" concept with little nourishing value. Of late, though, I realise it's of use just saying sweet nothings to someone (sweet nothing is really just swet talk that's devoid of proper meaning, just the sugar).

Can someone teach the B77W to be more than just a marvellous plane, but a beautiful one too?

It feels like cheating is such a common thing. So many stories on here (though perhaps, trolls), so many stories from friends who experienced it first-hand. I wonder if my boyfriend of 3 years have ever cheated on me but I just am ignorant of it.

Would you rather know or be kept in the dark?

Few months ago I was scrawny and nerdy but my confidence was ok. No one commented about anything until one nasty bitch kept skinny-shaming me. Being an introverted guy, I did not know how to defend myself and somehow let that got into me. More than I hate to admit, she is one of the major reason why I started bulking up. Then I started making noticeable gainz and my confidence went up. I began to do it for myself and I would say I am rather well-built now. But I am the same old introverted guy who is bad with girls. I began to took care of my own appearance and sports some new hairstyle. 

More and more girls started to say I look cute but I would dismiss all of them. I still feel pretty ugly inside. I do not know if they were telling the truth or is it just the case of making me happy. But nonetheless, I started acting differently because I feel more confident. And that is when I fall in love for the first time and was rejected by my crush within a span of 2months. Long story short I was friendzoned. I was like 70% sure she was into me because we go for dinners/outings alone and her friends will tease me even I kept the “tryst” a secret. 

And that made me feel like shit. I felt like I was being led on and being made used of. She seems so blur and innocent and I really don’t know whether she know that I had a crush on her or not☹. This post is probably making no sense. I just felt that what is the point of “looking cute” and working so hard to obtain a nice body when you can’t even get someone you like? I know that is the wrong motivation but deep inside I mean that is what we want right?

Ever after getting rejected, I have been hitting the gym everyday. It helps me to spend my time faster. I will think about her whenever I am free. Why do you have to make me feel like I am not worthy? As my guy friends said, “where got one shot one kill one”. I know it sucks but Im gonna work extra hard in everything I do so one day you will look back and ask yourself, “why didn’t I give him a chance”.

Oh , how I wish you were the one in my class and that you're referring to me. My heart breaks because after Week 12 ends, we will go back to our respective faculties and I may never ever see him again. My heart aches at the thought of it but I know that life has to go on. If only, if only it was you. Confessing would make it so much more worth it.

Dedication to all the unrequited love stories of nus, stay strong y'all!

I have been considering for a long while on whether my boyfriend is the right one for me,  but still haven't gotten the answer after a year.

On the surface,  things appear fine and he treats me well.   However deep down I don't feel very happy with him.  I don't feel excited to meet him and actually am afraid that one day he might propose and I would have to come to a decision at that point of time.

I know many would tell me that I don't love him and should just break up with him,  but I don't have the courage to do so.   Firstly I don't want to hurt him.  Secondly I feel that I might never be able to find anyone better than him. 

Is it possible to still lead a happy life if I marry him or is this relationship already going down into the dumps?

Well, after getting like the previous three posts by me filtered away for some reason, hope this one gets through :/

Nowadays, exams are more frustrating than before. If it's hard, obviously the score won't be good and i'll be depressed. On the other hand, if it's easy, i wonder if the bell curve god will destroy me. Somehow it feels like we are in Westeros. U win or u die. #WinterIsComing

I've been feeling this way for a while now. I feel like I have no one to talk to when I need someone to talk to. Its the reaching out, asking for help that's the problem. That's when I begin questioning why can't I reach out to these supposedly close friends of mine? Am I not as close to them as I thought I was? Also realised that I dont have a close fixed group of friends I always turn to. I have one or two friends from different places and this might sound funny but I do not have a 'squad'...all these make me question..have I made any meaningful friendships at all the last 2 decades of my life?

When I read technical forums of any kind, they tell me the same thing...

"The amount of misunderstanding of our topic by laypersons is so huge that we've no idea when to start clearing up misconceptions."

Seriously, why do we always fall for misconceptions? Are we that stupid to not fact-check, read up and just believe whatever someone says?

I miss this guy I love in JC. I actually love him unknowingly and did not expect myself to fall in love with him. I used to like another guy in JC and was sure that he was the one, until this guy, lets call him X, came into my life.

X and I were in different classes. He used to be from top class back then in secondary sch, but he chose to give up his study in JC. He was always involved in fights outside, and it was a surprise he was not expelled from the school. I met him by chance and we became friends. Not that i really wanted to be his friend, but he approached me first and I did not know how to turn him down. Perhaps becos he was quite tall, tanned, and quite handsome too, but due of his lousy results and gangster behaviour, many people did not want to be close to him.

But I realised that i was slowly falling in love with him as we spent more time together. He would always ask me to help him do his homework and for some reason, I did not decline. Perhaps I was afraid of going against him since he was famous for being the school gangster. I was pretty sure he was just using me, but I did not turn him down.

As we spent more time with one another (he would always find me) I tried to urge him to study. He was once from a top secondary sch, but chose to fail everything in JC and constantly involved in fights. Eventually I think I managed to knock sense into him, and he began to work hard. We would then study together after school. Its funny how later, he would be the one who helped me in my studies instead, especially math as it was my worst subject.

As his results gradually improved, so did his character. Once speaking like a gangster, he is now more gentle. Maybe becos of the hours we often spent alone together, i got to know more about his strength, and realised that he is actually a nice person afterall. 

But in his heart, he love another girl. Also, he was aware that I was in love with another guy (becos a lot of my friends knew anyway). Honestly, I did not expect myself to fall in love with him. Later on I realised that he got together with this girl he like and I was feeling broken instead. That was when I knew I had unknowingly fell in love with him. 

He eventually went to the states to further his uni education. Sometimes, I would recall back those bittersweet memories we had together, and deep down, I still love him and miss him a lot. I could vividly recall our conversations, and the one that was etched deeply in my mind is that he said he would ask andy lau to sing for me one day. Miss those times, our times, a lot.

To OP of  I think you need a chill pill. And perhaps a stress ball.

My advice is if you are not good-looking, better don't confess because you will most likely to get rejected. Use another path: habitualize the person to spend more time with you then slowly get together if the other party respond positively. Make the person want to like you.

I hate it, I can't tell faces apart well and if I meet anyone along the corridoor, 9 out of 10 times they wave to me first. Is it my fault or are most people's faces just too ordinary?

That's like the story of my life! Except I have been single ever since I land on mother earth. For me, almost every girl seems attractive to me now after being single for 2 decades.

Somehow this newfound attraction for girls after puberty has somehow made me more creepy during my interactions with girls though. That's why I have no luck so far. Sigh...

Seeing all the SEP confessions... Whos going to the UK? =D maybe we can tag ourselves/friends and talk ^_^

Despite my best efforts, I constantly zone out during lectures and tutorials, to the point where I suspect I may have ADHD. Has anyone experienced this before?

Confused guy here :(. Recently I feel like I am getting horny more frequently than before. In the past, I usually get off like once a week, but now, even in lectures I sometimes feel a need to get off. 

It doesn't help that my gf is currently at SEP so I have no one to have good times with. Recently, there is this girl, let's call her A,  have been throwing me signals whenever she has the opportunity to interact with me. She probably doesn't know that I am attached since I haven't told her anything about having a gf. Just yesterday, she sent me a text about how she needed a place to stay due to some complication, and basically I think she wants to room with me. To the most of you, the answer is a pretty straight forward no to A right?

But the complicated thing is, I don't exactly feel any excitement and attraction anymore to my gf. Though I still love her, but I can't help but entertaining thoughts of having sex with girl A. Her advances recently probably got me more horny this past few weeks. I am really confused now and desperate. Should I cut off ties with my gf and go with girl A? Or should I be content with my gf and go with my hand for now?

I'm seriously angry at all the posts with "I have a partner, but there's this xxx, I'm not sure whether to stay or to leave blablabla".

To everyone , 
IF you ever find yourself to be in this situation, PLEASE JUST LEAVE. You're no longer faithful to your partner by thinking of "should I leave and pursue xxx". The worst is you can't even make up your mind. You're an adult for God's sake and you don't even know what you're doing?! Even if you break up with xxx, what if there's a yyy and zzz who comes along? Are you going to dump them one by one also? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHATS LOVE???

Lastly, your partner deserve better. You're just a jerk.
You think A will still like you if she knows you're attached? Please tell them the truth. They deserve to know and you deserve to go.

I'm a year 1 girl who has a bf in the army. Recently I got really close to a senior from the same course as me. I feel that we have a lot of chemistry and he is my ideal type of guy. He is always by my side whenever I feel depress, cheering me up with magic tricks. Although he knew that I'm already attached, he continued to shower me with affection and love. Instead of rejecting him, I led him on by asking him to hug me when I'm sad. Kiss him on the cheek when he sent me back home. (Well, as long as I didn't engage in sexual activity with him, I'm not cheating on my bf) . 

I did clearly explained to him that, there is a very low probability of me becoming his gf. However, he gave me a shocking reply that touched my heart deeply and brought me to tears. Although he knew that he has little or no chance, he is unwilling to abandon a vulnerable girl like me. He wants to stay by my side to protect my fragile heart until the day I no longer needs him. When that day arrives, he will cut all contacts from me in order to nurse his emotional wounds.   

I'm confuse now, what should I do?

A couple days ago I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years on good terms. With my newfound freedom, I'm seeing the opposite sex in a whole new light. Everyone is attractive. I've had more crushes in these past few days than I did as a 13-year-old. Is this what rebounding feels like? Or is this just freedom?
-
 
Being gay in an all boys school and then in army was never easy. Coming to NUS, I somehow managed to pluck up the courage to come out to several friends. Not sure how other friends will react once they find out, but i intend to come to to many more friends soon and be more open about it. Hoping they won't judge!

It was your free day but you still woke up at 6.30 to make sandwiches for me to take to work.

"Take this, so that if your colleagues don't ask you out for lunch, you'll have food. Have a good day at work."

I love you so much! Thank you my love, best bf ever.

my girlfriend is on her period and it's the first time I'm seeing  her so moody and depressed. Any tips from girls (or guys) with regards to what to do? I googled but the general idea is just to be nice - which is too generic. I'm quite helpless at this kinds of things and its the first time she told me that she's on her period, so any opinion or help would be great. Thank you in advance!

Is it ok to do favours for my crush who have rejected me? I have not texted her since she said "be friends" and will only reply when she texts me. I still try to be as friendly as possible and will help her if it requires minimal effort from me. 

I am trying to distance myself from her. Or should I just ignore her? It seems childish to me. Am I doing the right thing? Yes she could be a very good friend if theres no romantic feeling involved but for the benefits of my own feelings should I just treat her as a acquaintance. 

But that will ruin any possibilities of her changing her mind. =/

I've just done one fucked up thing and I seriously regretted it. I've met this girl on tinder and we hit off really well. But the truth is, I'm attached. I know guys, why the hell am I doing on tinder when I'm attached. I've made it clear to my gf that I just wanna make new friends and let her check my messages. Back to this girl, we've chatted for several days and she has such a great character and she would be such a great friend. Until the point that my gf pointed out she might be interested in more than a friendship (I fucked up when I didn't tell her I'm attached from the start). That's when I've decided to confess to her and I'm not surprised that she got pissed. Now that I have learnt my lesson, I've uninstalled tinder. To that girl, I'm terribly sorry for the events leading to this, I know I've fucked up real bad and I don't request for your forgiveness. I'm sorry.

It's currently week 12 and I have yet to make any moves. Now that we have just finished our group project, we will be going back to our respective faculties, never to see each other again. I guess I'm not man enough to make it happen between us.

Boy, it sucks to be the one in love...
-
 
I don't know if my good experience with previous group mates distorted the reality of group projects.
 
After seeing so many good/efficient/friendly/attentive group mates last year, I am really upset with one new group mate this year, who might or might not hate me and either way, ignores me for the most part of the project. 

Just one question guys, is it normal that you feel awkward with one group mate? I mean when I told my friend about it, they said it was a normal thing and that it was why all people hated group projects. The same friends told me also that it had not made sense to them why I told them before that I loved working in groups! 

But since the group mate seems to hate me for personal reason (you know so much so that during group meetings he did not make eye contact with me and intentionally kicked me out of on-the-spot or secret group discussions), I kinda feel it was something abnormal. 

I cannot wait for the semester to end seriously. I am tired of being ignored/ avoided and interrupted when I am talking. I need a peace of mind 

Anyone feeling the same or having the same problems? Share w me or I will explode.

I really wish to be one of those pretty girls who get hit on and asked for their numbers by random guys while they're outside studying or eating. It has never happened to me before and I would just like to experience how it is like to be so pretty that you make strangers' heads turn.
-
 
Its hard to decipher guys at times. I knew this guy from Facebook. We hit it off real well, called each other every night with conversations lasting for hours. We even joked about being a couple. When we met he seemed so comfortable with me, even sleeping on my lap.

However, as months went by, the interaction lessened and sometimes we went weeks without contacting one another. But he will then conveniently emerge and calls me like nothing went wrong. Its no doubt that I liked him but I got sick of his disappearing act, and especially when I found out I wasn't the only girl whom he has been contacting at the same time. 

When I moved on and got attached he got immensely angry and started cursing me. He asked why we were so close and so loving and how I could forget all that and went with another guy. At this stage, I was confused because he never once told me he liked me nor did I told him so because I didn't wanna lose the friendship that we had. 

And till now, I never knew if he liked me or not and its hard for me to find closure without knowing. I would want to ask him but it feels so out of the blue and its been so long, I doubt he'd care.

I have 2 options:

1. Ditch the group. I've done my part (though little) and showed group mates who don't hate me that I worked for the report. I will risk 5% participation mark for a poece of mind. I am sick of being ignored, talked over and of not receiving any eye contact from you! Group mate who hates me!

2. Stick with the group till the end (it's one week left anyways) and be comfortably and conveniently silent during the whole process. Will help with writing up the report, and in staying with group, endure being ignored and hated.

Yes, I tell myself it is worth a lesson, not at school, but in life, to work with people who hate you and who you hate. But this is so mentally taxing! Imagine group meetings where the others do the talking without you knowing it or where one of them keep taking over and not assigning you with anything that builds into your contribution! I wanna give up. But I can't

Any advice?

NUS admin staff are the absolute worst! Talk about being lazy. Its happened so many times already! You think I haven't visited all those links you send me in your replies? I want a personal response! Not you telling me things I am already aware of! Everytime I ask them something, they ask me to visit the website instead. Well, if I had gotten all my answers there, do you really think I'm going to take my time to send you an email? Where. Is. Your. Common. Sense.

in your opinion what is worse? being bro-zoned or friendzoned?
-
 
I have given this girl I like a friendly hug on one occasion, and recently a hug from the side, meant to be comforting, as we walked side by side.

Later on, she msg me that she wanted to stick to friendly hugging and that she had some hugging issues before, it didn't felt awkward to probe but at the same time, I wonder if this was her way of friendzoning? What should I do next?

I am an international student who is currently dating a singaporean. I am lying to my parents about it, because last time I told them they freaked out and wanted me to return back to my country. They think I am too young  to date, they don't know the boy and he is from a different race. So now I convinced them that we are just friends and it was a little crush. I made the lie even worse; I told them that I will be spending christmas and new year's with a good girlfriend of mine and I will be staying at her place during those weeks. Instead I will be doing all this with him. I don't know how to hide this, since they facetime me a lot. But I am also very bothered by lying to them. Btw, my parents are traditional asian, which means I can't stay at a guy's house. Should I confess to them or just try to facetime for those weeks secretly? 
-
 
To the OP of , I know how you feel. Just know that we are together even in being alone. Be my friend :)

My boyfriend just said he needs to spend more time with God and not me... He said he haven't been spending enough time with God and wants to spend more time with God. Ermm what is he hunting at? FYI, I am not same religion as him.. And he already devoted 3 days everyweek for his all religious activities..

I am sure no one else can be more lonelier than me,

Nobody like me. Everywhere I go, I am bound to get rejected. Even my cousin delete me from facebook.

I will get kick out of every single group I join. Obviously I don't have a girlfriend. Not only that, I really envy people who were friend zoned by their crush. My crush don't even see me as a friend.

I have no friend. Any attempt to make friend will back fire and lead them to think I am disturbing them.

Is it really my destiny to be alone forever?

When boys are in love, they act like a child. When girls are in love, they act like a mother. Agree?

I have known him for several months. We have been going out on several dates. We have always had great time together. One night, he kissed me. After that night, he suddenly changed. He became so distant. He had stopped texting me first. It has to be me to initiate the conversation. I don't understand why. Is is possible that he is just busy since this is his last year, with FYP and job hunting going on? Please enlighten me.

In this day and age, is it ok to ask a girl out for a movie via FB msg, and not make a phone call? Context: I have shown some interest in a girl and she probably knows it. But I don't want to move to fast yet until we are closer.

To 

I faced the same problem with my boyfriend. How does yours talk to those girls? Is he flirty? Or just talking as normal friends? I think that matters. Because he might just be friendly and talking to those girls, genuinely wanting to make friends. If you're uncomfortable, just talk to him about it. You can not mention that you snooped, but just ask if he texts a lot of girls?

On a side note, a question for the boys: Is it true that you guys don't text other guys as often as you text girls? 
-
 
My bf and I are together for a little over 4 months now. I love him alot and vice versa, but we've had exhausting arguments pretty often (average thrice a week) due to pretty much the same issue.  Issue is that both of us have really different ways of thinking and this has resulted in a lot of miscommunication and misinterpretations of each other's messages. But we have really great and fun times together as well, when we're not fighting. I was going to suggest us going for a temporary break (to reevaluate this relationship), but we were having another such discussion, and after that he said 'can u not leave me', when I haven't even suggested the break yet. And now I can't bear to bring it up. I've got a feeling it's not gonna be long before the same issue pops up again coz it seems like it's so difficult to resolve, from the fact that it just keeps coming up. What to do??? 
-
 
To  I know how you feel. I was once the same. The fact is that right now you are irrelevant and useless, just filler in your peers' lives. I can guess that you have no outstanding abilities, background or connections (at least, compared to most in the circles you hang around in).

What you should do is to find people who exist in the same sphere as you do. You are just a common pigeon, trying to fly in the same sky as the eagles (or those who only want to hang with the eagles) 

Or alternatively, you can up your game. But then you'll end up jaded when you come to terms with what your "friends" only respond to. 

There's also the possibility that your EQ is shit. No helping you there.

Let's try this out: 

Please tag a friend who is single and available, but otherwise too shy or unlucky in seeking out a partner. 

They can pm each other in private using this :)!

GUYS AND GIRLS ARE WELCOMED :D.

Recently I discovered that my boyfriend has been texting other girls. Even though he made it clear to those girls that he has a girlfriend, he is the one that is continuing on the conversation with those girls. Also, he will hide those chats whenever I'm around and does not reply those girls until I go off. I know this because I snooped on his phone (it was only once, please don't flame me) and I discovered many things that he has hidden from me. Is this considered a red flag? Should I be worried? I cannot bring it up in an argument because I was the one who snooped on his phone, which puts me in the wrong before we even start arguing. Help please.

Reading so many ec posts here just made me think about my own, so I'm just gonna share another, albeit a slightlyyyyy overdue one :3

I first got to know you during Summit'14, and you were the captain of one of the martial arts groups then (not gonna tell which one XD). You were not really that tall (sorry, haha ;p), but made up for it with good looks/sharp facial features and a nice smile. Not to mention that your pleasant disposition also made it a joy to be around you :) A pity we sorta went our separate ways after the camp, so I couldn't get to know you more on a personal level.

Anyways, since finals are coming, just wanna wish you all the best for your exams! Hope to see you more around the src area! :3

Dear girls of NUSWhispers, 

When do you consider a guy to be boring? Do girls consider quiet/introverted guys to be boring just because they tend to talk   less?

Recently I made the saddest birthday wish in my life. I wished I never have a crush on anyone again, because everytime I did, he didn't like me back or it didn't work out for some reason. Experience has made me better at handling rejection. Last time I took 6 months to get over it, hopefully this time it will be much shorter. Nevertheless, everytime it happens I feel heartbroken and devastated. I feel like a worthless and useless person who doesn't deserve to be loved.

I know it is an illogical thing to wish for, but I had forgotten to make a wish before blowing the candles. My friends reminded me to close my eyes and wish for something fast and this is the first thought that came to my mind. Even I felt disappointed that I am thinking so negatively but I realise it is because of the emotional pain I went through in the past few days. 

I wanted to talk to someone about it in person, not text, but all my close friends were busy with concerts, festivals, project meetings and their own boyfriends. I didn't want to disturb them and also didn't want to cry in front of my parents, so I went to watch a movie alone, chose an isolated seat right at the back and cried as much as I could in the dark. 

I had done a lot of reasoning already - he wasn't the right one, I will find someone better, it's neither his fault nor mine that he doesn't like me etc. However, at that moment, I just couldn't reason anymore. All that came to my mind was that I liked someone and he didn't like me, and this pain was unbearable. What's worse is that all this while I had been guessing that he likes me too. Now I realise I was probably wrong all along and he was just being friendly.

Ever since I joined this club, she has been my sole reason for staying. Originally, I joined this club simply because my friends roped me in, and I have no intent of staying after a few sessions. But ever since I saw her, she mesmerized me, and I kept coming to the meetings every week without fail in order to get to know her better. Sadly to say, we were in different departments, so I had no excuses to strike up small talk with her at all.

After deliberating for 10 weeks, and seeing how the semester is about to come to a close, I basically mustered my courage and talked to her when I saw her walking alone towards the Kent Ridge mrt station. I don't know what came over me but I basically blurted out my whole confession like straight after introducing myself. She practically went silent after that and told me that she is not ready for a relationship right now, and being the awkward me I promptly gave some excuse about needing to get something from fairprice and said goodbye to avoid the awkwardness on the train with her.

Did I screw this up? I mean I am an evergreen so I have never pursued a girl before. Did I come off too strong and too sudden? Is there a way to salvage this? :(

I am so frustrated with my group. We already formed this group at the beginning of this semester for the group. For the first half of the sem before the recess week, I've been the only one suggesting ideas and getting them to brainstorm too, but they keep saying ok and then never submit anything. In the end, we only started after midterms.

When we finally started, the first thing they did was to ignore my previously stated ideas. They came up with ideas which I found to be lacking, but a few of them keep supporting one another because they were friends since JC days. So I gave in quietly and we started doing. But now, I am seriously pissed off. They keep shooting down ALL my ideas but eagerly accept ideas from that tiny clique. And all they know how to do is to say, "we should quickly finish this, time is running out" but still make no progress! Why do they keep shooting down MY ideas and act as if their ideas are oh so awesome? Up til now, not a single one of my idea has been accepted. I have a friend in the group who supports me, but that few of them keep brushing away her opinions too and she meekly gives in to them. I think our project is screwed up...

I really really like this guy... But I haven't got the courage to confess. He's from engine and is in his last year. He stays in hall and is always busy with hall stuff. He loves eating bread by the loaves and rice by the pile. And he always keeps a lot of rag material to build things for people which is really random but I find it cute. Hehe.

I really want to confess SOON but I'm afraid. Any suggestions to how?
-
 
After my crush rejected me, it is so awkward when our mutual friends who did not know about the rejection still tease me with her. I am just trying to forget about her and every time they mention her name I will cringe. I really do not want to know anything more about her because it is hurtful to me that she no longer tells me stuff about her daily life. 

It is just so hard to remain friends after rejection.

Why isn't anyone addressing the mental effects of academic bullying. I used to trust some of the people around me and in turn I always help them in their work. It later turns out that they always take advantage of me. Some of them who always got excellent result will act blur towards me when I consult them regarding my tutorials. When they get almost straight A results, they will always complain that they score so badly when I am constantly scoring below B+ for anything that is graded. It really makes me feel so demoralise and sometimes suicidal. There were a few occasions when I ask them for the due dates for some of the submission and it later turns out that they give me the wrong date. I also start to realise people will only be nice towards you if they need a favour from you. I starting to lost trust in some of the people I once trusted. Saying so much of this, I believe everyone who is studying in NUS are victims of academic bullying but to varying degree. Those who are poor in academic like me suffer the most.

 Totally agree with you. Love is a wonderful thing even if its one-sided and even if it cease to exist after a while. I used to think no one understands me, no one went through the same route as me. Until he came. I thought I found someone with the same thoughts, the same experience, the same sentiments. We were so close; we shared our most intimate thoughts/fantasy. I admit, I cared more for him than he did for me. Through that, I learned how caring for someone can be tiring yet rewarding. And when he cared for me, I appreciated every thought and moment he cared for me. We are still friends but I can never forget nor let go of the past we had (though he claimed it's not love). Love is beautiful in that way. I think we should not demand it to be reciprocated but we should appreciate the moments we had and treasure it somewhere deep in our heart. It's tiring, sometimes demanding; but its worth it to make the person you love smile. 

A year has passed, we are still friends. But I still love you and my heart is still locked for you. Maybe we will eventually part; for now I like the way we are.

Just want to rant. Everybody takes forever to reply to my messages. Even my supposed good friends. Even if it is project-related and highly urgent. Is it because I'm someone people just heck care? Is it because I don't get angry? Is it because I'm someone they can ignore? Is it because I'm not important? Nobody takes my word seriously and on days like this, I just can't do this anymore. Gonna cut these "friends" out of my life. 

Before you say, people have better things to do than reply your text messages, they reply after 12-24 hours I mean c'mon, you definitely would check your phone between that period esp when I know that "friend" of mine is always texting her boyfriend. 

At the end of this angry rant, I realised, I'm just hurt :(

I'm just going to sort out some irrationality bothering me. 
Am I the only one who's increasingly bothered by close friends asking for relationship advice? Though I've episodic manifestations of lusts, all of them conforming to the societal norm of heterosexuality, I've been disgusted by feelings of love and unwilling to explore them.

Am I the only one who enjoys going to lectures alone? Sadly, none of my lectures are webcasts, and class participation for tutorials are graded. Maybe that is a relief for my mental well-being. I'm being rather reclusive since after National Service.

Being a Freshie marks new experiences. I've never experienced panic attacks before NUS. It happened a few times on a weekly basis in the first few weeks, subsided towards recess week, and periodically once every week after week 9. 
Sweaty palms, churning stomach, breathlessness, heart-pounding, fidgeting. I hate it when it happens during a lecture, where I need to find a perfect moment to go out. I'm always sitting at a corner seat, hoping no one sits near me. Sometimes placing my bag on the seat beside me. 
I've suspected it has got to do with my diet, because I've to habitually go to the toilet before every lesson. I'm avoiding meals at crowded times and areas. 
I'm grateful for being able to study here, although I've not told anyone that.

Thank you for reading...

It just dawned on me that I haven't apologised for what happened about 7-8 years ago.

It must have affected you greatly, but sadly, I forgot your number when I tried to get over you as well.

Now that you're in YLLSoM, and as you are turning 22 next Thursday, I would like to hope that you would be able to free yourself from a past burden.

I know that reconciliation is probably like a thing beyond us already, but yeah, you have one of the strongest personalities that I have ever come across, and it is with a tinge of personal regret that I finally let you go.

As 22 approaches, I would just wanna shoutout that I'm doing fine, and that you should do your best too!

I know it sounds very code-ish, and life in YLLSoM is super tough, but do persevere on and let God guide you through Kay?

All the best! And happy birthday in advance :)

Because it's week 11 and I am stressed that I have 2 submissions next monday, I randomly browsed some really old classics on youtube. They sounded really 80s and 90s, so I had nostalgia for my childhood. 

Which made me realise that I myself have lived 2 decades. I checked wiki to find out more about the singers who provided tonight's retro play list. They were all in their 60s and 70s! Yet they were so dashing in the music videos! How time has slipped us by! I myself have lived 20 odd years blissfully protected by my parents. I am still such a child! I recently only realised that I did not know how to seek good because my parents kept giving me good things on a sliver platter. 

I had been cross recently seeing all my friends getting scholarships and building their CV portfolio and relationships while I was just dreamy and irrelevant. But life is short. I resolve to seek my own goodness in my life and be a little more independent. One little thing at a time.

This year's valentine day, I felt so heartache as I watched couples having a fun time together and wonder if I am going to have valentine day in 2016. Now, at the end of week 11 of this semester, I am starting to feel that next year's "valentine" time day is going to be the same again. 
-
 
I recently found out that almost all of my new friends are attached. Honestly, I'm quite jealous and sad. Not like I specifically went to make new friends in hopes of finding someone, but after awhile it makes me wonder what is wrong with me and why can't I find anyone.

Not to mention, it hurts a lot (regardless of being honest or just making me feel better) when my female friends (single or attached) tell me that I'm good looking/really nice/sweet/they'll be jealous of my future GF/etc.

Trust me, it's not for the lack of trying either. 

inb4 people comment man up/just cos u r nice doesnt mean the feelings have to be reciprocated.
It still hurts, especially after multiple times of being rejected/friendzoned.

So I noticed this boy in class from the first day of the semester. He's kind of like the brooding, silent type, and it seems like he always likes to wear a singlet that shows off his lean physique. 

And, well, I like to think of myself as popular. I hold exco positions in two clubs, I have quite a name for myself in my home faculty, and I think I'm better looking than the average girl. I've tried to strike up conversation with him before, but it seems that he prefers to keep to himself. I decided to be a bit bold, and get to know this guy by inviting him to my birthday party - along with some of my friends, of course.

I made quite a show of it, asking him to come over in public. He openly rejected me, but then leaned in close -

and told me he'd kill me.

It's been almost a full semester since you came back. We haven't spoken since. No, we didn't even speak once while you were away. I don't know what happened between us, and I don't have the courage to find out. But I do know that I don't ever regret knowing and eventually falling for you. Somewhere along the way as I was waiting for you, I'd already had the feeling that we were never meant to be. But I stood strong in my decision to wait, because I believed you were worth it. And you were. Thinking back, I don't ever regret waiting 431 days for you, because through it all, you have taught me so so much. And I've become a stronger person, because of you, so thank you. Thank you for showing me that I could have the capacity to love someone so much. Ours was a bittersweet love story that unfortunately did not have a happily ever after, but if I were to go back in time, I would choose to live through it all once more.

So today I stared at my crush for an hour until they looked my way. When they finally did, instead of smiling flirtatiously as planned, I stared blankly back until they gave me a quizzical look and turned away slowly as if there was something wrong with me. Now they think I am a creepy weirdo. Great. So much for my elaborate plans of seduction. I need help. How does one stop awkwarding? 
-
 
What does it mean when he keep asking you for sexual favours but keep changing his claim on whether he's being serious or he's joking? I like the guy but more than in a sexual manner. And it's making me confused because I wanna spend more time with him but I can't be sure if he's plainly making use of me for his needs.

It's been 2 years since my previous relationship, and I discovered what I missed the most about it (or any relationship for that matter). It's the skinship, and no I don't mean the kissing and what not. It's the hand holding, hugging, leaning on each other, simple stuff that you usually see girls do with each other.
-
 
I have a little crush on this junior of mine in engineering. Mixed blood, she has a lovely smile every time I see her. She must have a good heart too as she seems to show huge interest in the nature and environment. I'm not sure if she's single, or might even have slight interest in me. I just have to keep seeing your smile while it last!
-
 
Whenever I see people get stirred/shipped, especially if one of the involved party is actually interested... 
part of me wonders what it would feel like
another part of me wishes to experience it
another part of me doesnt want to deal with the embarassment
but mostly i wonder why must people stir/ship so much.

I fell in love with this pretty girl whom i've known for awhile. She's really independent and she's not bothering to look out for a potential partner. Advice on how should i go about wooing her please? Appreciate it.

Love doesn't have to be both-sided to be beautiful. It is beautiful on its own, whether or not reciprocated.

I met an angel on 13th February of this year and life has not been the same since. She liked me a lot, but mainly because I was kind and helpful. I started to care more but never pushed. I walked her to her hostel every night, I spent late nights working with her in my office and my home, etc...

She also did everything a friend could. She gave me her band. She used to call me 'beta' and comfort me whenever I missed my mom. She used to bite me, etc..

It is sad how she drifted apart. It had a lot to do with what her guy friend who could speak the same language as hers (I could only talk to her in English) and whom she trusted more than me told her. I also got the feeling she was just using me for her work. My friends also started calling her 'bitch'. I was okay with her using me, maybe because I really just liked spending time with her. But yeah, we did drift apart and she started hating me lol

I guess she has found someone new she can love now. I try not to meet her, so I don't know. This is what mutual friends tell me. It is okay, I told her I just want her to be happy anyways, so can't really be selfish now :)

I have stopped chasing girls now. She has converted me into a man. A man which carries her photo with him all the time and cries in the rain sometimes, but a man nevertheless. She did take away a piece of my heart, but it matters much less, because at least I have started to understand the value of my own heart :D

My secret wish is that one day, when she has her cute children, she does let me play with them. I like kids. And then maybe, just maybe, she bites me, ruffles my hair and calls me 'beta'. That would work like a balm :D

I love her too much to not to let her go :))

What do you guys think if someone used tinder to find love? From what I heard there is like a stigma associated to it, like it is only for finding fwb and ons. For me I have been getting increasingly desperate for a relationship as I have had no luck with girls so far, so I am thinking there might be a lesser chance of rejection on tinder since they have already 'liked' your profile.

So I'm a female and I was close to a male classmate of mine in JC. We were not in a relationship at all but were inseparable best friends who were always there for one another but things turned sour mostly because I was burdened by a lot of family issues and he grew tired of dealing my sadness. We drifted apart but were somewhat on amicable terms with intermittent contact. But he suddenly unfriended me on Facebook one day. I probably discovered this a long time after he did because I only realized when I wanted to tag him in a video I thought might interest him. I decided to be cordial and still wish him well whenever I could like special occasions for instance. He's now gone overseas to study and we still communicate once in a while when I ask how he is. But I'm still perplexed as to why he suddenly decided to unfriend me. I try my best to be cordial and not breach the topic because I care deeply for him and getting to ask how he is and knowing he is doing well means more to me than whatever his perception of me might be. But it's still at the back of my head and it stings terribly sometimes. Could someone please help explain this or advise me somehow? ><

When you first asked me out, it was at a completely bad timing. You were only being nice to me for the sole reason of making me date you. Could you not have waited to know me better? Somewhere along the way I start to feel that you could be the one. Only you just never bothered to get to know me better. Every time you'd just tell me it's okay. Did you even mean it? Or did you just resent me until you got tired and decided to dump me? You waited till you could find another back up to chase? I would have never given up on you. And you really don't know how torn up this break up has made me feel. You want to be "friends" and claim that you would still be there for me. Can you really keep your promise? Even after you broke every single one that you made to me in the past. If you'd told me sooner, the damage done would be lesser. I started to think that you'd be the one. That only you could accept me for who I am. I can't wish you happiness nor can I can wish you any success in chasing down a new girl. The only thing I wish is to not care about you anymore.

Reading  pisses me off so much! 

That's nothing wrong with being a escort, companion, or even a pornstar. That's a personal choice, if that's how someone choose to live their life, it's fine, do your thing. But it irks me to no end when PEOPLE IN A RELATIONSHIP choose to lie/betray/cheat on their partner. Why, if you choose that lifestyle, still want to be in a relationship ?? Especially when your partner is kept in the dark. How selfish can you be? And not using protection?? Your partner could have gotten STDs even though he/she has been faithful while you're having your "fun". 

To the OP, I'm sorry you have to go through that. My suggestion is to dump her and get yourself tested. You are not obligated to help or stay with her because even if you are busy, it is not an excuse for her to jump on someone else's dick. If she loved you, she wouldn't have done that.

Saw this on Tumblr:
The “friend zone” and unrequited love are not the same thing. Unrequited love is, “I love you, you don’t love me in that same way, I am sad about that.” The “friend zone” is, “I love you, you don’t love me in that same way, you have therefore wronged me.”

Unrequited love is, “My unilateral crush is my problem.” The “friend zone” is, “My unilateral crush is your problem.”

Agree??
-
 
I don't know whether it's my lack of empathy or feelings, but sometimes I really don't care about people's lives. Everyone should just live for themselves, but that doesn't mean that I won't help when needed. If you have a problem and ask me for help, sure, I'll offer you my sincere opinions and advice. But don't flatter yourself and act like 'my life is so exciting, I want you to ask about me so I can brag and tell you how I am better than you'. It's annoying and frankly, I don't really give two shits. Do yourself a favor and eat some humble pie, or makeup so you can be prettier inside #bitchymodeon 

I hope you'll stop caring about people who judge you and just be your true self.

Need some advice from the lovely people of NUSWhispers, sorry if this is your typical, boring confession!

There's this guy I am very close friends with and I always thought it more to be platonic. However, recently some friends commented that he seems to be interested in me (by looking at how we interact)  but I don't want to be over-assume things and jeopardise our friendship.

Signs(?)
We text each other everyday and I see him showing concern like saying" Go sleep, it's getting late!"
He teases me a lot, especially about trying to matchmake me #mysinglepringlelife
When I wanted to catch a movie but had no one to go with, he came along despite finishing a night shift just before (which i only found out later)
If it helps, he's quite a quiet person 

I don't really know how guys show their interest for I do have some guy friends who are really chatty on text and act really brotherly towards me. I did ask him before but he didn't admit or anything. (it feels like I got an implicit rejection lol)

I do have a romantic interest in him but I still very much value him as a platonic friend. However, it'll be so dumb if we both like each other but let each other get away by fearing the "what ifs" ^^"

How else do guys show their liking to a girl? Thanks in advance guys
-
 
we got to speak to each other only for that fleeting moment. yet it will be something that i will always remember.
there's something about our chance encounter. something about the uncertainty, that we will likely never meet again. that something beautiful happened. like a rainbow, it was never to stay, but it was good enough while it lasted.

yo #fitfam been reading the NUSW posts and recently I saw posts about how to lose your gut and moobs... so I just wanna share this video which I stumbled upon the other day. I know it sounds generic but you gotta change some things to get results :)

There's this really cool girl called Stacy who always asks me to chill at her place. We'd be watching TV, or hanging by the pool (her family's rich). I think she likes me but the truth is, I really like her mom instead. It's gonna be hard to tell Stacy that I don't want to be her boyfriend but stepdad instead. Her dad walked out a few years ago, so I think I could stand a chance with her mom.

This is my first time being in a relationship. I met my girlfriend at the Student Life Fair last year when I was a representative for my interest group booth. So that's about 2 semesters of time spent together.

Lately she seemed rather distressed and high strung. Not the normal end of the semester exam reactions, but more than that. We met to talk and she finally broke down and admitted that she has been working part time during the weekends as a...part time companion. Something of that sort.

Needless to say, I was shocked. She came from a middle class family ( she drives to school ). There isn't a clear reason to me as to why she has been doing this. I wanted to press her for a reason, but seeing her in that state, I didn't. I spent the next few hours letting her cry while I mentally retreated into a box to figure out what was going on.

She said recently, there is this client of her's who is a regular and she suspects that she maybe pregnant as she has missed her period by 2 weeks+. She admitted to me sex without protection was a great thrill for her at times. Especially when I was busy with studies and could not afford to meet her every week.

Where do I go from here ? I am half agony, half torn, and a myriad of emotions. To end this post off, I would like to share a favorite song of mine

心痛比快乐更真实　 爱为何这样的讽刺 
我忘了这是第几次     一见你就无法坚持 
孤独比拥抱更真实　 爱让人失去了理智
会不会是我太自私　 拒绝更寂寞的日子
(張惠妹 - 真實)

This is in response to , where the poster was worried about his level of comfort with his bros. 

Please note that platonic affection (ie friendships) can vary - you can be very close to someone else, without being romantically or sexually attracted to one another. Having a bunch of tight-knit friends who are comfortable with one another to a point where you can drop casual expressions of affection and butt smack each other - that's a real privilege, and not something to be worried about. Plenty of people think that this is something to be avoided, because it might mean that you're gay. That's bullshit because all of you know very well that you're friends, and even if things develop past that point, it's not a bad thing too.

Case in point: me. I have a couple of friends with whom I usually hold hands, link arms, am physically affectionate with etc and people give us strange looks sometimes. But we're clear about being friends, and since it makes all of us feel good (hugs feel good, get what I mean?), there's no reason for us to stop. :)

In the recent weeks I'm starting to notice this guy in one of my classes. He's really friendly towards me and would initiate conversations even though I barely know him (or his name). I sincerely think he's really cute, but am very intimidated by him because he seems like a smart, sporty lad. The shyness I feel towards him goes against my normal character. Because of this whenever he talks to me I may come across as being uninterested or unfriendly towards him, even though deep inside I really do wanna know him better. Although it may seem cowardly, I secretly hope that he could ask me out for coffee...

I'm planning to go overseas this upcoming break with my SO. However, my parents strongly disapprove me going and gives really stupid excuses that exists out of this century. I really want to go and I can't believe how much they distrust me.
-
 
I used to have this very close friend who confessed to me. Now things just became super awkward and I feel awkward to even say hi.
-
 
Broke up few years ago but it's not easy to move on. Heard from my friends that she had moved on recently yet I am still trying my best to keep myself occupied, trying to move on. 

It is never easy to forget someone that treated you so well. It is even harder to try to love someone again after all the sh*t I had been through. 

Hope someone special will notice me. 
-
 
I keep seeing you around, again and again and again. And those chance encounters destroy me inside every single time. I want to walk up to you to just ask how you are but heck, i’m too timid, too scared to risk it all again, too scared of all the consequences. 

Three years since, I miss you like hell.

Hi, I need advice :( I have this acquaintance (note the choice of word) who has been wooing me for quite some time and I don't know how to make him give up. 

He confessed to me even though we have never had a proper conversation before, only very very small small talk and I would only consider him my acquaintance. I rejected him. And now he will ask me out once in a while. He asked me out several times even though I have rejected him and I take quite long to reply him and sometimes even end the conversation by not replying. He will ask me out again sometime later. 

I just find it weird that he only asks me out or asks me REALLY weird questions. I reply him out of courtesy but my replies are those very dead kind and I have told him outright that I don't like him that way. What should I do?

I know some of you will ask me to give him a chance but I just find it really uncomfortable to go out with someone you barely know, plus I don't want to give him false hopes (I don't think telling him "okay I can go with you but only as a friend" works on him)
-
 
Here comes another typical confession but please bear with me because I really needed to get this off my chest :(

I met a guy from one of my classes this sem, and I felt something for him since the second or third week we met. It was one of those rare moments where I actually felt like this guy could be a good choice, a great guy. However, despite being told repeatedly to just "go for it!" I ignored my friends' words of encouragement because I was too shy and too afraid of rejection. (read: too prideful)

Now, as the semester is drawing to a close, I am left with a deep sense of regret as next week or so is probably the last time I'm going to see him, since he's from a different faculty and not likely to take any more modules in my home faculty. I really thought we had a deep connection there, but I'm so afraid that once this class ends, we won't have many things to talk about in the future, and even if it goes nowhere, I still want to keep him as a good friend because I believe he's a really good person. :/

What should I do?

After seeing all these posts about loneliness and relationship issues, I am kind of shocked as to how much I can relate to them. 

For me, I have always been the type of person who compartmentalize my friends, and as such, I always act a little differently around each group of friends to experiment around. As for the reason why I do that, I don't know. But I think it can be attributed to how I have always felt uncomfortable letting people fully into my life. I guess it can also be attributed to how my father always drilled in the notion of 'a fresh new start' every time I had a change in environment.

The persona that I had on ranged from loud uncaring and obnoxious kid in secondary school, to a quiet, seemingly intellectual kid in JC, to a seemingly demanding and confident officer in army, and to my current seemingly shy and awkward dude persona in NUS right now. 

I don't know why I did that, and now I feel drained as hell trying to keep up with all these different 'personalities' around different groups of friends, and sometimes I would just shut myself out from the world altogether, fearing that somehow friends from different groups would come together to discuss about me, and then finding out how different I am to the person that I made them believe to be me.

As a result, I never had a true friend. No one knows the real me. Even I myself am confused as to who I really am. Needless to say I have great difficulty in achieving intimacy in both friendships and with girls, and this have been bogging on my mind so much lately that it has been affecting my studies. I did so badly on my mid terms that I don't think I can ever pull up the grades with my finals.

I don't know what I want to achieve with this post, but I guess I just want to let those of you who feel lonely to know that, you are not alone in this.

Need some help here. I am interested in one of my project groupmate. She is from a different faculty as me but on top of the usual project meetup, we often study together with another of our groupmate but sometimes just the 2 of us. I am not sure if she is interested in getting the relationship beyond just friend. Is there any way to find out?  From a evergreen guy
-
 
my (fairly close, talked on a daily basis) friend started ignoring me after she got her boyfriend, only looking for me for homework-related matters/to talk about her boyfriend troubles. I gave up on the friendship, after telling her how i felt once and having zero results. couple months later, her boyfriend grew tired of her jealousy and over attachment. I encouraged his break up with her. 
it felt good. 
-
 
Poster of  here! I'm the girl who needed help in decoding the male species haha. 

I think I may have missed out an important piece of info. When we are with our group of coursemates, he talks to this other girl most of the time and they seem to be quite close. The girl is attached though. It's quite obvious that they are of the same frequency. Both of them are the really bubbly and playful type. On the other hand, I'm much more reserved and he doesn't really talk to me much when we are with the group. Now I'm thinking that he likes that girl... Arghh am I just thinking too much?
-
 
I know its normal for a guy to like younger girls. But as a girl, is it weird for me to like younger guys too? like more than 5 years younger!
-
 
He asked for my number a while ago, but I was shocked and didn't give a reply. I think he also felt awkward so he didn't ask me again. However, now I really regret it because after coming to my senses, I find myself liking him too and I really want to talk to him more. I haven't met him after that though. If I were to meet him again, what should I do? Should I ask for his number?
-
 
It's been many months into a relationship with my girlfriend, and lately she keeps putting me down in front of others, then later brush it off as just joking. Is this normal behaviour, since I have little experience in r/s? To top it off, when I use the exact same thing to describe her, she'd get pretty upset and say that I'm mean.

Do gaming laptops reply girls? I am thinking of getting the Razer Blade 14 cuz its like the sexiest laptop in existence. But will I be like Evergreen if i start carrying it around? (pun intended)
-
 
Dont understand why 3rd parties exist. Like can you just leave couples alone. Just because you have a crush on someone who's attached, you go after that person and proceed to flirt. Even if they are going to break up, you wait for them to do so, then go after your crush. Do you even feel good? Or is this your habit and it makes you happy to destroy relationships. (Just ranting)

Regarding , this guy I like is single but I don't think it would work out logistically since it's the end of the semester already. Should I try anyways? I'm just so scared.

Hi guys , just a thought , will it be ok if I date a person of a different race ? I am a male  chinese -25 year old  , and the person im attracted to is a 25 -year old indian guy. He is so fit and cute  and cares for me  and what is ur opinion guys ? I am so in love with him , but can this interracial gay love work  over here in this dot  ?  My friends keep being racist and all , but honesty needed guys,.....does chinese-indian gay love happen here ?
-
 
Sometimes, I wish girls can teach me the art of friendzoning someone. During my whole 2 years of NS, two guys happen to confess to me. (BTW, I am straight) I not sure what makes me so attractive to guys. It was quite traumatic sometimes knowing that you are straight and this is happening. Sadly, no girls ever had a crush on me and when I confess to some of my crushes, I got rejected.
-
 
Regarding , it's obviously wrong to pursue someone who is attached. I know he isn't attached though. So should I approach him or not? 
-
 
I need some advice here. It's pretty long but please, I'm really out of choices now.

My clique has 7 of us, and I'm the only guy. We've been going out as a group quite a lot (outings, lunch, dinner etc). For the past few months, they have been my closest group of friends in NUS. 

Here's the thing - when you spend a lot of time with someone, feelings develop. Gradually I felt attracted to one particular girl in the clique. She's not the prettiest (as what my other guy friends told me since they always talk about me) but she definitely caught my eye.

Recently we had a chalet just for the 7 of us. (There were some alcoholic drinks but I didn't drink a lot since I know my alcohol tolerance is really bad) At night we decided to play truth or dare. At this point in time, I was probably the most sober.  The girls were slightly tipsy.

Halfway through the game, one of the girls decided to reveal her secret crush. It turned out to be.

Unfortunately, she's wasn't the "one".

There was an awkward silence then and I decided to use the toilet. I went to pee and wash my hands before exiting the toilet. Little did I know that this time another girl decided to confess to me. She hugged me mumbled something like "please tell me I'm the one you like."

Not knowing what to do, I unhooked her hands and told her "you're drunk, go wash up and rest early" and left the kitchen. 

I proceeded to head outside the chalet and sat near the pool to reflect on what just happened. As if matters couldn't get any worse, another girl decided to pick this time to confess. She sat down beside me and started talking about how she wanted to "bring our relationship further." 

At the end of the whole chalet, I was wondering whether I had struck lottery there times in a row. But the thing was, I didn't really want those lottery, I wanted something else.

I wanted "her". 

What should I do from here? The clique is getting tensed up since a few of them vaguely remembers what happened that night and I haven't given them any response. Should I still go for the "one"? I really find her alluring but I don't want to cause our group to crumble because of my selfish desires. 

Ps. I'm an evergreen that am absolutely clueless about how to handle relationships.

We were all from the same class in anglican in 2009-2010. Now that our friends are in uni, our bros clique seemed to have drifted apart. They only wish to find girls girls and girls. And they hang out with the guys at uni just so that through them they can interact with girls. First priority: find girlfriend. So disappointing. 5 years of friendship is worth less than finding a girlfriend.
-
 
To  This happened to me before and I was really annoyed and quite disgusted initially. Instead of just sitting next to her and saying hi suddenly, be a bit more indirect and ask if there's anyone sitting next to her then start talking by using the lecture's content as a topic? It probably will be less terrifying for her then. It's unlikely for her to fall for you right away so it'll take some time.  Since it's already week 11, if you really want to get to know her then just try? And maybe you guys can study together for finals. Even if it fails you won't have many opportunities outside lecture to meet her again anyway.

As a person hangs out alone in school, I do it because I feel that it's easier to focus when you're alone. I also cherish my freedom and independence. However deep inside, I wish that one day there will be that one person to bothers enough to make the first step. Someone who forcibly tears down my walls

Dear C,
We broke up for at least 6 months, why do you still try to establish contact with me and get angry with me for the things you did when i mentioned them? Why can't you leave me alone to find my inner peace that I strive so hard to get? I still love you, not sure if you do but this is certainly a bad time to pull a stunt on me again. My grades can't take that pounding and my heart can't take anymore emotional roller coaster rides from you. Actually, tell me if you love me.
Best,
C

I think that there has been several posts regarding why guys text you often after class but do not talk to you that much in a group. 

I am a guy and I'm doing just that at the moment. Firstly, I constantly text this one girl often especially after classes about school, asking her about her work and reminding her to sleep early even, and occasionally I try my luck asking her out for meals or movies. If I like a girl, I will care for her and go out of the way to do something sweet for her. If a guy does this for a girl, she probably holds a special place in his heart. 

Now when it comes to a group setting, I do not talk to the girl I like as much too. After all, you have other friends around and all of them have a different level of closeness with you. Chances are that things that you are going to share with the group, that girl would have already known since you text her often outside. Also, you can't really ask private or specific questions only to that girl. Either your friends will think that it is directed to them also, or they will feel that you are outcasting them by treating them as transparent. It will leave a bad impression of both the guy and girl among the group. 

 the guy in this case probably likes you if he only does this to you. Try spending more time together alone at your dinners/movies if you fancy him or just want to talk more with him, he'll be so happy :) Good luck!

Friendship -> Develop feelings -> Get rejected -> Sad and disappointed. Is this a nice guy syndrome? 

I mean that is normal right? When you develop feelings for your friends and start hanging out more and being sweet you surely expect your feelings to be reciprocated right? Like that everyone is a nice guy?

Don't tell me you do something sweet for your crush and expect nothing in return. Touch your heart. 
Maybe the nice guy syndrome is based more of the reaction after you are rejected. 
Whiny and unreasonable => nice guy?
Sucking it up and thinking okie it is her right to reject me => good guy?

There is this guy that I am starting to fall for and he is the second guy that I ever liked. However, I found out from my friends that he texts quite a handful of girls (not with ill-intentions, just that he converse well with girls). I will end our conversation by not replying because I do not want to fall deeper, however, he will double text and ask me why I did not reply. What does that mean? I don't know if he does that to other girls as well.

It has been 3 years.  I thought i was over you until pictures of you and her turn up. They all said it was for my good when we broke up, that i was too good for you , that you were too young for me. But i only found that i have crossed every hurdle , every fragment of heartbreak only to find myself deluded. When those pictures turned up, it was as if my heart was never fixed. Time had done nothing. There's no one that seems to understand - no one even did when i was first drawn to you despite you doing the chasing. I dont expect anyone else to now . Just wanted to get this of my chest. It's times like this that i feel so alone.

The girls i like are always eyecandying someone else and soon, they get together. My luck is sooooo amazing. Evergreen for life

I've got the biggest crush on one of the student conductors in the NUS choir.  I don't know what to do. Is it inappropriate to initiate something? It's just a CCA, but maybe there's a boundary between execs and members that shouldn't be crossed? Or am I just overthinking? He's just so passionate about music and hilarious during rehearsal. He wouldn't ever notice me among the dozens of other singers, but a girl can always dream.

I have the tendency to make people around me laugh with my words and actions, but deep inside I'm an unhappy person with nothing worth smiling for.

Congratz girl! You had single-handedly slain a cold-hearted demon, are you satisfied now? Now I can finally empathized the feelings of all the girls that I had toyed with, over the years. I used to derive great pleasure and sense of accomplishments, when those girls relentlessly begged me to return to them, after being mercilessly dumped by me. 

Karma is a bitch uh? I had let my guard down, and you successfully gave me a taste of my own medicine. Never in my wildest dream, I could ever imagined that you got close to me, in order to plot my demise. Those innocent smiles, those false future that you had described to me and those crocodile tears that you shed for me..... 

If time can be reverse, given a choice I wouldn't choose the playboy life. No matter how many girls I fucked, my heart is still empty and miserable. You came into my life and proved to me that I'm still a human being. Only when you are hugging me, I could sensed my heart beating and that feeling is so warmth. I thought that an angel has appeared to liberate me from my darkness and a demon like me can finally find true happiness. For the first time in my life, I fell in love and I proceed to deleted all my FWBs contacts to devote all my heart to you.

You must have hated me a lot, to be able to deliver this fatal blow to me, so mercilessly. That smile of yours, is it genuine? When you saw my soul being ripped into thousand pieces, are you truly happy? Is this what you really wish for?

My heart is bleeding profusely now and it hurts like hell. But it's perfectly fine! What a great honor to die under your hands =)

This isn't a troll post so please save me.

I'm a guy but I find it really easy to get along with guys and you know with guys it's always a love-hate sorta thing where we'll trash talk each other but say lame stuff like <3 and "I love you bro" and we'd buttsmack and shit. And I like girls, been in a couple of relationships, only had romantic feelings for girls and never anything towards guys.

So here's my question: How do I know that I'm supposed to be with a girl and not a guy? With girls I have that sort of affectionate feelings but with guys I'm that comfortable to be lame and fucked up with. ??!?!?!?

Be warned, the following is not a success story. 

When I first entered the workforce I didn't know what to expect. I've heard stories of people saying how equipped school had made them and how ready they were for anything that came their way. But I was still unsure. I tried to stay optimistic and true to myself at the very least. On my first day, a senior colleague told me not to expect much, told me that career progression here was unthinkable and even a pay raise was near impossible. I tried not to be disheartened and tried my best to adapt to the working environment. I was attentive and did everything to the best of my ability and was rewarded with employee of the month. But after multiple awards with no promotions or pay raise or any benefit at all, it became more and more normal rather than something extraordinary. 

After years of working, I must say I am exhausted. I have a friend who chose not to work and has fun everyday sleeping or just minding his own business and while I have other plans for life, I do envy his lifestyle. For me work seems to be so ingrained that despite my happy disposition I can't help but feel like a robot. I repeat to myself certain things to keep my spirits high but from an outsider point of view I'm no different than my colleague who spends each and every of his day lamenting about life. A female friend of me supports me wholeheartedly in pursuing my passion and is always introducing me to new ways to have fun, but I always felt she was living inside her own dome. 

So that's my work life and as you can see, it's far from ideal. 

But if there's one benefit of it all, is that I do have some free time and I get to spend the most of it doing stuff I enjoy and hanging out with the people I like. Money has never been an issue due to my enthusiastic work ethic and if there's one thing school has taught me, it's that no matter how bad things may seem, no matter how many people put you down, and no matter how green the grass on the other side is, stay true to yourself and work hard - things will get better. 

After all, despite being drained each working day, I love to head back to my pineapple to get a good night's rest. 

P.S. For the secret to success, repeat to yourself "I'm ready" each morning

For those who feel stressed out about finals coming up, just know that you're not alone. 

And that means there's a probability someone is going to push you up the bell curve so hope for that.

 I think I am in the same dilemma as you. Just that I am the rejected one and I am trying to forget about my crush or keep a distance between us until my feelings go away. If you have no romantic interest please do not talk to him. Let him have his space. Stop being so selfish by thinking of yourself only. We would be your friends again (if ever) when we are ready.

Fucking hate love.

Girls, how would you feel if you sat alone in lecture for the whole sem and then suddenly before the lecture start a random guy came up to you, said hi, sat next to you and just started talking? 

Reason i ask this is cos i just started noticing this damn pretty girl sitting alone in lectures for one of my modules. I never noticed her before cos I usually sit with my other friends.  Last week I happened to notice her and saw her sitting alone. Same thing happened today and i think it's safe to assume she's taking the module alone.   Should I just go up to her and say hi? I'm quite reluctant cos i keep thinking maybe there's a reason she wants to sit alone, or what will she think if a random guy just walks up to her and starts chatting. Will she be disgusted or what? I think it's pretty clear that if a guy does that he's trying to hit on her. I also scared she may not be singaporean (although from what I spied her doing on her phone and from her face i think she is). Not discriminating here but I probably won't want a potential gf to be from another country.

Sigh... it's already week 11 and next week i think it's last lecture. Such a pity i never noticed her earlier on in the sem. What should i do????? Or am i just being a despo? Help plz.

I liked him so when he asked me for sexual favours, I agreed to and looking back, I'm filled with anger and regret. Guess I just brought it on myself cuz I was stupid and naive. He claimed it was a mistake and we were too reckless, so we agreed to forget about the whole thing. But I was hurt and vowed to forget him. And then I found out he unfriended me on Facebook for unknown reasons which made me realize his true colours. After actively ignoring my existence, he has suddenly asked me for the same favours again. I am angry at him for using me but at the same time it is so tempting cuz I wanna be close to him. I told him that we can't do that stuff anymore cuz I don't wanna get hurt again. I don't know if I will regret my decision.

Some help needed in decoding the male species! So there's this guy who's confusing the heck out of me. Some background: He's from the same course and we see each other almost everyday.

He texts me quite often after school and has asked me out for dinner and movie. Thing is, when we see each other at lecture or have lunch with our coursemates together, he doesn't talk to me THAT much. 

Is he just being friendly or could it be something more? Somebody enlighten me before I fall deeper into this...
-
 
I was the one who told him (through a friend) to stop asking me out/texting me. That was because I knew we could never be more than friends, but I was falling. 

Now I am suffering the consequences of my own decision. I can be busy, but at the end of the day when I lie paralysed on my bed, that's when I wish I could talk to him, that i wished he continued to text me random things that made me smile.

I am tired of telling my friends that I miss him, even though I really really do. I wish I could text him, and somehow I know he would be gentle and oblige, but I'm worried I will fall again, & that wouldn't have been my intention of a "break". Now the whole idea is "if you want to see him, you shouldn't. You should only see him if you don't have the urge to see him anymore."

Why do I always have to do something that isn't what I want? Is it really good for us ultimately, if we force ourselves to do what our heart does not want? I don't need him to know my struggles, I just feel really broken, not because of him but because of what I "should and should not do". He didn't hurt me. I was the one who hurt us by asking him to stop.

What do you guys think of ldr? My so is leaving spore to study for 3 years and idk if i should cont this r/s for theres simply too many uncertainties and our parents arent very supportive of it either. Ugh so conflicted :((( any advice??? Thanks!!!!!!

It's funny how you introduced your female friend to me as we are both single. Little do you know that actually you are the one that I secretly hope could be my girlfriend :( You are just so perfect and so ideal. But well, you are attached. I just wish that you are happy. Secretly admirer from far far away
-
 
ldr? Forget abt it. Out of 5 of my sec school/jc friends who went overseas for studies, 4 of them broke up within 2-3 mths? Some were tgt for 4 mths, some 4 yrs. I know sample size is too small to draw conclusions but frankly speaking, when yr physically away from yr partner you have to put in so much effort just to even facetime/skype. Yr SO's or maybe even yr own priorities will change. Oh and yr arguments will not be face to face also which could be a prob? The best thing is to break up before u go off and if it's meant to be, u can find yr SO again when u return.

 Perhaps professional help from a psychologist/psychiatrist would help? Or perhaps reading related books? Time? There were times when I was rather pessimistic with regards to the outlook of things and thought that time would never heal the wounds, but looking back now, I think things have been a lot better.

If he doesn't like you then I think there's really nothing else to ponder over. But if you truly like him and he too feels the same way, respect him as an equal in the relationship and talk it out. If both of you decide to stick around, work things out together, and perhaps he's someone to be part of your remaining life. Things he could possibly accept if he likes you could be to remain purely as friends till you are mentally ready or a relationship without physical contact of any sorts till you are mentally ready.

If either party doesn't want to start or that things at the end of the day just don't work out, then so be it? It really wouldn't be the fault of anyone and some things just turn out the way they do and at times we can't seem to comprehend why that is so, even if we very much want answers and struggle to find them. Furthermore, if he likes you, I'm sure he would want the best for you, even if things don't work out the way either of you wanted.

Bottom line is, don't be too hard on yourself :)

Shoutout to all those lonely people who feel like they've no friends. I'm not going to address a particular post but hopefully sharing my experience will help at least somebody even in a small way. I joined uni knowing no one else in my course. Having self esteem issues, I was constantly self-conscious and awkward and felt that attending any camps would just make me feel more unconfident because my awkwardness with big groups of strangers just makes things weird and uncomfortable. I found my first friend by asking a course mate who wasn't in a group for lunch, and subsequently attended lectures with that friend. Yet, I had multiple classes and tutorials to attend alone, and often time to spend in between as well, all of which I'd spend wondering why everyone else had friends but me. Things got pretty terrible and I'm sure it affected my studies. Being alone and friendless essentially worsened my pathetic semblance of a self-esteem, and the more I lost confidence in myself, the more awkward, desperate, yet reserved I became which isn't the best recipe for making friends. 

It took time and introspection but ultimately I realised my issues were beyond just the bad circumstances I was in. I inherently looked down upon myself and hence expected the same of everyone else, and with that fear would subsequently put up walls to protect myself, shutting any potential friends out. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Eventually I decided to go to CPS and met a very sensible counsellor who frankly helped me realise that listening to the condescending, judgemental voice in my head was a choice not an obligation. As I grew more confident, willing to make mistakes and laugh at myself for those mistakes, I also found it much easier to connect with people without worrying about judgement. 

My friend got to know other people in our course, and when they joined us for study session or lunches, I tried to make it a point to be friendly so I could at least get to know people in my course even if on a hi-bye basis. One of the most important things I learnt was that just as I was shy to talk to people, so were many other people. Nowadays, when I meet someone new I try to be friendly (even if they seem a little unapproachable) and take the initiative to make conversation. Sometimes you find new friends, other times you just find out who's not interested which is okay too. There's definitely a dash of luck involved, but with some of the people we've met, things have worked out and our "clique" has been growing, as have my acquaintances.  Friendships, like all other relationships, are controlled by multiple factors including the subjects and circumstances. You can't force things but you can always put in your best to create a more conducive environment to facilitate the progress you hope for. 

I just want to say don't lose hope, I've morphed from a "talks about once a month in class" to "lonely to the extent of suicidal thoughts" to "confident and nice to talk to (as described by friends)" person. It's a tough journey but when you get to the other side it'll be beautiful to look back and see how far you came. Cliché as it is, love and respect who you are, it'll make your head a more peaceful place to be in and your body a healthier, happier home for you soul. 

P.S. Also, if you have self-esteem issues do try to address them before you start working, because it's likely to make a huge difference in your workplace life and career prospects if you do (from experience).

I feel like an outcast for most of my life. I have quite a bit of acquiantances to whom I will say hi to whenever I see them nowadays, but I actually have very little friends at all.

Before I entered NUS, I was that kid who was really awkward, whom everyone would shun because of my weird antics. Somehow, someway or another I tend to offend people unknowingly, against my best intentions, and this repels people away and drew unwanted verbal and sometimes physical abuse from bullies in the past. I guess I had shitty social skills and emotional intelligence then. Throughout my secondary school to JC, I literally gained zero friends whom I could confide to. Yes, I was THAT weird. 

Thankfully going through 2 years of army had my head smacked hard in a good way, and I managed to be more 'normal' when I entered NUS. Actually, until now I still not sure if I have become 'normal', or that people simply grew out of the way they used to treat me. Though I can tell people definitely treated me better now as compared to in the past when I had zero social skills. I even gained a few friends now. I guess you can say my skills leveled up and I can somewhat connect to people on a superficial level.

However, my loneliness was still there like a gaping hole. Superficial interactions simply isn't enough to fill this gap. I find that I have a severe deficiency in my ability to connect to people on a deeper level, which results in my inability to form meaningful relationships with people, in particular in my endeavor to get a girlfriend. Somehow I have this inability to talk to people about how I really feel, my deepest thoughts about things and my outlook on life. It's like I have this barrier, this unconscious filter that I put up so that whatever I say would be pleasing to the person I am speaking to. But the things that are said are never deep enough to form meaningful connections with the person. The words spoken are politically correct, but never personal nor intimate. I want to get closer to people, but I have no idea how to.

I guess right now I am having some sort of a quarter life crisis right now , with everyone getting attached and some even getting married at my age right now. I still have one more semester left in NUS and I plan to make full use of it, but I have no idea to. Any advice from people who have gone through what I went through? Thanks

It's close to a year since I broke up with my boyfriend.  Although I have deleted his number, I would sometimes add his number back just to see his WhatsApp picture and status and hope that he is doing well.

Has anyone ever felt like they like someone, but don't actually want to fall in love with that person because you want to like someone else because the feelings just don't come out that way? I'm quite confused with my feelings now, and am not exactly sure who I can turn to ask. :(

Sometimes I feel that my friend who just got dumped by her bf deserves it. Though we are probably each other's best friend and I appear to support you when you grumbled and complaint about your failed relationships, I want to tell you something..

So what he's not from a local uni, so what his earning power is much lesser than you. Complaining that he is a loser when the fact is that he dumped you is just hilarious. Giving your body to him doesn't mean that he has to be your slave and tolerate your nonsense. Being attached with him, you should have shown him more respect by not flirting around and don't club every other weekend. Do you know that all of our guy friends are joking and gossiping about your "plight" now? So. Please stop complaining and badmouthing your ex. Tyvm.

Im emotionally and physically drained from all the quarelings with my bf. we have tried mending our r/s alot of times. i kept holding him back despite him initiating breakups several times. he's nice to me still but the fights have really wounded our r/s severely.. i love him as he has been a constant in my life for a very long time, but i am thinking of a break up but i am scared of the hurt it will cost me. it hurts me to stay in the r/s as i can't see a future now but at the same time, breaking up would hurt me too.. im confused.. how long does people take to recover from a breakup? what do i have to do?? we've been together for 1.5 years..

Being a flicker-minded guy who likes every pretty girl, i thought I would get over my first rejection quickly but it still hurt so fucking bad. It is not the humiliation or embarrassment or anything. Given a second chance I would still confess knowing I won't be satisfy with the friendship. I don't regret it but I still feel so bad. I just cry myself to sleep everyday. I wish someone I could break down in front of someone but being on exchange now, I have no close friend. 
I fucking hate this feeling. I don't want my crush to feel bad also. It is nobody's fault i understand. I wish I never knew you.

I'm trying to be more independent this semester, like going for more lessons alone because none of my good friends are taking the same modules as I am. Most of the time it's not too bad; there's not much interaction required during lectures anyway and I try to make new friends in tutorials. But the friendships forged seem very superficial and transient...it's like you're just friends of convenience and once classes are over everyone goes their separate ways. I know it's not realistic to become BFFs right away but sometimes it feels like you're the only one putting in effort. 

I have friends that I trust and spend time with regularly, but they have their own schedules and I don't expect them to (nor do I want them to) hang out with me 24/7. Yet when I'm alone I start to feel a little lonely and empty. I used to study as a way to distract myself from any negative feelings but now I'm finding it hard to focus.  

It's tough trying to go through stuff alone, even if you want to try.

I happen to read a post on how a girl have to lie to her parents about going out late for fear that they may find out that she is in a relationship. Now, here are my parents. They are the complete opposite. They are always worried that I am still single (evergreen). I know they are worried about me but it always make me feel as though its my fault for being single. They don't understand how hard it is for me to find a girlfriend. Looks like we should switch parents.

Relationships really cloud your judgment and mess up friendship dynamics.

For my case, it was this group of 8 of us, 5 guys and 3 girls. We were from the same hall and same hall CCA. Among the 8 of us, there's this prominent pair (and they are a couple) as both of them are quite good-looking and the male is really one of the best among all the halls. His girlfriend is quite good-looking but skill-wise she is just so-so. 

All of us except for 2 (her boyfriend and another girl) are from the same major so naturally the 6 of us hang out together quite often. The girl is the most outspoken and tends to be the center of the clique, she would say really childish things and crack super lame jokes that are not funny at all (even in the lame sense, some don't even make any sense) but everybody will always humour her and seem to place her on a pedestal. I'm unlike them as I'm more reserved and I tend to enjoy observing from a distance how everybody sucks up to her although they are more skilled than her, in studies and in our CCA.

On the field (not exactly, I changed this so it won't be obvious) she always likes to bark out commands and talk down to people as if she's the captain or one of the most skilled. Sometimes she calls for team meetings and rants on and on. Sometimes her rants go in circles, sometimes it hits a dead-end and keeps beating on the dead-end. Due to all these really idiotic circumstances, I decided to leave the CCA and clique altogether. I made up some stupid reason that I couldn't continue the CCA anymore, and some conscious efforts to distance myself from them and their happenings.. It was tough getting around on my own at first, but I was able to make some friends by joining other CCAs and from my tutorial class. 

Half a year down the road, I found out that he had broken up with her due to unable to stand her childish ways, and I could see that she was quite broken. He got poached by another hall and our 1st/3rd placing dropped to 4th/4th placing. She left hall due to personal reasons and the clique became fragmented (I see them sitting separately now).

I don't know exactly why I wrote this, but I feel somewhat vindicated for not pretending to like someone due to clique dynamics or peer pressure or whatever it's called. I'm also glad because breaking away from this clique allowed me to meet someone who eventually became my girlfriend :D

Please allow me rant. To the girl who often appears around CBLC room (might be a member): You look cute, esp with that cute bag of yours. It's not my first time seeing you, but I doubt you will ever notice the not-so-good-looking me. What's more is that you are always together with this same guy or surrounded by a group of guys. I envy how close they are to you. I often wonder why am I not one of them? You might never see this post, but I just want to say, you are my daily dose of happiness. I am not asking much, just hoping that you will notice me someday. Btw, I realised you are often in sleeveless top, do bring a jacket to class :) 

From the guy who is not fated to be your friend

Dear OP of , (apologies in advance, this is quite long) 
I'm a freshie and I've just went down the same path as you. I missed every orientation camp that there was due to my late acceptance as well...It was quite demoralising at first when I attended lectures and tutorials, I felt that majority of the people knew at least one other person in the lecture theatre (through JC, secondary school, army mates...) Sometimes it felt as though everyone knew everyone and I was just the awkward one left out (because none of my high school friends are here).   :(  I've joined a few CCAs and I'm also in a hall of residence so I have made quite a number of friends, but there is still a little distance between us. I guess that's expected because most of them have lived in Singapore all their lives and they have a closely knit circle of friends. So it's hard to just join and blend in...(sometimes I envy that they have stayed in just one country because I've moved around growing up and never got to establish the kinda friendship people here have). 

During the first few weeks of the semester, I was plagued by the thought that the next 3/4 years of university would be a nightmare because I knew no one, went to lectures/tutorials alone, ate meals alone, went to Welcome Teas ALONE... it was the complete opposite of what I anticipated university life to be.

As an introvert, it took immense effort for me to come out of my comfort zone in my attempt to make friends. Some eventually became my friends while others simply acted as though they don't want to know me, ignored me and saw right through me whenever I greeted them. It was harsh, painful and often made think whether I made the right choice to return to my homeland (as I always had the assumption that I would just fit in here). Some people also look at me as though I'm some sort of an alien when I tell them I've lived overseas my entire life, others judge my accent, the way I dress, even my handwriting...

By the end of week 3, I could list the number of friends I had on one hand. That was miserable. I attended events held by my hall and by our house and made maybe 1 friend...So then I realised, that it would be best to join a CCA/Interest Group where I would be with those who shared the same fervour in the arts as I did. 

Now it's week 10 and I'm overloaded with assignments, CAs and tutorials. And it seems as though friendship should be the least of concerns...but I meet new people everyday and I try to make new friends. So dearest OP, it will be difficult and frustrating at times, but as long as you keep trying, I assure you, your efforts will not be in vain. Some of the closest friends I've made so far were through the CCAs and Interest Groups because we share the same passion and enthusiasm which will not be influenced by our background, instead you will make friends who value you   not for your vivid overseas experiences but for your personality and who you truly are, it just takes time. 

Be adventurous, be brave and be capricious! :)

Hope this was helpful, please feel free to reply to monotonecrayons@hotmail.com or perhaps critique it! (Please don't judge the email address, it's an extra I made in the past...)

Since about a month ago, I've had something growing out of my anus. It's a little bud, doesn't hurt, and there's no blood in my bowels nor are there any kinds of discomfort. The thing is, I'm terribly shy and have been contemplating whether to go to UHC to have it checked out or not, since it's probably nothing.

I've known him for close to a year now. We've been associates throughout this period and it's only over the past few months that we're gotten closer. He's a really great guy, very different from the previous guys I have dated. I think I have fallen slightly for him but the truth is, I'm really scared of falling in love. I have seen/experienced way too many cases of people (regardless of gender) cheating or emotionally abusing their partners to want to become vulnerable again. I hate that I feel this way though but I don't know how to go about changing this mentality.

Most of us seem to drink and party a lot. You'll see a lot of different kind of drunks; 

The angry one- that knocks over other people's drinks and complain about their exes.
The pretending to be sober- to get another drink because he doesn't want to disturb the rest
The sad one- who literally burst out crying over anything and everything from happy moments ("you guys are the best friends EVER" *sobs*), to upsetting moments (see the angry one)
The crazy happy one - who proclaims to love everyone and hugs and kisses everything and everyone, smiles uncontrollably.
The horny one- who tries to hump everything and everyone.
The baby- who needs to be loved after puking everywhere.

And then there's my guy friends whom I frequently drink with and I don't think I've seen anything like it. They start to speak intelligently. Like. When they are sober, they sprout absolute nonsense, typical dude stuff. With alcohol, they talk about politics, gender issues, monetary inequality, wars and people, disparity, racism, love for poetry, philosophy etc in the most civilized manner as if partaking in a gentlemen's debate of sorts with active discussion, laden with facts and statistics to back up their arguments. 

I'm just amazed how alcohol  can transform a person so much even for the better. I love going to get drinks with them for the same reason of some sense of odd sophistication I suppose.

Would like to hear any other kinds of drunks you know of! CHEERS!

It really hurts when you find out that people you've known for nearly half your life and regarded as your best friends choose to talk badly about you behind your back instead of talking to you about why they are unhappy with you. And it hurts even more when you realise it's because to them, the friendship is so far gone and the differences so great that they don't even think it necessary to try and address them any more.

Now I'm kinda afraid my remaining friends may secretly dislike me too.

How long does it take to mend this wound?

To the previous confession, i guess that its normal for a guy to like a younger girl? I'm nearing the end of my studies, 26 this year and I've been dating a 16 year old girl. She likes it too because i have more experience than her classmates ;)

What's with all these F/SN UBW quotes. 

To those who want to give up, here's a quote for you:

Don't forget. 
Always, somewhere, someone is fighting for you. 
As long as you remember her,
you are not alone.

I hope this don't get filtered. What happens if someone on okcupid gets attached, will we know? Are we able to terminate our account if we feel that okcupid is ineffective? Is it common to go for lots of blind dates for this app?

I miss you, more than you will ever know. It's been 10 months but I still think of you and of the good times we shared. I'm sorry for all the broken promises I didn't keep, and for all the hurt you have felt and will feel. I will always be responsible for it, now and forever. 

I wish you all the love in the world.

Two months ago I wrote about Sam, a baby I aborted when I was 19. I kept secret my decision from everyone I knew, including the father of my child: my boyfriend. I made a decision that I wasn't going to keep the baby. I deeply regret not involving my boyfriend in the decision, but I honestly believed at the time, that I did it out of a place of love. He would've assumed responsibility and he would've asked me to keep the baby. And I would've loved him for saying that and I would've said yes, but I genuinely didn't want to rob his chances of being a regular, maybe even boring university student, whose worry amongst others is about not being able to meet deadlines. I wanted him to experience life and didn't want him to have to forgo that to become a father, husband and student all at the same time. 

It took me a long while but two nights ago, I came clean to him about our Sam. We cried our hearts that night. My heart ached terribly not just for the baby we lost, but for my boyfriend too. I had not seen cry, so vulnerable. I had always known him to be the stronger one. He was - and still is - my pillar of strength. I explained to him the events that led up to the abortion. From the time I got my first, second and third positive test, to the first clinic appointment I made, to the many times when I thought about telling him but didn't, to the time when I sat in the clinic... cold, scared and alone, to the times when I just couldn't get through my day because the grief overwhelmed me. He was angry and disappointed, but mostly, he felt sad that I went through it by myself. 

We sat on Bus 10 from Kent Ridge that night heading home. As I laid my head on his shoulders, the same one prior to tonight I had always found comfort, I felt tears land on my face like bullets. I looked at him teary-eyed; I was afraid that I was only going to see in his eyes the death of our relationship, but all I saw on the bus ride home was a long future, a house and kids in it. "We'll be okay, our kids will know about Sam," he said.

Home, is where he is.

They always marvel at my achievements. They always ask how I do it. I never tell them. Because the truth is so simple, and yet so bitter.

I hate myself. Everyday I look at myself and I see no redeeming qualities, and the rest of the day is a futile attempt to try and change that. How can anyone constantly find the motivation to change, unless they cannot tolerate what they are? Always trying to be a better person, a superior person, a person I could eventually come to like. But what is better? Don't know, but just pick a direction, any direction, and start running. Running as fast and as far away from me as I can.

Am I happy, doing this to myself? I don't know. But I would be miserable if I didn't.

Not too long ago, I got rejected with "you're a really nice guy. But the problem is with me".
I walked away without uttering a word.

Confess to the girl and she will feel that you are desperate, don't confess to the girl and you are closing a window of opportunity. So hard to be a guy.

Which of the clubs is the best  - Zouk or Attica? I am thinking to go there and play around as i recently got stressed about the projects. School is taking a toll on me. It's time to play hard.  - From an evergreen girl..

In the past, I was a selfish coward. I'm afraid that if i continue to stay by your side, there will be a day when I can no longer contain my feelings towards you. Due to the fear of rejection, I developed thoughts of severing all ties with you before I sink too deep. In order to protect myself, I isolated myself from you by hiding into my tortoise shell. I thought that I will be safe from all the pain while I'm hiding away from reality. However my selfish actions had created so much misery for you. When you needed me the most, I wasn't there to comfort your broken soul . That's when I realised that I had such an important placing in your heart, my simple presences can bring you joy and help you forget your sadness. In the end, I'm hurt by my selfish actions too. 看见我心爱的女人受伤，我也受伤了. 

Will you forgive me for being a useless guy ? No matter what is the outcome that you have decided, I swear that I will never abandon you again! You always tell me that I'm too nice and "nice guy will finish last". SCREW THAT LOGIC. What's wrong with being nice !? I just want to protect the girl that I love dearly, wipe off every single drops of tears flowing out from her eyes. Even if you reject me in the very end, I will still risk my life and plunge into the depth of hell to rescue your broken soul. 对不起我不是这世界上最帅，最浪漫的男人。 除了对你好以外，我什么都不会了。You are the woman, I love the most, in my whole life.

I'm facing such a tough decision: I really dislike my major. I'm a year 3 now, and I made a very bad choice 2 years back, listening to others and not my own passion. 

I had planned to either transfer or reapply to something I feel much more passionate about. But thinking about it now, is it worth it? If I do so, I'll spend 6, 7 years in Uni. All my friends will have graduated. Even though I'm a girl, I'll be so old when I come out to the workforce.

I don't know if it's worth it. On one hand I feel like those years don't matter as long as I get to do something I love. On the other I feel like I should just stick it out.

Please give me some advise, or share any similar stories of unconventional Uni journeys if you have!

I need help or just advice or motivation to get through this remaining one month of school. I'm depressed and its taking its toll on my studies. As much as I hate using it as an excuse, it really did affect me. I can't concentrate, tired all the time. In short, I don't have the mood to do anything. My CAP is sucky and I need to salvage it. I'm afraid that I'm going to get a warning letter after the exams. But I do know if I work hard now, I can make it at least over 2.0. Any advice, motivation would be greatly appreciated. I feel so lost right now...

It has been 2 years. I told you, I told myself, that I would just regard you as a friend. Up till today, I still cannot accept the reality that things are no longer how it used to be. Thanks for being a huge role model in my life, showing me that we do not always have to be ostentatious and high-achieving, helping me learn to appreciate the simple and humble qualities and lifestyle.

In an ideal scenario I would wish you happiness and gradually draw away from your life, even though I yearn to be a significant part in your future, even though it pains me to reminisce the same few scenes of the times we had together. I know that you would want me to move on too, but all I can do now is to think of you as motivation to pursue my own happiness and success.

From the looks of things here. I really don't know where to find true love. Tinder cannot. Club cannot. Engine cannot. Hall cannot. Cca cannot. How ah?

I would like to seek advice on a relationship issue.

Last night, I came home rather late and my parents kept questioning me why was I so late. It was a working day the following day thus there were worried. I lied to them saying that I met a primary school friend but in fact I was meeting a guy that I liked for supper. I had not told them about the guy as I know that they would reject the rs. They kept questioning me to the point that I could no longer lie. So I told them about the guy and guess what? There were pissed for my lying and they said that I am still too young to be in a rs that I should focus on my studies and all first. I know that you guys might be thinking why  I lied in the first place but knowing my parents, I had to cover up in order to meet guys. P.s Im 20 this year and he's 25. So here's the problem: my mum wants to meet him but it's not because they want to sincerely see him. It's because they want to tell him that im too young to handle a rs and that we should just be friends. But the thing is that I find that I should be given a chance to date; im not even a kid anymore. I can make wise decisions on my own. Has anyone faced this issue before? Oh and also he is of a diff race which makes this issue more complicated.

I have been thinking about this for too long and would appreciate some thoughts. I am thinking of getting rid of friends who I strongly believe are jealous of me or just don't fit what I've always thought friends should be like. The problem is that almost all of them are my close friends and I would end up pretty lonely. I would also feel guilty.

For example A is one of my closest friends but I think she has always been jealous that I've scored better than her academically and because I receive more male attention than her. Most of the time we have a normal friendship though. Some examples of her jealousy are refusing to help me in a module similar to what she took previously, trying to one-up my academic achievements and belittling them, outrightly saying that she thought guys would not really like me as I wasn't pretty and pulling friends away from me. My suspicions were proven when another friend told me about how A messaged her before on how shit she was etc compared to how I perform in a few lengthy pitiful messages. However there were also times she encouraged me to do better and said I was pretty. Her toxicity just comes out rarely. I think that I will have to face a few more hurtful times if I keep her around despite her being a much nicer friend most of the time. I just don't know whether I should do this. There are other friends too but this post has been long enough. Is it normal?
-
 
I kinda wish that my facebook and instagram posts had a "seen by" function. I know I'm being stupid, but I'm starting to get really offended that nobody likes my posts, or they just take a long time to garner up a few likes. After all, everyone is always scrolling through their social media, so it can't be possible that it took them hours to see my post. Being an overthinker, I'm starting to feel that everyone I know hates me - evidenced by the lack of likes. Or maybe I'm completely insignificant to them - is that even worse than being hated? While I'm ready to accept this if this is true, I would just like some closure.

I've got a real issue with my self-confidence here. Hoping there will be kind souls out there to give me constructive and helpful advice, that'd be great! 

Okay, here goes. I've seen my friends get attached one by one and I start to yearn the feeling of getting attached to a cute girl to (I'm sure many single guys out there think the same way too). Furthermore, it doesn't help when I access social media (fb, insta) and see pictures of well-groomed, well-dressed and good looking couples who are happily attached and having the time of their lives. 

A little about myself. I'm of average height and built and above average in term of facial features. I'm not stupid either, having been accepted into three ivy league institutions.

I don't know how to achieve such goals, being quite extroverted  on one end and but that active on social media or have many friends of the opposite sex.
I also don't like the idea of going out to seek girls which will make me seem very desperate and not going with the flow, even look like a loser.

Having a hot gf with a good personality would be such a dream come true but it's just so difficult to achieve sometimes!! Many of the hot ones are usually pursued by many guys or are already attached. Such a task seem even harder than A levels LOL. 

Constructive advice appreciated!! Thanks and sorry for the long post!! Have a nice day ya fellows ;)

Is it possible for people to hv a fwb yet not know it?? 

I have this friend who is attached.  We are kind of close but our friendship is platonic in our sober state. We do meet up for drinks one on one though and whenever we drink together, we will make out,  and this sometimes even results in heavy petting. 

The weird thing is, the next day when he messages me in a sober state,  he tends to completely omit to mention what happened the previous  night, even though I try to set the stage to make him admit something.   It's as if he completely lost his memory and sometimes he does really casually comment 'oh we got so drunk last night I can't remember anything'. 

Is he trying to act blur or did he really forget?  Just wondering is it possible to be completely unaware of multiple making out incidents?

I lost best friend almost one year ago to clinical depression. She does not respond much to anybody including her own parents. Seeing her like this breaks my heart. I kind of blame myself for not recognizing the signs. For  a few months, she had been really upset constantly, crying almost every day. She lost her hearty appetite. Even her favourite food fails to cheer her up. Many times, she would message me trying to talk but being busy with school stuff and fyp, i didnt had much time for her. Once, i even asked her not to be so clingy and told her to respect the fact that other ppl have their own commitments and do not have the time to keep entertaining her. I wished I could take it all back. I wished that I had seen that warning sign that she was trying to hold on to the last bit of sanity. Dear A, I have apologised to you a thousand time, but I'm not sure if you heard it. Please get well soon. And to everyone mugging hard for the upcoming finals, please take care of your mental health and take care of your friends around you. Stay strong!

In response to  I think you should only tell her not to feel bad only when you're sure that she's open to that idea, and that you won't develop feelings for her again. Sometimes a girl may feel even more awkward when you tell her not to. So you gotta make sure that she is the type that will be open to be friends with you. To do that you gotta tell her that you will be aware of your position around her. Of course you have to mean it, meaning you should expect less frequent sharing of feelings as compared to the past. In the beginning it will be awkward and you'll feel that the friendship isn't the same as the past, but as long as you guys work for the platonic relationship I suppose it'll work. 

I think the most important thing is that before you continue with this friendship, you must promise yourself not to fall back to that prior-confession smitten state. Otherwise it will just make things worse between you guys. Also, remember that being friends means there's a possibility that you'll see the girl getting together with another guy, and you have to be happy with that sight.

That moment when you find out someone you like is attached...haiz..;(

As an evergreen, this picture describe me perfectly

If you rejected your friend, would you still want to be friend with him? Although I really feel like cutting her out of my life, I have a feeling that she must have felt as bad as me when she rejected me. Before I confessed, both of us are really close and would share our feelings etc etc. I trust her a lot with my feelings and thoughts and I am really very confused now.

I wanted to tell her to stop feeling bad about rejecting me and I would move on with time. Do you think it is advisable to put my feelings on the table so that we could clear the air? Would you want your friend to be honest with you on how he felt or let the friendship die a natural death?? It would be really stupid for me to lose such a friendship over a silly crush but Im scare I would expect something more than that in the future. Please advise. I really need some perspectives.

i've had enough of my girl friends telling me that guy on tinder are douche or just want to hook up. why? because you are asking for it! only reply to those guys who are 8 or 9 or 10 out of 10. and use those pick up lines that make you want to drop your panties. 

you know what you should do? filter out any one higher than an 8. if you think hes an 8, hundreds of girls also feel that way and are lining up to suck his dick already. and he knows it. go talk to that 6-7. entertain his sincere conversation opener about your smile and stop being so self absorbed, only wanting him to boot lick you. try to be interested in his life as well. 

really cant take these self entitled girls with so many guys talking to them and can choose to ignore them, while im here not getting a single match. 

guys, please match with me.

There are a few cafes which I wish to try the food. Sadly, I got no girlfriend to go with. I tried going alone a few times but seeing so many couples there always make me feel awkward and self-conscious.

I like this guy, and he knows it. He's verbalised to his friends before that he doesn't like me, but because nothing has ever been out in the open (I've never said anything about how I feel), he doesn't really know that I know he doesn't like me. (Sorry for knowception) 

But he always initiates conversations and hanging out. It makes me very confused and torn, because yes I really like being together, but I do not like the fact that at the end of the day when he leaves me for someone else, I will be the one ending up hurt.

You can say he's toying with me, but at the same time I feel that he is a lonely person seeking a companion. Everytime he asks me out, I feel really conflicted because on one hand I am really afraid of getting hurt, and on the other hand I don't really want him to be disappointed. (He seems to make extra effort to make one-on-one hangouts happen) Or maybe you can say I am afraid that if I reject his invites he may never ask me again.

Anyway I am confused. Has anyone been in such a situation? What do guys like him want? And will he ever like me back?
-
 
Legit question!! Pls dont filter this!! What are your opinions about going after an attached Girl? I mean it's not nice, but what if you like the girl very much? Got goalkeeper doesn't mean cannot score goal right? They are after all, in a r/s but not married!!

I'm sick and tired of reading these superficial confessions on nuswhispers. They all start like "I made some eye contact with her and I really want to start talking to her", "how do I talk to my eye candy/crush" blah blah blah. Seriously? Are you guys 14? Either grow a pair and talk to them OR just realise looks matter nuts in a relationship. I just want to see more deep confessions by our fellow students such as family and financial woes. Or the occasional joke on nuswhispers. NOT YOUR LITTLE CONFESSIONS OR RANTS LIKE THIS. Period.

Anyone else is having an existential crisis? My life has always been smooth sailing. Schoolwork, computer games, dating girls and occasional part time jobs. Nothing interesting. However, I've started to seriously question the purpose of my existence. I consider myself to be a hedonist. This means that I strive to achieve max pleasure, and nothing else. So why am I mugging in NUS? Will my improved CAP really bring me higher pay next time, which will buy me enough material goods to outweigh my suffering now? Why am I even studying? I love driving. Shouldn't I just be a delivery driver and enjoy my life as it is? I really don't mind an income of 1k+ only. Shouldn't I just be a loan shark runner and spend my money on clubs on weekends? Might be a little late, but I'm joining the #yolo crowd finally. Maybe after my finals I guess.

Is it wrong for me to like someone else when I'm already in a relationship?

I really love my SO and I plan to marry her in the future (we've been together for more than six years, and I'm really sure she's someone I wanna spend the rest of my life with), but there's this girl whom I've become close friends with, and I really enjoy her company. 

Let's call her C.

C's attached too, but we hang out one-on-one rather often. We've made it clear to each other that we're both attached and should not develop any feelings for each other, but I find it really really difficult to suppress the feelings I get whenever I spend time with C. I look forward to receiving her texts, to our next outing and go out of my way to help her whenever she is in need. I don't, however, feel jealous whenever she talks about her boyfriend, or describes to me how sweet he is to her; I feel glad that she is being treated well.

I would like to believe that I'm only feeling and acting like this because I treat C as a really close platonic friend, but I can't tell if I'm just making excuses for myself. I don't wanna stop being C's close friend either, so I'm just bloody confused. Somebody help please? :(

I'm a 1st year girl who thinks she's crushing on her 4th year senior what should I do :((

We first met in a group karaoke session - one of our common interests, and then later on we've gone out together in groups several times and a few times we ended up alone together. 
I'm an introvert so I'm usually pretty quiet unless someone starts talking, which he does as he's an extrovert. I feel like I'm making him feel awkward with the silence but I'm just too shy to talk more!! ><
I keep wanting to meet him again even though we just met recently.
It's fascinating how we have similar body language when we sit and talk and it feels like he /might/ be interested in me but I don't know.

Well, the main problem with this is that he's a final year student so he's only got about half a year left in NUS. I don't think I have the courage to confess anytime soon, so I was thinking of confessing during his graduation if there is no development by then. But at the same time there is the possibility of us having more time together in NUS if he does feel the same way about me.

I've had close to zero experience with romance so I have no idea what I should do with these feelings :((

Wow after seeing all these confessions about this medicine hunk, I'd really like to find out who this mysterious man is. More hints???

There's this girl that I've met over one of those dating apps. I've never expected such a gorgeous looking girl to actually reply to an ugly boy, like me.

So we've chatted for quite some time, with me initiating the the conversations all the time. We exchanged contact numbers with her saying that somehow she trust me, which gave me the impression that she doesn't share her number with everyone.

After that, as she is in the midst of setting up her business, she also shared about some hard times she is facing, which again is something that she said she doesn't share with just anyone. 

We have met once for drinks and darts, I appeared  without informing her and so did another guy whom she also met on the app. Anyway, there wasn't much interaction between herself and myself as she was busy playing darts with others in the bar. When we were leaving the bar, the other guy offered to send her home, which I gladly let him do so. However, she didn't board the same taxi as him. So after he left, the next taxi and I offered her to take the taxi first as I knew she didn't have the intention to leave with anyone. 

However, in the midst of offering her the taxi, we ended up taking the same taxi and I dropped her off at wherever she was headed to. Along the way, she doze off on my shoulders, after having chat a little. After she reached her destination, as she was unsure of the area, I alighted taxi after she alighted thinking that it is better to make sure that she found her friend to ensure her safety before I leave. The next day, she sent me a message telling me that she appreciate my gentlemanliness efforts.

After that I tried to ask to meet her again but it seems like it is not working.

I'm pretty much at a loss because I really like her. I don't want things to turn sour, I do know that she is not looking for a relationship but I just want to stay by side to help her in any way I can. 
-
 
Would you snatch a walking cane from an old man. Would you snatch a balloon from a kid. Would you push someone away because you want his space.

To begin with, it is ridiculous for us to develop intense infatuation with attached people. Keep your feelings in place, dude. There are more than one The One.

There's this girl that I've met over one of those dating apps. I've never expected such a gorgeous looking girl to actually reply to a toad, like me. 

Maybe because she was looking for a church to attend, and I agreed to go church-hopping with her. So we've chatted for quite some time, with me initiating the the conversations all the time. We have met once for drinks and darts but we've not met for the purpose we're supposed to.

I'm pretty much at a loss because I really like her. I don't want things to turn sour, I do know that she is not looking for a relationship but I just want to stay by side to help her in any way I can. 

I know people will tell me to leave her and look for another girl but I know I will do accept that fact that I am to look for someone else because that's just gonna show how little sincerity I've got for her.

Can the bringer future of Singapore enlighten me on what to do?

A not very smart toad :/

Hope this doesn't get filtered, legit question here. What are the best places in NUS to have sex, other than hall/residence rooms? Need a serious answer asap.

It's so difficult to turn away, even though I know I should. 

It feels really unfair that I'm putting in so much more effort into this friendship, yet not receiving a proportionate amount in return. 

It really hurts me, because I enjoy every second of your company, every conversation we have, every hug we share; my heart tells me I'm not ready to give all of these up, but for the sake of my emotional well-being and my own relationship, I know I have to.

Why is it so damn fucking difficult to suppress my feelings for you?

There's this really cute girl I saw at a party and I don't know whether I should ask my friend about her, since he's her friend from his course. Then again I should have found a opportunity to talk to her that day. Should I?
-
 
I want to know what's the status between me and the guy I'm supposedly dating but I don't know how to broach this topic. (Point 1)

When it's just me and him, I can definitely feel the sparks and attraction. But when he's with his best friend or we're around my classmates, it's like...either he's being cold towards me(WHY DO GUYS BEHAVE THIS WAY AH? SOMEONE EXPLAIN PLS! Point 2) or I'm ignoring his presence deliberately (but this was in response to him being cold to me, I used to acknowledge him). 

The first few weeks, we used to heshohesho almost daily. But now, it's about once a fortnight and he regularly cancels on me. It feels like schoolwork is interfering between our relationship which is part of the reason why I don't want to be a bitch about the situation. I started feeling insecure after last night. He came, but I didn't and he didn't make sure I did either. I found this mildly humiliating and don't know whether I should continue investing myself in this relationship. (Point 3)

Any advice NUS Kakis? 
-
 
I hope this does not get filtered. It is pretty embarrassing though. It looks like everyone is getting attached and I have been, for the longest time, trying to find someone to invest into. (Honestly, I've even tried tinder.)  Btw, I am a girl.
I have dated but they never worked out. & my hormones are getting slightly out of control... but I do not want to get a fwb because of the emotional entanglement. Advice?

Is it true that love finds you and that you don't have to look for it?

I am an exchange student. I've had a few crushes back home as well as here but since I'm here for a short time, I didn't follow up. I'm ever-green, the main reason being I'm too picky with people and the one's I've liked haven't liked me back. But I'm losing patience now. At the same time, I don't want to look for it desperately as I believe that even if I do get success, it'll not be good for the long term. It's also that I don't know how to look for it. People say that you should learn to be happy with yourself first but it's so difficult sometimes when you're alone in your room. I have good friends back home and I've made a few nice ones here as well. But still, I don't have a go-to person with whom I can talk about whatever I like,with whom I can share my dreams and get intimate with. This is also affecting my performance in school as I sometimes fall wondering "Who am I doing this for?". Does anyone even care what grades I get or what I do with my life. A few odd days it really makes me depressed. I'm not too close to my family as I've been living outside for 3.5 years now and only visit them for a short time every year. Even when I talk to them, it's just the normal "How are you?", shortly after which the convo ends. I've had crushes before and I scored exceptionally high in high-school as I felt that I was doing it for someone that time. But now, I just don't have that motivation.

Please help!

I met this guy during my exchange semester in Europe. I did not notice him until the time I realized he is putting too much effort to talk to me. Although he has always been around we talked once or twice in the first weeks. later, after few more meetings and some time spent talking he started to touch my hand or hold it when talking.  I was ok with that  as on the one hand I thought that is a way for him to show that he likes me and on the other hand I was also developing some feelings towards him. He recently moved to another level of touching,like hugging and stuff which is still ok considering that he is European. However, today he put his hand under my sweater and started playing with my bra straps. I tried to move because I did not like it but he was holding too tight that i could not move. And all the time he had a very calm expression on his face-pretending that he is not doing anything and was keeping the conversation about random things.
I really need your advice, because I do not know  what are his intentions? and what should I do?

noticed there are a lot of guys asking about how to confess recently! I'm not sure how useful this will be, but at least you have a girl's perspective? Maybe if girls agree/disagree can also share your views.

for me usually what happens is I meet the guy, we communicate with each other via fb chat then whatsapp. this doesn't happen super often, maybe at the initial phase we text each other once every 2 days. sometimes people are busy so if there's no reply for 2-3 days maybe think about whether the other party is busy. however, if all seems good, after chatting a while, either I'll hint to the guy to ask me out, or he will make a casual suggestion to hang out. this is usually done in reference to some part of our conversation (e.g. girl wants to try this cafe, tell girl you've also wanted to try and ask if she wants to check it out together). if the girl says yes, this is a good sign. if the girl says no, maybe don't confess la. I know this part seems difficult, but by not asking directly "will you go on a date with me" at least it won't be so awkward for both parties, and you still get an idea of whether she's interested or not. if you don't try asking to just casually hang out, you really will never know. personally I'd much rather the guy ask me this way then confess straightaway which may seem a bit weird (sorry I don't mean to be judgmental but that's just how I feel).

if she agrees to go out with you, try to be aware of how the date is going. there have been dates I've agreed to go on which ended up in awkward silences, and there've also been some where we ended up having a really good time and making more plans! if you breach this final barrier where you're pretty confident she's having a good time with you because she doesn't mind hanging out with you one-on-one frequently, then maybe you can try your luck. but really, anything before this stage is a no-go.

actually not sure if this helps but TL;DR is - the most difficult and crucial step is actually asking her out in a casual way! good luck fellas (and girls too)!

So there's been something that's been bothering me for a while now. Previously, I was attached to this guy let's call him X. While I was together with him, I still went out for lunches / cafe outings with another guy, let's call him Y. X was aware and not exactly happy, especially since I met Y through Tinder. But I assured him nothing happened between us. Y was also kinda X's friend as they had met each other through a school program in the past. So I guess X didn't feel as pissed since Y was kinda his friend. But then the thing is Y would often make moves towards me, like attempt to hold my hand etc. However I never really let him hold until nearing the end of my relationship with X when we were fighting and on the verge of breaking up. After we broke up, Y somewhat pressured me into giving him a hand job. We were at his house watching movies then I went to take a nap, when I woke up he was holding my hand and like asking me if I wanted to do more. I was unwilling and he asked me to blow him, and like I felt bad??? because I kept saying I didn't want to and then he asked if he could eat me out. I didn't want that either, so in the end I compromised and told him I would give him a hand job, but then he wouldn't be allowed to touch me. So that happened. Afterwards I felt quite pissed about the whole thing because I didn't even want to do any of that, and I stopped talking to him for quite long. But now he has tried to initiate me to go out with him again, and I just give him the excuse that I'm busy with school. Should I just cut off all connections with him?

I'm not skinny, but not obese either. But ever since I got attached, I've put on another 5kg. My BF keeps assuring me that it's all right and I look fine and I'm not fat. But he always makes fun of people who plus sized and is always laughing at his (girl) friends, calling them fat and flabby, even though some of them are skinner than me. Isn't this like contradicting himself? So I'm actually fat in his eyes right. 
On top of that, he doesnt like me to exercise too. When I do, he'll complain why am I exercising, why did I go for a run and etc. And what's also quite disturbing is that recently, I've also noticed that he keeps looking at other girls when we are out on dates. He just won't stop looking and stealing glances at the girl next table while we were having our dinner just few days ago. Should I have confronted him about this? (So when we are not together, he'll have all the freedom to stare at all the girls he want to his heart content?!)
It's just making me feel so so insecure like that. And it just makes me feel as if it's the way I look that he would prefer looking at other girls. 

Someone enlighten me?

Dear K,

I can't believe that all these time I've let myself be vulnerable to everything you've done to me. 
In sad times, I'm sad with you.
In happy times, I'm happy with you.
In angry times, I'm angry with you.
In tough times, I rough it through with you.
No matter what you put me through, I stuck it out with you. But you chose to end it anyway.
You're not my first, and you won't be my last.. But I guess your last will be episode 16.

Farewell K-Drama.

This is probably a generalization. But in uni, it appears to me that guys are more genuine about friendships as compared to girls. Girls sometimes appear to make friends out of 'usefulness'. Like 'you're smart, ok I'd be your friend', 'I live in hall, no faculty friend, so I be your friend from faculty to do group projects together', 'That girl/guy is so creepy/nerdy/ socially awkward, I don't want to be his/her friend'. With girls, there is a lot of false pretense etc. If you aren't cool enough for them, they sometimes do not really want to talk to you. e.g. give one word replies, look at their phone when you are around and don't bother striking a conversation with you. But they kind of pretend to be your friend by saying hi to you(esp when their other friends are around), liking your Instagram post etc. Whereas for guys (while they sometimes do have the intention of getting to a girl's pants), if they sis-zone you and stuff they are like pretty genuine about the friendship, and sometimes the friendship seems less transactional. And they do take care of their friends and stuff. I'm pretty sure this is a generalization but I'm just tired of being a second option/used by other girls in uni.

Can anyone shared how it felt to reject a good friend? Do you feel guilty? Would you want to salvage the friendship if the other party is willing to do so? I am the rejected one. I am in such a dilemma. I just wanted my friend to stop feeling bad about it and while I want the friendship back, I do not know if we can be become what we used to be before. Did anyone's friendship become stronger after rejection?

How do I start talking to a guy from the same hostel as me? I see him around at times but we're not in any ccas or comms together (sadly), do not really have any mutual friends, etc. Could it be fate telling me that we're not meant to be? I do really want to at least try though. He is really cute! It's just I don't know how to do it so that it seems 'natural'. Any ideas?

I'm a 22 year old virgin. I've never tried it before not even once. But sometimes the temptation is just so difficult. How do you guys do it? My ex girlfriend wanted it but I didn't give it to her, and similarly, my hall mate wants it from me now. 

The only difference is that that time was 3 years ago and I was less curious, this time round I just can't resist the urge to, especially from a willing party. The only downside to this is that she has a boyfriend, whom she says refuses to penetrate her, thus her reasoning that I can do it in his place. The plan is for us to meet up for frequent sessions, 4 times a week? (Not sure if it's counted as frequent) and that we each get to pick two of the times/ days. 

However I should also mention that her boyfriend is my friend from JC, and on the other hand, she is a really hot, popular girl with a few thousand Instagram followers, and promised me a good time.

I haven't agreed with what she said yet, but she said we could try it once and if I like it, we could continue. What should I do? Should I give it a try? She said to give her my decision by Wednesday, all I need to do is knock.

guys i need help. I know a guy who keeps giving me eye contact, the really long type and its kinda obvious he's shy around me. He's always checking to see if i'm looking but when I look at him, he turns away. How do I make him brave enough to come talk to me ? He has such an open personality and is well liked by others but I don't know why he's so hesitant to approach me. I don't really know what's on his mind. Should I just wait for him to make the first move ? HELP

I have a problem that is plaguing me ever since I was in JC. I have this tendency to view every single girl that I interact with as a potential girlfriend, and because of this it seems that the girls that I interact with are somehow put off by me. It's not that I go around confessing my feelings to all of them, it's quite the opposite actually. I have never confessed to a girl before in my whole life because I don't know what to do after the confession and I am too shy and insecure to find it out by trial and error.

After being without a close female friend for so long, I have completely no clue what to talk about to the opposite sex, and many often times conversations with girls would just be us exchanging pleasantries with no real talk going on. Not even small talk, because I am apparently too social inept to find pleasure in that and that I have no idea what girls are into nowadays. And even if I do, conversations will be really fake because I have absolutely no interest in what they are saying, and I am only interested in getting a female friend/ potential girlfriend. I guess girls can pick up on this and they drift away from me as a result. Thus, most conversations with girls are awkward with silence almost being a guarantee. 

Anyway, recently I have decided that I really should get a girlfriend, due to the fact that I am graduating next semester and from what I heard working life is really difficult for you to find a spouse. It doesn't help that I am from engineering and most likely I will become an engineer next time. Well, I guess you could say I am getting a little desperate.

So for all you popular with ladies bros out there, mind telling some of your secrets with the ladies? Girls feel free to give input as well as to what do you normally talk to guys about.

To , I can't say you won't ever get into argument because I've never experienced that before. However, I can offer some advice in the event that you do get into an argument.
In my previous relationship, both my ex and I had little or no experience with handling arguments before. We would either just get angry at each other and eventually leave the matter without a resolution, or we'd just keep the issue to ourselves and let our feelings slowly build up. Obviously this didn't solve any of our issues, and ultimately led to the end of our r/ship.
After that experience, I realised that an argument, if resolved properly, could (most likely) strengthen your r/ship and help the both of you to grow together. I am currently with my partner of six months as well and we've argued more times than I can count. Little arguments, big arguments... everything. But I feel even closer to my partner than before. I feel like I'm rambling on now so I'll just give some general dot-point advice:
1. When in an argument, emotions tend to run high and if you feel like you're gonna say something mean, just tell your partner you need some alone time to cool down. But be sure to tell them when you're ready to talk again.
2. If you're the type to clam up when you're upset (like me), try not to. Especially if your partner is also that type. You won't be able to work through issues if you don't talk! If you're really upset, see , but just don't clam up.
3. Even when you're arguing, show you care for your partner. Make sure they took their medications or have enough food or whatever. After all, your partner is the one you may potentially share your life with.
4. When you have arguments you might feel like giving up easily. DON'T! You need to systematically work through whatever it is without the "break up" mentality in your head. Sometimes you need to compromise so be open minded.
These are really general points that might not apply to everyone and every situation, and the best way to learn is really experiencing it for yourself. Don't be afraid of arguments but rather, embrace them and handle them carefully. All the best :)

After getting rejected by my crush, she is behaving cranky and weird. We already agreed to be friends minus the awkwardness. Yes I feel bad but I will feel even worse if I lose the friendship. Can ladies pls share some light what is she thinking?

Is she avoiding me/not replying my texts cos she feels bad about rejecting me? I already plan on telling her that I don't really feel that bad with her rejecting me and she already made it clear that she wants to be friend and I would not have not romantic interests towards her. So stop acting weird around me!! I should be the one embarrassed and awkward man.

Hi, a few months ago, I made a post on my friendship ().
I thought I have got over it, moved on and went on with my life.
However, yesterday as my birthday, and I received a text from me wishing me a good birthday. I replied thank you and there were no further texts from him.
Since that text yesterday, I was again plunged into the valley of depression. He is the one who started to downgrade me first. Why did he text me again after such a long period of no communication.
In fact, the period of no communication, not seeing each other did not even effect him at all; which is evident that I am perhaps only a acquaintance or even a network to him. Otherwise, he would not have texted so nonchalantly. He would have asked me how I was, especially since I, who once texted, emailed and communicated with him very frequently, abstained from all the communication such a long time. It just shows that he did not care. It upsets me a lot. I have seen him as my best friend. And yet, after 6 years of friendship, 6 years of weekly lunches and heart to heart communication, to him I am not even a close friend.
I cannot walk out of this feeling of melancholy, of rejection, of low self-esteem etc. I do not know what to do. And about 3 weeks later, it would be his birthday and I am in a dilemma to wish him happy birthday or not.

Anybody has toxic family members? I have. Two infact. Both hate each other and one is relatively closer to me (in terms of family tree) and the other is a bit further. Both toxic in terms that they will hurt you and tell you off and be all nice the next minute when they realise they need you or they realise they already pissed you off. Yesterday i got told off for something that i didnt do/ was trying to help in doing some stuff. It doesnt help that i have nobody to turn to (note that i am not singaporean) and the people closest to me aren't here with me... even if they are here i bet nobody will believe me because they are very good at acting and covering their craziness. 

I hope for a day where i can have a family of my own, where i can go back to a home that is warm without all these toxicity because its getting to me and my temper is getting worse.

So I'm in a steady relationship with my gf for about 6 months already and we have not gotten into any fights or major arguments yet. My friends told me that in a relationship sure will have fights or arguments one. It is possible that a couple will not get into any fights or arguments? Worried because I'm not sure what will happen to us if we get into a fight or major argument and I'm afraid of losing her.

Is a lack of deep/sustained conversation a problem in a relationship? My girlfriend and I can't seem to talk about any deep/interesting topics and I find it quite frustrating sometimes. We don't really have a lot of common interests too. Any advice?
-
 
I am a guy and I  need serious help. I am madly infatuated with a female colleague. Even she has strongly hinted to me that she is not interested in me, I still cannot get over her. I would still stalk her on FB and look for her pictures once in a while. I know I really should stop this but I cannot get her out of my head. 

What should I do? 
-
 
To  I am not sure why you would vehemently reject so many guys, because of them being your friend. I guess my opinion remains, my opinion, but it is that to be a gf/bf, you probably have to be at least friends first and to click on a level much greater than other friends you have. Well the thing is, I don't see how you would reject someone whom would like you when it is a friend, does that mean you would like someone who likes you without not knowing someone better first? That implies the exact immature mindset that belies your basis of choices which determine the very reason you would like the bad boys, coz they are obviously better at getting girls' attention. I fail to see how you would totall rule out your pool of friends as potential suitors, considering you would know them a lot better than someone whom you would have just met like at the club or something. I think you should go back and reflect on this at least, if you are lesbian, then I guess there's nothing to discuss here... 
-
 
To OP of  Hi, your post sounds exactly like my situation, except that I'm a girl. In my opinion, you might want to think again if you really love her as a potential girlfriend, or you just have a crush on her because she can understand you. It's not a good idea to confess now because it is more likely that your judgement could be incorrect when you're feeling down. You could probably be just be attracted to her because she's the first person whom you opened up your emotions to. Nevertheless, you can always try spending more time with her (for example studying together, going for lunches...).Take it slow. Don't scare her off because even if you two can't be a couple, you can still be best friends with her! :)
-
 
I think for a guy to confess to a girl, you really need to have the mental preparation that you have at least 80% chance of getting rejected ( for many reasons or may be she is attached) and 20% chance of getting accepted. However, this is not to say you should not attempt to confess. I have friends who got rejected countless times but eventually they still get attached. It requires lots of patience as well as a positive mind set. I have already got rejected close to 10 times ever since I started confessing to my crushes over the last 4 years. Getting rejected hurts a lot but trust me it is temporary only. At least you can move on with life.

It's nearing the end of Week 10. Assignments are piling up, and the pressure to start studying for finals whilst trying to practice coding and complete exercises due every week is making me feel so overwhelmed. I had a similar experience in JC as well, where I had an anxiety attack and suffered from mild depression for a while. I fear that I might be having a relapse of the attack again soon. Sometimes, I find myself paralyzed with fear and the voices in my head keep telling me I'm useless, I'll never make it, and it's starting to get to me. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from having a relapse again?
-
 
To , I'd like to disagree. We get better with practice with most things but I feel that dealing with rejection isn't one of them. I've confessed and gotten rejected more times than I care to count but it gets harder every time. I can feel my self esteem getting chipped away with each rejection and after so many times, it's hard not to feel like I'm some sort of damaged goods who's unworthy of affection.

it was my birthday the other day and my bf of 1 year plus simply wrote me a card with poor planning of activities that day which ended up with me planning during that day itself... despite the fact that i have told him i wanted something semi-special since its my birthday for weeks in advance... he said he did but the results... not really want him to spend alot money but just the thought and effort would have suffice but... now, everytime i think back i just feel... p.s i planned a special day out for his birthday (his birthday is before mine) does not help with the fact when i see other bfs planning so much for their gf birthday...

I have heard lots of stories of how guys only go for girls based on looks. Here is what I am experiencing right now. For the past few months, I am facing lots of difficulties in life due to many life changing events and started feeling very negative. However, being socially awkward, I have very little friends and have no one to turn to. There were many times that I feel helpless. It was until this semester that I find myself confiding my problems to this girl and her and patience really make me feel a lot better emotionally. I started developing a crush on her as I feel that I can connect to her emotionally. Should I confess to her? I am afraid I may be a burden to her and will people judge if she is dating a needy guy?

To OP of  

Hey, I feel you! In fact, I submitted a similar confession a few months ago about how I attended a camp but failed to make any really good friends, and that I found it hard to click with my OG mates, but it was not posted. Not the point here though. 

Like you, I am very bothered with it, even till now. However, due to my introvert personality, I understand that I am really not a 'camp' person. I attended that camp just to try stuff beyond my comfort zone and hopefully, to make new friends. I definitely tried a lot of new stuff during the camp. Some of my OG mates were nice enough to talk to me, and I even clicked off quite well with some. However, I found it really hard to click with the girls as they seem to have their own clique already, and because I don't spend much time with them for personal reasons, they saw me as this 'very quiet girl'. Subsequently, I didn't manage to make any friends close enough whom i can even ask out for lunch (I tried though, but it was awkward for the other party.)

At first, I felt that i must have done something wrong and gave myself a lot of stress in making new friends. However, I feel that, from the start, my character is not even suitable to be in camps, and that it is sort of not surprising that i don't make any. I joined a CCA which i enjoy and made close friends whom i really treasure. Just wanna press you on and tell you not to give up. If you feel that attending hall and camp activities give you more stress than enjoyment, then i feel that maybe, your character just don't suit them or click with them. Don't force yourself then. There are many other ways for you to make friends. If you tried really hard but that dun work out, then just forget about it, try new ways. Also, you may want to reconsider the way you approach people - is it too awkward for them? Sometimes, i think i tried too hard to act like i was close with them, i feel that this had a backfire effect which made others felt uncomfortable. Go slow and steady! Furthermore, it is only the first semester! Who knows, maybe next week, or even next semester, you can meet really close friends. 

Also, OP, i feel that i may know you and you may be the OG mate whom i clicked off well with LOL. Even if you are not, maybe we can know each other soon if fate allows and confide to each other about such problems. (: Just want to let you know what you are not alone!

This is an advice to all engin guy yeah! I noticed that engin guys especially have a very high inertia when it comes to approaching the girl he likes. They can tell their friends about how interested he is but not the girl herself. Even though in this current age, it's acceptable for girls to approach guys but hey many girls still prefer the oher way round. So before you complain about not having a gf, reflect if you made an effort in pursuing someone, of course with the person knowing that she is being pursued. At most get rejected but it's a learning process. 
-
 
I kind of like this girl and we've been on great talking terms. I have lunch alone with her often but i heard she does this with other guys too. I'm really quite interested but i dont dare to chase her as she already has 3 guys chasing her... Whenever she notices that a guy is chasing her and she doesnt have similar feelings for the guy, she would slowly push them away and slowly cut all connections/ignore the guy. One thing im glad is that she actually "confides" in me about which guy is chasing her that she doesnt like. However, im afraid to chase and eventually confess as i might end up like the rest of the guys and we cant even be friends anymore. Also, she's pretty, tall, slim and rich while im just an average guy with average height and wealth... Oh damn, help :( 
-
 
3 more weeks to go, but I feel sad about it. It means that I only left 3 more weeks to see him. We are from different majors so chance of us taking the same module next sem is very low. I tried to ask him out before but failed, now I have no courage to ask him again. I don't know how he feels towards me, so I am not sure whether he will take initiatives or sth. I don't want the feelings between us just fade away, but, what can I do if he doesn't feel the same way as I do. Sigh.

Does anyone self-harm at this age? Ive done it and also abstained for awhile... I don't know why I should stop ):

So this week will be my first time going to a club with some classmates, I don't dare to tell them it's my first time because I'm afraid of what they might do. Can anyone tell me what to expect? Drinking games? Or just dancing all night? 
-
 
I broke up with my ex who is kinky, horny and willing to do all sorts of things with me to try and chase this one innocent, pure and 'my ideal type' of girl. I think some of you guys out there will think I'm crazy haha. I hope all goes well with this special girl who managed to turn my head~

Reading all those 'pornographic' posts about 'blow jobs', 'liquid spew out' and all, i am totally stunned. I am an evergreen and i have to admit that i am rather ignorant in such things. I am mind blown. How can you guys and girls have such intense s** so early when you aren't even sure if she/he is the right one? Some of you are even doing it with your friend/people whom you just know. How will your future/current partner think of you when you grow older and find your true love? Even if he/she don't find out, how do you even face him/her with a clear conscience? I am rather conservative and no, I won't do it - for the sake of my future partner. I sincerely hope that 'he' will not be like you guys/girls too, and that he will leave his first time for me. 

I don't know if i sound too god-like or ignorant here, but I feel that I should leave s** till i am really very sure that he will be my life partner. Don't be too surprised though - although i dun watch porn, i often imagine such things too. I just feel that I should curb such desires for the sake of my future partner.

I hope this post can be posted on the page as, although my story may sound very trivial, it has been bugging me for years. I feel that I am losing out in 2 important friendships of mine. I am confused. I really dun like the fact that i am thinking that i am losing out as it made me feel like i am a petty and sensitive person. 

During secondary school, I used to have a very close friend (my classmate for sec 3 and 4) and another group of rather close friends from different classes (we know each other since sec 2). Let's call the very close friend A, and the other group of close friends B. Most of my recess and lunch breaks were spent with these 2 parties. However, during secondary 4, I tend to spend more time with A as A experienced some problems with the class. This led me to drift away from B. On top of it, during my last year, I spent most of my breaks for the coursework, which left me with lesser time for B, since A had very little close friends and I had to admit that I felt obliged to spend more time with her. Furthermore, it was true to some extent that I clicked better with A as time proceeded. I am not sure whether it was because of more time spent with A, or simply because of better chemistry shared with A.  

 After the O's, A went overseas to study and I have never see A since then. We can only maintain our relationship through video call. As the years pass, although it is not explicitly said, the number of times we both made an effort to video call decreased gradually, and I am aware that our friendship isn't as close as before. The last time we talked, all I wanted to chat was about the mundane stuff (school stuff), but A seemed to be unimpressed and repeatedly prompted me to chat about more interesting stuff. This was unlike in the past where we could chat about the most mundane stuff under the sky for hours. However, I am aware that she MAY still see me as a close friend (may not be top of the list now, but still close enough to entertain me right after I SOSed her during a very bad day although she was not physically there for me). 

Regarding party B - I broke contact with them for about one year, but made the initiative to talk to them again after 1 year of no contact. It was awkward at first, since the current people in party B are already very close and have developed a chemistry. In fact, I am very jealous of them. I always want to return to the times where we can be as close, but it seems that it is very hard. It seems that the moment i chose to spend more time with A over B, I have sort of given up my friendship with B to some extent. However, it seems that my sincerity paid off - members of B start to gradually accept me again, starting off with one member who frequently chatted with me, and gradually, the others took the initiative to ask me out. Party B members were so close that they went on an overseas trip together and gave surprise birthday parties to each other, which I am offended and sour of as I was always excluded. However, they made the effort to buy a gifts for me from that overseas trip, and from their respective individual overseas trip. 

The sad thing is that, I sort of lost my temper to the member whom i was closer to in party B a few months ago as the member neglected our appointment which i was looking forward to. Being already very sensitive that I couldn't join into their good chemistry and trip, I lost myself that day. The member felt very bad afterwards and apologised numerous times, and I felt very bad too as it wasn't easy to be comfortable with each other again. Things got awkward AGAIN, and now, the whole of party B is drifting away from me again. 

I feel that i am losing out now. Like, if i dun spend so much time on A, i could have maintained a very good relationship with B till now. Furthermore, I have to admit that, since members of B are studying in Singapore, I really need them more than A as they are the ones who can be physically there for me, meet me and listen to my woes, give me birthday surprises etc. Also, B members share more common identity (we are locals) and interests with me which i really hope A can have, but it isn't the case. I really hate myself for thinking this situation in such a selfish manner.

If you kinda like him then learn to reciprocate. He has been initiating for 2 months do you not think he would be weary? Of course, everyone is very occupied with their busy schedules right now. If you really want to progress further with him, you will naturally want to make time for him. The fact that you'll make time for him if he ask you out yet is unwilling to ask him out instead probably just mean that you are not willing to give him the time he is willing to give to you. Balance is important in a relationship. It can't be always one party contributing.

I do not like this module I'm taking. It's to do with gnitekram. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the professor and her tutor (the one is teaching me) are both rather.. oily personalities. I can't describe it. It's just, the image I get in my head is that of brilliantly colored eels with bared fangs. If they bit you, you'd know it but you wouldn't be able to catch them because they'd constantly slip out of your grasp. Why am I taking this module, you may ask? Because it fulfills one of my requirements so I didn't want to drop it and waste a semester.
You people might just be like, 'cool story', but I feel really uncomfortable.
I don't know, I just needed to rant. And don't tell me I'm being imaginative or overly sensitive or that I should go talk to them. Heaven forbid!

Is it normal for a NUS student to have a so-called ah lian girlfriend/partner? Please don't filter this post out, as potential advice that can be given is at stake here.

I met her through Tinder, I swiped right of course as she was really hot. She's 2 years younger, but isn't really working, she just lazes around and works part time for those on-and-off jobs that lasts a month or two. I have been working part time, together with studying to bring her out on dates and all as she's broke half the time, always spending whatever money she musters on cigarettes.

She has a big history as well. She admitted that she had over 23 guys penetrated her, and that the first time she did it was when she was 16 (i think), if so, counting, she had 23 partners/bf/stranger i dont even dare to ask for the past 4 years. She also admitted that out of the 23, 5 of them did it with her unprotected (she took pills) whilst the rest used condoms. But this all doesn't include the number of people she had petting/oral with. I asked her why she enjoyed all this and she replied that it is normal for her too. I think I am getting influenced.

Since we met 6 months ago, we've had sex for about 30 times already, but im beginning to reconsider whether am i truly in love with her or if it is just lust. She is extremely good at pleasing me on the bed. She blows me like no other girl did, and she rides my cock just so well, she lets me blow it onto her face, her chest and onto her clothes. Furthermore, she said she trusted me and she proved it with words. Excluding the number of times we had sex alone, we've had about 7 other times with her other friends, sometimes threesome, some group, at her house, chalets etc. She even let me meet up with her girlfriends (whom i met at these sessions) for private sex as she said she didnt mind as we are still exclusive to each other. The number of blowjobs, penetration that i've got and done in the past 6 months has been great. I've managed to fulfill my wildest dreams.

However I am thinking twice now as to whether or not this is someone suitable for me in the long term. I believe that a more stable partner who's in uni as well may potentially be more suitable for me. I just hope for a sweet innocent girlfriend.

I'm a girl and have been attached to a wonderful guy for a few years now. We are going well and I'm very happy. But sometimes I dream about other guys and get into a relationship with them in my dream and I always wake up feeling very guilty... Last night was one such night. Anyone gets dreams like that too?

First semester into year 1 has been an utter disappointment. I got into the hall I wanted and all the camps I applied for. But till date, with sem 1 coming to a close in a few weeks time, I have yet to find true friends, the ones who would be there for me when I need them. I've been actively participating in my hall activities and I also know quite a lot of people in my faculty, but through it all, these were just people I got to know, and not friends. People who I got close to in hall at first made me feel like I could at least feel at home, but they eventually took me for granted and only came to me when they needed things. It wasn't like that for me in secondary school or jc, but for the first time, I feel really alone. I don't need that many friends, but I just need a few I could count on. Is it that hard to find?

I frequent clubs about once every week and through the few yrs I've been clubbing  I've made out with countless guys, on average about 1 every week.  Well some flings are repeat flings so maybe the absolute number is not that bad. 

To me making out at clubs is very normal.  I'm single by the way so I don't see any issue with my moral compass.  However some people have spotted me behaving inappropriately and are spreading rumours about me.  I find it weird actually as I have always thought it is a no-brainer the stuff like that happens at clubs.  In a sense,  what is so peculiar about my actions? 

I honestly don't believe anyone who clubs frequently but doesn't admit they have made out with anyone ever before.  If that is true then they are totally missing out on a huge part of the fun.

I was rejected. I really thought maybe we stood a chance. I really thought so because we enjoy each other company (or so I thought). She just walk into my bubble that easily without effort. You could say bird of the same feathers flock together. I was disappointed and sad. I don’t know if we could still be friends. I don’t think I can take it if she talks about other guys. I really really hope we still can be platonic friends. I might need some time off her. I am bummed about the rejection but it is not really bad. I just feel so sad that she do not feel the same way I feel for her. I do not regret for my decision to confess because sooner or later I have to do it. I need answers. I need to know the status of our relationships and not think constantly whether it is hanging-out or a date.  I really hate falling in love. Nothing good has ever come out of it. I hate the feeling of being super happy one day and depressed the next day. Can’t love be simpler, be less painful?

I am a very introverted person so there are not many girls who could come into my life so easily. I feel really so bad and confused now. I want to break contact with her because I know I will be hurt knowing that I might expect something more than a friendship in the future. But I still want her as a friend because I can say anything to her.  

Why is it so hard to find someone who love each other?

Recently I've been emotionally, mentally and physically exhausted due to personal problems and just plain lack of sleep. As a result, I've not been as outgoing as I usually am. I also feel like some of my acquaintances now have a different opinion of me- they seem more.. wary, I guess. I trust my intuition, but I can't really pinpoint what is wrong. Is my change in behavior the only reason they would be like this? If you were one of them, what exactly would be the thoughts that run through your mind? Please help! Thank you.

Has anyone gotten that great feeling where you knew you helped someone much? 

Once, my friend was crying as she caught her boyfriend cheating on her, and I happened to be nearby and heard her. After finding out what happened I decided to help her. 

I let her give me a blowjob whilst I sucked her vagina, which was the next best option as she said her boyfriend wouldnt like it if I penetrated her. I ejaculated all over her clothes. However Im not sure if she's still with him as she has been rather secretive recently. We've still been meeting up for petting and oral but I didnt ask about him fearing that I would lose my chance to help her out. However I still see pictures of him on her instagram, what should i do?

To  from 

Everyone is different, and every couple has their own ways to deal with problems. Mine worked out because I chose to be completely open, as my partner and I value communication and honesty as the foundation of our relationship. Maybe you should talk to your boyfriend properly about why he felt the need to hide it in the first place? It could be a symptom of a bigger problem such as insecurity in the relationship or a lack of openness. The important thing is to talk about both his and your emotions, work things out together and find a solution you both can accept. If you two don't resolve this issue properly, it is bound to come up again and fester like a infected wound.

To be happy in life, we should not pride ourselves too hard on chasing material goals (getting rich, buying a nice car etc.) Ask yourself this: How do you know if you will become truly contented with what you have even if one day you do attain success in terms of career and wealth? The concept of happiness can be really simple, it can be as mundane as wiping your ass after you take a dump and realising that there's no residue left behind. And yes, if you one day manage to attain my level of understanding of life, do drop a confession and let me know. I would totally appreciate it.

So, I've been feeling pretty down these few weeks because I think my crush does not seem to be liking me back. :( We met through one of our mutual classes this semester and we actually have each other's numbers and fb now. But the thing is, I'm not sure if he just sees me as a friend/classmate, or if he likes me but is shy to approach. Also, he seems like a really popular guy in school and has many friends, but from what I observed most of his friends are guys and i get the impression that he doesn't talk to girls a lot. (Though I could be wrong, since we aren't exactly close friends now) 
Are sociable guys also shy to the person they like? Next week is our last lesson together. Do you guys think it is a good idea to try asking him out to study after next week? At least I can be more sure if he likes/does not like me back and focus on studying after that, and things also won't be so awkward if he rejects, since we have no more classes together.

Hi everyone, 

I need some advice. I've broken up with my bf 2 months ago and i stopped texting totally, except for an apology letter i sent to him which i indicated i want to patch up. Recently, he initiates conversations with me (which is an improvement because he ignored me totally when we ended it). However, when i reply normally, he gives one lined answers or uninterested replies. When i end the conversation, he initiates one the next day. 

I'm really confused. Why initiate conversations when its been so recent and then give me generic answers when i'm trying to talk normally? Yet initiates conversations when i end the conversation? His messages are also spreaded out, like he will read it and reply few hours later, up to 13 hours later. Is there a chance to patch up? Or is he trying to be funny? He isn't a guy that would play with peoples's feelings.

To  and 

My boyfriend also had a dark past but he hid it from me. I found out myself. He said he hid it because he didn't think I would accept him for it. Is it a red flag if he hid it from me in the first place? Instead of coming clean.

I took a FASS mod this semester (I'm from a different faculty). There was this guy in my tutorial project group who turned out to be really nice and easy-going, and I'd definitely want to know him better. However my tutorial sessions ended already and there is no more chance to see him D: Even though I have his number (cuz of the project), I don't know how to begin the conversation or anything :( Any advice?
-
 
So, I have taken a business mod this sem. We had group presentations today, and a Q&A session after. You know the drill. Anyway, I was trying to help them so I asked them a question I knew they would have prepared for. But then the tutor kind of misinterpreted it in a way that suited her own opinion. She started really attacking the 'weak spots' of their presentation, all while mentioning my name. Her criticism was so harsh that they couldn't answer. And their presentation wasn't that bad, even. 
Now I have a feeling they kind of blame me. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal to most of you, but is there anything I can do to make things better?

Hi there, im the op of . Yes actually im afraid of how they would respond towards it. Im not sure if they have an issue with it. But I think they sort of suspect that I'm dating someone. My mum told me to focus on my studies cum work instead of getting into a rs now but I feel like giving this rs a chance. It's because of what my mum said which made me afraid of telling them about this rs. I know this may sound kiddish or ridiculous but this is one of my more serious rs so im very confused.

A guy asked me out a few times for movie, jogging and other similar interests and texted me about stuff other than group projects. I got to know him better over the past 2 months and now I kind of like him. However, I am feeling sad because he doesn't text me so often anymore or initiate dates nowadays. Does it mean he doesn't like me after getting to know me more or he was never romantically interested in the first place, wanted to be friends only and got scared that I may like him? I wonder if he is too busy but then I think that I have a busy life too but if he asked me out, I would still manage my schedule in such a way that I can spend time with him. Any advice on what I should do?

Hi people, my crush whom I have known for around 2 months rejected me and we both agree that we should stay as friends. We got along really well and have went for outing/dinners alone before and that is also why I thought maybe I stood a chance. But now that I think of it, 2 months is really short and she has all the reasons to reject me. 

I want to keep the mentality of really just having her as a friend because I think she really understands me but I am afraid of developing feelings towards her. Do you guys know any girls who rejected guy at first but grow to like them after they started to know more and more about the guy?

I have a problem. 

I am slightly above average in looks while my boyfriend is average if not below average as he has quite a bad skin problem. I have no issues with that per se  but I feel awkward whenever he says that I am the prettiest in his eyes. I want to return him the compliment but I would be lying if I did that.  He is a great guy,  sure,  but he triumphs in other aspects.   How do I be truthful yet not hurt his feelings?  Do I avoid the topic of looks altogether?

I made a new friend in a module that i was taking alone. We spoke mostly about school stuff and we hardly talk about other things out of the module. Recently, he started talking to me about things other than lecture content. Which is totally fine btw cuz i think he just wanna know me better as a friend and all. However I kept getting the feeling that he is interested in me. And i may be right because just yesterday, he asked me out for lunch. So i dont know if i am thinking too  much into this or what. I'm attached btw but I never had the chance to tell him that because the topic never came up! (we mostly talked about lecture stuff rmb!) How should i casually let him know the fact that i am attached and not embarrass him (or myself; cuz what if he is not interested in my after all) too much ?

All these posts about finding the love of your life makes me want to post about mine. I was a couple of years out of NUS when I exited a seemingly stable relationship. Needless to say, it was heartbreaking yet liberating. But what I picked up from there was that nothing could be certain, and when people change, things fall apart. 

I knew my current girlfriend through a dating app (not Tinder). It was on this bored afternoon when I had just downloaded it out of boredom, and started swiping, at first not even knowing what kind of app it was. I thought..it was probably many ah bengs and ah lians like the 90s irc/icq times. However, I was wrong. And the 10 plus or so girls I spoke to were fine and mature people, with quite a few grads from our local Us.

My girlfriend and I hit off really well from the start. We chatted day and night, and sent snapshots of our lives to each other. It was like this best friend I had never met, and we soon took to Whatsapp. Naturally, I was also cautious, and I didn't want to get too close. What if we met in real life, and couldn't click like we did online? It did eventually come to the point where it would appear rude if I did not ask her out.

And so I did, and she agreed.

The first time we met, I was excited but mentally prepared that things might not work in the romantic way, and that things could fall flat. What would happen then to those little <3 emoticons that peppered our online conversations? 

Thankfully that didn't happen, and initial silence turned into meaningful conversation as we bonded over our past loves and dreams of the future. It was as though I knew her for a long time, and dates followed. It was only 2 weeks later when I asked her to be my girl, only because it felt so right to do so. 

Time together was effortless, and we both found comfort in each other's company. We also shared the same goals and priorities in life which was a huge plus. One plus year on, and we are going strong. Soon, we'll be embarking on our next stage of life together.

So my juniors, especially those who are 'evergreen', let nature take its course, as I truly believe that there is someone for everyone. One should not try too hard to make things happen, and if you have to, then perhaps it is not the best person. However, it is also important to put yourself out there, place yourself in new circles, on new paths, and you may be surprised with what you can find.

Never once would I have imagined finding a partner through a dating app, but I'm glad I did, and so did she. It would be a darn interesting story to tell our kids next time.

Hi people pls help.
My crush ask me two week ago to confirm if I want to go to an place with her friends this week. I told her I am fine and block out these two days (not that I have a lot of events happening). Today she told me her friends don’t want to go so maybe the event have to be postponed. I feel upset.  Is it reasonable? I know that it is not her fault but I still feel bad. I have been looking forward to it. Would I seem petty if I told her that I know its not her fault but I will still go whether or not she is coming. Pls advise.

I feel like a terrible person. I always promise girls orgasms through sexting and all, but when we eventually meet up for the real thing, I find it really difficult to go down on her. This is because during my overseas exchange last sem, I got badly traumatized in a one night stand when the girl asked me to go down on her and it tasted so fishy and nasty. Ever since then, I had developed a phobia of oral sex. I am even paranoid of how my penis smells after intercourse. Can someone please tell me that not all pussies smell bad? Like what most ppl here say, a guy who does not provide does not deserve. I really hope to eradicate my darkest fears of giving oral sex to a female.

To OP of , how long ago in the past was the guy's history? If it was quite some time ago you might want to consider if he's changed his ways. Even if most guys who engage in casual intimacy are quite open about their exploits, they tend to hide it from girls they are romantically interested in as they know it is quite likely a deal-breaker. The fact that he has come clean with you means that he's trusting you with the decision whether you can accept him or not. Everyone has their own dark past but it shouldn't be allowed to hang over the future. Maybe he's decided to end all that unhealthy behaviour and commit to you now?

Whatever your decision is, I hope you can keep both yours and his emotions in mind and do what you're most comfortable with.

To OP of , That guy that you have described isn't me. My "intended recipient" saw my confession and gave me one hell of a time... Girls crying in front of me will always be my ultimate weakness.
I had no choice but to spill out the beans. Truthfully speaking,  my days are numbered. I have contracted a disease that will make my body weaker and weaker, day by day. In a few years time I will lose my strength to stand and to even speak! Being evergreen, she is the first girl that I hit up on so well. Maybe it's because of karma that forbids me from spending the rest of my life with her. I have discarded the cowardly thoughts of disappearing mysteriously from her life. I pray to God that he will give me more time to watch over my cry baby. Even though I can't reach till the end, just a little while longer will do =).

Well. On your side, do cherish that guy ok! Peace be upon you.

I'm not sure if its just me, but why is it that so many singaporean boyfriends are soooo unromantic?? Receiving cards and letters are so rare nowadays. My boyfriend brings me out to the occasional cafe but only after me saying "baby can we go to xx." He doesn't actively bring me out, preferring to play dota instead. And this seems to be a trend among my friends' boyfriends as well. I mean my boyfriend is sweet and loyal but a spontaneous trip to the zoo or receiving the occasional flower and something handmade would be nice.

Hey there! Confused person seeking relationship advice here. I have been dating this guy for about 4+ months now and I find that we click rather well in terms of character and how he treats me. But I have a problem which is bringing up this relationship to my parents. He is of a different race from me but I don't think my parents see that as an issue. But it's just that I do not know how to bring it up to them regarding us. Hope I would be able to get some advice from others! Thanks in advance.

Why are people whom confess about their lack of interest in their SO getting so much flak :( I think once you're getting constantly frustrated with your SO, it just shows you lost the spark, or it was never the right fit in the first place, and dragging it out won't do the both of you any good. 
Obviously, you need to try to make it work, but if you can't even dredge up any feelings for him other than guilt, then there's nothing to work with already. Don't be stuck in a dying relationship trying to think it's all good if you force yourself to stay, that just resorts in an unhappy marraige/life. Being in a rs is a chance to explore life together, and if it doesn't work, then don't force it to.
Its not about whether you're mean or that you're being unnecessarily fussy (although, please learn to keep expectations in order) , you're just trying to find a right fit. And although it may seem harsh to those being dumped, it's better than realising down the road that your partner feels no commitment to you at all.

I have been noticing this really cute girl this semester on bus 151 on most wednesdays and thurdays mornings. She is always with her tall friend and i am captivated by her smile. As almost the same group of people normally takes this bus route to FOE, if you ever read this post, drop a smile my way so i know i wouldn't be silly to approach you out of the blue.

I have posted several BGR posts before and most people agreed the girl was giving a lot of hints. I confessed and she said she hope we could remain friends. I was crushed. I really feel so sad now. I really want to believe she is clueless that she is leading me on with all the occasional dinners/texting/going out . But with all the teasing from friends, how could she be?

For proper closure, should I talk to her about it? The first girl i ever like enough to confess has rejected me:(. But still i did not regret confessing to her. hopefully one day i will meet someone who will treasure me

I recently met this guy through mutual friends and he has had this girlfriend for 7 years. 

However the first time I met him I already noticed he kept looking at me and was very interested in talking to me.   I found it weird but I dismissed  it as him just being friendly since it was clear everyone at the gathering was attached. 

Then later on true enough at the end of the night,  he asked for my number which I gave to him as I didn't know how to reject (because well after a night of chatting he can be considered a friend right??) So I gave him my number. 

He then began texting me things such as telling me he wish he met me before he met his girlfriend and that he thinks I'm very attractive and his dream girl.  I've been replying his messages as I am the sort who feels obliged to reply and find messaging quite harmless anyway.  But also to be honest, I am flattered and to some extent enjoy the attention I'm getting even though I'm already taken. 

I'm not interested in that guy but somehow feeling coveted still feels good though I don't know if any bit of what that guy says it's true. 

I feel rather guilty about this though as I have a loving boyfriend and know that flirting,  even through text messages,  is not quite right.  I'm in a dilemma whether to stop.  I am afraid that my desire to feel desired could destroy my relationship.

I feel you. I have always thought I can meet my significant other on Tinder but I have always hesitate as people will think I am despo, I have given up, those kind of embarrass things. Furthermore, I don't think it is easy to find your significant other on tinder, not as easy as what most of us think as people can be spoilt by choice on tinder. I admit I am very desperate to get into a relationship given how hard it is for guys to find their significant others these days but look like I will not trust Tinder at least or now.

This is a weird question but... What is a normal amount of text messages people get in a day?

Sometimes I see my friends' phones going off with so many whatsapp messages, even if it's mostly group chats. I on the other hand can not receive any whatsapp notifications for 2 hours...

Will any guy like a girl that doesnt like wearing skirts/dresses/clothes that are very girly? Im a girl that dont feel comfortable dressing up very girly-ish and I'm wondering if it's part of the reason why not a single guy has ever been interested in me. Well, yeah i know i dont have the pretty face and slim body also la, but yeah, just curious.

Is it just me being surrounded by guys or are those few girls in ME really pretty? Not because they're the minority but they're actually pretty irl. Or ME3 girls, that is. They could be at least above average in FASS. 

One thing about ME is that these girls are always in their cliques of guys that I don't even know how to approach them! There's a cute short hair girl in my lab group but we din even have the chance to talk, and I only got to know her name from stalking the attendance sheet. Any tips for ME guys to know these girls?

I've known guy friends who are players, like they do intimate stuff with random girls to satisfy themselves. I'm okay with that and I still think they are awesome friends. I've never considered them romantically though, because I just don't. Recently, another guy who I've been friends with for quite some time confessed to me, and I do like him as well. He then became honest with me about his past, like how he did many intimate stuff with many various girls. At first, I felt indifferent and was like "oh okay". But slowly, I'm feeling disgusted. I thought I'll be fine with it, but it's been weighing heavily in my mind and I recoil slightly at the thought of him. We haven't established any status because we agreed we should think more carefully before committing into a relationship.

I was always into the "we should give people second chances" mantra, but now I'm finding it extremely hard to practise this and I know/feel I'm a hypocrite. It's great that he is honest with me, but at the same time, I'd rather not know (or just know that it was with only his exes). Yes, the conflicting feelings and struggle. I still like him and I still think that he is a great person, but there is just a disgust whenever I think of the 10 over girls he screwed and the hands he is touching me with which makes me feel damn uncomfortable. I'm okay with us hanging out, but I think I won't feel okay with him touching me.

Feeling terribly heartbroken right now and confused about my own moral compass (the part about hypocrisy).

To  Wonder if you are him? Hope you can disclose more information. Even if you are not, I shall just express about him. I am very grateful to have him around. I'm often emo, depressed because not many people can understand me. He was my sole confidante and a gift for my poor soul. He has been through much more than me and I pale in comparison with his attitude in life. Like you, OP, he does not really have plans nor much success in life but his knowledge of the world is deep. He may be a nerd outside but he has a kind heart and an intelligent mind. Alas, the gift perhaps has an expiry date and we have to part ways soon. Meanwhile, I will always treasure the time left and when he's gone, I will remember the memories somewhere deep in my heart.

For the first time i met up with this girl I met on Tinder. It started out normal, dinner movie and stuff. But afterwards I went to her place and she had loads of sex toys in her room. Subsequently she asked for a threesome, me her and her brother. Without protection. I know there are many of you guys out there who felt safe but somehow I just didn't, I didnt want to proceed but she started stripping me and I couldnt control myself. After that her brother gave me a blowjob whilst I made out with her, and then I proceeded to pound her whilst she did her brother's thingy orally. I really dont think this is normal. She asked me out a second time, what should i do? I really want to but Im not sure if im doing it right.

I sometimes feel that my boyfriend really falls short of my ideal intellectual standards.  He is not street-smart, has poor sense of direction,  little common sense,  sparse general knowledge and little to no political awareness. He is also really quite 'suaku' as he didn't grow up in a privileged family and has not experienced many things which I have experienced.  These issues have left me very troubled. 

I know you might wonder why I would get together with such a guy in the first place.  Well,  such traits take time to manifest and by the time I realised all this thoroughly,  it has already been almost 2 years into our relationship.  It doesn't help that he already appears so confident that I will be his life partner and is excessively nice to me. 

I am at a loss as to what to do.  I know that I won't be able to stand it if he doesn't improve but want to give him time to try, yet I am afraid eventually it still may not work out and we will just end up wasting each other's youth. 

Sigh such a difficult decision to make.

#rant I know i should not be complaining about this but do you, too, have that group mate that will appreciate/ listen to any other group mates except you? I have one! And he is super annoying. Every time he starts saying about something, and not necessarily about work, he always responds to the other girls in my group, like, stops to listen to what they have to comment, or shows sincerity in wanting to know their opinions. As for me, he just ignores me! Jesus, I cannot wait for this project group to end

I'm essentially paying for all the dates my boyfriend and I go on. :( I used to like doing it because he would do the same and we would take turns, but now he's broke all the time (spending on himself, spending with his friends, never spending on me) he would take it for granted that I'd pay whenever we go out. I'm so tired of it. I don't know what to do :(
-
 
Pls don’t filter me. Although she is not my girlfriend yet, I think I am getting a bit possessive. We are in the complicated state where we will have occasional dinner and hanging out alone and I really like her. I think that she does not hate me too☹. But sometimes when I ask her out and she said she have something on already I feel sad because she didn’t tell me she’s going for that thing. I know her life does not revolve around me but I can’t help it. I suppose the right thing to do is to act chill about it and ask her to enjoy herself?

I'm the one who posted several days ago regarding the encounter I had with a girl at UTown. Thank you guys for your advice, I guess I shouldn't be overworried about it. 

On a side note, to my roomie, we did it on your bed, and I'm sorry. I knew you asked what were the small stains and I just didn't dare to admit it then. I didnt intend to squirt on your bed by the way, that girl wanted it on her face and some just leaked down. On a side note in the past week or so I managed to do another 2 girls from my hall, perhaps due to my increase in confidence now. I didnt use protection either as the first girl told me it was fine as long as I pulled out before ejaculating.

There are so many guys and so little girls in ME. How can i make myself stand out to attract the girl that I like? I'm just a typical normal looking and boring guy who is always trying to rush my tutorial. And to make it worse she's always sitting with her circle of friends and all of them are guys.

HOW TO FIND LOVE ON TINDER
(You don't. Because going into anything with such high expectations will set you up for soul crushing disappointment. Here's some tips to increase your probability of getting some matches anyway.)

1. DO NOT swipe right for all hoping eventually one will match: Tinder algorithm discourage such actions and will not send you your best matches.

2. PROFILE PICTURES (mostly for guys): Please at least show your face. Picture says a thousand words so you want to tell the others that at the very least you are not some socially undesirable creature
(DO)
- Non-selfie, candid photos - look like you have social life and friends like you enough to help you take 
- photos with animals: look caring, animal-lovers can't be psychopaths right?? 
- Travel photos: posing with scenery as background is cute, but iconic landmarks a bit tacky
- posed photo with nice background: make sure it's instagram worthy
- engaged in hobby photo: shows that you are interested in life, also plus points if it is cool (highly recommended)
TIPS: wear collar shirt in your photo (make you look slightly classier without being too douchebag). Suits/ blazers are best.
 
(DO NOT). 
- selfie with room as background: I seldom see a good guy selfie. looks unnatural, also i may imagine you as some otaku who never leaves home 
- group photos: you think i come here to guess wth are you meh???? 
- photos of low quality: dont know kope from which hidden dungeons of the interent, or too poor to get decent camera
- studio/ professional work photo: look like insurance agent what if he want sell me something walao

3. Write something in your profile (both genders): state some interests, or what you think is important to let potential dating partners know, or some open-ended question to invite a conversation. Don't just lazily put your horoscope or some results from personality test and expect people to know all about who are you as a person.

4. Don't just say hi: tell you why are you interested in her as a person -she look like she can be the champion of a spelling bee, and you are a sucker for good spellers? her caption says she can eat all day and you would like to challenge her to buffet meltdown? make it personal, or at the very least, don't make her feel like she's one of the many other matches you are concurrently texting. Ditto for girls - in fact i strongly encourage girls to send the first message if you want a more engaging conversation.

5. Basically if you feel like it's a struggle to think of what to say to the other person, very likely this match is not gonna work out. if you can't even maintain a decent conversation online its gonna be awkward irl.

6. go in tinder with a open heart and mind - you may not find your future spouse, but you can make some new friends. <3 if really cannot then oh well at least it killed some time hahaha. 

REMEMBER! people can sense desperation.

Strategise and maximise your chances; YOU ONLY SWIPE ONCE

Do u guys feel umcomfortable when you know that your friend, or rather close friend is having sex? That day I went to a club with one of my friends who is a big time clubber, and it was my first time at a club. It was shocking, he managed to get his other friend and two other girls to the bathroom where the 4 of them did it in a cubicle, without protection. I even knew where he and his friends blew their load, onto their faces. And the two girls were people they didnt know! To him it isnt even worth bragging about as he practically gets his weiner sucked daily by different girls which he used to talk about but stopped. How do people manage to be so open and normal with all this?

What's the difference between being sensitive or actually feel like you're being used? Sometimes I can't tell if my friends use me or I'm just being sensitive. I'm always accomodating them, listening to them, giving them genuine advice. But I feel like they don't reciprocate it. I feel I'm the friend you hang out with when you're bored. The friend that's the 'therapist', nothing more. The friend whom things you can use and then ignore her for a couple of weeks. I'm not the sort that would address the issue. But are there ways of confirming these thoughts? 
-
 
I know girls feel uncomfortable when guys openly gawk/check them out.
But I'm wondering how guys feel when they notice girls doing the same to them; like check them out head to toe and just...leer. I've realized I tend to do it sometimes. Sorry boys.

can anyone give me any tips on how to confess to a girl? Does it has to be fanciful or when the atmosphere is right I could just ask her? We are now at the complicated stage I think (hopefully she doesn’t just treat me like a friend) and had been having dinners / texting each other together. I would be leaving for exchange in two months and I do not want to lose the opportunity. Please help. Talking about your experiences will help too.

This is my second year in NUS and i have been feeling miserable and lonely. University life is too different from JC life. To make it worse, i am an arts student even though my interest and strength lies in Maths. How i wish i am able to turn back time and take up Maths instead. This makes me feel like my arts degree will be useless in future, hence the reluctance to study hard for my arts modules. However, i've scored As for my maths modules (which can only be used as UE). 

My CAP might not be good enough to take honours i think. But to me, even if i did well, i don't see the use of taking honours when i don't see my future job being related to my major.

Any advice on what should i do? I considered taking another Maths degree after getting this degree but its such a waste of time. I should be graduating and working so that my old parents can retire. 

Also, i feel lonely because my friends are all getting attached with boyfriends. I used Tinder, chatted along well with some guys (although i have never met them) but it's so embarrassing if we actually get together and tell people "oh we met on tinder". Hence my reluctance in meeting them.
My circle of friends is small in uni and i haven't met anyone i liked. I made an effort in joining a CCA but its full of girls haha. 

Ok i feel better after ranting..

 I know how you feel falling for a guy on exchange, I was once in your shoes but we're now together as he felt the same. 

We're both very realistic - we intend to go into an LDR, and if it works out, good. But we also recognise that it probably just might not, and if it doesnt, at least we know we gave it a shot and at least it was so good while it lasted. (And all the things you learn about a vastly different country and culture!)

Sometimes we really ought to stop overthinking things so far into the future and meticulously weighing our chances. It doesnt mean that if you're in a non-ldr/conventional relationship, it wouldn't end. Heck no. When it comes to matters of the heart there's always risk and vulnerability involved. But if it's mutual and real, even just for now...then go for it.

My girlfriend wants me to go down on her but I'm afraid to tell her that I find that disgusting. Have been giving excuses all this while. I have the feeling that if I do tell her, she would stop giving head to me too.

Hi there, i hope this doesnt get filtered. Recently read that a few OPs are having issues with their mother disapproving of their BF and this seems to be giving them alot of stress and issues. 

Allow me to share my side of the story/POV. I play the role of the BF. When i first dated my gf, i face the same if not more disapproval from her parents. I get comments ranging from "he doesnt look good" to "he isnt even rich, if he doesnt have money why get a gf" to even more ridiculous things like "he must have a motive for dating you". These comments were received mostly in the first 2 years of my r/s. It definitely doesnt feel good. What helped was that my girl fought for me, yes, she argued and quarreled and choose not to accept what her mum had said. However, what i wish to tell you is that you should not be fighting this mission of "change of perception" alone While its important you fight for your relationship, it is also important that the guy is aware of such perceptions. Yes it is unfair, it hurts the ego of the guys, there are guys who takes it negatively and therefore the relationship bursts and breaks. However, if your bf is worth you fighting for, rightfully you should be worth your bf making the same amount of effort too. 

What i did after knowing, was to please her, yes, outrightly please her parents. Buy things over, show the care and concern, bite down the pride and ego, swallow what you have to swallow. Then both of you work together to change her perception. It happened that my gf's mum is extremely stubborn so it would at times be good to get siblings to slowly convince the parents.

I think many times we dont understand the way parents show concern over their children, especially the daughters. Ultimately, daughters are like gems in the family, your parents isnt going to easily hand over a gem to the guy isnt it :) This might help you to understand their actions easier. 

Oh and do always share positive things your bfs did for you, every little surprises, every little gestures. When they see the positivity in you, that you are happier, that there is a future and that you are truely taken care of, they will slowly let go and feel safe that "he can take care of my girl"

Fast forward now, im 5 years into my r/s and planning to continue it into a lifetime long. I am not saying i have the full set of solutions. However, i hope this little thing i have shared will help you guys to feel less stressed.

Lastly, at the end of the tunnel there will always be light! Please have faith! :)

A few days back a guy friend who is currently on SEP in Korea began texting me. I have to admit I have a little crush on him (I'm a girl). However, being the very bad texter that I am (I do not fancy texting is this weird?) I took quite long to reply his texts and my replies weren't that good either (trust me, I tried). Any advice on how to not let our convo die out? How do people keep a convo going on for weeks or even months?

My boyfriend plays 5 dota matches minimally a day even though it's week 10 now and then he says he has no time for me because then he needs to study. So essentially, it's: 1. Dota 2. Studies 3. Girlfriend. I don't feel like a priority to him anymore and it was so much better when we were dating. He also does not like studying with me because he says it's distracting but I think he is secretly playing dota when he tells me that he's studying. I feel very dispensable and I don't know how to bring it up to him because I am afraid that he will break up with me. My previous relationship ended because he felt that it was too much trouble to maintain the relationship. And I am afraid if I confront my current boyfriend about it he will think and feel the same way. Any advice? :(

Currently on exchange, and I'm realizing how much I miss this girl who's in the same major as me. Problem is, I'm a strict vegetarian, and speaking practically, if we do get together it might become a problem in the long run when there's so few places we can eat at (and hence spend time together). I don't want her to change her dietary preference too, just for the sake of me. In a dilemma now and seriously need some advice :(
-
 
 Hi there! It's not often that I get to see people like you. Most of my friends, guys and girls alike, think I'm either stupid (guys) or desperate (girls). I assure you I am neither. I'm just someone who values a warm and nurturing family above a double income. If you're serious, you might consider leaving me a private message at shalom.et.versuchung@hotmail.com (random account set up solely for such a purpose), and we'll see how things go from there? Cheers!

Hi guys. Do you all think that it is asking for too much to ask my girlfriend to delete her photos of her and her ex off her Instagram? She says that it doesn't mean anything other than hold bittersweet memories for her so what I don't understand is why can't she just delete them then? Isn't it normal to delete those photos once you are reattached again?

So I was watching this British movie,  'About Time' and I heard a statement by the lead's mother, commenting that ladies whom are too beautiful tend to forget how to have good conversation, to her future-in-law. Then, I was thinking, that is kind of true... that the girl with too many guys complimenting her, actually no longer has the ability to have good conversation...while that is not true all the time, it is actually true for a lot of the time. When she is so busy judging a person from the first statement....and choosing to reply or not, that she no longer converses with quality, depending on the guy to maintain the momentum. While as a guy, we enjoy keeping momentum, it is like playing ping pong... when you hit the ball over, its fun when it is returned, if the ball doesn't return at all or barely, the game loses the flavour... conversation is all about ping pong, its only a good game when there are exchanges. It can get incredibly difficult to craft out a good message with each individual girl especially on platforms such as okcupid or tinder, for people whom are actually serious on the site, girls have the priviledge to pick and choose whom they want to reply to, but do it often enough, it becomes a habit, hopefully it doesnt carry into your real life interactions, but you begin to lose touch with what defines good conversation and throw a good book because you didn't like the blurb... well enough of this rant and p.s. a particular R***** S***, I know you are reading this and feeling incredibly compelled to reply because of your self created high horse of feminism, as a feminist and proponent of equal rights myself, you... do not represent feminists, you are just an angsty, pouty and petulant little girl whom has a universe of grudges against mankind. Enough about this rant, well peace out.

I observe the reason why some girls make eye contact with guys is because they want others to look at them in order to validate their attractiveness. By doing so, it boosts their ego.

I don't really make eye contact with other human beings. Maybe some people might find this behavior to be autistic. 
-
 
Seems that many people are quite unhappy that "this person only talks/looks for me when he/she needs my help" :-( ... just want to share my personal opinion on this. To start off, I am quite a shy person. I'm not really good at continuing a conversation, even if I do enjoy the conversation with the person (most of the time, as a listener). When I make friends, I've always have to worry about how to start a conversation/keep a conversation going and I panic quite a bit when I run out of things to say, especially when i really want to continue the conversation but have no idea what to talk about. Thus, sometimes I only dare initiate a convo when I'm pretty sure there will be stuff to talk about - such as, asking a question/requesting help. It's just me being the awkward me not knowing what to say hence only looking certain people up "only when I need their help" :-( but tbh my main aim of the convo is not seeking help but to just say something to the person (and hopefully, continue the convo once it's started). Back in my jc days, I 鸡蛋里挑骨头-ly came up with trivial questions in my assignments just so to have a legit reason to have a convo with my crush then (lol). So just to sum up, I'm sorry if i let anyone felt that I'm only befriending you because I think you're useful or whatsoever cos' i really didn't mean it :-( and to the people out there who are unhappy that certain 'friends' only go to you when they need your help, maybe some of them just really want to talk to you.
-
 
I am a guy who is extremely desperate for a relationship but in front of anyone I will act as though I take things naturally as I understand that girls do not like desperate guys. (And guys need their pride) The act was indeed very good to the extent that most of friends thought that I am choosing to remain evergreen. As a guy, I am pretty most guys who has not been through a relationship will act as though they are not desperate but deep down they are actually desperate.
-
 
I'm feeling pretty used. I am in the same module as this lady who would only ever talk to me regarding work when she needs my help. Conversations about anything other than work would either just die off, or not be replied to. I get that i am probably not handsome enough to chase her(not that it is my intention), but i am just looking for a friend to talk to. sigh
-
 
I would love some objective views on these behaviors cos I can’t see it from my side:(
So I have a crush on this girl and I have a feeling she has something for me too. Both of us are rather introverted and don’t like hanging out with many people so whenever I meet up with her for dinner/outing alone it will be a hush-hush affair for me (at least for me – I don’t tell my friends I had dinner with her). I know her friends and she know my friends. But somehow her friends know about us (I don’t know how) and would sometimes tease me etc. 

Sometimes when we text and when we are in the mood, we would share about our feelings because I feel safe talking to her. Her personality is very similar to mine and I feel that she will sometimes empathize with how I feel. But I only behave like that in front of her. Whenever we are in a group, I am completely different. I would be more aloof and tries to avoid her (I don’t understand why too).  When we are alone, I would not be really shy and laugh quite a lot with her. 

Last month both of us help an electronic fair. I stayed for both days when she stayed for one. On the second day she came again and we were talking for a awhile and I asked her why. She said she was bored (I was thinking wishfully maybe she wants to see me?). She came along with her friend and she told her that she can actually stay with me if she wants. She was then like wutz no and walk away quickly and I did not see her for the rest of the night until they went home and her friends said bye to me. She was with them and it was abit awkward as she avoided eye contact and did not say bye to me when she walked pass me. Is she just shy or maybe she really just treat me as a friend? 

I am so dense. Wish I could pick up cues more easily.

I know I am many years late but can someone tell me what's the purpose of Tumblr and how does it work?? Last night I stumbled upon some of those sg girls xmm tumblr pages. While part of me found it disturbing that people's instagram photos are being "stolen" and posted on these pages, I couldn't stop looking...and eventually I fell further down the rabbit hole into tumblr porn :/ There seems to be a worrying trend of young girls/ladies taking sexy photos or even nudes of themselves and not keeping it very private (seeing as how it has been dug up and posted). I'm really conflicted because I find the source of these images and videos questionable - possibly illegal? - yet I couldn't stop looking, and I feel guilty about that.

Anyone read  and  and realised: it's true that being an asshole will make girls fall for you? Sigh, time to change my personality.

To ,

Give up hope. At this moment, take care of yourself and forget about your girlfriend (just call her "ex"). Nobody is confused about a person they love. 

Although I do not wish to be the bearer of bad news, there's a high possibility that there is another guy in the scene. Your ex is confused about her feelings about you and the another guy, but she is not THAT confused, because you are getting the boot and not the other guy. 

It doesn't change even if there's no other guys in the scene, your ex is split between you and singlehood in this case, and you are still the one getting the boot.

By being "confused", your ex is embracing the possibility of losing you forever. Would you do that for your ex, who you love dearly? Why would you want to love someone who is willing to lose you? 

She has made a choice, now it's time for you to make yours. Please love yourself and walk away from your confused ex. Do not try to convince herIf she comes back, doubt her, question her. Is she back for you, or is she back for the feeling of a relationship? Nothing breaks a relationship more than a lack of trust.

-- From a person who experienced, and believes that "a break" is a pre-cursor to a breakup, a cowardly way to do so.  A "break" is a period for the person initiating to trial-test how's life on the other side, while keeping you as a back-up. 
-
 
 I wanted a future like that too lol. But then rarely there was one who thought the same way as I did or they just laugh at how ridiculous I am. Times have changed, but maybe it isn't really that bad? I don't know about others but I'm willing to be the housewife if you are a good husband and dad. 

I'm probably as crazy as you are.

To  i went through something similar to your bf actually. Was my first job but i was so miserable. Everything was wrong from the first month. I felt lousy. I couldn't handle the stress and politics of that particular job. I cried every single sunday because i had to go to work. My bf told me he was tired of dealing with sad and sobby me after a while coz it really took up all the time we had together. I felt even more lousy. 

But honestly. I felt i had noone to turn to. It was my first job for goodness sake i felt like a failure. I felt guilt, as though i was disappointing my parents and my bf that i was sabotaging our future together coz i couldnt hold on to a job to finance ourselves and our future wedding, kids etc. Really felt like i failed. On top of that, i felt like a burden. A huge burden for my bf to bear coz i was a sobby sad mess whenever he saw me. 

After talking to some really close friends, i gathered the strength to resign. They assured me it wasnt my fault and it could have just been a poor fit with the work culture and environment. I then explained to my bf about what my friends shared with me and how i felt about the entire thing. From initially asking me to toughen up and suck it up for at least one to two years, he supported my decision to move on if the job really made me feel so depressed and lousy. So i resigned after only half a year and took a month of break to heal mentally. 

It was from then that the relationship with my bf began to mend too. He became more supportive and i became less of a sobby mess. Now im in a new job and im back to my happy self! It really was a fit thing. Even though job title is the same, i feel so much more at ease at my new job and im glad to have had the support of my partner. 

Tldr; my advice is to really understand what is making your bf so upset and miserable and to support him. Assure him it is not entirely his fault that he feels that way. It could be an adjustment issue or that he needs to move on. Hear him out and in time things will get better (:

Hi, would like to know if there are any successful cases of couples getting back together after a breakup. Recently met my ex and we started talking. Everything seems so normal and feels so comfortable, it was almost as if the breakup didn't happen. Think i'm falling in love all over again, even though moving on from that relationship was the hardest thing i've ever been through. Guess you can never truly get over your first love.

I really cant stand it when a group of friends cant hang out normally together. In my faculty, there are many different 'big groups' of people that you see which normally hangs out with each other. This is normal.

Within these big groups there are smaller groups, the cliques within the cliques. That is fine as well. What bothers me is that within cliques i have observed that certain guys are trying to exclude the other guys because they r trying to jio some gals out for their outing/studying together what not. But they are a clique! And yet all these things go under the table. They talk normally on the surface, and pretend everything is normal, and then under the table they text the girl they like non-stop whilst trying to exclude the other guy they find a threat. Im not sure if this happens in the girls' worlds as well, does it?
-
 
As I sit at my desk at night, listening to some jazz...I wonder.
All the potential people around me who can be someone I'll click with...someone out there, I can just talk to easily and the conversation flows smoothly...a friend I can just 'jio' for like a beer on a weekend...wonder when I can get that chance...maybe that's why I'm still stuck on my chair on a weekend night...haiz. Musings of a lonely guy. Just putting it out there. Maybe I need to get out more.

I met him for the very first time at the lobby. I noticed him because he looked so flustered - shirt half untucked, boxers showing, half awake. Later in the day, he introduced himself to me as a new part-timer, waiting to enter uni and choosing between two. I replied that I have already accepted one of the two he was deciding between, and we exchanged number. 

We spent the next few weeks getting to know each other. We were like old friends - talking about everything and anything. Within a month, we became an item. 

Then, it was time for uni. He chose the offer which made us uni-mates, and we embarked on a new phase of life together.

We were a big part of each others' lives - studying together, sleeping over, hanging out. We never stopped learning about each other too - childish bickering, hurtful quarrels, tears. 

There were moments we doubted our decision to get together so quickly. There were times we wanted to just throw in the towel and give it all up. But we've never truly had the courage to let each other go.  

I don't remember when he became a part of my family, but I do remember him being thick-skinned and buying food over just to get to know know them better and prove himself, despite my parents' disapproval. 

Fast forward to today, we are 3.5 years into the relationship.

I don't remember how long I took to get over my bulimic tendencies, but I do remember him taking my hand in his as he checked my knuckles for scarring. I do remember him ensuring that I pace myself each meal until I recovered. And I will never forget the look on his face when I told him I was doing it again. 

I don't remember many things that we do in this relationship because I am a human with goldfish memory. But what I do remember each day is to be thankful for this special someone I so hastily fell in love with. And for someone who knows me better than I know myself.

to 
I'm the OP of 10749 and I like your idea of a short term r/s...provided the other person involved knows what they're getting into. I think it could happen like in those movies...you'll eventually end up falling for the person and realise that most of the things you nitpick in girls are kind of baseless...well either that or someone could get really hurt. Good luck :)
And I hope you do find the girl of your dreams.
Btw...what kind of short-term r/s are you talking about. I'm assuming you mean just dating?

, I totally understand what you're going through. With some of my friends, conversation is literally a competition. They can talk over each other for more than a minute without signs of relenting, and only stop when someone tells them to take turns to speak. Every time I talk one of them would definitely interrupt me, and I would just shut down after being interrupted. At one point I didn't even want to talk anymore.

Read online that you could say something like "as I was saying before you rudely interrupted me..." but if you're non-confrontational like me then just learn how to speak more confidently, since its always the people who seem more confident that are heard. Alternatively, you could google or search reddit for more tips, or head to 7cupsoftea to seek advice (these helped me loads). 

If all else fails, get new friends. I'm not kidding. Distance yourself from toxic people who make you feel like shit, and if everyone you know acts this way (like in my case), learn to be alone for awhile before you start hanging out with them again - the situation may not have changed but you'll feel a lot better about yourself knowing that you're not the problem. Good luck, and I hope things get better x

Hi guys.. I have an issue with my bf of 4 years.. we have numerous quarrels over this and it's affecting our relationship.. Time and again we wanna resolve this issue but to no avail.. and google doesnt really give a definite answer. We cant marry each other and live our lives like this with this persisting problem.. 
So we hope to find a solution to this and please comment and give some advice..

Does Sunday or Monday start a new week?

Argument 1: Sunday is "weekend" so its the end of a week.
Argument 2: All calendars start with Sundays, even nursery songs. 

Please halp.

Today's (18/10) your birthday. The last time we met was on mine. How things have changed. I've read all your messages but been too afraid to reply. There's just nothing left to say, anything else would make it worse. But yes, I'm happy, and I hope you eventually find someone who makes you happy too. And when you find her, hold on to her tightly, be calm, and be kind.

// Think of me, think of me fondly, when we've said goodbye. // Our chapter is closed now, but I wish you well for all the chapters that are yet to be written. Thank you for the good times we've had. Please don't try contacting me again. I've moved on, it's time you do too. All the best x

Dear OP of  ,

well, I'm thinking short term r/s in terms of a glorified FWB I suppose. But hopefully one that doesn't leave me quite so empty. Basically No Strings Attached with.. well.. SOME strings attached. If that makes any sense to you.

But yes, I'm thinking of treating it with the same respect as a full-fledged relationship, exclusivity and all. Just, maybe we have an expiry date which we agree on, or other terms which we agree on before we begin the STR.

Hi! I'm the OP of ! The one about having a toxic friendship with a guy I kinda like. I would just like to thank those who took their time to read my lengthy post and a big thank you to those who gave their advice and opinion! I really appreciate all of them!

For those who didn't read it and would just like the gist of what happened: Basically, I have been helping this guy who has a rather difficult personality with his studies and other stuff. But recently, I offended him unintentionally (FYI I messaged a meme to him on Facebook which said "Funny but f**k you. I know it's immature but I wasn't expecting him to be so offended so as to delete me off Facebook). I confronted him cause he wasn't responding to my apologies and he said I was distracting him from his studies and that he doesn't care what I've done for him. If I offend him or distract him I can just disappear from his life. 

Most of you told me I shouldn't hang around him anymore, and yes I've considered that many times, even before this happened. But the truth is, other than the fact that I kinda like him, I also pitied him because he really doesn't have anyone in our course. I should mention this, actually I already graduated from NUS and am currently doing my masters coursework in Australia. And we will see each other everyday for the next few years unless one of us retains or drops out. So I don't wish to make things awkward between us and hence I've decided to give him another chance, but just one more. And I will not invest so much of my time and feelings anymore. I don't want to be disappointed again. 

Now because I wasn't thinking clearly last week when it happened, I asked if he wanted to study together with me this week to make up for lost time and he said yes. But now I'm worried about how it would turn out. Since this happened fairly recently I am still quite upset about it but I don't wish to bring this up anymore (cause he doesn't want to anyway). It could either turn out to be a normal study session or it could be the make or break in our friendship. Good news is this week is our last week of class before the finals and then the three months summer break so whatever happens time (and distance, he's not Singaporean) will help us take a break from each other. So I'm really hoping for the best! 

Thanks for reading and thanks for your help guys :)

To  I had depression long ago and until today, my family still doesn't know about it. It will turn hell if they know, they are that kind of people who link depression with mentally insane (would probably send me to IMH). I bottled up my feelings, even my opinions are closely regulated to make sure they see the perfect me they wanted. I have a confidante, my best friend, whom I am grateful for. Similarly, OP, look for someone you can trust to confide in. You can start by telling them a little and tell them more as you gain trust in them. And if you really can't trust anyone, vent your opinions in a blog, locked away from everyone's sight. Its the best way to vent sometimes when I don't have my best friend around. Remember, you are not the only one going through this.

I love my girlfriend a lot. She was really sweet to me in the beginning months. However, she dropped the a-bomb on me a few days ago telling me she was confused and stuff in the relationship. We are currently on a break and I don't know whether should I wait for her or just give up hope totally. I mean I care so much for her but I dont know whether is it being reciprocated. Why are relationships so tough to sustain :'(

I am single for the longest time. I have seen my friends get out of relationships and get into another one almost effortlessly, while I can't even get a date. I feel like a loser. I am graduating in less than a year time, but I am still the awkward shy person that I was all these years. Nothing has changed. 

In secondary school, when people were getting steady, I was too much in my own world to join in the fun. In JC, when I was finally aware that I want to get into a relationship to try it out, but I suddenly became awkward and nervous around girls, and so I didn't have any luck. My awkward behavior garnered unwanted attention, and lets just say I got my fair share of ill will from people who were supposedly more 'normal'. I turned to things like anime and games as an escape. They were beautiful as they portrayed romance as the most beautiful thing that can ever happen to a person. And as such, I had grown to have an idealized notion of romance. I longed for a selfless girlfriend similar to that in the idealized stories of anime, and hoped that girls would like me for who I am. But however, reality is so much different from fiction. Countless of awkward encounters with the opposite sex crushed my confidence and yanked me so hard out of whatever self esteem that I might have left. It also doesn't help that my awkward encounters fueled more of the gossips that 'normal' people might have for me. Somehow, they think that it is fun to laugh at awkward people. My chemistry teacher then gave me hope, as he suggested that the best time to find a girlfriend is in university, and that I should focus on my studies. And so I did, hoping that university life will be kinder to me.

Unfortunately,  while people's maturity, the difficulty of the course material , the environment, and my age have changed, my singlehood and my social status still didn't change. I was the shy, awkward, unpopular kid back then, and I am still the shy, awkward, unpopular guy now, and judging from the trend I will likely be the grumbly, awkward uncle that everyone shuns on the MRT everyday in the future.

Why is life so hard on shy and awkward people? It is not like we are people with ill intentions. Why is it that people can talk bad and joke incessantly about other people, often unknowing how detrimental it might be to the victim's self esteem, and still have people and girlfriends gravitating to them. Meanwhile, people who are shy and awkward are treated so much worse, even though they don't hurt anybody. All of this make Karma seem like a convenient lie- a lie to keep the society civilized, and people who aren't afraid to challenge Karma by hurting other people are actually seen as confident and sexy, and thus are popular with the ladies. It seems that all the bullies in the past that I know are all happily attached by now with great jobs and internships, some of them are even happily overseas living the lives of their dreams. It seems that they have 'moved on' with bullying and the damage dealt to the victims and Karma never ever caught up with them. Meanwhile, shy and awkward people are often left in the dust, trying to pick up shattered pieces of their hearts, and are too busy piecing their hearts back together to even navigate life 'normally' with someone that loves them for who they are.

I still have one semester left in nus, and hopefully with this last semester, my life can finally see joy and hopefully I can find someone to love after 25 years of sad existence.

I have been with my partner close to 7 years now. When I first met him he was the bubbliest and caring person I have met. He made me happy in his own little and special ways that nobody could. It's safe to say that I was his support throughout his teenage life and he will naturally tend to consult me in every life decision. He didn't come from a happy family and most of the time he was alone, which evidently made him more mature than his peers.

We are now at the phase of our lives where we crave our career paths, but he has become so confused of what he wants and should do in life, making him depressed. Everyday, he will consult me for every single decision, even trivial ones, like knowing when he should and should not contact his boss regarding his resignation. On top of that he gets really angry or frustrated over the smallest things. When we meet (only once a week due to my busy schedule), all he does is whine about is unhappiness at his current job. I may seem evil and/or cruel but this is slowly draining me out, and I can no longer stand it anymore to the point that I am ignoring his rants. 

I understand we all need someone to talk to but if its so negative everyday that it makes your significant other feel so empty on the inside, is it even fair? I understand that its not always rainbows and butterflies but I feel that we are no longer happy. Is it all worth it to even stay in this relationship anymore? I feel that it would do both of us good if we had a break in this relationship but I don't want to feel like as if I'm breaking up with him at the period when he needs me the most. I do love him, but I just can't do it anymore.. I feel like a horrible person but I'm really tired. Drained.

omg I really can't stand this. 

I can't get this person out of my mind no matter what. I'm just an ordinary, quite phantom girl in hall and by chance, I met this guy and ended up talking. I truly enjoyed talking with him - it was our first time talking and we talked till wee hours. Throughout my meetings with him, he has always been very affectionate - he patted my head and did some cute gestures to me, which I honestly enjoyed.

I'm not sure if I have fallen for him, but I keep on thinking about him. I'll always somehow choose a route to go back to my room such that I'll pass by his door. I find myself missing affectionate things he does to me occasionally. I can't get him out of my head.

The thing is, after a while I found out that he's a very popular guy, and has always had tons of girls around him. And I believe he's like this to every girl. sigh. It's ironic that he is always way more affectionate to me than this guy who confessed to me. I guess people are just different.

Any advice to get over this? I can't exactly just forget him cause I see him really often. Help.

I'm not sure where to start.
I met a guy, J, when I was doing volunteer work. J's a volunteer too and has been there for a few years. We got really close then, he would bring me out for supper after the volunteer work weekly / send me home. J also got me an internship at the place he was working. That's when things went out of hand.  When his girlfriend was on summer exchange last year, he will sometimes get a room at a nearby hotel to make out. Other times he would kiss me, hug me and hold my hands in public. He assured me that his gf is total fine with it as she is also doing something similar with a guy from her course. During work, I got closer to one of my colleague, H, and eventually started dating him. That's when J got upset and threatened me that he would destroy H if I got together with H (which i did after i left the job). J made things difficult for H even after I left the job.

I left the job when school started but we are still volunteering at the same place. His then girlfriend (now fiancé) is not aware of all these things that has happened. Should I let her know? 

I have also reported his doings as 'unprofessional' to higher authorities and has resulted in some serious consequences. I don't know if I have done the right thing. All these that has happened is slowly eating me up inside. All I want is to protect H. I have never felt so much hate for someone. So much that I want to destroy him.

My good friend of 3 years has requested me to have anal with him. Initially I thought no it'll just be weird and may have detrimental effects on our friendship subsequently. But he promised that it wouldn't and if I liked it, we could continue, and if I didn't, I could just voice out. What should I do? I actually enjoy sticking things down there as it stimulates me a little and I have heard that it can be decently pleasurable. The only problem is that my girlfriend wouldn't like it.

Why do people take so long to reply to your messages? It's the 21st century and cmon we all know you are looking at your phone every few minutes. 

This person's whatsapp status changed to online when I sent the messaged but there's no reply until a few hours later. Why??? What, am I not good enough for you?! >:(

It's been so long since I've been with anyone that I've turned into Raj and Steward from the bigbangtheory. Everytime I get to know a new girl I imagine that we will go out together, hold hands and be a couple, no matter who that girl is. 

Is this normal? Somebody help me :(

Guys, some advice needed here. I have this friend of mine who's interested in me. The problem is, I only like him as a friend thus far. He isn't being friendzoned yet, but I just don't feel romantically attracted to him. If you're him in this situation, will you prefer the girl to continue giving you a chance? For e.g. she continues chatting to you, agreeing on going out together? TIA 
-
 
i was viewing some instagram profiles when i suddenly stumbled on to this user. He is a friend from my tutorial. Anyway the account is not connected to his facebook and the posts are weird. Most of them looks like cropped versions of his facebook photos and some are half naked photos of him. I have a feeling that someone made this to make fun of him and I dont think that this is a nice thing to do to anyone. However, im not sure if he is aware of it or is he okay with such things. I feel like bringing it up to him but then again it isn't really my business.

 I personally don't think people are scared of depressed people in the sense that they are afraid that such people would commit suicide or anything of the similar sort. I think it's because they don't want themselves to feel negative or sad, or perhaps one could say they are insecure and not comfortable with who they are and tend to want to hang out with outgoing and popular peeps. Perhaps the solution isn't so much as to change yourself for others but accept yourself for who you are? I think once you achieve that, you will be much happier in the long run and perhaps then, the right people will come along :)

Well, i know you can't expect gifts from people... but what if the person said they have a gift for you?... Just that he/she didn't bring it.

I have this friend, during my birthday or after she fly overseas when she meets me, she always say "i brought something for you but i've forgotten to bring it, give you next time". But the next time never came... till today i haven't receive anything. HAHA. I'm fine with it actually, i don't expect a gift. But since she said she has it so i'm kinda expecting it!!! Well.. this is just a short story of a cute friend, i still love her. <3 thoughts that matter i guess xoxo

Well, i have been with my bf for almost 4 years now. We don't really have much issues with one another, but we always argue about this one thing over and over. We even almost broke up. 
My whole family knows him. They even consider him as part as our big family and invites him along for family events. However, his family doesn't even know about my existence. I don't even know if they are aware that he has a gf. According to him, his parents are too strict and don't allow him to have a gf. At the start of our relationship, he promised that he will tell his parents once he's done with NS. 2 years of waiting, still nothing. I'm tired of waiting. But both of us love one another. It's just his parents. Every single time i mention about this issue, we always end up arguing real bad. He said if i can't wait, maybe i should just leave. 
I don't know what should i do. Wait? Leave?
-
 
I left Singapore without properly telling this guy that I have feelings for him. Deep down inside I think that we will meet again someday, like when I go back to Singapore for exchange; but it's highly likely that I am not the only nice girl in his world. He's in army so I'm safe for two year, but then what after that? I'm the passive type so if he shows no sign of romantic attraction (or bluntly tell it in my face) I'll just practically stay quiet and overthink the shit out of the situation.
And I think I'm friendzoned, too. What to do sia...
-
 
I've fallen for this girl in my block... The thing is that she's attached, although this was not known to me and I had been messaging her often for the past few weeks, with her responding positively. I think I have fallen for her pretty badly, and think about her almost all the time, believing that it was mutual. It was only recently that I found out she actually has a boyfriend, when a friend happened to tease her about her single relationship status. At that point, it got pretty awkward, because she became ver silent. It was only after a few days that she kind of hinted that she's actually not single. When I found out, all I can say is I felt disappointed and kind of deceived.

I'm an evergreen and I've never felt this way about a girl before. Like many people, I have trouble deciphering signals of attraction and tbh I'm not sure if she feels the same way towards me, although she displays many many signals. It is so hard to hope since she's attached. She tends to be much friendlier with me than to other guys e.g. turning to talk to me all the time and coming to sit near me. On text, she also tends to initiate conversations even when there's nth much to talk about. It might be wrong since she is attached, but based on our interactions I think she's one of those rare few girls that I am willing to abandon my singlehood for and possibly be with her for the rest of our lives. It's selfish, it's stupid, it's dramatic. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Does anyone ever feel like they have just gone through a lot in life compared to the average person and that is why not many people can understand you? 
People generally just want to see others smiling and happy because if people seem depressed I think they get scared.
I went through major depression after being severely bullied years ago. The kind where I could see people get scared when they look at me because it looks like I'm just going to jump off a building anytime. I think I'm still mildly depressed now I just try not to show it. However I think it means that I cannot be as enthusiastic and once in a while I will just feel depressed again and want to be alone. I think people can feel this and that is why even when I'm trying to make friends it is harder for me. It's like I want more friends to make me happy but it just takes a lot of effort to talk more and engage people.
I actually overheard my mother telling my aunt who suggested that I was depressed that she wasn't going to send me to a counsellor as it will affect my future prospects if I were to be diagnosed and that I would get better on my own. My mother has always tried to downplay my problems, has always thought of herself first, I think she lacks eq. When others find out that there are times I do things that my mother doesn't allow, I think they are judging me but they can't understand that I just don't value my mother's opinion so much but I'm expected to be a good obedient daughter. It makes me guilty though.
This extends to a friend as well. She like many others has lived a relatively normal life and cannot understand why people would be so bad and advised me to be more aware of what I do so I wouldn't provoke anyone. It made me more depressed and I just felt even more different from everyone else. 
This is the problem with people who have not been through a lot. They don't understand there are people out there who are willing to harm you, bring you down, make you feel horrible for their own satisfaction. It could be that you were an appropriate target or you just happened to be there. That just because you are nice you expect everyone to be nice back. Life is not fair. 
It makes me want to be alone even more but at the same time I feel like I'm missing out or a little rueful watching everyone else in their large groups or with their partners.
I'm getting tired. There's no one for me to really pour out my soul when most people I meet nowadays are looking for friends to have a good laugh with. Not that I can blame them really...
-
 
OK so I'd like some advice on some friendship problems I've been having. Yeah it's not as entertaining as relationship problems but I really value this friend and would like some advice.

So this friend of mine has a personality that's really hard to get along with. His previous clique broke up and he's a major reason behind it. I spoke to all of them but none of them liked him (there were 5 or 6 of them). I became friends with him because we were in the same group but also I found his personality interesting. 

Now, the problem with him is he claims he doesn't need friends. And that he only cares about studies. Sometimes he can be extremely competitive and gets upset if someone does better than him. He also gets offended very easily and can just break a friendship if you unintentionally offended him. Which was what almost happened to me.

So I've been helping him a lot in his studies. He's been asking for my notes (not always) and explanations for concepts. I'm fine with that cause he helps me sometimes too (though not as much as I've helped him). Now recently, we've been having lots of tests coming at us so I guess we were all stressed. We were chatting on Facebook and sent him a meme which offended him when I didn't mean too. And guess what, he deleted me from Facebook. I apologised to him and tried to call him but all he said is he wants to focus on his studies. 

When I finally confronted him two days after he deleted me, what he said really made me upset. He said I was distracting him and that he just deletes anyone who distracts him. I told him he should have told me I made him upset and all he said was he was busy (come on, it only takes a few seconds to say "yes I was upset") and he didn't understand why I was bringing this up because it was a small matter. Then I said "I've done a lot for you. I'm not saying you should repay me back but I was hoping you'd treat this friendship a bit more seriously" and he said "it doesn't matter what you've done for me. If you offend me and distract me from my studies you're not my friend." He even accused me of blaming him, which I wasn't cause all I was trying to say is if he was offended he should have said something and I would have apologised.

So friends, what should I do? I was really hurt at what he said. Now I don't feel too bad but now I know that he really doesn't value this friendship. He did add me back in the end (he said he ended me back cause I apologied wtf). I'll be very honest, I do like him a little. I don't get nervous around him but I do think about him occasionally. So I think me liking him is stopping me from getting out of this toxic friendship. 

Tl;dr: Male friend who I like tried to break off our friendship cause I unintentionally offended him, even though I've helped him a great deal. Says studies always comes first. Should I forgive him and move on or get out of this friendship before I hurt myself more?
-
 
I really like this guy. He's currently in army so we pretty much only meet every or alternate Saturday or Sunday. Sometimes I think I actually love him. He would be the second guy I've actually really truly cared for out of my total 5 relationships. And we aren't even together. And the thing is I know 100% confirm he is not interested in me in that way. And I can accept that. I don't expect him to have feelings back for me. But I need to know how to stop feeling so much for him and to be able to see him as a really good guy friend again. It's messing with my head and also messing up my attempts to meet new guys. I always end up mentally comparing them to him, and I always sabotage the potential ones by bringing him and my liking for him up. So even though I may think a guy is a potential, end up I will screw up whatever chances we could have had because I end up talking about the guy I like. Sigh. How do I manage my affection for him :(
-
 
I've been in and out of relationships a lot, and in each relationship naturally we take a lot of photographs together. Although we've broken up but I keep the photos that we take together and all my ex's are stored in this folder in my hard drive. It's not that I miss them but sometimes I look through the photos and think of all the happy moments we had together. Is that wrong? I feel like they are (not were) parts of my life although years ago, and it's not like deleting them will erase them from my life. 

Thoughts?

To ,
Tinder is a good place to start. (Unless you're a guy, then it's difficult)
Or if you're lucky enough one of your friends is super open minded and close to u and is willing to give it a shot....good luck!
Or you can always try here at whispers. Interested? ;)

Hey everybody, I hope someone here can help me with my problem: Since I came back from exchange I'm in a dilema. I have no experience with Western guys. Still evergreen. Since a couple of weeks I realized that even though I don't have classes at utown I often find myself being there without any specific reason. Sometimes I fantasize that one of those handsome exchange students will pick me up. After I came back to Singapore I realized that I don't see a future with those guys I used to like in highschool.  I my wildest dreams I just follow one of them to their room. But in the end I know I am even to shy to talk to them. Ahhh can't think of anything else anymore. I think it is effecting my performance at school.

i am gay and i have a boyfriend. however he's always so busy and doesnt have time to meet up. sometimes he blue ticks my messages and doesnt reply until like a day or two later. what do i do? i love him so much but it irks me alot when its going like that :/
-
 
To . Yes!! Omg. My mother also refuses to listen to me whenever I attempt to explain my position to her. Sigh she is pretty adamant that I find some other guy instead and her "I deserve better" is starting to turn me off. I don't understand I'm getting increasingly weary while trying to improve the situation. Coping with academics is draining enough and she has to be this unsupportive of this r/s. Hang on dear you can't give up, for him and yourself!! Jiayou!!!

I have only been to the gym once, and I'm so incredibly lost when I'm there. And intimidated. Anyone can guide me? I'm a girl btw.

Is it okay for us to not like a person with low EQ? I mean it's not their fault that they appear so unconsciously mean... but it shouldn't be our fault to be angry at them for being that mean right? I mean, i know a friend who is always bad with interacting with people, i don't blame the other person for being annoyed with my friend? 

Am i being mean if i say my friend deserve it?
-
 
Truth be told if you stop fapping for a long time your body will emit pherhomones (sorry not sure how to spell) that will attract the opposite sex. There are some guys that seem really alpha; confident vibes, attracts attention, draws everyone. More often than not they control their personal sexual trysts.

I consider myself very blessed. Born into quite a well to do family, with parents who selflessly provide me with a luxurious lifestyle. My parents got me a car at 19 as soon as I passed my driving test, and my own estate at 20. I am already more than a millionaire. But I always believe in being humble, sincere and kind. 

Since I entered uni, I have been maintaining a low profile in school. I try to give back to society, by doing community service with the school club. Being with friends, I never talk about my wealth, or tell anyone about my estate, but my car is sometimes inevitable since I drive everyday. That's because I see no point in purposed flaunting of wealth, and I hope to meet genuine people, friends, or even a potential boyfriend. 

Then somehow, I don't how, one of my friends found out about my private estate. Some things and people start to change. For some of my female friends (whom I like to think of as closer friends), they start to become (I hate to use this word) spiteful. Words about me being a spoilt brat, princess, and even arrogant girl, start circulating among them. I was sadden, to learnt that these words came from those whom I thought were selfless volunteers in the club, or friendly student leaders in the faculty. 

I feel sadden, yet feel sorry for these narrow minded people. But thankfully, Through this incident, I managed to find true friends who are never jealous, and always supportive. 

For these girls, sometimes I wonder if their actions will reverse if I were a guy instead.

Is it ever possible to ask a girl, whom you aren't that familiar with out, without implying that you wanna get to know her better and date her eventually? Prof Ben Leong do you have any idea as well?

To the girl I just met tonight. I am not sure if u will see this, but u are the girl of my dreams. I hope u feel the same about me too :) and I hope there are subsequent meet ups!

To , i have the exact same issue as you (i re-read your post twice because i can't believe we are facing the exact same situation). Anyway, my mum thinks that my boyfriend is ugly and not presentable. She only met him a few times but without much communication. she always give him a really fierce and black face of disapproving which pains me a lot. i can't bear to let my bf know about it. my mum even asked me to look for other guys because she said "you don't have lack of suitors anyway" i quote. what makes it worse, she is stubborn so it is very difficult to talk to her because she totally shuts me out whenever i tried to speak to her nicely about him. and no i do not want to look for anyone else; we are both very serious in this relationship. 

i don't know how long is this going to take before she accepts him or is she EVER going to... i've been hopeful for the past one year but i am tired, i really am. especially when i go back home with a disapproving look every time she knows that i am out with him. this is hurting our mother-daughter relationship and it serves nothing good to any of us. i don't know what else to do and it is draining my energy till i dread to go back.

My boyfriend has been in IMH for a while now for severe depression. I visit him every day despite being utterly tired from lectures and schoolwork, yet no matter what I do, he's completely unresponsive, save for a weak smile or a dreamy nod of the head. I'm on the verge of giving up hope. I cry myself to sleep every night at the loss of my loving boyfriend to this horrible horrible sickness. What should I do?

Honestly speaking as a girl, when i wear sleeveless, or off shoulder tops, or translucent tops, i wore it that day to feel good about myself. I think i am pretty when i dress up. It makes me more confident when i feel beautiful. The same thing goes for makeup. I am mostly doing it for myself, and not really for guys. It's partly for girls, coz girls judge when you don't dress according to the social conventions and take care of how you look. And i am pretty sensitive to social rejections from their eyes or body language which makes me feel terrible.

About being looked at, i dont mind it from anyone as long as it falls within the boundary of i think that girl is pretty or i like her clothes/style (or even looks like why is she dressing like that). I can tell the difference from a lustful look which looks like they want to tear my clothes apart and see/imagine me naked. Most girls do not like being objectified and just seen as a sex object. We feel good if we feel we are admired. Perhaps this is the difference between why the girls cover themselves up when you stare at them and whisper about you being tiko because the look in your eyes was obviously the disrespectful and undesirable (and honestly scary) kind.

My boyfriend and I just graduated recently. We both got jobs immediately after graduation. I started working for a MNC while he went to work for a VWO. I make close to $4,000 a month while he only makes $2,200 a month. 

Right off the bat, I'm going to say this but I'm worried. I'm worried that he would not be able to provide for our future. My worry is not so much that I'm making more since our finances would be more or less pooled if we do get married. My concern is that his job is not one which has prospects and his pay is unlikely to increase much over the years.

I truly admire him for his dedication to his work. He really works tirelessly to make a difference to his beneficiaries. I can really tell that this is the direction he wants to take in life. However, there is a selfish part of me that emerges from time to time screaming in my mind that he should get a job that pays better and just volunteer at the organization in his spare time.  That he should know better since we have talked about how high the cost of living in Singapore is. 

I'm at a loss as to what to do and at the same time, I'm not sure if there is a solution. I don't want to stand in his way since his job makes him happy and makes people happy but at the same time, what about our future? Maybe I should go buy 4D or something.

Sometimes I pity my non-Singaporean friends. They have to bear quite a lot of responsibility. Working part time to make sure they can make the rent this month, having to live in a small room outside , living so far apart from their family. When we go out for dinner , they won't order extra appetizers or things that they deem is a waste of money. One of them is on a scholarship and yet he still works part time as a waiter to send some $$ to his parents . Seeing them reminds me to appreciate what we have sometimes...

I would really like to know how you people out there find your FWB..?

Dear OP of 

I feel you. I've been single all this while, not so much cuz I couldn't get attached, not because I can't commit, but because I've been incredibly picky about my partners.

And to get by I've resorted to FWBs. People I could never see myself ending up with, but yet had enough chemistry to do couple things with. Yeah I suppose I had an outlet for my urges, and had a way to ensure I could get enough intimacy with another human being, but somehow afterward there was this empty feeling.

I don't see a solution to this till I find someone and get attached. But that's easier said than done - I find it incredibly hard to find someone I'm interested enough in. So I've been exploring the possibility of a short term relationship instead.

- similarly empty-feeling promiscuous guy.

I've been having suicidal thoughts. 

It's weird. I don't actually want to kill myself, but there's this part of me that feels really detached from myself, and I keep having this thought that I should jump just so I can see what it's like.

Someone tell me what to do please, idk what to do because my counsellor is really useless and I always feel worse after talking to her 
-
 
, I think I understand what you're saying because I guess, I went through that phase myself. I have considered different ways of killing myself, which methods I can actually visualize myself doing. I didn't actually realize it wasn't normal until I spoke to some friends about it, and they said that they don't even think about their death, and any method of killing themselves sound creepy. But, I guess the most important thing is to keep your head up, and remember to always try to rationalize things first. 

I used to self-harm too because of some circumstances, and I have to admit that sometimes, up till today,  I still have to compulsion to when something bad happens that I feel I cannot deal with. But I realised you have to find it in yourself that you KNOW it's not healthy and you have to try to push the idea away, sleep it off or something.

Somehow I think sometimes, you might feel counsellors cannot help because these kind of things are quite internal- it's hard for you to really verbalize what you're feeling cause it's just all that pent-up sadness and emotions that you yourself don't even know where it's coming from. So at the end of the day, try to help yourself :) try to look at it from as mature a point of view as you can - and remember that your brain really is a rather strong organ. You can will those bad feelings away if you wanted and of course, try to busy yourself with meaningful things. You will become stronger through it. Take care! :)

My boyfriend doesn't study and he just wastes his time away doing nothing / playing games / sleeping, ie everything else in the world except studying. Despite all the support and things I've done, things still remain the same. What can I do to help?

How i long for the good ol secondary school days, my friend (D) and (A) agrees. All of those in our clique had found new friends and are not practically not-free for the entire time when I return to singapore during my holidays.

I am currently in year 4 and mt gf is now working after graduating from NUS last year. We felt that our relationship of 5 years would last forever and decided to exchange vows after consulting our parents. None of our friends know about this and we intend to have a grand wedding reception after I have graduated in 2016. However, just recently, I got into a fight with my gf/wife and I admit it was my fault. I should have kept my temper under control but what was said has been said. Immediately, I apologized to her and even sent flowers to her place. She rejected the flowers on both occasions and she has blocked me on Whatsapp and probably blocked my number on her phone. I do certainly see a future and hope in our relationship but the way she's acting makes me want to pull the plug off our relationship. I had planned so many important events with her ( booking HDB, wedding plans) but I really don't know what to do. Advise needed, friends

 Your post made me realise I am probably desensitized to sex too. I read a lot of erotic fiction and watch a lot of porn, most of it much more hardcore than anything my boyfriend ever watches. I think it's because we don't have sex as much as I would like to. He masturbates every day and has to actively abstain in order to build up enough desire for sex, which has resulted in me searching for more and more intense porn in order to get the same high because it can't compare to actual sex. It has come to the point where I'm fetishising cuckqueanism and fantasize about him having sex with another woman in my presence. I have broached it to him several times but he often dismisses me. I'm not sure why because he used to be more keen on sleeping with others in the past.

This is quite a graphic post so I don't know if it'll be shared, but I guess I'm sad we are not as intimate as we used to be. And I don't enjoy sex as much now whenever we do have it because I have more extreme scenarios in my head that seem more attractive. Sigh.
-
 
Even 4 years into uni, I still find it extremely awkward to speak to ladies who look, by normal standards, average and above. It's like, they're so good-looking, what if I say something wrong to them?? 

I'm already at my final year, mech engin,  I guess that doesn't matter anymore - everyone's already split all over the place.

when your SO has lost faith in the two of you and has hinted that she's been considering someone else... what do you do? is it worth it to continue investing in the current relationship or is it just the sunk cost fallacy that's gotten to you?

Does anyone know where to get period delay medication? I'll be going overseas with friends for a holiday and the period (pun not intended) when we are going is an inconvenient time for me. Thanks!

Just a rant about a failed relationship because there's just nowhere else to turn. After dating my ex for close to 4 years, it's so difficult to handle being alone again. Despite asking him to reconsider, he's simply saying that he's moved on and is dating another girl. He just never bothered to give us a chance and communicated properly while in the relationship. Usually he would just say things are okay and I foolishly believed him. Mutual friends engage in side taking (though they claim they don't) and honestly they aren't the ones who got dumped so they really don't know this pain. I fucking can't take this bullshit anymore. Ruined and tainted all my memories of NUS. Though he thinks we can be "friends", I honestly never want to see his face again.  Can one ever be friends with their ex?
-
 
I am attracted to a girl in my project group. 9 weeks have passed and I have yet to make any moves to ask her out. Is it too sudden and weird if I were to ask her out now? Also, is it wise to defer to after exams so that it wouldn't be awkward for the group in case she doesn't take it well?
-
 
There’s this girl I’ve had feelings for since secondary school, and now we’re in NUS together. We’ll call her Donna. 
Once we hit second year, we went out drinking, and I worked up the courage to exchange numbers. 
We started out talking often, but she hasn’t answered me in three days now. 
I’m getting depressed just thinking that Donna might be sick, or that something happened to her… (´･ω･`) 
Please, somebody give me some advice. 
-
 
I've been with my significant other for about a year now and things are going great. However, I feel that he is watching too much porn to the point whereby he's desensitized to sex. He had never cum from having sex with me and always have to get if off himself afterwards really intensely, while watching porn whilst i am still beside him. It bothers me to a certain extent really but I can't bear to bring this up to him. Advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.

My mathematician/programmer boyfriend is unromantic and weird. But it's okay because I'm unromantic too and in the same frequency of weird (which is probably why we get along so well). And I love him for who he is :)

P.s. Anyone knows where to download romantic_bf.deb and normal_bf.deb? 
-
 
I suck at commitment. So relationships? Nah. But I've had many FWBs/FBs. Well the thing is, after getting physical with them, there's always been this empty feeling. Of something missing from what we did. There was definite chemistry, the intimacy felt great but it lacked something. Whenever one of them would do something romantic, like hold my hand or a simple gentle kiss on my forehead, it would feel like that gave me a much better feeling than whatever other (sexual) stuff he's been doing to me. Yet I know he doesn't mean it. And that hurts, knowing in that kind of relationship, those simple gestures, neither of us deserve from each other.
But then when I think of committing, when I think of putting in effort to make things work with one guy long term, I feel suffocated. I'm the most confused promiscuous girl ever. 
-
 
,  I wanted to offer a bit of advice regarding this. Evergreen, but I've felt the impacts of porn on myself, so I can somewhat understand what's going on. 3 months clean currently, and I hope to make this a long-lasting clean streak.

It seems like porn is already interfering quite a bit in your sex lives. It's especially so when you start moving into increasingly graphic/sexual videos, because it means you've become so dependent on porn to get off that you need more stimulus to get off again (just like drugs).

I highly suggest you/your partner to abstain from porn. Obviously it's easier said than done. Too many a time have I gone back to videos and whacked off to it, which usually happens when I'm bored or it happened on a whim. There's really a need to get over this addiction. And yes, Tumblr porn counts. Also, isn't watching porn kind of like, cheating on you/your partner? Since y'know, it's watching other people get off and probably imagining you/them in that scenario.

Support your partner/get support along the way. Maybe start small, such as a week, or a few days if that's too difficult. Offer incentives (sexually?) if you/your partner manages to hang on without porn stimuli, but don't overuse the reward system of course. It's all a matter of balance. You/your partner must also willingly want to actually do this for him/herself and the relationship, or you'll/they'll return to porn before you know it. All the best. :)

I'm a guy with a relatively close female friend. I'm gay (though not open to everyone) but point is, she knows. However, recently I couldn't help but feel that she might like me in that sense. Just wondering, would it be likely to happen or I'm just sensitive? Would someone like another person knowing that he is gay? I'm not really sure what to do, should I pretend not to know anything?
-
 
I know that guys in general do not pick up on hints and would always prefer to receive direct answers. And so that is what i did. I explicitly told my bf what i don't like/what i want most of the time and even then, he fails. I am getting tired of this. And before anyone of you accuse me of having high expectations. I do not. I had never expected my bf to do things like reply immediately or go to every places that i suggested or to stop talking to his ex. Anyone of you out there that is in the same situation? :(

To the guy I just met tonight. I am not sure if u will see this, but u are the man of my dreams. I hope u feel the same about me too :) and I hope there are subsequent meet ups!

My buddy has asked me for advice, his girlfriend has asked him for a foursome with two of her other male friends which he strongly objected to. I told him that he shouldnt stick around with her as this spells for future problems, but now im worried as to whether this would affect his relationship....advice please?

I don't like being in love. It's frustrating to see the guy you like in school treat you differently when he's in front of his friends and when he's in private. Let's call him G. 

Before I met G, I had a few fuck buddies - great sex, strong attraction but just no relationship. Let's call one of them M - for master. ;)

G has been frustrating me because he says he wants to meet but last minute don't want to meet. 3 times in a row this week. 

Today, M called to ask if I was free. We haven't met in months and he gave me what I so desperately needed. One hour later, G called to say he was free to meet. In my head, I no longer wanted to meet him anymore. So I just bullshit an excuse up. 

If G has been flirting with my best friend lately and hasn't asked me to officially go out with him, this doesn't mean I've just cheated on him does it? Cos if it does, damn, I don't feel bad at all.

Hi guys. Sorry just needed a platform to rant for im rather distraught. My mother have been telling me that she would be unhappy and unsupportive of us should i get together w my best friend. (I think she had suspected sth) She feels that i deserve better given my physical attributes (i hate to admit this but he is not the most goodlooking guy out there and my ma knows my suitors and they are betterlooking than him ughh so she feels that way??) Yes we have developed a liking for each other and I cannot bring myself to tell him that my ma doesnt approve of us like..HOW to he doesnt have a clue and i dont want him to feel inferior :( And both of us are serious about this r/s. :( Everytime i see him i just cant bear to bring up this issue and it kills me all the time when my ma mentions this at home. She just doesnt view this progession as positively as i do no matter what i say. I dont even know what to do now. Just very conflicted and sad that my ma thinks this way and he is kept in the dark. Sigh idk anymore thanks for listening guys. Sigh.

To  you should've done the scorched earth policy the moment you broke up! Get rid of everything that reminds you of him (except for 1 or 2 most important photos or letters, and hide those in a box and don't take them out) and don't follow him on social media! You probably prolonged your healing process by continually checking his social media - how to move on like that :( All you can do right now besides that, is be patient with yourself and be open to possibilities. Acceptance takes time, and everyone moves on in their own way. Keep busy, keep improving yourself. Eventually, there will be a day where you realise you're content, and you're free :) It was not a short or easy journey for me but I'm here now and I know you will be too!

I really need some advice. Recently I've been somewhat worried about my relationship. My boyfriend has been texting his ex-girlfriends behind my back, and still keeps his old pictures with them. I keep trying to tell myself it's fine, but now I'm not too sure. To make matters worse, there are many other girls who keep trying to hit on him (probably because he's rich and is a scholar and is very sociable etc). I've spoken to him about it and he always tells me not to worry, but he never changes his ways. What should I do?

I love this girl ever since we were kids. It was pure luck and perhaps fate that we even met. It all started when she was being teased at and I stood up for her. Afterwards, I got to know her name and more about her. Later on, we got into the same school, and were grouped into different houses, and you could imagine how I wished we were in the same house so we could interact more. Reality is, we were grouped into different houses, and everytime there was house practice, I would see her smiling happily with other guys. She was very pretty, and there was this guy whom I absolutely hate, who also have an interest in her. Lets call this guy J.

I was always constantly teased by J in school and I really hated J. He would always make fun of me, and perhaps of my socially awkward nature, I always ended up as a laughing stock to his gang. Fate has it that J and her were in the same house, and there were plenty of time for them to interact. I would always get jealous of J and absolutely hated him to the core.

Fast forward, eventually J ended up with her. That did not stop me from loving her. She was the first girl I loved. And have always love her throughout all these years, remaining faithful to her. Perhaps it is also due to my socially awkward nature, I could feel her distancing herself from me.

She eventually married J, and I could only keep my love for her deep in my heart. You ask why do I still love her after all these years? I dont know. She is, and will always be, the only girl I love, even after her marriage.

My relationship with J never improve. In fact, it worsen. Eventually, they have a son, and I am still an evergreen. 
A few years later, she and J died tragically, leaving behind their only son. Perhaps it is my deep love for her, that I did not mind taking care of their son even though I hated J to the core. Perhaps it was also because the son resembles the mother. You could imagine how deeply saddened I was when she died. I literally broke down, and felt the world collapsing.
I have been constantly keeping a lookout for the son and offered him protection. By the way, I am a professor and teaches potions even though I fancy the dark arts more.

Girls and guys, will like your opinion on what is a blowjob to you.

My male BFF and I were dirty talking to each other for fun, and being really creative in how we wanted to seduce each other theoretically. We were also being really explicit with each other and going into step by step detail. He mentioned he wanted to strip me and dry hump me, and I mentioned to him a blowjob came to my mind, which got him really excited, and he kept saying he wanted me to blow him away. I thought that was just part of the fun and games, so I reciprocated by saying I wanted him to do stuff to me too.

After a few days, he told me he still wanted me to do a blowjob on him and I told him he sounded really insistent about it. So yes he told me he really wanted me to do it to him in real life, and I told him no, and my reasons for it. He sees it as another form as masturbation, and nothing sexual about it, but I see it as me wanting to pleasure a guy, which I rather be someone I love. He told me he was willing to reciprocate if I wanted to, but I didn't want him to as I'm not even attached to him. So he was really disappointed and told me he wanted to sleep, it being late at night too.

I asked him the next morning if he was angry at me, and he told me he'll be lying if he said he wasn't. So I asked if it was because I brought it up but didn't want to carry it out, which he agreed. After that his replies were short while I was trying to explain my reasons for not doing so to him, and didn't answer after a while. Later in the day, he told me he was still not happy but didn't want to force me into doing so, if not there's also no meaning. But to me, it sounded quite reluctant as from his messages as he said he was still unhappy. We then agreed to discuss this that night.

That night, he told me the reason why he really wanted a blowjob was because I made it seem desirable, and he used to fantasise about it when he was younger, and also I said I wanted to do it to him. I told him I thought we were describing seduction plans to each other for fun, and going into really explicit detail. He knows those more elaborate scenes both of us described to each other were theoretical, it also being lack of space and materials, but he didn't see a blowjob as being in the same league as those scenes. I told him if I didn't even love him, to me it'll seem meaningless because it'll be just carrying out the acts, without even considering our feelings, like friends with benefits. And I was unhappy at him being unhappy and sounding reluctant in accepting the fact, because I felt as a girl, I should be able to set my own boundaries for myself, and not be upset if a guy wanted to cross what was acceptable to me at each point of the relationship. He told me he apologised for making me feel that way, but didn't want to say anything about my accusation the day before that he sounded a little sex-starved, because he was still not ecstatic about the rejection. I then apologised for leading him that way, but told him he being insistent on it was how it seemed like to me, though he didn't force me in the end. He told him he forgave me but was still unhappy that to him I accused him of being sex-starved. He then said he'll find another way to relieve himself of the desire and we didn't end off on a lighter note.

Just to make it clear, we have agreed that we had no romantic feelings for each other; I know he will never feel anything for me, and I'm past the thought of thinking I liked him. But this issue has created a rough bump in our friendship for the time being, which I do hope in time to come we are able to get over it. At this moment, I don't really know what to say to him at the moment. Any advice on this? Thanks!

In response to , I would think that if taking a break would be beneficial for you, then by all means you are encouraged to. I took a semester-long LOA before due to personal reasons, and I felt more comfortable and ready to continue my studies when I returned to school after the break. You don't even need to let your friends know and people usually won't ask either. I did feel a little uneasy to be taking in my even-numbered sem when everyone's doing their odd-numbered sem (i.e. My 4th sem in sem 1 this year when people my batch are in their 5th sem), but I realised I was thinking too much because most people will just assume you've been at SEP :)

With regards to , something similar happened to me as well. I asked my mom why such things happen and her reply was its neither because of luck nor because men don't respect women. In fact, my mom said that older men "disturb" young girls because in the past, it's rather common for males to whistle or call out to young girls, especially those they think are attractive so this somehow became a habit ingrained in them. The reason why things like this happen less is because both men and women are educated, and men wouldn't dare do such things either because girls are a lot more likely to report them should they do such thing like disturbing girls. 

However, when I complain that such things happen, I was horrified to hear comments like "aiyah, men behaving this way is normal lah. If they don't go after girls like that how to have next generation ah?" I do not know if it's just the people I met giving such comments or is it simply a sad truth that society is quite forgiving towards guys "disturbing girls". Yes usually we hear politically correct answers like such behaviour should not be condoned blah blah, but it appears to be otherwise, like there are people who still think that men "disturbing" girls is a normal behaviour. In fact, I thought that guys in general don't seems to understand what girls have to go through, especially when encountering uneducated/old guys because they will never experience such problems themselves. 

A question to the guys out there, do you all have the temptation to disturb young attractive girl you all see, except that you know it's just not the right thing to do as it may reflect badly yourself and thus you all controlled it? Please do not blast me as I genuinely wish to hear about what guys honestly think because I am not a guy and it's very difficult for me to understand why many guys cannot seems to resist the temptations of girls they think are attractive.

Is the reasoning "men aren't meant to be monogamous" legitimate? It sounds so much more as an excuse for men to cheat on their girlfriends while expecting their girlfriends to stay loyal to them. 

I'm not some broken hearted jaded girl. I just watched my friend dump his girlfriend because he couldn't stay "monogamous", but really, I call bullshit

I really need some advice. Recently I've been somewhat worried about my relationship. My boyfriend has been texting his ex-girlfriends behind my back, and still keeps his old pictures with them. I keep trying to tell myself it's fine, but now I'm not too sure. To make matters worse, there are many other girls who keep trying to hit on him (probably because he's rich and is a scholar and is very sociable etc). I've spoken to him about it and he always tells me not to worry, but he never changes his ways. What should I do?
-
 
I'm really having a hard time with issues in school and in my personal life right now. But as things are getting more and more hectic in school and people around me are stressed out by their own problems etc., I feel like I shouldn't be adding on to their burden by confiding in them. Not to much the precious study time they could be doing when I don't bother them with my whimpering. The struggle is real and I feel so alone. Do anyone of you feel the same way? And should I just "suck it up" and fight this on my own? I just don't wanna burden anyone.

I have a question and I hope it'll be posted. So, I was talking to my friend and the guy behind her kind of looked at me and gave this strange expression, like a very small smile? Is that good or bad?

I wonder how many of those who frequently chip in advice on relationship-related confessions are currently successfully managing a relationship themselves. Nice, politically correct advice is good and all, but I really have to take some of the stuff some of you say with a pinch of salt when you aren't even in a relationship. 

And please, none of that "I am good with relationship stuff, but just choose not to have one cause I'm at that point of my life where I feel great being single". All you can do is restrict your advice to the mistakes you made. Don't act as if you're such a font of wisdom.

People CAN change.

Okay, so here's my confession.

Around a year back, I had become a very dark and sadistic person. I had friends and family members that I could depend on, but deep down I was really lonely. I was fairly sociable and likeable, but I always felt alone. I would skip classes, spend so much time inside my room, would beat off once or twice a day. I could see myself deteriorating. Mentally. I started watching all kinds of things. Horrible things. Things one might call 'snuff films'. No, they did not turn me on. Maybe a few. No. I dont think so. Maybe the ones that involved actual rapes? I dont know, and I dont want to think so. 
Did i ever feel like committing those horrible horrible things I saw? No. This I am very sure about. I had enough sanity. But once, I did have a fleeting thought of what it would be like to torture someone but had to discard the idea shortly as I felt uneasy. I DID wince whenever I saw those films, I wasn't immune to the gore, to the pain, to the reality. I HAD enough sanity. But I DID watch a lot of them. A lot.
Before I could tumble deep deep down into the sadistic abyss and quite possibly end up rewiring my brain, something happened.

I met an angel.

She was the purest of heart. You could see it in her eyes. In her smile. She was stunningly beautiful. Just thinking about her would fill me up with so much joy. The scenery in my mind would change into a grassland flooded with sunlight! She had that halo! 
I felt myself being pulled towards her. I started liking her. The more I thought about her and the more I got to know about her, the more I loved her. She had so much positivity in her! Enough to save me. Enough to bring out the original me. Mind you, the dark phase was totally not the original me. I have always considered my true self soft of heart since I was a kid. She brought out the light in me again. And turned it brighter than ever. 
We are attached now. We are both sociable and likeable btw. I have the support I always seeked. I don't feel alone anymore. She makes me the happiest person on the planet. And I to her.  I am caring and loving like no other. The type of guys one might only see in romantic movies. We truly love each other. I mean it, and she means it.
I can no longer stomach those horrible things. Just thinking about them makes me sick to my stomach now. 

I just want to tell you that people CAN change. At least, I have.

I have been with my gf for close to 2 years. But today she dropped a bombshell on me.

I had been trying to pursue her since uni. After being in the same clique as her  for a year plus, I made my move but was rejected because she said that she wanted to focus on her studies and did not want to be distracted. At the same period, we had an exchange student in one of our project groups. This was still in our uni days. I got together with her after graduation, with much pursuing on my part.

Today, when we were about to get intimate, she suddenly blurted out that she had slept with that groupmate back in our uni days. It took merely a month for him to get her into his bed. Both her and I still keep in touch with him via fb, but I don't really contact him much whilst she's in active contact with him.

I find it hard to take her seriously now, and question all that she has said to me over the course of our relationship. FML.

Does anyone know how to trust your SO again? I want to, but i'm just scared i'll be hurt again. Hopefully there will be someone who could offer a piece of advice..
-
 
I hope this doesn't get filtered. I really want to rant this out.

I don't get why this is constantly a recurring issue I face while studying in NUS libraries: people talking at their normal volume without even the slightest effort to lower their volumes

People get even noisier if seated in a group. Like just because they need to discuss something then they think it's okay to be talking relatively loudly, or even have a right to do so? Shouldn't you be moving your stuff outside/toilet area if you have discussion to do?

Is it that hard to be considerate towards your peers?

I'm currently serving my NS and will join NUS next year. I have no experience in terms of having a relationship. I dont drink or club, which is uncommon among my friends as they do it so often. 
I have never had any fwbs or ons before. 
I am wondering is it normal? Many of my friends have already done it and it seems like I'm the abnormal one.
Many told me to make new friends but i don't have a channel to do so. Any thoughts? Or do i have to wait till i get into uni and things may get better? 
-
 
Hey D, thanks for trying out this relationship with me one last time. But you know it will not work out. You said all I have to do is to trust you but I really cant. Everytime I start to trust you, you will flirt again or like another girl again. This time round, I already told you it is the last time I will be trusting you but you dissapoints me again. Lets not waste our time anymore. Bye for good. Hope you are happy with what you are doing now.

I have this guy friend whom I talk to occasionally on Facebook message.  We actually became friends when we were assigned as project group mates,  then he added me on Facebook and began talking to me. 

So this guy started to tell me things like I was his eye candy in school and that he had been noticing me for quite awhile.   He also told me about how he admires me for both my looks and character.   He said rather suggestive things such as that he actually enjoys going to school so that he can see me. 

Weird thing is that this guy is actually attached.  And he is a loving boyfriend at that.  I can vouch for that given that he also does tell me about sweet things he does for his girlfriend. 

He has clarified with me that his admiration for me is how he would admire a pop star/actress ie.  He just admires from afar and wouldn't think of anything more than that.  He said I am just like somemore out of reach for him. 

I find this all very weird.   Is it possible to be a good faithful boyfriend and at the same time have this weird dynamics with another girl?  

Just to clarify,  I am in no way interested in him at all.  He's just a friend to me.  Not trying to find a solution but just trying to satisfy my curiosity.

I've been suffering from depression for about three years. My time in NUS has been filled with ups and downs but more ups, which is good! Judging from the number of posts about NUS peeps suffering from mental disorders, I know I'm not alone. I'm going through a down phase right now though. I'm currently in second year and it sucks. Constant low moods and I lost sleep because of something very trivial. I'm super afraid of being judged badly and just let people trample over me just to seek their approval. I broke down, I lost hope, I can't live like this. I feel as if I'm alone and no one understands what I feel.

That being said, I found one of the best ways to cope with depression/anxiety disorders is to find people going through the same ordeal and support each other. I was pretty sad that to know NUS does not have a peer support group for people suffering from such mental disorders. UCH counselling holds work shops for anxiety but at $150, I'd rather not.

Also, for the people who think that you suffer from a mental disorder but have yet to get a diagnosis, do not be afraid to seek help. Go see a private psychiatrist, or go to a polyclinic and get a referral to see one at IMH/NUH. No one has to know about this, but I strongly recommend you let someone close to you know so that you have some form of support. Recovery can be long but you will see how strong you are and you will realise you are capable of so many things.

I was hoping maybe that I could create an informal support group(whatsapp first?) If you suffer from depression/anxiety/bipolar/whatever mental disorder and you feel alone, please email me @ luminatetritium@gmail.com with your NUS email and just say 'Hi!' or something, so that I know that you're from NUS. I'll email you back with my NUS email and we could create a Whatsapp group and maybe meet up if everyone is comfortable!

Hi! B77W here. And getting very amused at the comments.

Do people really think that fucking is like building up a CV? The more the better? Looking at the threads here... seems to me it's "YES".

After reading all the confessions on NUS Whispers, I get the impression that everyone else is doing it except me. Is there really such a libertine sex culture on campus? Or is it just that such confessions are over-proportionately represented on confession pages like NUS whispers because people get a thrill in confessing such things while remaining anonymous?
-
 
Recently i noticed that there have been many sex-related posts and I thought I could get some advice here as well. My girlfriend gets really aggressive everytime we do it, like very. (please dont filter this as what i need is advice)

Whenever she feels horny, she would push me onto the bed and then attempt to pull my clothes off, and whenever i tried resisting (which I cant, as she's pinning my hands onto the bed & that I do not want to hurt her by using too much counteractive force), she would jump on top of me and sit on me. Then she would proceed on to rip my undergarment off and then stimulate my genital with her mouth before giving some rough oral. 

My question is that, is this normal at all? Could other guys perhaps in similar situations give some advice? I, for many times have wanted to told her that I didn't like it when she gets so rough...

I saw a post on losing weight and the advice given were pretty good in my opinion. So I would like to ask for some advice for the opposite situation.

I am super thin, my BMI is severely underweight(<15). Since my dayd in secondary school, I somehow grew more than 20cm but only gained less than 10kg. I think the main reason for my situation is my super small appetite. I feel hungry frequently, but when I eat, I cannot even finish a normal plate of rice with 2 dishes. Anyone has advice on how to improve my appetite, or some other way to gain weight? Because being thin is nice, but being super thin is not good for health.

To  
This is from a girl's point of view. I suggest you try to get to know her first. Talk to her, initiate meals together or maybe studying together. Once both of you spend more time together it will naturally be more comfortable. Personally if a guy who has never spoken to me before  suddenly confessed, I wouldn't be put off. Although I'd most likely reject BUT suggest for us to start as friends first. It is better for both of you to get to know each other rather than rush into a relationship.
And to be honest try taking the initiative to know the girl, I know of some girls who will never take the first step or show interest even if they do like you. Good luck!

Seeing a couple of posts on depression, I thought I should share my story on this platform. To be honest I am not sure what's my motive, maybe I just want it to be made known to people who have depression and probably relate from it.

I wasn't clinically diagnosed with depression, but I know that I had mild depression. I won't go into the details on why I had depression, but I'd roughly say that it was due to multiple factors - financial, family, relationship issues. I was studying in a JC, and while everyone was doing well in at least an aspect of their lives, I was somewhat lagging behind. And after some time, it truly felt like my life was engulfed by darkness, where I would just be really passive and got really comfortable in the abyss. I know it sounds too fictional but when you're in it, you'll know it. I was aware that I was being really negative, and like I've said, I felt way too comfortable feeling really emotional, down and hateful for no apparent reason and so I did nothing to really "save" my own ass and get out of it. 

Somehow, some things got hold of me, which I can't exactly pinpoint on what they were, but after 1.5 years, I finally made the effort to climb out of the hole I've been hiding in for so long, and got out of depression. What helped me was friends, who stood by me throughout my really, really bad days (or year), and positivity from even the smallest things around me (like seeing a kid being all happy and trouble-less, and no, I'm not a pedophile). I started changing my mindset, and I was constantly telling myself to find anything that makes me happy, and invest in it. It was difficult, because of inertia in me, but I started somewhere; I started slow, and I am proud to say I fought the beast inside me.

So to whoever's reading this, if you have friends who have depression, please, do not shun them. Do not leave them in the lurch, but do not expect them to immediately open up or figuratively speaking, hold your hand when you offer them one. Give them time and space. Let them know you'll be there for them, and make sure you mean it. I know we've been told to get rid of any negativity in life, but if you think you can make a difference to someone's life, someone you care about, stand by them.

Hi guys, I'm a guy staying on campus and lately I've been noticing this girl from one of the other blocks. The sad thing is that I don't share any classes with her (that i know of) and the few times that we have had inter block activities, she always seems to be surrounded by friends, especially guys. From asking around, I know that she's green and that most of her close friends from her block are guys which for the most part, is a little intimidating for me since i don't know if they are interested in her/she is interested in them or if i will be able to break into her circle of friends. i don't know what to do or how to approach her but i'm captivated by the way she carries herself and how shes always laughing. Does anyone have any advice?? :)
-
 
Dear J,

It was nice getting to know you.
We hung out a couple of times after we first met and I truly enjoyed your company. You look cute when you smile and I like to tease you because you look adorable when you blush.
However, things got a little more serious and I told you that due to some personal reasons, we cannot go any further. You were very understanding and said that we can still be friends.

We don't really talk to each other now, though I wish otherwise. I refrain from texting you because I realised I like you a little too much so I don't wanna sink deeper into this when I know nothing can develop from it. I can't do that to you as well.
But somehow I still find myself looking forward to hearing from you. Every time I receive a whatsapp message, I hope it's you, maybe asking me out for lunch or whatnot. I look around me when I walk hoping I'll bump into you.
Maybe you're doing what I'm doing, or maybe you just don't wanna talk to me anymore. Either way, I suppose it's for the best. Hope you are well and good luck with your studies.

I'm 21 and evergreen. Like if there was a greener shade that green, I'll be that. I'd convinced myself the cost outweighs the benefits. I'd told myself that crushes would only crush my heart. 

How does it feels like to hold a girl's hand? How about going out with someone of an opposite sex? When your pulse rates increase, what does it feels like?  Does it resemble the anxiety I felt on the first day of school?

Whilst you fear for your lack of inexperience in the birds and the bees, I'm just worried what my parents think. It feels incredibly lonely to have your close friends so far away. I'm staying on campus out of convenience. All the socialization wears me out. I can let go of my inhibitions with close friends, but recently, making new friends has become such a humbling experience. 

To all mums out there: Just because your son doesn't ever let you meet any girl, doesn't mean his sexual orientation deviates from your expectations. Sometimes, he's just yet to sort out his issues to take on new ones.

I had sex with my girlfriend last week. It was pleasurable. The thing is i couldnt control myself and i unloaded on her chest. I like the feeling. However i was wondering if this turned girls on?
-
 
So my ex has recently found his SO. It's been 3 years, and I thought I have gotten over him and won't be affected if he found his SO. But now that he's attached, I realise I haven't really gotten over him. Any advice on how to get over someone you don't want to get over? I know I shouldn't check his social media but I still did for the past 3 years. I will stop checking on his social media from now on. Is there anything else I can do?

How do you tell whether a guy likes you... Or is just lonely and wanting your attention (but really doesn't have feelings for you)?

Especially when he continues to initiate to hangout when he knows the girl likes him...? But never really asks The Question/broach the topic of getting together?
-
 
To OP ,

How obvious were you? Unless you explicitly told him "I like you" there's a chance that he might not have read your hints (some people are just that blur, myself included hehehe). Just give it a shot! What's the worst that could happen? For all you know, he could be expressing his form of "liking you" as he's too shy to shoot the question himself. If you really like him, just go on ahead and ask :3 All the best!

I'm only in my second year of uni now and already I have matchmade three couples from my friend group over the past year or so. Whilst I'm still single and looking out for Ms Right to come into my life. 

I wonder why I have the luck to be Cupid to others, but I can't make my own luck at love? The feeling sucks, about as bad as unrequited love feels.

I'm 26 years old this year. I've been in 2relationships before and I'm currently attached but I am still a virgin. I have never tried sex and the closest I have been is heavy petting. Is it turn off if your future husband is a virgin and has no experience in bed?

It is not only the girls that are choosy but the guys as well. I mean, no male will want a female that is fat right? Or ugly or whatsoever. For males, please do not focus so much on pretty and physically attractive girls, because if you look around yourself, there are other nice girls with equally charming personalities that are deserving of love as well. And who knows, they might already have a crush on you but you failed to realise it when you are chasing for the most brilliant diamond and neglecting the other rubies, sapphires and emeralds (I am a pokemon fan) in the pile. 

May everyone find someone who will love them for who they are, and not for intense physical copulation only. Everybody is deserving of love and they are all brilliant in their own ways. One day, someone will notice you for who you are, and he/she is out there. 

TL/DR: Stop being choosy and end up being spinsters/bachelors at age 45. Learn to appreciate people for who they are.

to guy-who-takes-the-same-class-as-me,

i think you are very charming (-: i admit, i think your looks are above that of the average guy. but that's not why i'm attracted to you. 

from the small number of interactions we've had, i can see that you're smart, you're a hardworker & you've a big kind heart.    

& that smile of yours, it gives me butterflies in my stomach.

To the OP of . Hey buddy I have the same problem as you as well. I have been crushing on this girl in my tutorial class since the start of this semester. I have no idea how to get to know her and ask her out without coming seemingly creepy since I am a shy evergreen too, and time seems to be running out for me as well since the semester is coming to an end in more than a months time.

To the ladies reading NUSwhispers, will you be put off if a guy in your class whom you have never even spoken to before, suddenly confesses his feelings for you? 
-
 
I never thought I'd post one of these but...

I met you while volunteering. It was your first time, and by pure luck of the draw, you your friend and I were working on the same thing. I thought you were cute from the get go, and I was kind of disappointed you had to leave early. 

Then we met serendipitously as I was on the way home. You were heading back to Utown, and I was buying stuff because why not. I wonder if you could tell that i decided to drop off further down because I was enjoying our convo even though there were three of us? I was so happy that I could talk to someone about design and machining and mechanical engineering and startups... I felt so impressed by you and the way you carried yourself and the things you wanted to do. Argh, I swear I was swooning like a little boy on the inside. But a gorgeous girl like you must surely be attached already, right?

I really hope I get to see you again. Feelings of awe and crushing hard aside, I just can't describe how absolutely amazing it feels to be able to talk to someone about all the things I like and am aiming for in life with someone who seems so like minded. Sigh. *fidgets uncontrollably*

Im a girl and hv a high sex drive but I dun like talking about it. Im not interested in ons or fwb. I recently brought up the issue to my bf and he told me he was a bit disturbed by it. Nt sure how I should feel about it...pls dun troll, looking for advice..

To all the guys who think girls only like guys with deep pockets: you're wrong. 

 We like guys who understand girls have emotional needs which need to be attended to long before you even think about kissing or making love to us. 

 Girls like big dicks on the assumption sex will be better. If no big dick, girls like guys who prioritize/ensure she has cummed first, or at all. (i) Foreplay, foreplay, foreplaaaaayyy. But then we also like guys who aren't pushy for sex all the time. If you're being pushy & she's rejecting, see  & part (i) again.

 We like responsible guys cos it means we can probably rely on you to take care if us - like if the condom slips or if we accidentally fall in love with you throughout said r/s. 

But if you treat her like a little fucktoy, won't listen to her emotional problems or ask for FWB, can't make her cum or enjoy sex, don't have a big dick, likely to siam the minute she says her period hasn't come this month, 

Can you really blame girls for wanting a guy with deep pockets? If a girl is dating you for your money, it's prolly cos you suck at everything else but she just can't say it to you and bear to hurt your ego.

I have a problem. I am a perfectionist. Its not so bad when it helps in getting good grades but its becoming a problem because its the time of the semester where deadlines are all incredibly tight and yet I spend copious amount of time, right down to the last moment, to perfect my projects and essays. There is really no harsher critic other than myself and I would beat myself up over the smallest thing that went wrong, to the extent of being neurotic. I'm pretty sure this is a result of my upbringing especially with regards to studies. I find that I am incredibly tired and unmotivated because I need to get everything perfect and its too tiring to do so, and as a result I really do not feel like doing any of it. It always isn't this bad at the start of the semester because the deadlines were more spaced apart, but these few days I feel as though I'm about to reach my breaking point. Help. :(

Hi people, wanted to know your opinion on this. 

Recently I got closer to a friend of mine and we exchanged WhatsApp messages almost everyday. However, recently I could tell that the conversations doesn't seem to be flowing anymore. Like her replies get shorter and less frequent.

The problem is she's attached and I am single. But I am not interested in her as a potential gf. I am afraid she might be distancing herself from me cos she thinks that I am interested in her. 

Before you guys say that I might be oversensitive, I had looked at several things before concluding that she might be distancing herself from me. Like how her replies get shorter and less frequent over time. Or how she replies group messages (we're in some common group chats) much faster than she replies me.

I really don't wanna lose this friend but I don't wanna put her in a difficult position either. If she's feeling uncomfortable, I will naturally take a step back and see how from there?
-
 
It is weird that most girls I have dated would ask if I do drive. Their wide-eyed anticipation would reduce to a awkward silence when I said that I do not have a car and hence don't drive. Then again since when is it imperative that a guy need to drive to enter the dating scene? How impressive are undergraduates who drive a car that they did not work hard for ?
-
 
To the OP of . Thank you for posting what you did. I'm sorry you had to go through all that but your post is something I really needed. Like you, I'm from a low tier JC, and I've not made any friends for the past year. I sit alone in lectures and I hate it. I've gotten used to it by now, but it still sucks. I thought uni life would be exciting. But it's just the complete opposite.I'm honestly depressed and its affecting my studies. I try to ignore it. But going to school everyday and looking at people in cliques, surrounded by friends while you're all alone is just sad. I will definitely take heart from what you said in your post. Thanks again!
-
 
Today 12 oct 2015 you celebrated your 2nd year anniversary with him. He was my best friend and so were you, or so i thought. You two got together on this day 2 years ago, right before my A levels. Do you guys know what you did to me? I had to hold off my grief until after A levels to avoid screwing it up. But i guess you guys dont give a shit about it, like you did my feelings. I would wish You guys congratulations, but it would never ever be sincere. I cant bring myself to forget all the pain. I hope i can soon, its ruining my life, making me numb to all feelings. Oh well I guess that's life 
-
 
I am attached but I still tend to talk to quite a few guys regularly on WhatsApp (with the knowledge that they are interested in me).   I also meet them sometimes for meals but we draw the line  ie.  No physical contact except for maybe some light touches on the arm.  However because I'm scared that mu boyfriend will be jealous I hide all of this from him. 

Is this considered mild cheating?  As a guy,  would you break up with your girlfriend if you find out about this? 
-
 
The guy I'm dating is very introverted to the point where sometimes, I feel he doesn't want me around in public. He'll find some reason to go somewhere which us different from where I'm going even if i have no plans to go anywhere. He's okay when we're in private though. I'm a very extroverted person and extremely attention seeking. I just want to spend time with him and have his attention but it appears like that's a very big chore for him. Are introverts normally like this? I confronted him today and he apologised for just wanting to be alone so that he could get work done. How can I relate to him better without feeling like I'm being a nuisance? Help me NUS kaki!!! 
-
 
This is just an observation about FASS Arts Camp and O Week. I find that the people who have attended Arts camp are super clique-y. And it's worse because the freshies become counsellors for O week and they just don't really care about making friends. They persist in their own bubble of exclusivity and even when having gatherings they will just have their own little clique outings. What's the point of o week then really? Not everyone can attend arts camp and is quite unfair. o week is a huge disappointment always.
-
 
I would also like to thank the OP of  as I can relate to it. I really needed it because it showed that people who did not do any wrong can still be excluded/bullied. I'm really glad for the post as I couldn't understand why it was so hard to make friends and was excluded e.g. being lied to that someone's car had no space to include me so I had to walk alone, ignored messages asking whether I could sit with them during lectures, even while sitting together they did not really bother talking to me etc. I asked my friends why I was treated so badly and they actually told me to find out what I did wrong. This may make sense but I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong and my friends couldn't suggest anything either. It was really hurtful that i was told to be nicer when I didnt do anything wrong and as I was sure they were determined not to include me in their clique from the outset, they were not welcoming from the start. I'm sure it was also because I was of not much use to them as I was not popular, no connections, not that smart and these are prized things in my faculty. I lost interest in studies feeling bad I couldn't fit in and scored a mediocre CAP but I managed to get a much better CAP the next semester. I would advise people going through this to not be so harsh on yourself, find those less superficial people who will like you for your sincerity and personality and not what you can offer and please don't neglect your studies. In fact try to score well and push them down the bell curve, I suppose they deserve it.

To girls: would you care about your boyfriend's past/break up with him if it means he was quite promiscuous - like having ONS or he has visited hookers before.
-
 
Ok, I don't understand why some people keep being so pessimistic about their grades when they probably got like only 4-5 questions wrong? And the thing is these people are usually very smart and they should know it too (given by their stellar results). So, I don't really understand why they do not have more confidence in themselves. Sometimes, they keep talking about how they are going to fail, and my inner thoughts were like, 'ok, who is the one who is really going to fail -.-'. 
-
 
To 

Have you told him directly that you are not interested in him anymore? He may have gotten your message, but because you're nice and don't want to say anything hurtful to him, he may still continue to think about you. This makes it very hard for him when he's trying to move on.

Hi there! Please do not filter this post as this is important, admins ! Thank you! In addition to this note, it's not either a troll post or a plot twist.

I am going to be 22 in next month time and evergreen. I would like to ask the audience of this NUSWhisper page for the opinions. Is it fine to lose my virgnity on my birthday at this age?? Will guys accept this? I am single anyway . 

I know it sounds stupid but oh well, my hormones have been going on and off. I managed to hide the fact from my family for 5 years which I did heavy petting with my exes. To be honest, they didn't know how to do proper sex with me. *facepalm* 

Sometimes I think I am thankful because I don't lose it to them as it is damn precious to me. So therefore, I wonder it is all right to lose it to the strangers who idk?? I would like to hear what you have to say about this! Ty!

How can I stop being overly-attached? 

My boyfriend complained/hinted to me that I am overly attached, meaning not giving him enough personal time. Maybe it's just me, when I love someone, I would want to be with him as much as possible, see him as often as possible, and I wouldn't mind discarding my other plans or neglecting other less important things just to see him. I find myself constantly thinking about when's the next time we can meet, preparing surprises to make him happy, and spending a long time to think about what to wear. But I think I am suffocating him. It's not like I don't have my own work to do, but when it comes to him... I am just willing to give all I have. So when he doesn't show the same amount of ethusiasm or give the same amount back, I do get a little upset. He said he should not be the centre of my universe.

How can I get over this lonely feeling, and what can I do to change? To not come across as overly-attached?

"Being brave isn't about not feeling fear. Saying that you must be brave without fear is like saying you must be strong without muscle, or wise without age. It is an impossibility. Being brave is simply feeling fear, but overcoming it because you know that what you do is more important than the fear you feel. I look into each of your eyes and see fear, but I look into each of your eyes and see bravery." By ThePieAndFighter 

Such a inspirational comment when i was listening to the youtube video titled "4 Hours of The Best Epic Inspirational Music". Really anxious about giving presentations since it has always been an challenge. Wish me luck for my preparation. I am gonna nail it.

To my 'Angel' in real estate,

We've known each other since our JC days (I still remember our econs lessons together!) Even though the last time we hung out was a few weeks ago, and we didn't quite get to catch Ant-Man, I've been thinking of you ever since. I know I might not be good enough for you, but I'm willing to try to become the man you deserve. There's still a couple of months till I'm out of the army, but I can't wait to join you in NUS. :)

I'm facing a relationship crisis now and i wanna know whether it is normal for a guy to slap a girl's face or even strangle her throat during sex? My bf never fails to do that to me every single time we make out. Although he didn't use a lot of force, I felt that his actions are degrading me. Moreover, he has this weird habit of spitting into my vagina before penetrating me. He simply refused to apply the lubrication gel that I brought for him. Whenever I bring this issue up, he will quarrel with me and threaten to break up. Fast forward to his 24 birthday, he requested anal sex from me as his birthday present. Under the influence of alcohol, I reluctantly agreed to his idea, hoping that he will cherish me more, if i made these sacrifices for him. Despite knowing that I was experiencing immense pain, he continued to force his way into my anal canal. I tried to push him away and yelled at him, but he didn't stop pounding me rapidly. The pain is so unbearable and i started crying, he then finally came to his sense and started consoling me. I got hurt so bad that it took me nearly half an hour to recover and get off from the bed.

Do my boyfriend truly love me? Perhaps I knew the answer already... But this is my 1st relationship, should I give up just like that?

Ok so i am in a serious dilemma right now. While i am not her first guy but my gf is the first girl that i have ever been with and our relationship is going on to the 4th year now. So just recently my gf proposed her idea of having a threesome, with another female friend of hers. She told me that it is because she has been with other guys before, and knowing that she is the first girl that i have ever been with, she does not want me to feel like missing out. I am really grateful that i have such a caring gf who is concerned about my sexual experience, but it keeps bothering me. What if she is trying to test my loyalty, or maybe she really does want me to go along with it. Or even the case that she turns bi and have sexual interest in girls and want us to have a threesome, which i actually do not mind that much as long as her feelings are with me. Not to generalise but i think most guy would be ok?, if not excited about a threesome with a hot gf and another equally attractive female friend. So what should i do now?

My SO is on exchange right now and she has been spending all of her spare time taking part in social activities. We whatsapp each other but she hardly replies me because she is occupied with other people. We only have skype sessions about once a month, about an hour long each time. I've tried asking her to make some time for us, but she says she wants to enjoy her exchange. This is a yearlong exchange and I am not sure what's in our future. As a benchmark, we used to have meals about 2-3 times a week, and go somewhere once a week before she left. We also whatsapped quite constantly. Any advice? I understand that being in a LDR often means cutting down some time but I think my girlfriend isn't keen to put in the effort. Am I asking for too much? 
-
 
my gf doesn't seem to be interested in the kind of things that i am interested in... n it's mutual like she's into a lot of "cool" stuff (that average gal doesn't like) but guys tend to like. but i dont. i try to understand more about her hobbies and spend time on them but it is not mutual. does the strength of a relationship come from shared experiences and hobbies? or is compatible personalities good enough?
-
 
We're only friends but my heart sinks every time I remember that you're probably going to meet a nice girl who will match you perfectly. Someone you like, someone who's going to make you smile. 
Even though you're going to be in a different faculty when you enter next year, I still wonder if we will cross paths once again.

My girlfriend and I have started having sex. It started out quite well the first time as we were both kinda new at it so it was fun and "innocent" and cheeky and awkward. But the last two times, she's started becoming a little too aggressive and she's basically slapping me and scratching me, drawing blood. I don't want to sound like a wuss, but I'm just being honest when I say it really hurts. I guess it's kinda my fault too because the first time she did it, I acted all manly and pretended to like it. How do I tell her to stop? What if this is what turns her on? What if she decides that I am not manly enough?

I CANNOT GO BACK TO BEING SINGLE AND NOT HAVING SEX. I WAITED 25 YEARS AND I CANNOT GO BACK!

anyone has any good tips on how to stalk people on facebook  better. so far I have only discovered how to check the post and pictures that the person liked. (Yes, I know im a noob)

Year 4 engine student here. I am already graduating soon and have not found love during the 4 years of study here. I have never had a girlfriend before and so I don't know what it is like to be in a relationship, and I fear that girls don't like inexperienced guys like me. I have had many crushes before, but this fear kept preventing me from approaching them at all. I would think about all the possible ways how the interaction would go wrong with me being such an awkward person and in the end after thinking so long, the moment has passed and I lost the opportunity to talk to her.

Recently, I have been noticing this girl, but I don't really have the chance to spend time with her as we are in different courses and we only see each other once a week during practices, and even during the practices we would not have a chance to interact at all. To this date, I have never even introduced myself to her. I really don't want to keep missing out on opportunities and life like this, and I want to ask her out for a date or something. 

Should I just ask her out? Or should I get to know her better first, by saying hi and making small talk, but wouldn't it be too slow this way considering we won't get much interaction during practices at all? 

-
 
 Perhaps he's also afraid of embarrassment and you don't seem too enthusiastic about conversing with him e.g. taking a seriously loonnnngggg... time to reply. Since he isn't the aggressive and bold type, you probably need to ask when in doubt :/ Ask!

My boyfriend has a bit of a reputation as a player and he's had quite a number of fwbs and sexual experiences. He's been honest with me about all this from the start and I've always felt that I could be okay with his past. However, recently when I think about it I feel very bothered. When I see him texting or snapchatting I will wonder if he's ever been with that girl, and I feel insecure especially since he has a lot of good looking female friends. I try very hard not to think about it and have yet to bring it up to him as I do not want him to feel like I don't trust him. He matters a lot to me and I really want this relationship to work out. What can I do to get over it?

To the guy who smiled at me yesterday. I'm a guy btw. Thanks for smiling at me even though we don't know each other well. I think we were from the same JC. I remembered your smile because unlike some of my acquaintances who don't even smile when they see me, you did. Even though we don't know each other well.

So thank you. Thanks for making my day.

I had this crush on a girl and we would go out / have dinner alone occasionally. Its mostly a impromptu thing like do you want to have dinner tml? 
Around one month ago I asked to go to somewhere she said she will think about it (she told me it will be more fun when theres more ppl). Then recently when we had dinner she brought up the thing again and asked me if I wanted to join her and her friends.
She had went out with me alone before so is it for the sake of really having more fun or she wants to avoid being with me alone?

We asked each other out for dinners so I guess we are quite comfortable with each other?

Hello to all the couples out there! I just want to ask how you and your partner communicated before you two officially got together (still in the wooing phase). Were the texting and meeting up very frequent? Did both of you take the initiative to start conversations or is it mostly one person doing it all the time?
I got closer to an acquaintance a while back and we started texting. We seem to hit off well and I can tell she puts in as much effort as I do to not let our conversations die. We usually reply to each other's WA messages the moment we see them, pretty much like instant messaging, and if something comes up she'll let me know with a ttyl and then resume the conversation later. All the signs are looking good except that she rarely initiates text conversations and I'm usually the one who does it. She has a shy personality so I'm not sure if this is normal or that she's not interested and I shouldn't try to take this to the next level.
Sorry for the wall of text, any constructive input is much appreciated!

Anyone out there feels like once you've reached a certain age being single, you inevitably tend to (consciously or unconsciously) wonder/fantasize if your other single friend could become a potentially significant other?  

I'm evergreen and totally ready to be single for life and depend on myself because I know I can (I also quite like the freedom), so I don't think I'm THAT desperate. But yet, I am also open to relationships IF they happen. Recently when I met new single friends, no matter how hard I try to keep the interaction innocent and focus on the person as a friend, there will be this thought at the back of my mind that says that, objectively speaking, there IS a possibility that this friendship might become something more. And then I feel like my friendships aren't that innocent and pure any more.

I usually don't act on those thoughts (well unless the other person hints positively) and after a while it doesn't affect me that much, especially if I conclude that I'm not interested in the other person in a romantic way.  I feel like gone are the days of true and innocent friendships for me, that is not affected by romantic interests at all. Or maybe this is just me entering a new phase of my life in mid-20s, when we have evolved to start looking for potential partners as a priority.

 It's perfectly normal... I have been through the same. If she loves you for who you really are, as you say, then she loves you whether you're inexperienced or not. Don't worry about those petty things. You have got to put an end to that kind of thinking at some point, if you expect to trust the other person. It might as well be now.

Girls don't care as much about it as you think they do. And guys don't care as much about small things as girls think they do. Reading these confessions, sometimes it feels like everyone is caught up in the little details of life that are irrelevant in the end. Stop overthinking.

I don't know if it's just me... or is it the case that the people you meet in NUS are somewhat superficial? Like for example if I form a project group with a few others I never met before, most of the time we get on just fine, meeting up for discussions and what not. But as soon as the project is over everyone just disperses, like leaving the whatsapp group, never to be seen again. Most of the time our conversations never go beyond the project and the usual school stuff like "what modules are you taking this sem? Do you plan to take xx1234 next sem" and so on. 

I'm in year 2 now and up till now i have not made a single good friend in NUS. Most of the time i hang out with people i already knew like from JC. I mean i do know quite a number of other people around from past project groups and if we happen to bump into each other in school it's just "hi, bye" kind of thing. It's not that I'm feeling depressed or whatever, but it is just a really different lifestyle from JC where everyone is pretty close. So i would like to ask is it just me? Or does this happen to everyone else also? And lastly i would like to ask whether this is the case in the working world as well? Cos if it is then i wouldn't give a second though about this. Do comment below if you can offer any advice and thanks for reading.

Did anyone used NUS's CPS services before? My emotional health isn't exactly that strong and I have been internally debating for 2 years if I should go any try it out. So far in the past, the bad thoughts would fade after a while but nowadays the thought lingers 24/7 in my head even though I am laughing and having a good time with my friends. 

I'm honestly scared that I may be judge for overreacting as honestly sometimes I don't think I'm depressed at all. And I can't ask any of my friends cause of my own personal psychological barriers plus on the outside I am often depicted as the cheerful bimbotic girl. 

Please advice.

Is being a competent female too intimidating?

I don't mean to be arrogant, but whenever I talk to guys about something I'm passionate and knowledgeable about, it always ends up in stunned silence and awkwardness. I usually end up apologizing because I've rambled too much. I feel like this kind of pushes them away.

Should I dumb it down?
-
 
To  Please don't hesitate to seek some help if you feel like you need it! I've used their services before and it was really the turning point for me. Even if you feel that you can't connect with the first counsellor assigned to you, I think they do offer the option of switching to another counsellor if you want to. 

Anyway I think there's a misconception that you have to have 'serious' issues before seeking such services. Who defines serious anyway, it doesn't really make sense to let other people's opinions and judgement stop you from making an active decision to start feeling better about yourself. It's your life, and you're the one reaping the benefits or losing out from it, not everyone else. My experience with counsellors (external ones as well) are that they really provide a listening ear and open mind regardless of what you say, making it easier to confide in them since they won't have a pre conceived notion of who you are. They don't tell you what to do, but rather give you new perspectives and ask you questions that help you to find yourself on the right path again. 

I would recommend you to try out just once and see how it's like? It's free anyway, so no harm trying. If you're afraid of the social stigma associated, then maybe don't tell anyone about your first visit or just confide selectively in those you trust and know will support you. 

I also thought that my issue was not serious and this led to a rapid deterioration of my condition. Like you, I was good at keeping up with appearances such that I managed to lie to everyone, even my family. I think no one would have known what was going on if I chose not to tell anyone. But I chose to voice out because I wanted to get better and was sick and tired of being, well, sick and tired haha. Sometimes I wish I didn't wait until I hit rock bottom before starting to climb up. 

So good luck OP! Just sharing my experience and opinions. Hope that regardless your decision, you'll be able to find a way to cope with your problems soon!

okay, so i have started seeing this girl a month ago, and shes really cute and nice and for once in life there's a girl that likes me for who i am than what i have in my wallet. certainly some of the qualities i look for in a girl, except that one thing has been bugging me alot. When we had discussed on our imtimate lives, she had revealed that she had indeed slept with her previous bfs and had sexual relationships as well. As someone who had never dated much and had confidence issues when it came to girls, i am a 26 year old virgin. Now my problem is that i can get the fact that she's been with other guys out of my head and its been bugging me ever since she told me that. I am also very afraid that my lack of inexperience might affect our future relationship.  So how do i get over this problem of mine? isit normal for a guy to have this in his head? 
-
 
the sad moment when you realize you can't get over the guy you actually like for once. i always imagine myself being his girlfriend whenever he tells me his parents don't like his current girlfriend. whenever he complains to me about his girlfriend, i'll tell him what to do to fix it because i know he's happy with her. to him, we're just close friends. but to me, i'm like dying on the inside. I've tried dating but honestly.... it isn't even working. sometimes late at night i just get so emotional about it...... and i sometimes do think that i maybe i truly don't like the guy i'm dating and i'm doing that just to cover up the fact that i still like my friend.

This is a letter to my ex and I know you will be reading this. With this break up comes its lessons. Thank you for teaching me how to be independent and to deal with pain/loss. Thank you for teaching me that I need to love myself better first. Thank you for loving me and trying to do everything to make me happy. Truthfully, you have hurt me very deeply and I can't yet find it in me to wish you and your new gf well. Especially since we've been together for 4 years now. Though you still want to be friends, I think I rather not see you again so soon. Maybe in future we will meet again stranger if we should be so lucky.

Today on Facebook Memories, I saw an Instagram post that I made a year ago of my (now ex) boyfriend. It reminded me how much I loved him. I wanted to marry him, and I was so sure we would. But I was lying to myself through social media. I was trying to convince myself that things were still the same as it was early in the relationship. They weren't. We broke up a few months after that. It was mutual. It was civil. We're still friends, and I'll always look fondly at our memories together. 

Circumstances can change so fast. Treasure the people in your life while they are in them and keep them close.

To  i sort of went through similar things. Life is unfair. Let it go and don't go head on with your mum. If you don't, you will only be miserable. Think, it won't kill you to do the housework right? Tell yourself you have done well after completing housework and be proud because you are better than your sis. Love your mum. You can try expressing her language of love to your mum so that she can shut an eye about you not doing some housework. It will be hard but try it :)

I like how you act so bold and then appear so shy.

I like how irritating you can be in trying to get attention.

I like how real you always are, and smile and laugh so much.

& hello!

Hi there, I am the OP of  and I would really like to thank OP of ! You really made my day a whole lot better :) It's really a struggle but I will remember your words. All the best to you as well!

I've been dating a guy for a few month but I can't keep my attention off another guy i always see in dining hall. He's mixed asian, i think on exchange, and i always see him eating alone at cinnamon dining hall. I'm too shy to talk to him or offer to eat with him, but he always catches me staring at him.

Is it wrong for me to have feelings for another guy even when dating my current boyfriend for so short? Should I approach this guy or would it be considered unfaithful?
-
 
There's this acquaintance who has been initiating text conversations with me, although he often allows them to die off. Because of that, I'm unsure if he feels anything for me..and unfortunately I'm starting to develop a tiny crush on him after considering the possibility that he could be interested. What can I do to find out if he's truly interested wo going through any embarrassment if I'm wrong?

Hi! It's the B77W once again!

 I can understand. You thought you found your answer until some better one comes along.

I think part of the chase is also finding out who's really suitable for you. Take heart, because I don't actually think you're a jerk. At some point in time, we have to realise that loving someone is really all about finding best fit. Sometimes, it sucks to have to take oneself out of commitment, but I think it's fine. Heartbreaking, perhaps, but it might be better for you. Yes, love is selfish.

 Thank you. As a B77W I realised I'm made to fly to so many different places. Only 90 minutes of turnover time when I land at an airport besides my base. I need to go for my preventive maintenance soon.

Hello  and 

I think you 2 are the same OP?

I am OP of . Thanks to the Internet for putting up with these to & fro whispers coz we really have no way to identify each other. I really hope admin will still post this!

But from the description in 10446, I'm (sadly) beginning to doubt whether I am the girl in question. It would really have been nice...

Do you think you can also disclose why the circumstances are unsuitable? But whatever it is, I hope you succeed eventually :)

But to other guys, if you know a girl likes you, and if you decided to friend zone her... If you keep asking her to hang out, it may actually be very confusing to her...
-
 
I am a guy who was attached for 2 years, but I met another girl and fell in love with her. Eventually I broke up and went on to date this girl, and I feel much happier to be with her than my ex. Some people classify me as a jerk, and I do feel guilty towards my ex, but is this my fault?
-
 


try on Mon to Thur msg her. then suddenly stop ~

u see if she got msg u over the weekend ~

if not, move on. She have no right to keep you hanging.

Hello you,
Recently you asked whether I like [liked] anyone [recently] and I replied no. It's embarrasing&clichéd but I think I'm starting to find that you're someone I could end up liking [especially after these few weeks of you helping me with my awkward guy misunderstandings]. I know you're a sociable/helpful person by nature so I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into your actions [unlikely you'll even see this anyway!], but if I am reading too much into things and in the tiny chance that you do read this, thanks for being such a great friend (: 

[&sorry if I'm unintentionally preventing you from going after whoever you like!]
-
 
To ,

Yes it is your fault. Put yourself in your ex's shoes. Imagine you are happily in love with your gf with no signs of any issues, you have always loved your gf the best way you knows, then your gf dumps you because she met another guy and fell in love with him. Going by the scant information you provided in your post, you met the girl while with your gf, and you fell for her despite being attached. You fell out out of love with your ex willingly. The timelines overlap, which actually makes you a cheater. Love is a choice, not a passing feeling. So yes it's your fault.

No it's not your fault. If your gf abused you and treat you like trash, you fought so hard for the r/s that you are driving yourself insane to save it. Then this girl came along and showed you how love can be kind. Then no, it's not your fault. 

So it depends. But the past is the past, what matters is going forward. We live for ourselves, why care what people say about you. You were attached for 2 years before your eyes wandered, that's when the honeymoon period ended. How can you ensure it does not happen again in this r/s, that's the key.

"No one falls in love by choice, it is by chance.
No one stays in love by chance, it is by work.
And no one falls out of love by chance, it is by choice."

I hope you continue to love your gf. You may not see it now, but everyone has flaws, you don't love because of your partner's virtues, but despite her flaws.

And don't try to contact your ex to alleviate your guilt (for your selfish reasons). Trust me, I was in your ex's shoes, and she won't want you to contact her anytime soon. 
-
 
To OP of 10408...

Sorry but do you mind disclosing a bit more detail? Especially if you're a guy or girl... 

I am a girl... & not sure if you might be talking about me (if you're a guy...)

But from what I heard from a mutual friend, I might be unfortunately friend zoned... Just not sure if he changed his mind (which I also heard that guys don't usually)... 

All the best to you still :)

This is a legit question and not a troll. Im a girl and im not very good looking but im attracted to this really cute guy. Im not interested in a relationship, only perhaps ONS or on a FWB basis. How do i approach him regarding this? Will he be disgusted and tell the whole world about my proposition? Im quite afraid of what his reaction might be
-
 
Scenario: A girl who was out on the streets late at night was wearing skimpy clothing, and some guy attacks and rapes her. He gets away, never found, so we don't know what the reason for rape was. 

To the guys (and only guys): What would you say to her? How do you think she would respond to what you had to say?
-
 
To OP of  (not sure if correct post, but it's the one on how the mum always gets son to do chores), check out this subreddit called raisedbynarcissists. I can't really offer advice since I've not had that kind of experience, but I think you'll be able to find some comfort in knowing that you're not the only one who has this kind of parents. You may also be able to seek advice there, but from what I've read, the children (those in your shoes) usually move out because your mum has a particular personality trait that prevents her from understanding the needs of other people (i.e. you) so you can't really hold a proper discussion with her without her flying off the handle.

My own advice would be you'd have to continue to tolerate this or try to speak to your sister or dad about it and see what you can do from there. If things get serious, it may be best to consult a professional family counsellor. Then again, I don't know the full context of your situation so this might not be a sound advice.

Ultimately this is about your mental wellbeing in the long term so do speak to someone about this if you can. But if you have ample emotional support outside of your family and you're confident you're able to tolerate your mum's actions, it may be best to leave things as it is to avoid things getting out of hand (I'm assuming a worst case scenario here, I don't know if your situation is as bad as I picture it to be.) Best of luck.

Hi guys. Freshman here.
From not so well off family here so we cant afford to hire a maid, and thus we do the housework by ourselves.

But, this is where my problem comes in; between me and my sis, my mum keeps telling to do the chores at home, like washing dishes, starting washing machine, hanging up the clothes to dry, cook, ...etc. Sister virtually does not get asked to/doesnt do anything (she is a final year at NTU going through internship). Sister doesnt seem to be super squeezed for time either. Let me add on that this has actually been going on for atleast 3 years already; I had a stay out vocation during NS and still had to do chores after coming home from exhausting 12 hour shifts. AFTs will know my pain.
But when i mentioned to my mum today that she should ask my sis to do a fair share of the chores, my mum went absolutely bat shit crazy when she so called 讲输, or "loses the conversation"(mind you, wasnt a agrument). She then goes on this rampage, shouting to tell me not to do anything anymore, saying that she is stressed that i always complain (like what? 3 times in my life?) And she will even proceed to do every house chore in the house that is left, and undo anything that i did already (i.e. switching off the washing machine that was in progress). I feel guilty and super unfillal to cause this whenever i bring this up, but sometimes i really cannot take this super apparent bias. I dont like it like too, when someone asks you to do something, you then push it to someone else too.

Im super ok to with chores, as any that i do means my mum can do one less. But my sis apparently does not share my mindset. She has even proclaimed before she hates chores and will defintely hire a maid next time when she works. 

What should i do? Should i just 认命 and never complain again? Or should i talk to my sis directly?

has there been a case where two people go for exchange, and 3 people come back?

I can't help but notice that the guys in NUS are rather shy (or at least they appear to be because they tend to "friend zone" girls a lot of the time, maybe they do that to hide their feelings incase the girl is not interested? I don't know) But after 8 weeks, I've seen loads of situations in which the guy drops a hint at the girl and she responds positively but then he retreats and pretends it never happened.   (We have at least 3 years of university, which means at least 1095 days to find the "other half", that's a lot of time for trial and error...BUT I'm not saying to just go around and have a million short term relationships!)  So... that just makes it hard for me to tell whether a guy is interested in me. On somedays, I want to sing aloud to my heart's content (because he gives me an impression that he likes me) and on other days I hope for a thunderstorm so I have a reason to drown my sorrows in my room with a tub of chocolate ice-cream. (Maybe I misinterpreted his actions, maybe I thought too far...) But how am I supposed to tell, if he's doesn't take the first leap of faith???

Advice for guys from a girl's point of view: if you're gonna drop a hint, don't retreat, don't EVER lead a girl on and then just leave her hanging there! (She'll find someone else) And if you're going to take the first step, take a BIG step, if the interest is not mutual, you got nothing to lose, (if she talks about it to her "clique" you sure that's the girl you still want to be with?)

My boyfriend is not "the one" and I don't know how to tell him that. Every time I try to express discontent, he tells me he will change, but he doesn't, or even if he does, it is not sustainable. 

I love him very much and desperately wanted it to work out but deep down, I know it won't because that's not in him. Part of me feels like I should be a good gf and compromise because I should love him for who he is instead of changing him. But I don't think I am okay living with this for the rest of my life. I really don't know what to do. 
-
 
I'm in a loving, committed relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. But i still get a rush when cute guys notice me or when i get many friend requests from guys on facebook. I actually even changed my profile picture to the chio-est i could find because i love the rush i get from all the attention i receive. 

However, i never acted on any advances. I always let guys know i'm unavailable when they get too close. Is what i'm doing still wrong?
-
 
please don't filter this. 

i want to get to know a guy better. i am a girl. our interactions so far have always been in a group. beyond this group, we have never hung out just the two of us. i'm not romantically attracted to him. i just wish to deepen our friendship. however, i'm afraid to ask him to hang out, as i'm not sure if he will take it wrongly. i don't know him well enough to know his relationship status. i don't know if he's cool with hanging out with me alone. so i'm scared that if i ask him, he'll be scared off, and we won't even be able to become close friends. how can i go about trying to get to know this guy better in a manner that would be comfortable for him? 
-
 
 as someone who has been in the same boat as you (twice), I say delete his number. The only way to really avoid texting him is to try to be as rational as possible (though I know it's really hard). If you text him to show how mad you are, you're just giving him the satisfaction of thinking "yeah I made the right choice leaving the relationship". The reason why I say this is because I did that before, and I kind of regret how much power it gave him on hindsight.
I know it doesn't feel like it now, but you're better off without him if he can dump a 3-year relationship and get with another girl so soon. Another way to look at it is that maybe you two weren't right for each other, and now you have a chance to look for the right guy (or remain single if that's what you want, which is also cool!). Stay strong OP. You will get over this!

(Also, I used to like NUSWhispers a lot but sometimes the number of troll comments on a post which is sincerely looking for help is quite astounding. Have you ever thought that maybe OP was looking for advice because she was really stuck? Guess you all have nothing better to do, so here's yet another post for you to be all troll-y on.)

Should one be friends with someone who has feelings for them, without reciprocating them? Is it cruel to continue being friends? Considering that one has to meet them everyday in school, what should be done? Where to draw the line???

Got dumped by my ex 2 months ago and now he's happily dating another girl after the 3 years that we spent together. I hate him so much and seriously I want to give a him a piece of my mind. Anyone has good advice on how to avoid texting your ex?
-
 
There is so much on my mind but I can't say it to you. It would be inappropriate at this point of time, given our circumstances.

I like how you make me forget the person that broke my heart. 

I like how you remember all the tiny details. 

I like how you are so earnest, smile and laugh so much. 

I hope this feeling is mutual. :) 

(I think you read the posts from this page, so hello! You make my heart skip a few beats and I look forward to see you again. No I did not friendzone you.)

My gf and I are in the same clique of friends at school. Her birthday is coming. Do people in this situation usually buy a personal present for her + buy amother present that will be shared among the group of friends?
-
 
/rant

I don't understand people who ask "where and what time" in a group chat when these exact details were said less than an hour ago.

We all don't expect you to be at your phone 24/7 but is it that straining on your cognitive resources to read the convo?

Even when another person in the group graciously said "can check the convo above hahahaha", all your ego could muster was "so wud time and whr"

Especially when the total messages sent were less than 20.

Why do so many girls in Singapore have 'not here for hook-ups' or 'no fwb' in their profiles?  Are the men on tinder really creepy here, are the girls prudish, or do they just hope to find someone serious through an app like Tinder?

If only I had known you 1 year earlier. I would not have to go with the heart-ache that brought me to my knees today. 

If only I had known you, opened up to you, and made you my gf, 1 year earlier, would my future today have been different? Would I have been different, because of you?

If only I had not behaved as a weirdo (though I still, quite notoriously, am a weirdo), then perhaps, you would have seen me in a different light?

If only, at that time, I were to be as wise as I am now, instead of being hot-blooded and desperate then, would we have had a future together?

If only I had made a move 1 year earlier, I would not be... Bro-zoned!!!! 

Haha, hey, all's well, it's actually better this way; nothing much of a huge mess will ever come out of it, and I am content just by being beside you. 

Understanding you better,I understand that we're not really that compatable at all.

I will not do anything to sully your name, and much less, will I make a cheater out of you, despite what others might think, and say. 

I don't mind dirtying my own name and reputation - I have nothing of such value to lose anyway. The one thing, that I am afraid of losing, will the one very good friend I had, that being you.

The world may see me as a lunatic, I don't care, because I only care about who you see in me. You see, and accept me for who I am. 

You are the rare gem that I have struck. Thank you for being there for me.

I do not understand why some people do not like to reply my Whatsapp or sms messages. We have not met for some time and I just wanted to catch up over lunch. The double blue ticks on Whatsapp showed me that the messages sent have reached and have been read, but they just chose to completely ignore, even after I've sent a second message just in case they didn't get it. I mean even if they are not free at least reply a "no". Rest assure I am not going to ask any of them out for a meal anymore because it is just not worth my effort.

From talking to my friends, Sg guys are really cynical and disillusioned about dating girls. They think it's all about the money, or that gfs are troublesome... 

Why not go dutch? Gender equality (to girls, expecting guys to pay is also gender inequality)! If the girl says you should pay and you don't like that, then just dump her?? Especially if you don't want to spend your future with someone whose values with money are different from yours.

Also if spending time with your gf is so troublesome, why get a gf?
-
 
I am interested in this girl from a group. Not so much that I 'like' her romantically, but I would love to ask her out and know her better before anything else. 

In the past 2 years, any guys who stated their interests to girls were ostracised, labelled "desperate/despo" and "creep". They has taught me the important lesson of survival in this group: never confess/cheehong/show any outright romantic interest to the opposite sex. For the first time in my life, I am fitting in well in a social community. I like things the way it is right now. I don't want to upset the balance right now. Whenever such events happen, either the guy or girl will voluntarily leave the group to prevent any awkwardness, the remaining guys are often alienated and eventually stopped existing in the group. 

Things are just larger than 2 person right now. I can't "just do it" and only expect 1 less friend.

I usually club with a small group of regular guy friends (I'm a girl). I previously dated one of them but we broke up, but I am still close to the rest of his friends. When we go out to club, I tend to slut it out (dance pretty inappropriately). I've been told by guys in the club that I'm a good dancer (aka dance until damn slut lol). But I don't dance with guys that approach me especially recently. When I first started clubbing this year I did dance with random guys, but for many months now I haven't. I have started to like one of the guys in the group of guy friends (main reason why I reject the guys who approach now). However this guy has seen me dance really slutty with other guys in the past, and I DID date his friend. Is there a chance that I am still viewed as dateable to him? ): Like proper girlfriend not a fling type?

How do you get over someone who has been such a huge part of your life and was such an inspiration to you? It has been more than 3 years and I'm still holding onto the feelings for him. Although I do feel sad whenever those memories resurface, I don't ever want to forget anything because those memories are precious. I've tried everything to get over him, from dating other people and immersing myself in work that I love. But whenever the night rolls around the corner, my mind just drift to him. I still miss him so much and have become extremely jaded.

I'm a socially awkward person and don't really enjoy being in big groups. Which brings me to me to my point. Even though I joined a couple of school activities during my freshmen year, ( I wouldn't say I was actively involved in those  school activities) I didnt feel like I truly enjoyed it  (i.e. oreintation camps etc) though I'm glad I went for them because I made a small group of good friends. That being said, I'm not sure if I'm missing out on stuff because I see acquaitances around me signing up for ccas and committe positions etc. Like am I depriving myself the opportunity to fully enjoy uni life? Should I be more involved? Should I have signed up for these activities even though the deadlines for most of these stuff is over? That being said, I kinda enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with uni life. Not needing to be around people all the time etc. Like I feel like this is haven before I step out into the office-politics filled working world. But then again  when I hear people saying about the need to make your uni life fulfiling, I'm questioning my choices... There are several reasons why I don't join ccas though. I live pretty far from school and the thought of travelling home late doesn't appeal to me. I'm also not particularly interested in anything and am pretty contend with my no-life life. As for other sub committee positions I gave myself the excuse of midterms and didn't bither signing up for them. So my question for the readers are am I making the right choice by being totally uninvolved in school stuff even though I'm cool with it? And will I be missing out much? Thanks for reading. Please don't filter and sorry for my terrible use of English in this post.

I cannot stand some of my family members sometimes. They can be quite annoying and I can't. I really can't, I feel like I'm being thrown into a dark abyss of bad feelings. I'm generally happy and cheerful but sometimes I get so annoyed. I can't go back to being chummy when they have tried to hurt me / make me angry. 

The second problem is, I am very very insecure about myself and my looks. I just feel like I'm not good enough and there is nobody to help console me. 

I didn't feel this way before. This only happens recently.

I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and this helps a lot, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.

I am that person, who frees up time to listen to others problem. I am that person who tries their best to be there when others need them. I am that person who at times, when required, put others need above their own. I am that person who like everyone else more than everyone else like them. I am that person who feels like a toilet paper (not even a plastic bag) that is thrown away after being used. I don't even know what i am doing wrong. I have never been asked out for a second date. I am rarely asked out on outings with friends. I don't even get asked out for lunch between lectures in school.  Does anyone else out there who feels the same way?
-
 
I love it when I catch him looking at me and he looks away.

I love it when he remembers my plans for the day and asks me how did it go.

I love it when we go out together and after the outing he says that he had a nice time with me.

I love it when he asks me whether I reached home. 

It has not been a long time since I know him well. Probably not in love so fast but definitely interested in him. I don't know whether we will be together in future. I am not rushing to get a boyfriend just because I'm single and I take things as they come, but the sweet memories of him bring a smile on my face when I close my eyes at night.

B77W here once again!

I was prompted to recall one particular story of a girl in JC2. Just call her J. Well, she was really quite pretty (and is too pretty even till today), but thanks to a bitch, I couldn't even get to speak to her initially before she blocked me.

Strangely enough, thanks to a weird set of circumstances, I ended up in bed with her. She was utterly confused at what happened, and me too (don't ask what happened). But thanks to my sincerity, we somehow became friends, and eventually traded benefits.

The problem, perhaps, is that while she's beautiful, she lacks any sort of intelligible personality. I guess the B77W's engines overpowered her way too much, eventually resulting in nothing beyond FWB status.

But I still do miss her, her gaze, smile, and wish her, sincerely, all the best, with her boyfriend in the Air Force. Even if we may no longer see each other often anymore. And I think we'll soon drop WB status (not to be confused with the WB in XWB).

(The previous confession used F and Y. Hint: J is between F and Y.)

I want to receive treatment for depression. Only thing is, if I really do see a doctor for depression, would it affect my future employment? Will companies look into your past medical history? Even if you do not disclose it, they may find some ways to check you for due diligence before employing you? This is the only thing that is stopping me from visiting a psychiatrist or visit the polyclinic for their psychology services. Advice?
-
 
To those people who keep saying "I did damm badly" or "my grades are like sh**", please stop saying that if you just din't get the grade you want cause there are genuine people around in NUS who really did study hard and are really upset when they get damm bad results, way worse than what you got. So please spare a thought. Just say "its okay" or "Could have did better". Seriously, freaking annoying.

What can i do to prove my love when i cheated before? Before everyone starts flaming me, I'm really apologetic towards my boyfriend and i'd like to prove that this time, i'm really keen on the relationship, and won't cheat again.

Is it common for girls to hit on guys? To cut the story short, i think a female friend of mine (that i know just this sem) seems to be dropping alot of hints that she wants something beyond being platonic friends, and i mean the sexual kind. I was kind of shocked and not ready for it, so i did not respond to her advances. She's not unattractive, but i am kinda in a neutral position and don't have strong sexual interests. I read from previous posts that most guys typically do not reject sexual advances by girls. Wondering if i should give in, or reject in a subtle way, or just act blur. Any advice?

I see myself as a broken, a soul damaged by the trysts of my past. As such I feel like I shouldnt find love because of the fear that the shards of my soul will only hurt another. So much love to give but at what a price.  

I should stop seeing myself like that but deep inside I know that no one will accept my repentance but God. 

For now I will carry on life wearing a hood like a lone gypsy traversing through the cold, taking in the warmth of the experiences I behold every once in a while. 

Id only admire from far. And give my heart to causes I deem will help humanity, not for progress but to give hope to those who have been left behind. 

A life spent yearning but what other choice have I. I am afraid deep inside. 

One day I will bid farewell to those who have loved sheltered and cared for me in one way or another so I can be who I truly am. Beneath the broken shards is a little bird wanting to fly free.

Hi! Since troll knight is gone, I think I will write something under a moniker. Call me B77W.

Anyway, I would like to mention a short confession. I used to be quite a gf hopper, according to my current girlfriend (call her Y, but her qualities are more F than Y).

You may have friends who are serial players and feel jealous that they have so much popularity. Actually, don't be jealous. I was once there, but I realised how empty it felt. Don't know who really cherishes you. Don't know who's just taking you as a FWB. Don't even know who really wants to set you up. But thank you Y, for rearranging my life. I'm now more on-course to land safely. I feel happier now that all those distractions are more or less gone.

Just some thoughts. Thanfully B77W didn't crash into the sea.

Im a 24 year old guy and i tend to be attracted to girls younger than me. Mostly between 19 to 21 years of age. Above this narrow range my attraction decreases exponentially as a function with increasing age. Even with  girls of the same age as me i barely feel any attraction at all. Is this normal ?

So I'm currently overseas now.. Met this girl here and even though we only met a few times, we spent a few days together as she showed me around. I don't know why, but through our interactions, I found out that everything about her is what I am looking for in a girl. I haven't really felt these kind of strings pulling in my heart for a long time already, but my trip will be ending soon and I can't help but think of how I'll miss her so much.. As much as I want to continue interacting with her, I understand it will be tough over two continents. Any suggestion on what I should do?

I'm from SMU. Why do people in NUS seem like they're having so much fun!

I don't know why but it's one of those shitty days. I boarded the bus and went to a corner at the back to sit. Then 2 lovey dovey couples came along and kept talking and putting hands on each other. I found it sweet initially, but I just soon became jealous because I don't have a gf and nobody to give me such sweet moments. 

I feel so guilty and feel so much hate for myself. Because one of the ways I deal with this is to sluttify a girl, really hate her and violate her in my mind. I actually saw her panties briefly but accidentally as she was leaving her seat and I just want to touch her. To punish her for being happy with a guy other than me. 

I know I'm fucked up. But I'm being honest. And don't need to tell me I need help, I already know that.

In response to   and  and to all girls who has boob-related issues. We have different sizes and I think we should learn to work with what we got! There will be different pros and cons to having big or small boobs. I used to feel extremely awkward as I have a slim figure and D cup boobs so it made me really self conscious and caused me to have a bad posture. Many of my friends would think that I would look nice in clothings but the truth is, I can't fit into most of what they can! Clothings that dont fit around my waist will make me look fat. Clothings that are tight fitting usually cant fit around my bust area. :( It took me a long time to find clothing types that can fit me better. Big or small also have problems, so might as well just embrace it and keep a look out for things that will fit! :) Also, everyone has different likings and preferences. Big and small boobs are attractive to different people. Some people like bigger boobs, some people like smaller boobs. While your boobs may be just as amazing as your personality, those who like you for your boobs are not worth your time!

Whatever you got, since you got it, FLAUNT IT!

The fall compendium was released only recently and my friend has been bugging me since then to purchase it for him (i'm a girl btw). I hinted to him that he should buy it using his own money but he would not stop asking! I might just end this friendship as I think he is using me to get dota items only.

My guy stays in school. He is quite good looking, I would say like really above average. So, as you know there's this kind of confession page for residences. I realize that quite a lot of girls are like saying that he is handsome and wanting to get to know him better. Although I know he doesn't really care about this sort of things but I can't help but to feel really insecure. I really have the urge to tell them to just fuck off on page but I know that I am overeacting because these girls don't even know him and I believe what is mine will be mine. I don't know how to deal with this I don't want to tell him because even I feel that I am crazy.

Is it normal to not have a personal space between friends, especially between guy and girl? My guy friend brushes against me casually and i realise he doesnt move around that close to the other girls. What is that supposed to mean?

To  Break up with her. You're obviously not over your ex, and you're not being fair or honest to your current girlfriend about your feelings/emotional state. That you are already experiencing self-doubt is a sure sign. Don't make the same selfish mistake I did. Your current girlfriend deserves more than you can give her right now, and if you truly care for her, you will let her go.

I'm an exceptionally horny guy.

And most definitely really good in bed. Don't NVNT me, if you dare, post below and give me a try. The other girls I've had tell me I'm the best they've had.

But I'm not here to advertise.

you see, not a day goes by where I don't wish I was simply less horny. Or not horny at all. All through my life it's been no joke - I've had to endure uncomfortable erections during all morning assemblies in my secondary school years. It's not like I was looking at girls or fantasising. Heck, I didn't even know what porn was yet (ironically I found out what porn was thanks to a prohibition sign outside the computer lab). I used to stand up to go back to class with awkward boners sticking out of my pants, and was laughed at enough times until I figured out a way to artfully conceal it. 

Ever since I've discovered masturbation, I've had to get myself off at least once a day - or not be able to sleep thanks to the boner. My max was 5 times in a 12 hour span.

But it bothers me. Does anyone know of any anti-aphrodisiacs that exist which simply make people less horny? Seriously, if a reverse-viagra existed, I'd be quite happy to take it. I'd like to enjoy sex, not be forced by my instincts to find partners just to get by.

To make matters worse I'm not exactly good at getting attached either. I'm not the easiest person to live with, and I'm incredibly picky too. Plus there's a super high risk that whoever I get together with simply doesn't have a sex drive as high as mine. I'd hate to think she's just giving in to me rather than enjoying it with me each time.

Everyday in Business School is like entering a war zone because a large percentage (up to 30%) of your grades is based on class participation. I hate the way classmates offer deathly stares at anyone who contributes well thought out answers. I hate this tall poppy syndrome that exist within the faculty. I hate how class participation destroys friendships. I hate seeing those fake smiles and selfish personalities. Aren't we all here to learn from each other? Or did you signed up for school so you can put people down?

Writing this as I am in a real dilemma and need some advice...
I recently got out of an "amber-ish" relationship with a girl (Let's call her girl A). She rejected me. Nowadays, I have developed a crush on another girl (Girl B) in my class. The three of us share the same tutorials and I have been trying to get closer to Girl B. I wanted to go for lunch or study with Girl B after tutorials, but Girl A continues to stick with me after lessons, just like before. Perhaps it is Girl A's way of maintaining friendship with me, which is kinda nice I suppose, given that most rejections ends with no more contact and all that. However, this is making me kind of vexed, for I have no interest in pursuing a relationship with Girl A anymore, but yet I am still somewhat sticking with her and restricted from making any moves on Girl B. I also worry that Girl B might think we are an item and refuse even any small advances. I obviously do not wish to force the issue as it would make things totally awkward. What should I do?

tips for the ladies. how to tell if a guy likes you. 
1) guy friend always sits next to you in lecture/tutorial amongst other friends/clique, and he sits leaning towards you. i.e him sits leaning like this --> / | <-- you sit straight like this
2) when something funny pops up in his mind, the first thing he does is to ALWAYS turn to you to laugh/joke about it. (even though he has other friends beside him)
3) he subconsicously squares his body to you (open gesture) even when amongst other friends
4) he tries to take pictures of you 'for fun'
5) he leans in to talk to you even under normal circumstances (not whispering)
6) he mirrors your sitting posture/arms position unconsciously
7) he tries to establish body contact by poking, and tapping anywhere else other than the shoulder. e.g forearm, sides, cheek etc

girls, if you like the guy, reciprocate! this is one way to 'hint' back to him by mirroring his actions!

but if you know that this guys already has a girlfriend, you have a problem! please do him and his girlfriend a favour by distancing yourself! applies if you do not like him too, don't lead him on!

To , I am having the same problem as well. Broke up with my ex a while back (I initiated it) and got together with my current girlfriend recently. I don't know if it's because she has always been there for me (my very good friend) so I got together with her. The timing didn't help either, maybe it was just because I was lonely or she is a rebound. Even though I was the one who broke up with my ex, sometimes I confuse her with me ex, I see something that my ex and I shared a joke or I thought that she would like, and I will almost tell my current girlfriend. Sometimes my friends asked me "eh your girlfriend blah blah" and I will thought they are talking about the previous one... It doesn't help that my ex was more of a girlfriend material than the current only and also I'm still physically attracted to her. I do hold hands with my current one and touch her hair and waist. Just that my current one is my best friend and I can turn to her to solve my problems... But isn't that what love is about? Or is she just my best friend? Or best friend and lover?

Hello all, seeking some relationship advice here. I just got together with my girlfriend for 7 months now and she is my first girlfriend. However, there are some issues that are surfacing. Sometimes the replies that she gives me are quite hard to sustain a conversation with, for example one-worded replies and it really annoys the hell out of me. This has actually been the case when we started dating. Furthermore, we don't really have a lot of common topics to talk about so that makes our conversation topics usually very dull. Granted, she is quite a good girl however it seems that our wavelength are a bit off...I'm facing some problems myself as I have to work part-time due to some financial constraints and my studies are taking a toll, so I might have to sacrifice some time with her now. I also can't bring myself to love her fully but I can't really explain this part very well. So the problem is, where do we go from here??5
-
 
 to answer your question yes i have been there. Been cheated on more than 2 years ago. I had to get it out of him but i could sense the regret. I gave him one chance to earn my trust and he did. We're happy and he has been nothing short of honest and faithful to me. I trust him. 

How did i get to be so trusting? I cheated once before in a previous relationship. It was a huge mistake and i was never given the chance to prove to him that i wa repentant. I have never ever cheated on anyone after that. I guess that's what helped me make the decision to give him another chance. 

I'm not gonna lie. Despite my experience and convictions it wasn't easy. I was always suspicious but he went out of his way to listen to me. And he did things to make me feel better like report his whereabouts and such. He doesnt do that now tho. I dont need him to. Things are great and im so glad i gave him that chance (:

Just putting it here because when I tell others this, somehow they always disagree. I can't wait to start work. The staying factor is the fact that without a degree, getting the job might be much harder. So I'm holding on. Maybe it's because my degree and my desired job are quite different hence the disparity. But I can't help but feel like most of the things I am doing - although they can be interesting - are not very helpful, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. People say Uni is the best time of your life, but I don't think they meant the work you do, rather than the people you meet. I do appreciate all the people I've met during Uni. But at the end of the day, 1 more year to go. I can't wait to graduate.

You know, it sucks to know you are considered second-choice for someone of the opposite sex. Even when you got into a one-night-stand with her because you picked up on her innuendos before the guy she was crushing on did. 

She's a fresher btw. So is the guy she says reminds her of her BF very much. They're both my close friends, and I protect them both as equally and as much as I can do for people I deem to be in my clique.

What's even more twisted is that she has a boyfriend who's in a LDR with her, and she had been having sexual compatibility issues with him in the past year (Yes there is such a thing as too much stamina, as well as both parties wanting to play submissive). She screwed me and the guy she was crushing on within a week of arriving at uni, and it was through sheer will that all three of us managed to make nice and revert to purely friendship status with her. 

Yet thanks to that one night with her, I'm reminded of my singlehood status all too painfully, as well as my emotional and circumstantial unavailability to dating seriously. Me and her are very much sexually compatible, and I display enough of a separate character of my own as compared to her present BF whose only commonality with her is in terms of gaming that she considers me attractive in my own right. I want a friends-with-benefits with options to go exclusive on her discretion, but I know it's next to impossible because I can't be the bastard to break up her relationship with her BF, as unsatisfactory as it is. 

The stress and tension within me regarding how and if I should press the issue of FwB with her is bad enough that I have had to rub four out every night before I sleep since that one night with her. Considering that I usually rubbed one out every night before bed four is a sure sign of emotional and mental turmoil within me. I'm not sure what my best course of action now is. I can see a non-committed arrangement with her working out perfectly (we acknowledged that we both have similar sexual appetites) however I'm not even sure that it can be done without blowback considering how my male friend is also implicated and how she still has a BF at this point of time. 

Help?

I am the same socially awkward person who post the mini survey earlier on. (I have to admit even though I am socially awkward I am very noisy in NUSwhispers.) Anyway, here is my another mini survey. Will girls prefer dating guys who are confident or guys who are hardworking? ( Assuming You cant have the best of both worlds( Hardworking and confident). The hardworking guy screw up in his studies, in his work, not good looking etc but is determined to improve on himself while the confident guy is an all-rounder)

I've recently got to know this new friend. We have similar likings and appreciation for period objects, so conversations have been lighthearted and relatively chill. It's really nice and rare to encounter someone who likes quaint "old" stuff. Yet recently, it seems like the conversation dynamics is no longer there. Could it be my over enthusiasm caused some misunderstanding? After all, I really appreciate having such a friend in my life. #confused

I am a socially awkward person but I will like to do a mini survey here. Will any girls consider dating socially awkward guys?

Hey  thanks for the response and i'm really happy for you. I wish that could happen to me. What if you realised that he's still not being honest and frank with his feelings, and he's not true still. and on one hand he's been trying to prove that he does want me back
-
 
With reference to  - I'm a dude... With reference to  - hang in there. I don't have experience in that, but I do believe time heals most things. I've been hurt before and I remember it felt like I was dying - but I didn't, and I'm still here, and I'm just fine! Just remember you deserve to be happy. I'm sure you will find someone who deserves you.

Reading all the whispers here and realising there's too much negativity. :( just wanted to say: be kinder to yourself, you're probably trying your best already. :)  All the best to everyone still left with deadlines and midterms!

Just met my old flame at the workplace that we both just started working at and it is awkward ttm because he's my direct superior.

He's really nice and all, taking care of me and talking to me like an old friend, like we never happened. I feel bad because I'm the one that rejected him many years ago and it was a bad separation (with unfriending on fb, deleting each others hp number, the likes) and we never talked until today. 

I COULD go without seeing him as often since I know his schedule and I can avoid him if I desperately wanted to. But should I? He's still exceptionally nice and is keen to help, yet I don't want to lead him on, and I wanna keep my professional distance and not be too chummy.

Advice?

Yes, everyone is human. People make mistakes and should be forgiven. I'm a victim of such relationship betrayal. As much as i want to be okay and trust again, i'm scared, and i don't want to be hurt again. Anyone been in these shoes? What can i do):
-
 
I don't really like to be involved in a lot of activities and commitments but then I feel like it's compulsory to have such things especially during uni life. I joined some, but somehow it stressed me out because I always feel like I don't fit in. I think I pressure myself too much about this. :(

I've been really troubled over this for the past month or so. How do you know if you truly love someone? Or could it be that you just love having someone around for you?

Is it normal for attached guys to be watching porn when the couple engages in some form of sexual activites occasionally? Say maybe once a week and not sex but the guy's satisfied with just oral. The guy is also very open in telling the gf he watches porn. Just want to know girls' perspective on this, is it ok with you or would you get mad?

I am a fat guy and I need to get healthy. Ive done my research kinda already know what to do. I even have a routine that I want to follow. But thrice already, I've made my way to the Utown gym, only to quickly turn around and leave when I see all these hot and muscular guys and girls around. I feel so ashamed about my body and I can't imagine bouncing and sweating in front of so many people..

Yeah I know it's all in my head. But I'm here cos I need advice. What can I do to not be bothered about other people in the gym..?

What time is the gym least crowded?

True story. I'm a girl who's been seeing someone twice my age for the past 4 years with no strings attached. He was a millionaire when I first met him and his finances were like his bipolar illness. One year he was rich, the next year he had donated all his wealth away. I remember he told me "Don't fall in love with me," but I did.  He made it clear he couldn't marry me. His psychological condition and work makes it difficult for him to maintain a marriage. So he let's me date other boys - and I do. Whenever someone breaks my heart, I'll run back to him and he makes it all better again. 

I met him again today. As of late, we only meet once in a while. He had a heart attack this year so he's suddenly treating me better. Some days he'll ask if I want food and he'll drive by my house to drop it off. Most other days, we dine at Trader's or Shangri-la. 

Three times in a row now, he keeps telling me that there's something about me that keeps him loyal to me. He could have any girl he wants but he chose me. I didn't know this. All this while I thought he was seeing other girls behind my back too. Apparently not. 

Sure I date a lot of guys but that's only because he told me to go find someone else. Someone who can promise me marriage. But really, he's the only one I've ever genuinely loved and cared about. To hear him say he's kept himself for me all these years...It's like Nirvana, I just feel so incredibly honoured & happy and peaceful. 

Even though we're not married, we pretty much  are. He's seen me through my best and worst and I him. He takes care of me emotionally, financially, medically, (sexually), mentors me and encourages me to do well in uni. I'm so lucky. 

To the girls out there who stopped believing in faithfulness because you've had a boyfriend who cheated on you before, start believing again. The right one will come and the right one will choose you over any other girl without you  needing to do anything. 

Ssshhh...this is my little secret. What's yours?

Everyone says girls are hard to understand. I think every human is unique and it's very difficult, if not impossible to read people. So, a genuine, open to hearing ideas, question here about the male psyche:

1. Guy talks to girl day in and day out. Says good morning, good night, the whole shebang!

2. Guy talks about his hopes/ dreams for the future - His job, where he wants to travel, etc. Girl responds she shares similar dreams, but maybe not in the immediate future.

3. Guy moves to a foreign country for a job, but the communication/ deep conversations continue through text messages and phone calls, even across times zones.

4. Guy suddenly stops texting, suddenly talks about a girl he likes and has decided to date in the foreign country (but she's also Singaporean).

5. Guy scales back on the texting, only texts girl back home occasionally, maybe once every few days to say 'hi'. 

So, what happened? Girl read Guy's intentions incorrectly from the start? Guy has dumped girl and moved on to someone else? Girl is overthinking being friendzoned? This whole thing sounds impossible/ boring? 
-
 
With reference to , if a person is a vixen and intentionally wants to go all out to get what she ultimately wants, she will act considerate and ask the guy to reconsider his current relationship just so she could get the foolish guy's trust and think that she is really understanding type and at the end of the day, she will be the one the guy chooses. But this does not make her any less of a vixen and a goddamn 3rd party, does it?
-
 
I want to get married within 2 years so that I can have kids early. However I will need to wait another 5-7 years for my bf to get ready for marriage as he is a few years younger and currently serving the army. 
He wants to complete his uni studies, work a few years before settling down, but I want to settle down soon. It doesn't help that things are getting tense between us with this "what will be our future" talk popping up every now and then. Perhaps it is time to move on? 
-
 
Whenever i see posts that uses the terms girl a and girl b or guy a and guy b, it seems as if the one labelled 'a' is more important to the op (since he/she comes to mind first). Just something to think about.

Over the past week or so I've seen some confessions by insecure girls who've smaller-than-A boobs. I'm so sorry that you fellow girls exist and have to endure this very real misery and insecurity, but at the same time also so relieved that yall exist. Fellow girls who silently seethe when A cup girls whine about their "small boobs" - what even, they don't even know how bad it gets! And unlike guys, we can't hide our size at mere first glance in public either. Life. Anyway, here's a great repost from NTU Confessions: 

"To the girl who posted about having a flat chest:

Just wanna tell you that you're really not alone in this. I can totally understand how you feel as I have the same problem. I am almost entirely flat-chested, and have been insecure about it since secondary school days. Like you, I can't fit an A cup. I'm an AA or AAA cup (I think some insensitive ppl are gonna say 'then wear a bra for what?'. I'm lazy to give an in depth explanation but in general, small girls need to wear bras to feel a bit more confident and 'less exposed'). You can buy AA or AAA cup bras from lulalu.com. The founders of this bra brand are also small like us they understand how it feels too :') You should try out some of their bras! Quite expensive though, cos you have to ship them from the U.S., but wearing a bra that fits well will really make you feel more confident. (I'm not paid for advertising)
I used to feel abnormal and often wondered whether I am the ONLY unfortunate one with such a flat chest. So I often googled about my problem to see whether there are other girls in the same plight lol. And there are! You can search for forums and talk to the girls who really understand how it feels. That's how I found out about lulalu.com by the way. Haha there are many A cup girls online complaining about how they are too small and want a B or C cup. But whoa I'll be extremely overjoyed if I can even fill an A cup.

When I was younger (start of uni) I thought that no one would ever wanna date someone like me cos of my small boobs and would foresee my sad lonely future haha. But now I have a loving boyfriend, who always reassures me that he loves me for who I am, small boobs or not. And that he still finds me beautiful. Compared to the past, I think my level of insecurity has greatly decreased already. But now and then, I will irrationally have some breakdowns and feel upset that I am like this and start questioning whether my boyfriend will leave me for someone with boobs that he can at least be able to grab lollll. When I'm insecure like that, he actually feels sad too and will gently console me with words of assurance. His support really helps to remind me that there's so much more about me than just simply my non-existent boobs.

I don't know whether you're currently worrying about not being able to find a bf (you didn't mention but somehow so many guys replied your post to say they like small boobs lol), but anyway I'm sure you will meet someone who will love you for who you are (damn cliched but it's true la) cos anyone who doesn't love you just cos of your boobs is definitely not worth your time anyway.

Anyway, I found out that during pregnancy our boobs will grow for sure (like second puberty! Yay!). So you get two bonuses: bigger boobs and a baby! Haha but please don't get pregnant just for bigger boobs.

Hope you feel better knowing that you're not alone :) "

Haha reading all those posts about guys dont approach them makes me feel more like a guy myself even though i am a girl. =.= its more often that I approach the guys or text them to ask if I could join them afterwards during break.  In a male dominated course. The guy I liked... he's like totallly no action or de-action for the past 2 sems even though I had actively hinted him by looking for him during breaks, intentionally took same mods and asked if i could sit beside him in lectures...asked him out...=.= he still replies my msg fast when hes online. Sometimes he claims hes busy and when I apologized he said its okay he will still reply me. And my friends and I have caught him looking at our direction many times regardless where we sit. But thats all liao. No actions or other stuffs. so...omg so is he interested or not??? It doesnt help when he started to hang out with a big group of guys that makes it even more awkward to approach him. *sigh* another set of woes.

My boyfriend becomes very different (like more aggressive and calling names) when making out, is it normal? I feel a little intimidated and also awkward whenever it happens.
-
 
I joined hall but I feel like it was a mistake - I feel like I'm fading away. It's like I've become a caricature of myself. It's not like I didn't try to fit in, I just can't. I try hard to be outgoing when I can, but that just isn't who I am. I've given up.

Guys who dated many girls generally have poor memory? 
I've been together with my boyfriend one year ago. Before we were officially together, he was in quite a complicated relationship with various girls. 
Recently, he claims that I have watched a particular movie with him last year, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't me, who watched it together with him. Hence, i kept mum in order to not spoil his day. 
What's the best approach when you face such situation? Tell him frankly or just let him assume what he thinks? 

-
 
With reference to , , I'm sorry for whatever happened to you that made you so bitter, but I hope you realise those are very sweeping and unfair generalisations you're making. Ever considered the guy in this kind of relationship triangle? He's the only one who has made a promise to commit and broken it - not the '3rd party' girl. Not saying all others are blameless of course. Bottom line, just remember these are people with feelings. Everyone makes mistakes. Don't you?

Hi all. I find that I am unable to tell my SO that I love him. I do love him but I just can't seem to tell him that I do. Within the span of our 9 going 10 month relationship, I've only probably said it 3 or 4 times. I don't know why this is so either. There are moments where I think to myself "omg I love you" but I just can't verbalise it out. Writing it out in letters/post its/whatsapp is not a problem, it's just in real life. Even after practicing it in my head a few times to say it out, I just say nothing in the end. Help?
-
 
I'm a decently attractive girl and pretty much into fashion so I like to dress up to school everyday (I know I know, npnt buttt this is an anonymous site, gimme BOD can?)  from FoE  but I've noticed every engin guy's total lack of interest in me. It's like they don't even notice me. Not just me but like I've noticed generally they tend to have a lack of interest in interacting with girls and prefer to focus their attention elsewhere. There's nothing wrong with that but well guys if you're complaining about being forever alone, this might be why? 

-
 
Girl A has sort of a crush on me. I have crush on Girl A too but I am too shy around her and things are progressing really slowly. I also have a crush on Girl B. Girl B and I got along kinda well and have went out several times alone already(not date i think).

My close female friend ask how could I like two different girls at once. Am I a jerk for trying for both of them and see which one would "land" in the net?
I feel really bad and confused. Maybe I don't like them enough or am I too desperate?

I am an introverted guy who never bother to flirt with girls and always do my own stuff. I am definitely not a player but is such mentality wrong? 

-
 
Can I just say this to everyone: there's much more to life than having a significant other. The world is huge and there is so much more out there that is infinitely fulfilling and enjoyable. 

If you feel like you need a partner in your life, it's perfectly okay to look for one but don't beat yourself up if you can't find the right one just yet. Don't be ashamed for wanting or not wanting sex. Also, always use protection. And don't cheat man that's just rude and totally not cool.

To the evergreens: do not worry. Go out and play the field a little if you have to, go on blind dates, take the plunge and confess. It might hurt but that's how you learn and eventually find someone.

You are not a half that needs another half, you are already a whole person, and you are enough. Remember that and don't settle: take action if you are not happy. All the best for the rest of the semester everyone!

My friend never listens to me whenever I tell her to sleep. Going SEVERAL days without sleep has become a norm for her and I am genuinely worried for her physical/mental health. I know we all have assignments and projects to complete, but lack of sleep can cause serious long-lasting damage that no one should take lightly - especially not when it lasts for days!! I've tried everything from texting her, to writing her letters, to posting on her wall, ... I'm really at my wits' end. How can I help her?

Hi all. This is my first time trying to post something on nuswhispers. I am very bothered by something and would like to seek advice. I got to know this girl (L) 2 semesters ago and took common mods last semester. 
Since we took common mods and her house was quite on the way to school, I will pick L up and head to school together. The problem starts this semester when we had no common mods and yet L is asking me to tong pang her almost everyday, either to school or from school. 
Initially, I was fine with it. However, as time passes, I realized she is just treating me like a chauffeur. Sometimes she will sit at back of the car or she will just be texting her friend throughout the ride. She doesn't reply to my messages and if she does, it will always end off with "can I tong pang tomorrow?"
Could anyone please advise me on how I can politely reject her once and for all and let her know that I will offer if I want to? I do not want to affect our friendship (if there even exist 1). Please advise! Thank you!!
-
 
Cheaters will always be cheaters, 3rd parties will always be 3rd parties. If a vixen is bound to wreck your stable relationship, she will lower herself to a meek sheep, bow to you and tell you to reconsider your relationship so that she can appear in your life 'graciously' 
-
 
My whole life, only guys complimented on my looks but not girls. So am i above, below, or average? Btw im a straight af guy
-
 
I wonder what happened in the process. Come to think of it, when I was still a freshman, despite the bad grades, I enjoyed what I studied and tried my best to understand the gist of every concept. 

Fast forward to my 3rd and final year, the modules no longer interest me. I am tired of school. Yet the bigger part of me wants this period to last as long as God allows as the next time we get to rest will be 40+ years down the road. 

Doesn't anyone of you wish time would just turn back on its own and bring u along with it. 

Life was simpler without responsibility.

To OP  I feel you! I find it hard to socialize and mingle around with people I'm not familiar with as well. I play league too! If you'd like you can add me at cookiezNcream (smurf <30 account for anonymity reasons, posting my main here would be too obvious)

My sister is getting married soon and people make comments about me. You can feel the intensity of that moment, time slows and the laughter echoes. My parents' failed marriage actually puts me off. I feel that divorce and separation have hereditary elements to themselves, but I hope it skips my sister. She took a bold step I may never be brave enough to take.

How can I help my friend who has trust issues? He has almost no friends except me because he doesn't not trust anyone. The one closest to him is his mum and she always call him "handsome" in front of other people when he is obviously not. He thinks that he can trust no one because even his mum is lying to him. How can I help? 

-
 
 I'm going through exactly the same thing. It's been 5 months now. The fact that you miss him that much is a good sign, not a bad one. You're in a great spot, I'd say. I miss my girlfriend a lot, too. She's the only one that accepts all of me and believes in all my dreams. If it's worth it, you'll know it and it will only make it better when you see him again. Don't worry about it; do your best. Life hands uneven cards, but it's always down to how you play them. Wish you the best!
-
 
Is it true that uni guys prefer short, petite, sweet looking, those girls that need protection etc? I am a sporty, independent girl, goal oriented and i often receive comments like "you're like a man" or "you're scary". Thus, most guys won't try to chase after me. I end up with a lot of good guy friends. I'm just confused over what kind of girls uni guys prefer. 
-
 
There was a guy who told his friends about how attractive, kind etc I was to his friends and the girl who likes him came to find out about his admiration for me. Needless to say she was pissed and started trying to intimidate me in certain ways e.g. staring at me with her friends while plainly looking like she was gossiping about me, trying to get others to shun me. Strangely enough this was not the first time it happened in my life. This is really quite annoying and sad as I feel down from these mean girls while I guess the guys don't even like me enough to approach me properly and confess but I guess they don't know they are actually giving me a hard time indirectly. End result is always me left feeling insecure and I get nothing out of it. I don't think I should be approaching the guy if he can't even muster enough courage to tell me so I suppose he must think it is just a mild infatuation. So guys think twice the next time you express your admiration for girls without doing anything about it and I guess this goes for girls as well? Some people are just easily jealous and hateful.

I sort of have this thing going on with someone in school. We've been spending almost every other day together and our lives are starting to fall into orbit and revolve around each other and the next time we can spend a few moments together, even if its 10 minutes of brief conversation at Humble Origins.

I've had tons of r/s before and gone through the whole list of pet names:
"baby", "dear", "darling", "pretty", "good girl" etc.
but NOBODY has ever called me "sweetie" until he came along. The thing is...I find it so funny bc if you knew me, you'd know I'm more of the sexy & independent sort of girl, not cute or funny or 'damsel in distress' sort of girly - that's okay though cos I think he refers more to my actions like when I do sweet things for him.

My problem is: I don't know what to call him! help!

"Sweetie" sounds like its for guy calling girl but not girl calling guy.
I normally just call him "baby" in person - but I don't like typing this out on Whatsapp. He's a man, not a baby. 

Another thing is, I use terms of endearment whenever I want someone I have a professional relationship with to do something for me so I feel like it's more of a manipulative tool than a show of affection. The meaning is simply lost on me. 

I see the same effect being played out on me when he calls me 'sweetie' like when he's telling me to hurry up and you can sense the urgency in him voice but he doesn't say all that. He just says "Sweetie, let's go," and its understood.

So NUS kaki, HOW???
WHAT SHOULD I CALL MY NEW BEAU? What do guys like being called? What do you girls call your lovers?

Just wanted to share some stuff here I don't really tell others about, whether it's to vent off some frustration or to release some tension, hope you guys don't mind. I'm not gonna reveal too much though of course, else I may just expose my identity.

I'm a girl who doesn't really have guy friends. I'm known to be the quiet, mugger kinda girl though I've attended camps and everything when I was a freshie. I display my 'anti-social' side of me in front of people i dont really know, but I'm pretty crazy with my close friends or people I'm comfortable with. I really yearn to have that one friend I can talk to, I can listen to, I can just share anything without being judged. I've met quite a few who said they care but in the end, they didn't really give two shits about me. 

On a side note, no I'm not a mugger, I don't study like weeks in advance. In fact, I procrastinate till I really cannot procrastinate anymore (like the night before). Why? I'm busy playing league (of legends) - anyone wanna play with me can leave your ign in the comments (if this gets posted up) HAHA. But yeah, I pretty much game all the time. Bad habit, I know. 

i just feel this sense of loneliness I can't distract myself away from, and it's really depressing. Just hoping to have that one friend who's willing to listen and be there for me, and likewise, who I'll never dessert when he/she needs me. (:

That's it for my rant. Now to go back to gaming.

 Hello, my gf was in the same situation you're in when we started to get sexually intimate but she told me about it and we sought different ways so that both of us can enjoy the experience (like me being less rough on her). You should really discuss this with him as sex is something both parties should enjoy.

To the OP of , I can totally relate. I guess I'm facing the same thing currently.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year now and things have started to become abit...routine-like? Up to the point I'm starting to feel neglected.  Similarly to , when we first started dating, he made a lot of promises, replying texts almost immediately, sending me home etcetc. Now that we've gone 'official', i feel as if that has brought our relationship downhill instead. I know it's normal for relationships to go down this path, but I'm clueless as to what we can do to make things better. 

I'm starting to doubt myself being in a relationship because of this. Don't get me wrong, i know he's a great guy & he made those promises with good intentions, but I guess I can't help feeling neglected. Nowadays, I feel like a burden to him whenever I ask to meet, it's as if he would rather do something else. And when we do, it'll be a short one because he'll have to rush somewhere else. He doesn't do most of the things that he initially did when we were dating. Like, we'd take long bus rides together when he sends me home. Nowadays, he doesn't even take the effort to meet me in school. Most of the time i'm the one initiating conversations/meetups. 

Trust me, I tried to put things in his perspective. I understand that school work's been piling up and that he's probably too busy with his   other priorities, hence his replies that take forever. We give each other quite a lot of space and freedom but I feel that this is just going to tear us apart. 

I've tried talking to him about this because initially I thought there were just certain things he wasn't aware of. However, it has remained stagnant. I don't know what I should feel about this. What do I do?

I am a girl who is curvy but not objectively fat.  I have the ass and boobs that guys are looking for,  just perhaps not as small a waist as they like.  I am rather heavy,  around 58 kg and around 160cm tall.  Some guys have told me though that I am their ideal size and that girls who are too skinny are not sexy. 

Sometimes I wonder if that is to comfort me since I always see guys praising skinny girls for being hot and sexy.   Is is true that skinny is still always better or do guys prefer girls with some curves? 
-
 
I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years and counting now. We have a good relationship built on trust, understanding and compromise, and recently we have been discussing about applying for a flat. But that will not be the agenda for this post.

After being together for so long you just get used to each other. Nothing really surprises you anymore and you can literally read each other like a book. It is especially hard to make special occasions (like birthdays and anniversaries) retain that certain "wow" or X factor that gives you that magical feeling when you first fell in love. I would say most couples would reconcile that with an active sex life, which is virtually non-existent in our relationship. She has certain values which she wishes to adhere to and I respect and honour that. As with most guys, this is an extremely frustrating scenario but having coped with 7 years without resorting to unfaithfulness, I guess you do not need me to tell you what the gameplan is. 

To complicate matters we are on totally different lifepaths now. She's slowly making her own impact in the corporate world while I'm stuck in a lecture theatre trying to figure out what the professor is trying to say. The only time we have for each other is on the weekends, and even so, she may have to work and I feel obliged to devote some time to my readings as well. My family is not very well off compared to hers and in general; I find it imperative to prove myself and to "make it".

As of late things are pretty good, but there are numerous occasions where things can just get real bad real quick. I am good with keeping the relationship in this stage of relative comfort, but I am afraid that this would turn stale as a result of this stagnation. I am probably being very pessimistic about this, but knowing her when shit happens she expects an immediate response and that is what I am extremely horrible at. 

Anyone out there able to help spice things up given the context laid out above?

I don't really enjoy sex with my boyfriend as it is still painful for me even though it has been quite a few months since we started being sexually active. 

Yet when he asks me whether I'm enjoying it I always tell him yes even though it's painful.   Though we are a couple I still find it awkward to tell him I don't really like having sex since he obviously likes it and I don't want to spoil the mood for him. 

What should I do?

I don't get how some people can be so irresponsible. Hello, we are already university students, not in pri/sec school anymore. Can you at least be more reliable and keep to what you have promised? Or at least don't just be uncontactable last minute! Don't be so selfish and waste other people's time. Your time is precious, and so is mine. 
Worse when that person is someone "close" to you, yet so inconsiderate. Makes it harder to distance away. :(

To the OP of 
just wanted to say I had the same experience as you just today. I opened the Facebook app on my phone this morning and apparently, today was the 3rd year of a photo post I had uploaded on Facebook - of my ex and I. I rarely upload relationship-related photos and only did so for this particular instance because that day, I was just grateful for having someone to celebrate end of midterms with in a wonderful way.

But since then we've broken up - because of me. I made the grievous mistake of liking someone else and wanted to be free to date him (it didn't last), so I basically pushed my ex away even though he tried repeatedly to repair the relationship, all the while not knowing the real reason why I was asking for a breakup. He still doesn't know, and now we no longer talk. But today, older and wiser, if I could turn back time, I never would've made this mistake - not because I am no longer with the new guy, but it was never fair to him and was very wrong of me. I agree with you OP, technology has a really prescient way of reminding you of your past, and in the most bittersweet way! It was good while it lasted, and I sincerely hope he's happy in his new relationship.

TDLR; the past will always come back in the most unexpected ways, and I guess part of growing up is learning how to acknowledge it, deal with it, and move on.

Hi there, this post is directing to Mikhail Lim, Clement Low and other nice NUSWhispers commenters who commented on my previous post . Please do not filter off this post, thanks. Not sure if you can recall this OP who asked for advice on ways to bring her friendship with her male friend to another level since the friendship was going no where. I wish to drop by here to give my thanks to you all for giving me sound advice on this matter. A few weeks ago, I was somehow rejected by the friend because of some reasons which I shall not further explain here. I had not been able to gather my thoughts and feelings in these past weeks given that i was completely dejected that nothing will work out between us. It's a bitter pill to swallow though. Once again, I appreciate you guys for making the effort to give nice advice. It's comforting to know that we have a friendly community in NUSWhispers, so thank you (:

I'm extremely confused. I have no idea if I'm suffering from mild depression or I've just become plain lazy. I'm in my second year now. I have not made a single friend since. Even my 'hi-bye' friends are a handful or less. I had very high expectations when I came to NUS. I thought I would be able to make a lot of friends, join CCAs and just be very active in school. Never happened. 3 months into Y1S1, I was crying almost every night. I just couldn't stand the thought of being alone. I felt so embarrassed as if everyone was judging me. It became worst in Y1S2. I had no motivation to study. I rarely touched my books. I just didn't feel like going to school anymore. My CAP was very bad. Just passed. I knew I couldn't carry on like this. So I went to see the counsellor when Y2 started. I guess it helped a bit. But I'm not very comfortable with her either. It's just sad when you expected Uni life to be a certain way, but it ended up like this instead. I do procrastinate even in JC. But I always got my work done, memorised etc. But when Uni got so lonely, I just didn't feel like studying anymore. I sleep a lot more now, which is unusual for me. Being alone sucks.

I really salute people who's been through LDR/are going through LDR and going strong. It's a short one for me,  some days, i feel like i've learnt to master the art of LDR, but there are just some days when i miss him especially much. All i want is a hug from him, to hear his voice, or just him being around. It's terrible how disconnectivity can make us feel upset, and when he has wifi, i feel much better. The time difference makes it harder though, when the time we have "together" everyday are halved. I hope i'm not the only one who's going through these emotions... It's really easier said than done, to live life per normal, and count down to a reunion again.

Why are some people always dealt with the good cards in life? I work just as hard as them, but luck always seems to be on their favour. I know that you create your own luck and all that, but there exists a kind of luck that is beyond our control. And sometimes, that makes all the difference between someone's success and another's failure. What do you think ? Have you ever felt that way about a friend/relative?

Dont live with regrets. 
After following NUSwhispers, i just feel that everyone, instead of wishing and hoping for something to happen, do something, reach for it. 
I'm 23, nus undergrad. As of this year, both my parents have left this world for a better place ( i hope), leaving behind a younger sibling for me. My thoughts? Regrets, yet grateful. 

I regret not doing enough, though there will never be enough, for them.Yet, i'm glad through all these years, i learnt a lot a lot, DEFINITELY NOT ACADEMIC, but life experience. 

For those who have a shelter, not worrying about how to bring food to the table, worrying whether the guy/girl will like you for who you are etc etc, you all are already very fortunate <3

While i may be a little too young, i just want to say, live your life at the present. Be the best of yourself. Do what you want ( pls dont break the law). Letting go of the past takes time, but time will heal. Do what you love and the love of your life will love you for who you are. People are not mind-reading machines. Put down your self-doubts, let the other person know how you feel. Pen it down first if necessary. Don't worry about how the other person might judge you because you dont live base on how others are judging you. BUT you will live with regret if you missed the opportunity. 

I never got to know what my dad wants to say before he left. I never got to see him for the last time. At least i managed to do something for my mom. Cherish the people around you. All of you are beautiful <3 

No matter how tough life can be, it can't be tougher than yesterday. Keep going!

My ex-gf and me broke up 1 year ago but decided to continue to be best friends since then. Many of our friends said that it's a weird thing to do but we really cannot see what the problem is. We really enjoy each other's company and rather than being out of each other's lives like other couples, we see each other as really good friends-too good to lose. Btw the breakup was mutual. So any opinion on this matter?

Whats the point of studying in library with your friend(s) if you are so compelled to talk? Even whispers and murmurs are distracting to those who are really studying and want some quietness

There is this female friend of mine (I'm a girl too btw) who uses tinder every hour daily chatting with her different matches. However, when the guys start hitting on her/asking for sexy pictures etc, she will start preaching to them about how that is wrong and screenshot the entire conversation then proceed to put it on Facebook with a lengthy post saying how she has 'lost faith in all men' and 'there are no nice guys left' and 'all men want is sex'. But I really cannot stand it. Everyone knows that is the nature of tinder and you don't find 'nice guys' there (BOD few exceptions maybe) but that's hardly a platform to find your one true love/SO. It's like eating a lemon knowing that it is sour but complaining that it's sour after eating it. Logic?? There is none.

Sorry just had to rant. I've unfollowed her on all social media platforms until she grows up.

Please do not filter this as I'm really genuine in seeking advice from the public. 

I'm a girl who is interested in purchasing self-pleasuring toys (at least a dildo). I have noticed that adult shops are often in the middle of a busy street or area (eg. Bugis street). Plus it's a little embarrassing for me to enter an adult shop as I have not hit 21YO yet and I'm not sure if these shops will generally allow people who are above 18 yet under 21 to patronise.

Please do not suggest that I should find a fwb to satisfy my needs as I have no intentions of doing so, or to ask my boyfriend to satisfy my needs since I cannot have him around me whenever I feeling it. It would help if there are safe websites/products to recommend.

I feel that I am getting increasingly irritated with my boyfriend.   In the first place there were already a lot of things I didn't like about him from the start eg.  His family belongs to the lower middle class while mine belongs to upper middle class,  his general knowledge is really terrible,  he is quite uncouth,  he is not good looking.  However he was so sweet that I managed to overlook all these. 

As time passes though i find that these become increasingly an issue in our relationship.  I often get irritated by things he does or say to the extent that I try not to meet him too much to prevent quarrels.   I know this sounds like our relationship is going downhill,  but he has a good heart,  so is there any way I can salvage this?  I feel disgusted by myself being such a superficial person at times but I really can't help it. 
-
 
I don't understand how this could happen. I don't even know you very well. How could I be so attracted to you? I must be dreaming. 

It may be the unfriendly smile that I always have when you're around. It might be the colours during the sunset. It could be an exam period that seems to never end. But they are nothing compared to you.

I always believed that there will be nothing left in my hands even if I try everything hard. I know I just needed courage instead of this nervous feeling, but this is who I am.

You'll never understand how I feel, so I won't care for you anymore. Don't say "how are you", smiling at me, else I'll lose my sleep again.

Am I going to be the same girl, tomorrow as I am today? Keep being unfriendly and hardly say a word, I know I'm not sweet at all. Since you suddenly appeared in my dreams, I can't be honest about my feelings. 

Because I didn't realise that this would happen. I didn't even know you very well. But to tell the truth, it was me who was trying to steal your heart.

I'm an extremely insecure girlfriend and I'm the sort to get jealous when my bf talks to other girls. But recently I find myself masturbating to the thought and image of my bf making out with and touching other girls inappropriately. Tbh I find the scenario quite hot. Is this weird? Does anyone have this experience as well?

Need some advice on depression. My brother is depressed, and he knows it. He hates life, he finds nothing of interest, hates work, hates studying, has no social life.. and I wish I could help but I don't know how to.
It's not like I can tell him to "call a hotline" or "get over it" or "get a proper job" or "find something that interests you", because depression is more than just feeling sad. His mood just affects everyone's mood in the house, my parents have given up, and I too am at my wits end.

Any advice?

I ownself check ownself and realised I am a bad person. Not sure if this is the cause but couldn't do any work this week. Come tomorrow my boss will find out.

My dad came home much later than usual on Friday night and the first thing he said was "Is your job stable? I feel like quitting on Monday." (stress due to too much work) At first I couldn't parse the sentence properly so I kept silent. After like 10 seconds I realised what he said but I continued my silence as I don't think my job is stable. I mean my job can be stable for the next 4-5 years, provided I deliver, but the most recent fact is I can't. I wish I had the guts to tell him, "Go ahead and retire if you feel like it."

Despite my silence, I know I have to and will support the family if he quits.

Feeling stressed. And the worst thing is I have no outlet, no one to talk to. I used to be able to cry it out but now I'm comfortably stressed/numb. Some people smoke or drink, but I don't. Actually even worse is no one except myself really knows the extent of how easily stressed I am.

I thank you in advance for "You can PM me if you want somebody to talk to", but I have to decline. At this moment, there is only one person I want to talk to. But even if we talk, I also don't know what to say.

It's times like this that I realise how weak I am. If only I have someone to prop me up. Then I realise that this thinking is itself a mistake. If I couldn't make it on my own, no one will be able to help me.

So here I am, posting about how pathetic I am in the hope that someone can at least derive joy out of it.

exactly one year ago, my gf left me. deep down, i knew that was coming. i have neglected her and couldn't fulfill the promises that i have made. at first i was angry, angry that she had such high expectations. but only when i thought it through, i realise that i was the one that made her had high hopes. when i first started to date her, i did many things, made many promises. but as time passed, i did lesser and lesser. till the point i felt like everything i did was a chore. when she left, she told me that it wasn't because that i didn't do any of those things i promised. it was because i didn't seem to care anymore now that i've "gotten" her. truth be told, yes i did felt that way. so to all couples out there, never be complacent, don't make the mistake i've made. treasure your SO before they are gone.

I really dont understand how people can move on and love another person so quickly. I have been trying so hard and still no progress.
Its been going 3 years since he left me. Tried all sorts of methods to forget, but they never seemed to work.
Ever since that day, i have been filling my free time with many different activities, hoping to take my mind off him. But everyday there would be something to remind me of him. Stuffed toys, dramas, couples holding hands.. sometimes random memories would come back to me at unexpected timings. He even appears in my dreams regularly.
Tried to tell myself i hate him, he is happy without me, he has moved on and found someone esle, he isnt worth it.. but everytime i think "hey, i think i've made some progress", something has to happen to prove that im still at the starting point. I thought graduating would make things better.. but nop.
Everyone around me thinks im fine. Asking me why i havnt found someone esle, asking if i would like some help in knowing more guys. I would always put on a smile and say let nature take its course. But who am i kidding, even if the best guy were to appear in my life now, i know i will have difficulties accepting him. 
Im not scared of being single for the rest of my life, i totally would have no problems with that.
But i fear at just the thought of not moving on, i fear that i still love him no matter how much i tell myself no. Im really tired of living life like this.

Is it wrong if I'm a completely straight guy who has never been attracted to a male, but enjoy Male/Male pairings? Gay love seems like something so pure; the two guys don't gain any advantage from being with each other like children or money but choose to do so anyway. Men understand each other better than women too. I've been around women my whole life who, while probably unintentional,  made me feel like a tool or something just to be 'used', like for carrying heavy things or security. In my mind these are relationships solely out of love for the other person, not driven by base biological urges to reproduce, or financial security, or social status. Of course I know this is unlikely to be true in real life, but I have my fictional pairings...

I know no guys are going to admit to this (but you'll have good friends to tag you), but to you fujoshis out there, you never know if your BF or guyfriends might enjoy your... hobbies, too.

Hello! I'm an evergreen girl seeking some advice here!

There is this guy in my hall whom I see a lot potential as a 'boyfriend' or even 'husband material'. We would say hi and maybe chat a bit if we met, but never hang out. I don't know if I should ask him out for a meal, due to 2 concerns:
1. If he rejects, I think i will die lol as I value my face and pride a lot (it's stupid but yeah that's my personality D:)
2. I am very busy with hall life and I plan to do summer programmes and research, I don't want to be in a situation whereby eventually im the one who backs out as I cannot commit. I don't want to be held accountable for hurting another person's feelings. 

Any advice from anyone? I'm sick of giving up potential r/s due to wrong timing/other priorities etc but if I always think that way, I might really end up single for life. My friends say I am very 麻烦 aka troublesome, but really the struggle is real. :/

Need to get this off my chest, but seriously doubt this will reach its intended recipient.

Attended some family event overseas, and finally got the opportunity to have a candid, face-to-face chat with a female cousin of mine whose number I got nearly 3 years back and have been keeping in touch periodically for the past few years. I won't say I'm in love with her, given how Chinese traditional families tend to regard marriages between close kin as taboo and even unnatural. But I sense that every time we make eye contact, or talk casually about things from K-Pop to being childhood playmates (since we are of the same age), there is some kind of subtle acknowledgement of mutual affection, or maybe it's just me?

It doesn't help too that I've yet to move on from a very heart-wrenching relationship that ended in tumultuous circumstances more than 3 years ago. I also couldn't help but want to turn our frequent WhatsApp conversations in the direction of issues of the heart; but her reply has always been: the right one has yet to appear. (she's still evergreen though) So now here I am back in Singapore, confused over my feelings for a cousin yet acute to the fact that school work will overwhelm these emotions pretty soon and things will probably return to how it has always been: keeping frequent tabs on each other's lives and ample encouragement as we tackle adult life together.

(I am a guy, btw.)

My friend introduced my to this girl recently. I met up with her but also with my friend and his girlfriend. He arranged me to sit opposite her so I can talk to her. Is that considered a date? I am very clueless.

Advice to  I have been through depression myself and also helped others along the way. What I can say is we don't really like advice nor comfort. That sort of 'it is all right everything is ok' is bullshit to us. But what we need, is your listening ear. Initially, we might take a very long time to open up our problems to you. But my friend, through countless persuasion, finally made me confess. There are times that we screw up things, get into a quarrel for some small reasons but be gentle with us, because we are going through tough times. Give us some leeway and sometimes, give us time to be alone. When I had more 'me time', I could sort out some problems on my own and with some help and a great listening ear, gotten over depression a little. To be exact, depression can last very long (mine last almost a year) and certain events can re-trigger depression. Ultimately, it was dangling between resistance and susceptibility. to you, OP, it takes a lot of effort but it is worth it for your brother. Perhaps he will thank you someday. Take care! :)

TLDR: you never quite leave your past behind

I recently changed my phone. During the setting-up process I sync-ed it up with my old email - and in the process loading up old notes from 2012 in my phone. In doing so I loaded up some of my ex's old notes (I recall lending her my Apple ID when she first got her iphone to download stuff), and I saw some of the things that she used to write to me, and some of the old messages I used to write to her.

We used to write each other long messages for our monthsaries - I wonder when we stopped doing that? - but these messages were the mushiest of the mushy, and somewhat laughable too, but I had fun scrolling through all of them, remembering where we were at different points in time - me entering NS, her starting uni, etc.

It's funny because we don't really talk anymore. Not 'funny' as in ha ha (okay, maybe a bit of bittersweet laughter), but funny because we're so different from who we used to be, and yet the past finds a way to affect the present - as much as I (we?) want to leave it behind.

Thanks for listening. 
-
 
Does anyone else feel that they have nobody to talk to anymore? I mean like htht. It's like everybody is so caught up with their stuff.
 'I'm meeting so and so later."
"I have driving lessons."
"Go there do what?"
It feels like time is so precious that every meet-up has too be assessed, like whether it's worth the trip, or not. Yeah, I know time is precious, but can't we meet-up and just laze around spending quality time together? 
Majority of the time they do work around their time for our meet-up, but we got to be doing something, anything. If there's nothing to do, they're heading back home.
Can't people just sit down, share some videos, watch some shows together and talk about, well.. their life?

Recently my friend showed me some ads on Locanto. There are quite a few ads there by NUS students trying to create chat groups for like-minded uni students looking for casual encounters. What's with that?

There's this guy that I don't know how to approach further. He's very nice, he's from my cca and sometimes he offers to accompany me to the bus stop when it's late. But everytime we meet it's purely cause of cca stuffs and it's like he doesn't care about me outside of cca. When we are alone, he accommodates to my speed so I never have to speed up even slightly. If it's cold he'll ask if I need a jacket. And if I ask him about things, he'll generally be ok with helping. Sometimes I start to overthink his actions but then again he's also the kind of guy who's really nice to everyone.

I want to spend more time with him not just during cca but I don't know how to approach him and he might find it weird if I'm asking him out for lunch for no reason? But at the same time, he hasn't initiate anything and everytime I am the one texting him first. Not that I mind being the first but I'm just afraid he's replying out of courtesy and not because he feels like talking to me. And the worse thing is I'm afraid once exams and holidays are here, ccas will stop and there goes our only contact time. 

I'm constantly feeling he's out of my league. He stays in school and is starting to join more and more stuffs. His life is freaking busy and I think he's the kind girls will like. While I am just lagging behind not knowing what to do.

Anyone get the feeling that your life has gone to shit and continuing to be alive is meaningless? Here's a summary of my life:

Expectation: I'm gonna make a bunch of friends and have a good time in uni!
Reality: No friends, going lesson alone, eating alone.
Expectation: The student population is so big, one day I will find a girlfriend!
Reality: Forever alone. Female friends also don't have. Never even been noticed.
Expectation: I'm gonna join my favourite sport and one day represent the school at IVP or Sunig!
Reality 1: Never made the A team.
Reality 2: Suffered a career-ending injury, probably have to give up the sport for good.
Expectation: With the lack of social life, I should be able to get good grades i.e. at least second upper.
Reality: Nope. Stuck in second lower in final year.

With such a life, how would you even find the will to live? I think the only reason I'm still alive is because I'm too afraid to die. Sigh, such a loser.

I waited for my long-time bf for a year as he went on exchange, only to find that he started a r/s with a girl he met while on exchange. Our r/s was on the rocks but I was really waiting for him to be back to talk things out. The 3rd party is still shamelessly contacting him and clinging onto him, and he can't seem to shake her off. What can/should I do? Should I resort to dressing as skimpy as that 3rd party girl?
-
 
There were many instances I wanted to tell people off, shouted at them, calling them bad names because how they mistreated and lied to me, but I chose to calm myself and hold back. My friend called off a trip last minute after we had planned it for a whole sem to go on a trip with another friend - I hold back. My ex cheated on me and told me to break up - I hold back. Hell I even smile with the one who cheated with my ex. All these are because I believed in the heat of the moment, what I would have said would only hurt my friend and my then "significant other", and it wouldnt solve any problems at all. However, those "holding back" have been building up inside me, leaving me with a great depression and emotional turmoil. I am starting to regret and wishing that I had shouted at them and cursing at them and gave them a good beating. But I didnt. I dont know if I did the right thing anymore. I am still in good term with them but the emotional penalty is currently too heavy for me to handle. Would be great if someone can shed me some light on how to escape this emotion problem.

Girls, stop saying that there are no more good guys out there. Stop staying that they are either all attached, gay or dead. I'm sick and tired of hearing all these. Seriously, this is just what you think, but is that truly the case? I certainly do not think so. 
Good guys and nice guys? Open your eyes girls, they are everywhere. But I know what you're thinking. They don't meet up to your expectations? Your expectations of your perfect ideal boyfriend? Their looks aren't attractive enough for you? Yes I have heard these all. Let's be realistic. You are not perfect, so what makes you think that there's a perfect guy out there? Obviously you should realise by now that your complaints aren't getting anywhere? Why not just take a step back and rethink about what you are looking for? Cause trust me, there's no Prince Charming  out there unless you  want to continue dreaming.  No one can stop you then. 
And to all the good guys out there,  I feel really sorry for you, but I really hope one day you'll find a girl that's worthy of your love.
-
 
I hate how the world judges based on looks. I'm an above average looking girl (please no npnt comments they are extremely irrelevant) together with an average/slightly below average looking guy. A lot of my friends and even people who are my aquaintences are saying how I can easily get a better looking guy. But we're so old and adults already why haven't you realised that looks do not make up everything?? He is incredibly sweet and nice and a good guy at heart. Maybe if you'd consider these guys then you wouldn't be dating good looking douche bags (there are exceptions) that break your heart every few months.

The sun has failed to shine again.

Here I am on the mrt home, after a 6-8pm paper. Gastric pain hurts. But the feeling of knowing all those hours were for nought hurts even more. I was prepared to have late lunch so that hunger would not affect me during the paper, have a nap at noon so that I'll be mentally energized. 
It sucks to see that what I've focused on did not come out. I've totally misinterpreted the crucial questions.

My dreams were fragmented with the essay assignment. And now another potential major has bit the dust.

I should've known my calibre when so many classmates failed to get in NUS. Now I know how it feels like when all your interests dissipate one by one. Maybe I'm just really not suitable for this path.

This pond was too big after all.

Sometimes, I get very confused between liking someone and just admiring someone. I think I fell for a guy within my group of friends unknowingly. I felt so confused, and I started praying to god, asking him if he is really the guy I should go for. He isn't the type of guys that is good in chatting up girls, or so to say. He seems like a block of wood, like a gamer, a geek, yet at times he can be very cheeky and caring, which makes me very curious and wanna get to know more about him. He is really a good guy even though my friends and I were talking about it and they concluded that he isn't the type of guys girls will fall in love with (which I think I did). And I think I am not the type of girls he will like (base on cludes from his past crushes)

The thing I am confused about is that. i dont talk to him that frequently, or we may not have that many common topics to talk about, but I felt so curious about knowing him, and it kind of makes me wonder if that is like or just being lonely. Occassionally I do think of him, wonder what he is doing but I never picked up the courage to text him.  And I don't have the heart racing feeling when I am with him, though I feel nervous when we chat face to face. I just felt so comfortable, safe and so different from  chatting with my other guy friends. So I pray time to time to god hoping for an answer but I never got it.

I used to have a 'more than friends but not dating' relationship with this guy back in secondary school and it eventually faded into a normal friendship because we felt we were too young. It has been years and we are both now attached to other people. He has been giving me quite a lot of compliments recently, and I'm not sure what to make of it. Any ideas? I don't feel close enough to him to ask directly.

Hi all! I'm a year 4 undergrad this year and i'm still evergreen! My circle of closer friends are all guys and I'm wondering how i can break out of this evergreen status. I kinda like this girl from a module i'm taking. She is also my project groupmate. She has a nice smile and a personality i like. I really wish to interact more with her out of project and know her more but she has her own friends/coursemates in our project group. It's hard for me to become closer to her. In fact, i even fantasised about her being my girlfriend but i know it's a far fetch thought at the current state i'm in now.

I have a lack of experience in socialising with girls and past unfortunate events have made my cognitive abilities decline over the years. My memory becomes so bad that i don't remember my past experiences very well. Therefore, i always lack content to share with others. This deters me from talking to girls for too long as I'm afraid i would run out of stuff to talk about. I don't really like to expose my inadequacies to them.

Perhaps, the first step is to get to know more female friends and get myself comfortable in interacting with them on a frequent basis. However, i always have the thought that by doing this, i would be kinda like using other girls as a stepping board to the girl i like. I'm at a lost of how to change my current situation of having little female involvement in my life.

In less than a year's time, i will be moving on to the next phase of life...the working life. The chances of having innocent heart to heart interactions with girls would be so much slimmer. Coming back to this girl i like, i think it would be a great pity for me if i just let this potentially awesome friend or even girlfriend slip by just like this. I really wish to at least become her friend but i don't know what to do from here...ahhh...

The world is far too small. 

Through the past 1 year of being with my boyfriend,  I realised that the guy I lost my virginity to is his army buddy,  another guy who I once had a fwb relationship with was his hall mate and yet another guy who I used to have occasional flings with is his JC friend's boyfriend. 

So.  Damn.  Awkward.

These days people are very smart. They post confessions claiming that they see a chio person. Of course, they do not know who this person is. But once someone tags him/her, they go in for the kill.

P.S. I received 5 PMs thanks to my good friend who tagged me in a post. Sorry, no chemistry from a PM, I don't like strangers.

Recently I came across the trailer of Ariel Lin's movie. As I was watching it, there was only one thing that came to my mind. I felt as though I was the protagonist. The cheating and feeling of being a screwed up person.It was totally me. 

I can't help but think of how I cheated on my boyfriend back then. He placed me on priority over anything else and yet I did that to him. I once thought he was the one I was going to marry. But I guess I didn't deserve a good guy like him.

The scene where the boyfriend got a cake to celebrate Ariel's birthday pained me the most. It reminded me of how my ex would share about his day with me enthusiastically and I would just stare at him blankly without giving him any response. It's not that I'm not interested... It's because of my guilt. 

We eventually broke up but our relationship didn't end well. The first time we crossed paths in school after our breakup was really awkward. We literally just went past each other. Since then, I'll always try to avoid him. Taking a detour because I see him coming in my direction from afar. 

Sometimes when I think of him, I'll cry till my eyes become swollen. I feel so sorry but I couldn't do anything to turn back time. 

I'm sorry for all the hurt I brought to you. I hope you'll find a nice girl soon. A girl that wouldn't hurt you the way I did.

do  you ever just wanna kill your SO when they just dont get it!?!? mine is probably the densest person that has ever graced this earth and i always have to be super explicit if not there is not a chance in a million year that he will actually get the message. I get it that you guys dont read minds but come on! think a little harder would you!

Since the summer holidays, i've been keeping in touch with my ex bf (after breaking up in dec 2013) and since the start of this sem, i even go out with him on fri/sat nights almost every week because both of us are single (and lonely and bored). It seems possible that we can get back together but after he ORDs in dec, he'll be going to uk for uni, and he might even stay in uk for good if he decides to... I dont believe in LDR as i know im not one who can live with my bf being abroad for so long, and if he doesnt come back then what am i even waiting for? Sigh and there are 2 other guys chasing me, and they both dont know the situation im in with my ex (is this status considered amber??) Besides, both arent my cup of tea in terms of looks  but one has a great personality which i admire... Should i move on from the unhealthy relationship with my ex and give one of the guys a chance? ;( any relevant advice is welcome too!

I'm still waiting for some day when someone will love me despite my imperfections. It feels like I've been alone for such a long time, but I know that only through this way can I find the one.

Simple advice. To people with opposite sex platonic friend, don't be in a relationship, 99.99% you will hurt your partner in a way or another. Nobody likes their bf/gf to have opposite sex platonic friend. Choose either one, or end up hurting one of them. Or even both. Imagine your love going out with other guy/girl to a movie without you, how would you feel. If it is fine with you, i think you might as well find another partner that you will actually will feel jealous about. Be sensitive to others, not just yourself.

I am a single girl and never had a boyfriend before. I met a guy and I feel that he is kind of interested in me (not sure, I may be wrong) since he often texts me and asks me to go out sometimes. He is an extroverted guy, has a good sense of humour, makes witty remarks, flirts with random girls and uses slang in every 2 sentences. I am the opposite but deep down, I think he is a very nice and caring person and I secretly wish he likes me.

Recently, he, I and some other friends were talking about sex, porn, masturbation etc. I was clueless about all the terms. I only knew about basic sex - the way it is described in biology books and nothing more. I heard some of terms before but never felt the need to know the meaning and no one at home talks about it also. Personally, I did not think it was necessary to know so much details so I didn't search online earlier. Everyone had a fun time explaining stuff to me. We all laughed a lot and they called me an innocent kid. At that point, I laughed along with them but later on it slowly struck me that now the guy certainly thinks I am stupid and will lose interest in me. After all, he is so well-informed about these things and I seem to know very little.

However, just because I don't know about advanced sex terms doesn't mean that I don't believe in love. I often fantasise about how it would feel like to have a boyfriend. I imagine walking with someone at night holding his hand, watching stars at Town Green. I imagine watching the sunset together at a beach. For me, love is more than just having sex. It is an emotional connection. It is about sharing your joys and sorrows, caring about each other's feelings and accepting your partner with their strengths and weaknesses. It is the feeling that you can trust someone to be always there for you no matter how challenging the circumstances are. Sex is fine too, but I am quite traditional and would want to have sex only after marriage.

This is my view of love. I understand that everyone has their different opinions and I do not judge people who think otherwise, but I do feel sad that this guy won't be interested in me anymore because I am so 'innocent'. I had some feelings for him but now I have to get over it.

People who know me in real life can never guess I wrote this post. They probably think I am too busy studying and never thought about love and relationships, but it's not true. I feel attracted to guys too and I am looking forward to that day when I find my true love.

I am attached to a guy who is really nice to me.  However,  I have this problem: I want attention from other guys too. 

Perhaps this was borne out of my lifestyle before I met my boyfriend.  Since I was 18, I dated multiple guys at a time (but that wasn't cheating since they knew I was just casually dating) and always had multiple guys messaging me.   At that point of time,  my view was that such meaningless message is rather lame and that I wanted a proper boyfriend. 

So in the end I got together with my boyfriend because he is so attentive.  But even with that I still crave attention from other guys.  I probably see attention as a way to validate myself.  I still like to flirt with guys through messages and when I got to bars or clubs,  I embrace the attention when guys hit on me. 

I feel bad about this but I don't know what to do.   I feel that this gives my life some excitement or else being in a stable relationship becomes very monotonous. 

I am actually very worried about getting caught by my boyfriend like if he sees my messages or his friends happens to see me flirting with guys.   I never actually physically cheated on him but I think he will probably break up with me?  Just want to ask the guys around here,  if you caught  your girlfriend going such things but she didn't actually cheat on you,  will you still be able to forgive  her or would this already be a deal breaker in your eyes?

This has been bothering me for quite some time alr.

After a year tgt, my gf just broke up with me last month because she felt that she felt that we are not suitable and she needed time by herself and worked on herself and loved herself more before she can love someone else. Of course, i was heartbroken but decided to respect her decision and move on and let her go. However, it was more difficult than ever esp when we see each other everyday as we are in the same clique of friends. And she still treats me like what we used to except without any physical contact this time. So, I am really confused now and really dont know what she is thinking now.

Really hope you guys can help me out on this. Much appreciated.

What happen when 10, 20 years down the road some day and you meet the person whom used be your everything, whom used to be close with you until something happened, whom you were so deeply in love with. Will you still feel the same? The amount of emotions, memories and regrets. Things that the two of you have done together. Things that you shouldn't have said. Things that you should have done. Sad. Extremely sad. Wish I had met you earlier. Things may be different. I miss you. I really miss you.

I have been feeling incredibly lonely for years now. There's this crushing feeling in my chest whenever I think about it. It's starts right in the middle and spreads up my throat and down my arms and it kinda ends with a numb tingling feeling in my fingers. I yearn to be once again be included in a clique of friends with whom I can spend time with. I long to be intimate with someone who loves cuddling as much as I do. It really hurts to see happy couples all around holding hands, hugging, kissing, etc. It hurts even more when they are my closest friends.

I also have a confession to make. I have five different instant messaging apps on my phone yet I can go days without a single notification. I set reminders on my phone just so I have an excuse to "respond" and take my phone out in front of my friends and pretend I have a social life because I have other friends chatting with me. But the truth is that I just don't like being the only one at a clique meetup or gathering who isn't consistently on her phone messaging her significant other.

I really don't know why I do this kind of stupid things, because in the end, my friends won't even care.

When is a date a date? Just because I go out with a member of the opposite sex for a movie and/or dinner alone doesn't automatically make it a date right? How do I know when it's platonic or romantic assuming this goes on for a while and neither of us says anything?

What's the definition of flirting? Liking an Instagram/Facebook post? Sending kissy emojis? Being suggestive but cheeky so there's plausible deniability ("I was only just kidding", one might say)? How do I know if he/she is flirting with me?

Me and my gf are sexually active for about 1 year now. However i feel like my libido is lower than her, because sometimes after a long day at school, i just want to go back and rest but she wants it so badly. I know the general assumption is that the guy is always ready for more sex than the girl, so can i ask for advice on what i can say to my gf to let her know that i am just not into it for certain days without hurting her feelings or make her feel less of a woman, since i don't want her to feel like she is not attractive or sexy enough to get me into it. Truthfully, she is hella sexy and attractive. Thanks.

I've always been curious about what a different type of life good-looking guys live. I'm a below average guy, I exercise a bit but I'm not buff at all. Most guys know what kinda life I lead. Nobody takes a second look at us, nobody checks us out, paper bag would be preferred, etc etc. 

It's obvious that good-looking girls get a lot more attention and get hit on a lot. But does the same happen for good-looking guys? Don't need ask for picture because you'll just report to Facebook to delete. :(

There was once a girl I liked so much that I'm totally crazy about her. I'm always worried about her and her feelings. I was so overwhelmed that I wasn't able to make the best decisions for her. Even when I knew at the back of my mind that I should be doing things differently, I can't fight my emotions. Maybe I was trying too hard but I ended up making her sad and angry all the time instead. 

Then there was another girl that l liked but only barely more than a friend. I was more sensible. I didn't really cared to figure out what she's thinking and just did what I thought was right. Somehow, I ended up doing a lot of sweet things for her. I think I made her really happy when I'm part of her life. 

Looking back, I sometimes wonder if loving someone too much is a bane after all.

My boyfriend still keeps in touch with his ex-girlfriend and I'm a bit uncomfortable about it. I've spoken to him about it before but he just says that they are only friends. I feel that he would rather give me up then to not contact his ex-girlfriend at all. He has said it indirectly before. Sure, his ex may be living overseas now, but it still makes me a bit uncomfortable. It doesn't help that he went to consult his ex-girlfriend when we recently had an argument. He showed her our text messages (that was where the argument took place) and of course she sided with him. :(

I'm always amused when the students who are fundraising by washing cars send an attractive girl to ask if I want my car washed. If only they knew they'd have better luck sending an attractive guy instead...

 Have a good talk with him about your concerns. Not just asking him to stop gambling but why you are concerned etc. If he cares about your feelings, he would at least consider your point of view and not just ignore it completely. Gambling is not an easy addiction to quit and judging that he can lose up to thousand a month, I don't think it is something he can do alone. If you think it is something out of your control in helping him, accompany him to a help/counselling centre. If possible, be there for him every session because support would do a great deal to help him. As long as he has the slightest will to want to change, I think its possible as long as someone is there to help him and push him on the way because it's not surprising for him to want to give up halfway. I know for one that my dad gave up smoking for my mum when they were deciding to get married. What I'm trying to say that people can do things they don't want to or thought they couldn't do for the people they love and care about.

To the OPs of  and 
Oh my... When I read the first post, I felt so sad. Then later I saw someone reply, it seems like a lost love. I hope both of you managed or will manage to work it out. If you both currently still have feelings for each other, I hope you are willing to give it another go?

I know I'm just some anonymous person standing at the sidelines, but I hope you two will recover from the heartbreak. All the best.

i am an evergreen girl, with average looks. certainly not the kind of girl that'll walk into a room and heads will turn. people always say i'm the kind of girl that guys would want to marry. i have turned down guys who confessed to me, and the reason i give them is i only see them as close friends and i'm not prepared for a relationship. i worry that i'll never be prepared for a relationship. it looks like i'll be living life as a cat lady (which might not be all that bad bc i do like cats). most of the time, i am content and satisfied being single. but there are also times where i feel sorry for myself bc i can never seem to give myself a chance to fall in love ):

I've always been quite shy and socially awkward and hence a lone wolf while you are more extroverted and have no problems making friends. One day you came into my life like a ray of sunshine and it was like we were similar on so many levels. We quickly became good friends with a never ending whatsapp conversation...then I made the mistake of falling for you when you never saw me the same way. Many months later we drifted apart due to our own lives' circumstances. While you easily found new friends to grow closer to, I'm still stuck alone in the past, thinking about you. I wonder if I was ever as important to you as you were to me back then. Maybe the sad truth is that I was just one of your many friends.
Our whatsapp conversation is still ongoing, but you now take days to reply. While I've long given up on expecting instant replies, I don't think anyone could be THAT busy, right? I want nothing more than to move on, but there's no one to fill the hole left by you. There's no one else that I can have such conversations with. And I cannot bring myself to just stop replying you because it would berude. I don't know if you are just continuing to reply me out of the same misplaced sense of righteousness, but delaying it in order to convey a hint of your unwillingness. I hope you will be honest and tell me straight if you really don't wish to carry on the conversation anymore. It will hurt, but at least I will finally be able to move on.

To the guys who think that girls don't like nice guys, I'm one of the exceptions. I think 'nice guys' aka 'kena rejected for being too nice to a girl he likes' kind of guys do make the best boyfriends. Current boyfriend is one of those guys; he's my best friend of almost 10 years and I've watched him bawled his eyes out over a girl whom he really liked few years ago. In front of me, on 2 or 3 separate occasions. And I was there, feeling sorry and at the same time, upset that those girls who turned him down can't see how amazing he is (yes I developed feelings for him but that's beside the point). He may not be the kind of guy who likes to dress up (unlike me), but he's decent, family oriented, smart, humble and committed. And all those qualities are not enough for a boyfriend? I honestly don't get why some girls fall for bad choices when someone, who has done a lot for them, is standing right in front of them. 

And they claimed the world is running out of guys who are boyfriend material. Seriously. 

I'm lucky to be with my best friend aka the nice guy, and I'm glad that he's with someone who is able to appreciate him better than other girls he had chased last time. My gain, their loss. 

To the other nice guys out there, don't lose hope. I'm sure you'll find someone who appreciates you for who you are eventually :) 

Btw, I'm the OP of  (the going dutch on dates confession), and sorry if I seem to have an old fashioned mindset. I find myself baffled by the relationship dynamics of our generation nowadays :\

I feel guilty whenever i am enjoying good food, having fun with my friends. My parents are complaining how $5-6 is considered expensive for a meal while on the other hand, i am spending $20++ (min) on a meal when meeting up with friends.

I really dislike how i am burning my money away during meetups while my parents are trying to scrimp on every cents. Even though i try to bring my parents out for a good meal every 1-2 months, they will prefer me saving the money for myself to splurging on them. 

So, how do i get over these guilt-ridden feelings?
-
 
To OP , one of the strongest crushes in my life turned out to be on a girl who had no ass and no boobs, but had a pretty face. It was her looks that made me first take notice, but it was her smile that made me go crazy. For the record, she caught a lot of attention from other guys' too as I had quite a fair bit of competition.

So, speaking from a personal viewpoint, I really doubt you would have problems attracting guys. That said, as some pointed out in the comments, different guys are attracted to different types of girls. My guys-only cliques can never seem to reach a consensus on how attractive any given girl is. And after a while, we acknowledge the differences and say things like "Eh, this girl not my type, but I think is yours, correct or not?"

Long story short, there are guys who find you attractive physically. And smile more often.

I really really love my boyfriend but there's sometimes about him that I find is hard to accept. He's a compulsive gambler. In uni, when people think of bad habits, they'll usually think of smoking and drinking. But seldom do one think of gambling. He can lose up to a few thousand dollars a month. I'd beg him to reduce his betting frequency, but he doesn't listen. What should I do? I really do love him but I fear for our future...

How do we define the word friends. I go to school, I talk to some people from my course and 90 percent of the time is academic related. We do help each other out very often. However, I only see and talk to them during lectures and occasionally have lunch with them. I don't hang around with them outside of school. Are they still considered friends?
-
 
I look confident or at least normal on the outside but deep down my life is very screwed. My grades are poor, I am socially awkward, I am a burden to my project mates, I have a hard time finding people to work in my project, I screwed up lots of things during my NS and I got fired in three of the jobs that I work after a few days as my superiors say I am inefficient and I hold back everyone. I have tried to improve myself in this area but It seems like I am stuck in this vicious cycle. Should I still continue to put on this confident façade? I have a few crushes but I am afraid to even approach them as I think they will reject me for who I am since girls don't go for guys who cant manage themselves right? Sometimes, I wonder if I still have the rights to love someone given the fact that I may be a burden to them.

With so many posts on fwb, can someone tell me whr to find them? Like really LOL. I have stong needs now
-
 
I don't know why recently there are so many posts about sex and fwb. Before you engage in those activities, please give some serious thought to these:
1) ask yourself: do you really NOT mind if your future spouse has had sex with exes or fwb? Look at some past posts you will definitely see someone complaining about their partner having done it before with others and is currently feeling uncomfortable with it. If you don't want this to happen to you, then put yourself in your future spouse's shoes. Don't do it; don't let him/her down.
2) Come on, who won't wanna marry a virgin? Exclusively yours for life (yes marriage is for life). Yet they don't save theirs for their spouses. Is this fair?
3) why so despo to lose your virginity? To follow trend? That's silly. Why be a follower? You are young adults so please be more mature.
4) worried about not being able to lose it? Seriously?? Do you have such low esteem and low confidence in yourself? 
5) YOLO?  No. You only die once and live every single day. Live your life with some self respect for yourself. And your body. Sleeping around is no different from being a prostitute. Except that the latter still gets some money out of it while you don't.
6) If you were your parents, how would you feel? Will you want the same thing to happen to your future children? Set the right example so that you don't have to feel ashamed of your past when you tell stories to them in future. 
7) Contraception has its own risks. They do not have 100% guarantee that things won't go wrong. Also, pills are harmful and will ruin your body. If you want to become a parent in future, better think twice.

So please, to all desperate people out there, whether you are attached or fwb, stop thinking about getting laid. Spend all your energy on your studies instead.

PS: I'm happily married. Not some forever alone guy in case you are wondering. And yes, we saved ours till wedding day. It's priceless.

I am a caucasian exchange student and I am really interested in Asian girls, but I don't know how to approach them? They seem really shy, but also very cute. 
Can you please help me?

Before me and my boyfriend got together, there was once I let out a really smelly silent fart in front of him. I was dying of embarrassment and trying to avoid his eyes. He also pretended like nothing happened and continued talking to me about whatever we were talking about. We never acknowledged it. Then after we got together it happened again. We ignored it and pretended nothing happened as we did before. I wish we could fart happily and freely in front of one another without feeling embarrassed or having to awkwardly pretend we couldn't smell it. How do couples get over the initial awkwardness and embarrassment to the stage whereby they can fart and joke about the smell in front of each other?
-
 
Is it true that a guy will cherish a girl less if not much effort was put into courting the girl? Like we just met and were friends for awhile before getting together....I didn't have the feeling of being woo-ed at all. I agreed to be together with him solely because I like him too.

Is it normal and/or acceptable to fantasise about another person when I am attached, if I have no intention to act upon said fantasy? Does it mean that this I am somehow subconsciously dissatisfied with my current relationship?

To the poster of  I FEEL YOU. I feel the same way. Guess finding friends who resonate you is pretty difficult, with cliques and groups already formed since the beginning. Like you, I went to camps, and also events like dinner within my cohort. But I guess in the end, finding that friend who's there for you is really difficult. A friend who's really there for you when you need him/her. Wish we could know each other and share this nonsense but then this won't be anonymous anymore hahaha. All the best in surviving uni!

The bad news for ugly girls is boys do care alot about a girl's look. To those who said they care about a girl's character more, think about the last time you see a pretty girl vs the last time you see a ugly girl. You get turn on by the pretty girl right? Being turn on by pretty girl is hard wired inside a male's unconscious mind. This is because beauty is a language that conveys information about health and fertility.

There are also several good news though
1) Most male tend to find female more attractive than female find themselves
2) A female can appear more attractive by smiling
3) A female can exercise more often to make appear more healthier and hence, more beautiful

How do I get the attention of a guy whom I think is nice and want to know him better? We have only known each other from the start of this semester as we are in the same group for a certain practical class. He does talk to me during class, but not much and it is always about the practical at hand. On the other hand, he does joke around with the other guys in the group. A couple of times he sat beside me for class (though i am not sure if it was just a coincidence) but we never really got to chat with each other. He also seems like a sociable person, but it seems that he prefers to interact with guys more than girls.(and i don't know why this is the case)
So, i was thinking if I should add him on fb, but i don't want to seem desperate or overly enthusiastic as I am now the one who talks the most in our class group chat. And i think that by now, I should have appeared in his 'recommended friends' list so he must have a reason for not adding me. 
I really would appreciate some advice as to what to do here, as the class has only a few more sessions and we won't be seeing each other after that. Hope we will at least become slightly closer friends.

You know what?
We need a more inclusive awareness about depression.

When depression is described, it usually (but not always) amounts to variations of ‘feeling sad’. But I don’t ‘feel sad’, so I spent ten years thinking that I was just super lazy and undisciplined. 

Then, someone made an effort to point out that I might have depression. Had I never been introduced to the more ‘obscure’ symptoms, I never would have realized that I was worrying about the wrong things.

For some people, depression amounts to;

A bleak outlook on your life - feelings of hopelessness and disinterest in your future.
Persistent and chronic feelings of ‘sadness’ and ‘helplessness’
Thoughts of suicide and/or self harm.
But for me, depression is NOT any of those. I have;

Daily physical and mental exhaustion, but also severe insomnia. I am yawning by mid afternoon, but I can only scrape an average of five hours of sleep.
Lacking the ability to consciously construct a train of thought (without great effort). This prevents me from doing schoolwork, household chores, or socializing.
Chronic restlessness and physical discomfort, which accumulates to general grumpiness and frustration 24/7.
Persistent body pains and aches, especially in my neck and arms. 
An altered perception of time. I forget sentences as I’m speaking them. It’s difficult to tell if something happened two hours ago, or two days ago. Every waking moment just blurs into one big boring stretch of unsatisfactory.
You can’t muscle through depression. Things will not get easier the more you try to tackle them. You know a great treatment for depression? Accommodating to it. Making your life easier. Recognizing the things you can and can’t do. 

We need more people to recognize their depression. Otherwise, they’ll keep struggling and struggling and they’ll wonder why everyone is having such a good time while they’re using up all their spoons simply by driving to work.

I am just wondering what love really is like and how much a couple is willing to sacrifice for each other.

So I'm posting a question to all the couples that are very in love with each other now. Imagine what if one of your partner was found to have a certain illness such as diabetes, would you give up on your partner?

Is it even possible for someone who have been texting you daily for months to stop texting all of a sudden and not feel anything at all? I feel like I'm dying. Whenever I'm in my friend's car, I would hope that I get into some accident and just die.

I'm embarrassed by my brother. I know its awful to say it but I am. He's 25, evergreen and socially awkward. He has no close friends at all. The two times he met my female friends, he was interested in both of them. It was awkward as hell. I learnt to just not ever let my female friends meet him. At the same time I feel really bad because out of all my siblings, he's the only 'unlucky one' - short genes (really quite short for a guy), no double eyelid etc. I feel like a horrible sister but I don't know what I can do? I don't get to spend much time with him, but when we do in social situations I try to point out areas where he can improve on how he interacts with others etc. Not only myself, but my other relatives have attempted to help him improve himself so that he can finally get into a relationship (my mother and he are both super desperate for this to happen). But he doesn't seem willing to take our advice (eg. we advise him to shave because he's one of those guys that really really can't pull off stubble, but he doesn't do so). It also doesn't help that he doesn't seem to have any ambitions in life?? He's working with low pay in the F&B industry, and after being pushed to study in private uni by my mother, he dropped out in the third year. I was actually really upset by this because he wasted SO much of my mother's money when we are not well off, and his reason for dropping out is because he realised that his interest just wasn't in it. So basically: he doesn't have a degree (bare minimum these days in my opinion honestly), he almost failed out of poly, he is unlucky to not be average looking, is extremely socially awkward and imo his character really isn't a good one??? I am honestly embarrassed to be related to him and I don't know if it's me being a horrible sister because I've tried to help him improve himself but he seems seriously unwilling to??? Like I don't think any normal girl would want to date him and I know how badly he wants a girlfriend but with the way he's been acting for however many years, I don't think it's going to happen. Should I just accept that he's that way and just not bother anymore???

I'm 23 and a few of my same aged friends are thinking about things like BTO, getting married and all. It kind of surprise me that they are thinking of marriage even though they have only dated for 1-2 years. I know there is no "right" time to get married and you should do it when it feels right, but i still feel that 2 years is too short a period to really get to know someone. Marriage is a whole different ball game and it honestly scares me that people are ok with plunging into that. I have been dating my SO for about 2 years now and i never once felt like it was the right time. Am i doing it wrongly???

I'd like to share a concern of mine. My bf and I belong to the same clique of friends (mostly girls), and I feel uncomfortable sometimes when these female friends of ours accidentally have wardrobe malfunctions in front of us (e.g. when we're having lunch at a table and she leans down and me and my bf can see her cleavage & bra). I know my bf was looking, and I don't blame him either because I saw, too. But I can't help feeling uncomfortable and slightly ego-bruised since my own chest isn't a mountainous region like hers. I can't help wondering if he enjoyed the momentary view, even if it was just for a fleeting moment.

I feel very sad for my friend. Her jerk ex broke up with her over whatsapp (!!!!) and got together with another girl "a few months later". (The two of them have been talking for the longest time before that) I don't understand why and how the new couple's friends are so supportive of this relationship and ships them like crazy? Walao eh I thought people usually disapprove of this kind of relationships? 

But I'm kind of happy that she's now single, if you know what I mean ;)

People nowadays don't want boyfriends/girlfriends, they just want someone that acts like one and is loyal and caring to them, while they fuck around so that they can have the best of both worlds

Regarding the alleged racism it could be that the OP misinterpreted the presenter but just want to point out that the fact that he could not have had such an outburst without having faced a fair amount of racism before. Our nation has turned 50 but I still have friends who openly profess they are racist and seem to bond over that fact, glorifying in racist "jokes" and shunned me because I expressed my dislike towards racists. I have had a friend humiliated after her secret pal talked loudly to his friends that he was disappointed that she was Indian and dark-skinned. I have had friends openly "joking" about how Malays are stupid and lazy right in front of my Malay friend who was already sad over her grades and who was clearly feeling awkward but didn't scold them as they told her not to take it seriously which I think was just an excuse for them. I sometimes also wonder whether Malays do not dare to aim higher because they would be surrounded by more non-Malays in higher education and be subjected to more discrimination. There are many more examples. So I'm thinking I am not that surprised if the OP's suspicions were true. Of course the majority of Singaporeans are not racist but I think people should not quickly dismiss the minorities' claims of racism even though it may be an overreaction depending on the case. 

Now regarding the feelings of ugliness. I have been bullied over my small, single-eyelid eyes before, had someone hint to me to get surgery, was told that I could never be pretty with such eyes, openly laughed at and was even told by a guy that I would be his eye candy if not for my eyes (not that I care about him though). Of course this affected me a lot and I feel very sad just once in a while remembering the trauma but it actually deepened my resolve to never get surgery because my eyes are not something meant to be fixed and I have had quite a number of compliments about my overall looks before too and most importantly I believe I am pretty enough. I will always remember feeling like the ugliest girl in the world and I hope others have the strength to not feel this way.

To all those suffering from bullying/discrimination do know that you are not the only one and that you have to find people who care no matter if its difficult initially because there are people who do. I'm sorry for the long rant. Welcome any thoughts.

reading all these relationship stories and I'm just here like, forever alone. I have a question for people in FwB arrangements. Quickies aside, do fwbs engage in foreplay? And if so, does it involve kissing? Since kissing generally conveys romantic feelings, and romantic feelings are like death to fwbs. Sorry for the noob question. As mentioned at the start, I'm forever alone.

A few months ago, my JC friend from the student council unfriended me on Facebook. We worked together, although we were not very close, we were on friendly terms, sort of like acquainted. I was shocked she unfriended me and only me, but not the other mutual friends we've got. :O I still don't understand the reason till date.

I don't flood people's news feed with insensitive or offensive posts about religion, politics etcetera, and neither do I post photos of everything I consume. I simply use Facebook to connect with old and new friends and share some articles about current affairs and that's it. Okie, I am okay with it. I take it as a sign that she was not interested to keep in touch with me, since as I quite remember she was the elitist type of person who likes to associate herself with outstanding and popular people, especially the president, vice-president and exco of the council. Since I'm just an average Jane, so maybe I'm not worth to be part of her social circle. I'm fine with it, since I don't need her in my life as well.

However, I received a friend request from her last night. I accepted it, since I gave her the benefit of the doubt that the previous "unfriending" was a merely Facebook glitch. Then she messaged me asking me to like her new Facebook page on her lifestyle. An attempt to "harvest" Likes. On her lifestyle page, she brags about all the branded goods she bought, her expensive travels to Paris, and her hangouts with Caucasian men. "AMDK!" as what my boyfriend always say :-) I'd say her lifestyle page is quite interesting and definitely an object of envy for a poor Singaporean girl like myself.

Politely, I agreed and gave her page a like, and she didn't reply me after that. End of conversation. This morning, I checked her profile out again for curiosity sake, and guess what? There's an option to add friend. She unfriended me again! Wow! So much for online etiquette. It's not because I am hard up for her gold-made FB friendship, but her actions are actually very rude to think about it.

So I blacklisted her and unliked her page immediately. A childish game of tit for tat. If she request anything from me again next time, I'll ignore her. These are the type of friends we should avoid. She's an SMU student btw, but I'm certain not many SMU students are as arrogant as her. 

And in the light of recent news, Facebook is in a dilemma of whether they should add a "dislike" button. I think it is a bad idea, since it's less "hostile" online to either like something or ignore it. Adding in a dislike is damaging to the soul of the OP, because it's very misleading on whether the dislike is meant personally for the OP or for the content itself. The social media can impact the feelings of others as murders have taken place because the victims didn't give a thumbs up to the murderers' FB posts. Online etiquette shouldn't be taken too lightly. I hope she can understand this.

Coming from a single parent family, i have always supported my dad lookin for his other half after my mom's passing when I was kid. 

A few months ago, my dad brought someone whom he met from a single parent dating site for dinner. As my dad wanted to make it a casual date, he too extended the invitation to her daughter as well.

The two of us hit it off really well and we often meet up for supper almost twice every week. 

Now that my dad wanted to take the next step with my to be step mother, i'm afraid that the feelings that i've developed for her might not be appropriate in the future if our parents are to move on any further.

What should i do... :(

After CCA trainings the team will usually go a canteen for dinner. I also go to the same canteen for dinner alone because my schedule is as such. I've been on hiatus from the CCA for 6 months and counting due to injury. Thing is, I've never been very close to anyone i.e. outside of CCA I'm mostly hi-bye with them whereas they have internal cliques and so on. Neither am I a star player so I'm dispensable. What should I do if I were to encounter them at the same canteen? I don't want to purposely avoid them, but at the same time I feel very awkward and unwelcome when I think about just showing up and inserting myself into the group. After all I've been out of the loop for so long plus there are a few new faces from the freshie batch that don't even know me (nor I them). Unfortunately I don't always have the luxury of choosing any table/seat I want. I'm okay with eating alone, but I'm afraid of eating alone at a table within the group's view.

So many stories of people cheating on their partners lately, it's sickening. Is it really that hard to be faithful to your partner? If things are getting old and boring, then it's time for you two to either try something new or to move on. People who cheat are just cowards who want the best of both worlds, the stability of a relationship and the excitement of someone new.

The next time any of you face that temptation, try acting like a grown-up. If you want to have sex with someone else, please tell your partner. Get the slap and break-up you deserve before you do it.

 tl;dr version: Not sure if I'm the one you're referring to, but I'll be back approx two weeks from now. :)

long version: There's a heck lot of things I want to say, but I'll try to keep it short...er.

I actually wanted to post a direct reply to the post when it was up, but wasn't sure if it was referring to me (though the description matches me exactly), so here I am, anonymous posting to save myself from potential embarrassment.

Sorry for vanishing all of a sudden like that for a few months now. Started losing motivation over exam season last semester, especially when I started plateauing. Tried to return, but ICT, RT and other excuses made me choose the easier choice of not going to the gym. Did I give up at that point? I think I may have. Felt as though I wasn't progressing as I should have been, and that made me pissed at myself for my shitty discipline.

I've been having these strong impulses to return to the gym (feel like a slob currently; physique agrees with my sentiment), but I had to settle RT first, which drained quite a bit of time and energy. I'm happy to say that I just cleared my final RT session on the night your post appeared, so I'm finally ready to return to the gym.

I may have lost a lot of strength and size during my hiatus, but I'll definitely be back to regain them and hopefully gain more. Will need to plan my goals this time around. First, gotta work through midterms, so I'll start gymming by mid-October. I can't wait to return.

It's hard for me to put this in any other way, but to the person who posted  thank you. :)

A guy and I are very close friends and although the we never went further, it felt like there was something there. There were so many things we shared with each other that we didn't share with anyone else. 

Just as I was gathering the courage to tell him I wanted more, he told me he had asked out another girl and put me through the agony of details of how he adores her and what he's planning for this first date. Worst of all, he's still a close friend and his girlfriend is also pretty nice. Guess I'm just going to have to get over him.

My friends around me had been chatting and discussing about how they should go about looking for their significant other recently (we are all in our 3rd year of university and still evergreen). Truth is, i am not keen to get into a relationship but i was told by my mom that as a girl, i should not tell anyone, not even my friends that i am intending to stay single as society in general will judge me and think i am weird. Her reason for this were the following

1) people will suspect that i am not straight
2) people will think something is wrong with me mentally, because it was believed that it's is only natural if you feel attracted to the opposite gender and if you have no feelings towards the opposite gender, then you are just weird in people's opinion.
3) worst if by thirties, if a woman is i still evergreen by then, some people might nickname such women "old hag"

Personally the reason i wish to stay single is because i am happy the way i am now and i  see no need to get into relationship. And i read too much stories about how badly a relationship can possibly fail (of course i know there are good ones too). I know that a relationship takes efforts to find and maintain i do not wish to divert my attention to any relationship as i simply wish to give my all to my career. Lastly i felt that if you have good friends who can spend time with you, you don't neccessarily need to get married to be happy.

I am very disappointed with my mom's opinion that a guy can easily tell people he wish to stay single and not be judged, because society believes that a guy no matter how old, can always get married later on as long as he have the money. But for a girl, if you state your intention  to stay single, people judge because a girl have only until her thirties which is the optimal time for her to find a soulmate. Thus if you not "kan cheong" now, then you are weird to not like the opposite gender at this age (21).

Please i wish to hear opinion from you all on why my mom believe all these may happen to a woman, even at such modern times. Is there any truth to what my mom said, like my friends will judge me the moment i say i wish to stay single? And is it true some people in society call women who are still single in their thirties an "old hag"? is it true in general society judge a woman for intending to stay single and not a man? I think it's better to hear from you all the younger generation rather than my mom who's from the older generation...

Fell for this girl back in JC, got rejected, and I attributed it to perhaps me not being able to give her a sense of security and maturity, in the sense that I was failing badly in school tests and hence seemed like those frivolous kid who doesn't take things seriously. It crushed me at that time and I was unable to focus on the important things(pulling up my grades), leading to lots of difficulties before I made it  into Uni. Now, I have since let it go and am doing pretty alright academically and in life in general... annnnnd I just got rejected again by another girl with her message being, once read between the lines, that I wasn't good enough. Appearance-wise, I suppose I am probably above average looking in general(people have complimented me for my looks every now and then and are always surprised when they find out I am evergreen). Personality wise, I guess I am the expressionless kinda guy (People laugh from my lack of, rather than extravagant expressions when it comes to big news and all). I guess the problem lies within, maybe that I actually suck, or I can't talk to girls well. Doesn't feel too great and it makes me feel that I have to pretend to be someone I am not.

Hi everyone. This is going to be a rather long post so hope you can bear with me. 

Despite being in NUS for 2+ years (i'm a year 3 student) I'm rather sad to say that I have not made many friends here. The ones I know are all the usual "Hi Bye" kind and I don't know any one in NUS who i can just talk cock to and that guy would just talk more cock back. Even from my own faculty i dont really know that many ppl. I did join my faculty's orientation camp and during the camp i moved around with a group of 3 others, but after the camp those guys found their own clique from their halls and after that we never really got together anymore. I do still see them once in a while and as usual, walk past them saying hi without batting much of an eyelid. 

Outside of NUS i do have a decent number of cliques (not many, but one i'm content with) from army, JC and sec. school. Once in a while i'll meet up with some  of them studying in NUS for lunch or something. I know you guys will say go joiN CCAs and stuff to get to know more ppl, but the thing is the major that i'm doing is pretty hectic with packed timetables and content heavy modules that i simply dont have time to do all those stuff. I know its rather contradictory here, me wanting to get to make more friends but unwilling to join CCAs and Its not that i'm antisocial or anything. Its just that im not prepared to sacrifice my studies for the sake of some social life (again, contradictory i know). I guess its the nature of uni life? 

When i was in year 1 i was kinda desperate to take modules with others (those i already knew outside NUS) so I arranged my timetable to suit theirs. I guess this did not help things much since i always stuck around with ppl i was already familiar with. In year 2 i kinda gave up since its not easy to match time tables so I did most of my mods alone. It was a bonus if i happened to know anyone  doing the same mod. To be honest I kinda enjoyed the freedom, being able to do whatever i like (eat, study or just go to the library alone and surf youtube) without having to worry about what others want to do. However in year 3 now the sense of loneliness is slowly coming back and hence the reason for me writing this. Everytime i see a large group of ppl laughing and joking together makes me kinda jealous and sad since i'm alone in school most of the time.

Thanks for reading this damn long and rather emo post. Just wanted to get this off my chest and sorry for any grammatical errors or whatever. Typing this at 2am and im kinda sleepy already. And lastly good luck all for your remaining mid terms!

Back in Pre-U, I used to be one of those talkative person who makes all the jokes and all, basically the life of the party. However, things turned for the worst and I eventually ended up having to balance part time studies with work as I tried to make it into Uni. During those trying times, i encountered plenty of difficulties. It was then that my talkative self began to die out as, coupled with a decreased frequency of social events, I became a much more stoic and dry person. Nowadays in Uni, I am more of the "don't talk so much" kinda person, which was a far cry from my Pre-U days. I feel I have difficulty opening up to new people, having previously closed myself for an extended period. Although I am not "anti-social" as defined by conventional means (decent social media following, never ate lunch  alone etc.), I find that it will be very difficult to have new close friends, or to enter into a relationship (having trouble developing one as I write). I have a feeling that when shit goes down (I die or something), many people might attend my funeral, but hardly any will truly remember me. Hence, I am not too sure of what to do now. Am I supposed to embrace my new "lone wolf" persona, or conform and adapt?

 Hi, I get how you feel. Although I support a "top four club", until recently (with the F.A cup victories- okay quite obvious which club) I used to get alot of stick from others for my club's failure to win things and sign big players. 

My choice of name to put on my jersey wasn't the "star players" (think fabregas, v.persie, walcott; I got alot of jeers when they left the club because i was an avid fan-that was in jc). It was a relatively unknown defender who had like, one good season in the french league and was signed for the first team (koscielny). You might have known that he struggled early on, before becoming a key player in the side today. But that period of time while he was adapting, I found it hard sometimes to wear my jersey; people would commend about it, and given his tendency to score own goals and give away costly penalties, it made me stressed. 

I do have an idea which club you support, and I guess try not to let them get to you? Hopefully your club manages to improve, the season is still long. Can't really say much though, just to let you know that I feel you...

To  + personal rant

This is probably a little late since your post was like a month ago. But I just want to say that I have an eating disorder too, and I get how you feel. I'm in recovery now and there are days I wake up appalled at just how huge I have gotten. My mind is constantly overwhelmed with food. It ruined me socially too because now I just feel a little awkward around people. No one can ever understand this disorder.

I'm ugly and shy and not good with people. I don't have a boyfriend and I don't think anyone will ever be attracted to a person like me. :( I see all my friends getting attached and finding someone to love them and I really really wish for someone to like and accept my insecurities. But at the same time I feel so undeserving because I am so... flawed.

Anyway, I just wanted you to not give up on life. Let's fight together. Getting up everyday may be hard, but going down willingly is foolish. 

P.SWish we could be friends in real life too because we prolly get each other better.

I'm sexually active with my bf of 3+ years. Every time I hinted or directly asked for oral sex, he would "act blur". I can't cum through penetration (I doubt most women can.) and would like to have my clit orally stimulated as it gets very frustrating for me when I can't be satisfied. It's not like I don't give him blowjobs, I DO!! But all he does is receive and not give. It has come to a point where I don't like having sex. And I sensed that he's getting tired of sex with me too (as I can't climax with him), though he still gets horny from time to time. What do you think I should do?? Sex is such a chore to me now. I frequently browse the net in search of guys giving women blowjobs for free. I'm very tempted, but I'm afraid my bf will find out! FYI, I rather DIY if you get what I mean. I love my bf and intend to marry him. But when it comes to sex, I can't imagine being satisfied by him. Don't tell me to talk to him, I have tried and failed.

To op of  Sometimes dreams are what you worry about and sometimes reality that you couldn't face. I dreamt approximately the same dream for about 3 times now. That I was just a passerby observing you, walk past you and into my room. Every dream ended the same way: we walked away from each other after we met. Every time I hoped that I could walk with you at the end of the dream. But even in reality I have lost you. I finally understood what it feels like to lose someone so dear.

Posting this here because I don't know where else to rant. I'm currently taking the bar exams and there's this compulsory subject of family law. I come from a broken family and every session feels like I'm reliving the experiences I have tried so desperately to bury over the past 20 years. I don't know what to do because the compulsory nature of the subject makes it impossible to opt out or do poorly. I wish there was a switch to turn this stupidity off :(
-
 
I met this guy coincidentally and ever since then even though i knew he had lots of horrible stories I heard from others i cant help but feel curious abt him. I want to talk to him but im too shy. I noe he will oblige but idw him to do so just cos he wants the attention. Feeling conflicted! Wad should i do? 

(P.S. I think making sexual advancements will only cause us to be FWB but I don't want that, unless it will eventually turn out to be more?)
-
 
Is it a good idea to pretend that you already have a boyfriend in order to reject someone? I am quite annoyed by this guy who wants to meet up but I don't want to be mean. Moreover, he hasn't really confessed yet, he just flirted a lot. And he doesn't get my subtle hints that I'm not interested.
-
 
 Why is it that everytime we are talking about physical appearances and how ugly people felt bad about being ugly, the good-looking girls will give comments on the confession saying it's okay? When good looking people talk, there are many people who will listen to them.
-
 
To  and anyone who feels inadequate about their physical appearance: 
“If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.” -Roald Dahl

I am a guy and I feel less attracted to opposite gender over time. Like having less interest in getting into a relationship (sexually or romantically) I am not gay Btw. What's really wrong with me.. Sometimes my parents would even indirectly hinting me to get a girlfriend soon. That's really frustrating ...
-
 
Seeing people slowly getting into relationship and getting out of it is a pretty fun process. From how the courtship began, to how it ends. They end up coming to me half crying and whining about why things turned out this/that way. 
To state some observations, most of them in toxic and in verbally abusive relationships tend to stick to their boyfriends regardless of the numerous advises given to them asking them to reconsider their relationships.
Is it that hard for a girl to get emotionally detach from someone they've once committed themselves to, when the other party clearly treats them only as an option? 
Maybe, but I'm ready with my popcorn to listen to what kinda mess they got themselves into, again. 
-
 
I don't get why some girls expect the guy to be paying for their meals? Me and boyfriend have always gone dutch ever since we started dating 3 years ago. Of course we will treat each other on our monthsaries or anniversaries or just out of the blue. Even though right now I'm working full time and boyfriend is a uni student, I still don't expect him to pay just because he's a guy. And he doesn't expect me to pay just because I have monthly income compared to him. And of course we don't eat expensive eating places or restaurants (subway or fast food is fine with us). If both parties do not have these kind of expectations on each other then going out for meals together won't be such a problem.

That day, I was talking to one of my friend whom I haven't seen for a long long time. He got injured in some freak accident back in 2012 and is now in a wheelchair. After our chat, I wondered to myself: "Would anyone think less of a person just because he's on a wheelchair and not date him?" To me, it seems like he's a really good catch; good looking and all. Not sure if anyone bothered giving him q second look.

My girlfriend is sick and having a fever but still insists on studying for her midterms tomorrow. Her CAP is rather high and she has familial pressure to do well in school. However, I don't think this should be the way but no matter what I say she insists on studying and putting her results before her health. No matter what I say she refuses to go rest and lie down. Any advice on what to do?
-
 
Feel so sad and dumb, i didn't know you were so uncomfortable with me that you had to call your opposite gender friend to accompany you when we were together. You could have just told me, it hurts less this way.. And to people reading this, please be more aware to people's feeling and not make them uncomfortable, they have a hard time expressing it and often end up doing things that they thought is less direct but end up hurting more. For now, would it be better to continue messaging or to leave that person alone until she/he replies? Even though he/she may not start conversation with you, like forever?

I have crush on this girl for 4 years already and I asked her recently to go out recently. She just replied me yesterday after almost 2 weeks and said that she is not free and suggest me to pick another day. I am deeply hurt and wonder if she is playing with me? She once humiliated me 2 years ago by telling her girl friends that I should look in the mirror but I am much better looking now I guess. Sometimes she will ask me for lunch in school which makes me really happy too but most of the time she will ignore me unless she need help in schoolwork / paying for her cab fares because she forgot to withdraw money. I don’t mind doing it for her really. 

I work part-time to pay for my tuition loans because my parents are too old and sick to work and sometimes she will tell me she really appreciate what I have done for her over the years. I just don’t get why is she so mean to me sometimes. My grades are suffering and I did not want to disappoint my parents and yet I cannot forget about her. You know it is like a pepertual trap when I thought I am finally able to get her off my mind, she will come back and ask me if I want to hang out. I have been cutting myself due to the emotional rollercoaster she has been causing me but no one knows about it.

My life is a mess and I feel that everything is getting out of control. I am the only son and I would never entertain suicidal thoughts but I just feel that my life is on hard-mode. Why is she doing this to me? I have given her my everything. My heart, my soul, my tears and my sanity. I need them back please. I feel so sorry for my parents and friends for letting them down because I feel like I am a complete worthless piece of shit.

I have a friend who chased a girl who was attached, got rejected and is now really angry that she isn't talking to him. what advice can i give to him please?

To , I am in a similar predicament as you are. Despite being able to choose whichever university I want to go to for exchange with my academic achievements, I have to watch by the side while my friends apply for SEP, wait in anticipation for the results, and finally enjoy one semester abroad living new experiences. The bursaries available are insufficient to pay for the all the expenses in any good university abroad, which is what I'm worried about, since there's no way I can chip out any more money to go abroad above having to save for tuition fees as well. And it doesn't end there, does it? I can list out so many ways by which finances have limited me, so many things I'd had to watch my friends do without me while I politely decline without reason, so many ways my entire life would have been different if I just had the finances. 

But honestly, so what if you feel unjust/sad over this? The situation won't just change overnight just because you feel sad, will it? Sometimes in life, shit happens and the best way to move forward is to zone out from the shitty things and zoom in to the things that you can do to improve you situation. Life will always be unfair; look at yourself - you might not have realised it but you've probably had a lot of good things happen to you (getting into university, having arms and legs, etc) that others would kill for. Many good things must have happened and many shitty things avoided, in order for you to even get into university. But regardless, circumstances will remain what they are because they are out of your control - brooding over them will not get you anywhere. What you can change, however, is the way you think, and the steps you take to improve the situation. Ultimately, its the way we choose to think that will define how good our life feels. You have to permit it for any thought to affect you.

Like you, I used to feel so upset over my circumstances as well. But it happened so frequently, that eventually I was able to see that all this negativity never did anything to improve the situation. I keep reminding myself that only my abilities can change my circumstances. Once we graduate, we'll be able to change our own financial situation. What you can do now is to study hard so that you can get whichever job you'd like and then pay for yourself to go abroad, after you graduate. That's what I'll be doing too :)

Do dreams come true?

I woke up one night, from a terrible nightmare that got me down for the rest of the morning. I told you about it much later on. What was so terrible about that dream was that I lost you to someone else. Even in my subconscious, I knew I didn't want that to ever happen and the thought of it was broke me. You looked at me, worried, and said firmly, "that won't happen."

Well, I guess dreams do come true. Because I have lost you.

URGENT! I read on of the confessions the other day that counsellors in SG aren't very professional? Is that really true? I have an appointment with a counsellor this fri and now I don't feel like sharing my situation with her anymore as I am afraid she would judge me. I have noticed her looking at the time before but didn't think much of it till now. Sometimes I think she doesn't like me too.. But maybe I'm thinking too much.. Help please.

80% of my study time is messing around, 20% is when I actually get into the zone and get studying done. Unfortunately that 20% only seems to occur in the wee hours.

is it possible for a girl who got friendzoned to get the guy to like her eventually?? is it really time to move on? :(
-
 
To OP , I can relate to your situation. Try asking yourself these questions: does he have a goal in life? What exactly is his motive to BTO? Is it because he's sincere about living the rest of his life with you? Or because of some other reasons? Like to run away from family? To start a family like his friends? How much do you love him? Is he willing to give up anything for you? If you have answers for all these questions, you should have already found your answer.

Year 2 Chemistry Student here with something to get off my chest before getting on to my lab report

My friend intro-ed me to this girl back in April (still remember it was April's Fool day when I first met her), and we hit it off pretty well then. Eventually we went out together. Fast forward a couple of months and more dates, she asked to talk. I told her that I indeed liked her, and she rejected me with the usual kinda stuff. 

I am feeling very strange and rather horrible now. On one hand, deep down, I felt this was not going to work out, not at this time at least,  given how it seemed like we were just not able to "develop" as anticipated, so this could be seen as a bullet dodged. On the other hand, I am devastated by this. Rejection always hurts no matter how ready you were for them. Also, having had a very difficult last couple of years for various reasons, I thought that those setbacks have strengthened and hardened me as a person overall. Therefore, it was one kick in the nuts that I was deemed not good enough, and a second kick for me not being able to deal with it as efficiently as I would have liked. Ouch.

As I struggle to comprehend my emotions, I am thinking of how to overload myself with activities, such as mugging, playing tennis or basketball (my favorite sports which I have not really played recently due to time constraints in uni), playing the piano (a rank beginner, have not played for almost a decade), simply running my guts out, maybe clubbing, anything, to quickly pass the time and ignore these feelings, since time apparently heals as the famous saying goes. In my case of a very confused and unpleasant feeling, perhaps it could simply lighten the intensity of the emotions. Lets hope that's the case.

Currently, I'm having a long-distance relationship with this girl and we had some misunderstanding over someone she used to date. Here is the story: back then they were dating, he was a overprotective, overpossessive boyfriend. She needed to cater to his needs for attention. The guy often sulked over minor stuffs and made a bid deal out of it. Even when they were not together, he secretly stalked all the guys who tried to approach her. She is a nice and kind girl so she let him do all of those things without complaining a word. Now, when he knows that he's about to lose her completely, he started to disturb her one way or another, texting, appearing in front of her house ... I feel so helpless, not be able to be there to support her at these times. He would not stop doing all of those terrible things so she had to agree to make a deal with the devil. She had to go out with him for whole day for 4 days, of course, not crossing the limits, need to reply to his messages and gotta have a 3-hour motorcycle bike together. What the **** is this nonsense, you would think but calling the cops is not the option in her country because they wouldn't care and he would only let her go once they completed all of those things. If only I were there. Any advice on how to deal with this???

How do you tell if your TA dislikes you? 
My TA, for some reason, makes me feel like she dislikes me. I mean in one tutorial, she handed out blank paper to record attendance and distributed it to everyone who raised their hands but me. My group mate had to exchange his paper with mine and asked for a new one from her himself. Likely when we submitted the paper to her, she did not see me and another friend had to hand in the paper for me. 
I know it is bad paying attention to such small details but it really saddens me in a sense that if she dislikes me for no reason, than other people will too. Probably they would not like my face, or the way I say things. I mean things I am not aware of and cannot control. I fret to think about how my group mates may think of me, am I troublesome in their eyes?

What do you do for a friend who has the biggest ego in the world?

It's normal to have that jock in a group of friends, or a braniac that seems to know everything, or even someone who's really proud of all their achievements in life so far. 

Here, I've got a friend who has let his ego get to his head. Any attempt to reproach him will only cause him to shut you off as a 'bad' friend. People can only be with him or get lost. 

How do I help such a friend turn around? I would want to think my years of friendship with them should allow me to get to him more easily, but I've seen even childhood friends get abandoned...

emm how do ppl become couples when they don’t start as friends first?? What are signs that you can take the relationship further? My crush and I have no problem going to dinner alone/sharing unhappy events to each other. I can feel that she sort of trust me but I only known her barely a month. Is it too fast? Do girls get turn off if I ask them out too quickly? I have ask her out before and she agreed but I did not mention it is a date and we went dutch. 
Both of us are very similar in the sense that we are introverts who rather not be with big gp of ppl. I hate falling in love:/. Luckily LOL world championship is coming soon. Probably wont talk to her for a week. See how it goes then.

I have a friend that is attached and is currently cheating on his girlfriend with another girl who also happens to be attached. Thing is, the girl chose to give her virginity to my friend instead of her own boyfriend. To all guys out there, if you don't go for it, you can bet someone else will, so it might as well be you

I look like a tomboy, with short hair and i purchase my clothes from the mens section. Theres nothing girly about me at all. Yet, im straight and i like men. Am i just determining my doom by being who i am. I really tried being girly but it was really uncomfortable for me. Would guys go after someone who potentially looks and behaves more masculine than they are?

I'm about to finish my NS and will enroll next year (2016). I received a letter from NUS about medical checkup etc. I am currently undergoing treatment for anxiety disorder, panic disorder and depression. Will I still be allowed to enroll or will my place be forfeited? Would be great if anyone can share their personal experience. 

I'm in great distress right now and losing a lot of sleep. (probably my anxiety disorder kicking in) If I know that the school will reject me, at least I can begin applying for alternative universities instead of having to wait another cycle. 

Really hope someone can relieve me of my worries. Many thanks in advance.

I have been together with my boyfriend for around 2 and a half years.  He has been broaching the topic of applying for for a flat,  and I can tell he is really eager.  However,  on my end,  I am still filled with uncertainty.  As a result,  I have been giving all sorts of excuses such as that we are still too young,  we do not have the finances,  he hasn't proposed, our careers aren't stable yet etc. 

What I'm worried about though is the fact that I know that those reasons I give are not the real reasons.   I am not sure why I feel this way,  but after this period of time,  I still completely don't feel ready to decide on having him for the rest of my life.  Don't get me wrong,  I am serious when I enter into a relationship but to commit to enter the next level is a whole different story. 

Now I am worried -  does this mean I don't love him enough?  If you really love someone,  won't you be eager to spend the rest of your life with that person?

My boyfriend does not like to open messages from girls infront of me. I asked him about it and he says it's because he doesn't want me to worry and overthink. But by not opening these messages infront of me means that he is hiding something right?????

I don't consider myself a very casual lover, or even promiscuous, more of a really confused person. There is this boy, whom I have been texting lately, and even seeing a lot during my free periods. He may not be the best looking boy I know in NUS, but he has always been the best listening ears to my rants and problems, and the best aid whenever I'm feeling upset and down. Though he may not be the most eloquent person in his speeches, but I do appreciate how genuine he is to listen, and to give me his thoughts. Of course we have our good times as well, like how we would send messages through letters and also going to concerts together.

But the real problem with me now is the feelings that I have developed for this boy even though I have a boyfriend. Please don't be mistaken, but my boyfriend isn't one of those jerk. Just that he was rarely there for me because of the conflicts in our schedules.

Because things moved and complicate so fast with the boy, I've never told him that I am already attached. I've never meant to led him on or whatsoever, it's just that the time was never right to do so.

To make things even worst, while waiting for my boyfriend yesterday, I've came to learn that the two of them are in the same tutorial and are actually sort of close with one another. Though my boyfriend did not introduce me to him as his girlfriend, we did admit that we knew each other before. 

I'm really afraid that the encounter might starting making the two of us distant from one another. The sight of the two of them together really confuses me and put me through a really difficult feeling. I really need advice on how to make this feeling go away while not compromising my relationship with either one of them.

To the OP of 

I came from a family where my mum had mental issues due to my dad's infidelity and there was a lot of physical/emotional violence too. All my life I didn't want to get into a relationship because I was sure there's no such thing as a happy relationship. In the end though I ended up getting attached to someone really quickly after meeting - before telling my partner about the family issues. It only came out slowly over the course of our relationship and it really wasn't easy. In my personal experience at least, I really found my worst fears coming true, that I wasn't able to be "normal" and love my partner as well as I wanted to. My pessimism and own emotional baggage were like a dark cloud hanging over the relationship and I spent lots of time crying on my own over how hopeless and angry I felt, especially since my partner didn't seem to understand why I feel/act/think a certain way. But like in any relationship, communication and compromise is important, and I think if you are both honest about what you want and why, it can only make your relationship stronger. What helped also was that I went to see a counselor (and still see one at least twice a month) - one of the things she said to me was to stop beating myself up for not being "normal". There's really no such thing as "normal" and regardless of the childhood we had, there are people everywhere on the spectrum from manipulative to naive to distant to loving etc. So don't compare yourself to the "normal" people/relationships out there. What matters is between you and your (potential) partner and as long as they are accepting and compatible with you, give it a shot :) 

I guess what I wanted to say is it's really not easy, and while you don't have to force yourself to tell someone about your past immediately, it helps them to understand you and having someone who is willing to make that effort can make the relationship worthwhile :) Sometimes you just have to take the plunge and commit - although I tried to back out of my relationship and I still think about breaking up whenever I can't handle anything, I also remind myself that I don't want the shadow of my parent's relationship to be hanging over my life forever. We all deserve happiness, and you never know who could make you happier than you imagined you could be until you give them that chance. Please don't give up hope!

I sometimes feel like my boyfriend is as suffocating in this relationship as the haze ):

Me and my bestfriend, we have known each other for almost our whole  life. I first got to know her since i was 5, and she was 5 at that time too. Our families have been really close to each other too. I am an international student and i have studied in Singapore for almost 6 years now. 6 years ago, me and my best friend both applied for this examination to go study overseas in Singapore and we both passed it and got the scholarship. Through the last 15 years, we have been there for each other, through all the up and down times, but strictly as best friends. Especially for the last 5 years, we have relied on each other even more since we had to grow and mature without our parents staying beside us. So fast forward to today, both of us have had some relationship on our own. Some of them ended because either her boyfriend or my girlfriend said that they were not comfortable with the kind of relationship that me and my best friend had and continued having. Despite all these, me and my best friend see nothing wrong with it because we have been like this for practically our whole life and also we only see each other as best friends. For me personally, i have never been greedy and never wanted to ask for more from my friendship with my best friend because the way it has been- this friendship- brighten up my life so much and sometimes i even view it as the only thing that remains even if i lose everything. That is why i don't want to get greedy. Fast forward to 2 days ago, during this one night when we were sitting and chilling with some beer, she suddenly asked me:" I don't get why we have never even become a couple?". I then jokingly said:" Who knows? Maybe after all the relationship that we go through, in the end of that road, it will be me who is waiting for you". Then suddenly she turned and kissed me. I was really shocked for a moment but still returned her kiss. After 10 seconds, i came to my senses and turned away and said:" We are really too drunk right now". After that day, we never talked about it again but it keeps bothering me. I hope she does not get hurt from this experience. And i just want to ask is it selfish and coward of me if i do not bring up the matter and try to talk about it with her?
-
 
To the girl in , I'm kind of in a similar situation as you. I have been to prostitutes before uncountable times. I'm also asking myself whether this should be made known to my future partner. Perhaps, you could ask yourself this - what if I am your boyfriend and I tell you about my past. Would you accept it? If not, then I don't think you can expect someone else to accept what you can't accept.
-
 
I just realised that you have never loved me. That you never will, even though we may be good friends, we can never transcend that. That in your heart, there will never be a place for me. And so I lay you to rest in my mind, and hopefully so will my heart. 
-
 
To OP of . Hi there, I'm kind of the same as you - big inertia to get into a relationship (but at least you have someone interested in you). I'm a guy, average-looking, okay income, drives an average car, had average grades when I was in NUS. I'm also happy with my life right now and I spent a lot of time on my hobbies, doing things alone after work and I thoroughly enjoy this serenity of alone time. My friends tried introducing me their girl friends and I was just so reluctant to meet them not because I'm shy or socially awkward but it's because of this "inertia". So they gave up introducing me girls. Worst part is that the industry I'm working in.. Has little or no girls at all. Truth be told, although there's this big inertia in my mind, deep in my heart, I kind of yearn for someone to be by my side. So what I wanna tell you is..  Give him a try since you're genuine about it. You really wouldn't know if it will end up like before. Uni is the best time to get to know your SO. Don't end up like me lol.

I'm a final year student, and mostly everyone my age is happily attached. My friends especially are in long-term relationships whereas I have never been in a relationship before. Sometimes I get really jealous how they manage to get into a new relationship right after they end their last one. But the thing is - no matter how much I wish to find my life partner, or to even just get into the dating scene... I still can't get over my family issues that have marked me for the past 10 years. 

I used to be an extroverted and cheerful girl in primary school who had no trouble making friends with both the boys and girls in class. However, when I reached secondary school, my family broke down overnight and I slowly withdrew into myself. I stopped making friends - the only friends I kept were the ones whom I was already friends with before those issues started. Till now I still find it difficult to open up (it took me 3 years before I told my closest university friend about my family issues). 

Because of this, I also distanced myself especially from guys. I felt that I had too much emotional baggage and I was already 'damaged' and not worthy of being in a relationship. Whenever it seemed as though any guy was coming closer to me, I would retreat and become even colder and more distant to him until we would stop interacting at all. I had no male friends at all until I started learning to let my guard down only last year. 

I did get closer to a few guys as I stopped being as guarded, but everytime they confessed or asked me out I'd panic again and just think about how screwed up I was and inevitably end up rejecting them. I tried, and it took so much courage for me to go on my first date this year but I just couldn't bring myself to tell any of them about my issues. 

I really feel so useless sometimes, so weak and stupid for not being able to get over these issues even after all these years. Everyone around me can be nornal, why am I just so fucked up? I just wish I can be a normal person who can form normal relationships, but I'm starting to lose hope that I can ever do that. 
-
 
To OP of , if she/he did not give you a definite answer. Might as well go for one last try, nothing to lose since you have already felt that you had lost him/her. May be a final test from god. May the odds be ever in your favor OP.

Will girls marry guys with fertility problems?

Sometimes all I want to do is leave. Leave the life I've built, all my responsibilities and start afresh in a new country. I have a boyfriend and we're more or less happy together, but I would leave in a heartbeat given the opportunity to be another person and live another life. I'm always tired, always exhausted and I feel drained, because of school and relationships and hall life.

@op if you really had to turn a guy down due to legit reasons but you're actually interested, make plans to reschedule don't just say you're not free. same goes for guys when girls jio them out. if you don't offer alternative when first asked and just reject, any normal person would assume not interested??

Who said it's easy for a girl to go after a guy? Fucking tired can. I give up. Yes yes, I know you guys will say that he's not into me. Whatever.

Got this huge crush on this person in SSA2219 (South Asia in Singapore), she's this really pretty and cute girl. I think she's from Life Science, and I saw her the other day taking 151.  Sigh... I really want to meet her but I'm way too shy to say anything. What should I do?

I am the OP of . To ,  and all those who commented, thank you for your kind words, honest suggestions and wishes. To Jay Chua, I was a participant in the last run of the SG Kaki programme. My pair wasn't very friendly. Being shy, I didn't want to take charge either. I am not complaining but just take a little more care when you take in volunteers to be the kakis. Thanks everyone!

Hi! I have a question for guys (girls, if you think you have the answer, pleae share with me!) The thing is, I am looking forward to a very serious relationship,not one that ultimately leads to marriage, but one that lasts longer than a couple of months and ends with me feeling regretful having been so rash. That's why I always feel unconfortable flirting with guys. I mean, in social events or when I run into guys I know on campus, I would say  just enough. My friend who is a natural charmer will get into talking deep things with guys she just meets, which, if I were her, would feel embarrassed ever mentioning. But my cousin says it's the way girls flirt and I just cannot cope with it. If I am swept away by the moment and talk too much or smile too much, i will feel weirdly guilty for being so unlike me. Guys who I am interested in asked me out once or twice, but I had to decline for legit reasons. I am sooo socially awkward that I never dropped them the hint that I would be happy to join them the next times. They never asked me again. So help me, is it because I turned them down the wrong way that they never called back or is it because they never liked me enough? :(
-
 
To the OP of , at least you don't feel (i hope) like that in Singapore. I can from overseas to do uni here and I'm the quiet shy type. I don't have much of a clique and it honestly feels like shit sometimes.

I hope you feel better eventually, and don't feel that way at home in Singapore, because you truly can be (in my case) lonely in a place full of people...

I don't understand how some guys (and girls) can not only get attached, but also cheat on their partner with multiple other partners, while I cannot even grab the attention of one damn person.

I dont get it why conversations on Whatsapp with my crush is so much easier and smooth flowing compared to face to face. It just becomes awkward silence till he breaks it.

I love my boyfriend but hate that he smokes. How can I get him to even consider quitting without sounding demanding or resorting to threats?

I personally find guys from water based ccas to be pretty attractive. I know a number of guys from biathlon, lifeguard swimming and canoe polo and they all tend to be really nice people with slim and toned figures. Makes me want to join one of these CCAs but their trainings are so tough :'(
-
 
To all the guys out there, what shud an average looking girl who barely knows you do in order for you to start taking an interest in her? I know many would say "just talk to him!" but what kind? In real life? But won't the conversations will just be superficial...especially since we don't really have much time together to talk...and its a little weird to just ask him straight out if I don't know him (ask him out on whatsapp?) Also, I considered whatsapping him but don't really know how to start. I'm really interested in this guy so appreciate any help you guys could give! 

Just to give a better context, we get to meet up weekly bcuz hes in my project grp. He's a friendly, chilled out, cool dude. I think he's single (but not too sure yet, though maybe if I find a way to talk to him first I could find out).

This happened when i was in JC a long time back. There was this girl in class which at first glance looks socially awkward and is mostly by herself in class. I thought to myself who knew that would be another socially awkward person in the same class and so i started to try to know her better. I sat with her at the back of the classes and lecture hall to talk to her and learn more about her. Who knew that from then on, we started getting closer and our Whatsapp convo became more open to one another. At that point, i still had a crush on this other girl in another class so i didn't thought much about how close we became as i thought we were being close friends.  Eventually, we became so close to one that i told her about my crush on this other girl from the other class. As we were always seen with one another, it even lead to my classmates to question me if i liked her. To be honest, i was surprised when they asked me that as my heart was still with the other girl. It even got to the point where my friend's classmate of a separate class was jealous of how close i was to her as he had liked her since Sec school. So i did the stupid thing and ask her about this other guy who liked her since Sec school. She told me that when he confessed to her, she just ignored him because she didn't know how to commit to a relationship at that moment. To be honest, at that time, i felt quite relieved when i heard that because it probably meant that she had no real feelings towards me and we were just friends. After that, she started to become colder to me and talk less to me. I thought that something must have happened at home but it wasn't so. Come to think of it now, i must have been a complete idiot to tell her about my crush and ask her about her past with the other guy. It probably made me seem like an asshole to her and turned her off so much.
Right now, she still talks to me time to time but it wasn't the same as before. I hope that you find another guy in uni that deserves you more than this asshole of me.
TL;DR : Be more attentive to a girl's signals FOR GOD'S SAKE.
Yours truly, the OP of Post

I am a final year undergraduate who have been doing research for more than a year. Recently, I have trouble working with a superior who is from another school and not my FYP advisor. Times when she was asking for my help on her work, she would try to sound polite and friendly. But after the help was given, she would go into some nasty verbal attacks. The first time it happened was when she asked for my opinion on a specific methodology that was within my major. When she didn't get the opinion she wanted to hear, she told me off that I had a "lack of knowledge" of what I had studied. I explained that as I am only an undergraduate, I could only give my opinion as far as I know and that I find her words not appropriate nor helpful when we are discussing about research ideas. If I am wrong, she could correct me, not comment me with her personal attacks. Later, she backtracked, claiming there was "miscommunication" and I severely "misinterpreted" the meaning behind her words. No apologies were given but I accepted her agreement then that future discussions should be more civil. Another mentor of mine who have worked with her before also assured me that he will also talk to her and such a thing would not happened again. 

Recently after I had spent a week helping her collate her results, she 
criticized that part of my method was "incomplete". When I asked her where did she find the exact problem that leads to this "incompleteness", she told me off again that I  "asking too many questions means that "I am not listening to her" and that I have a severe lack of "modest for a young man". I am still deeply disturbed by her words now. Unlike her, I spent hours of weekdays and even weekends on research with no pay and no incentives further than a a few lines on my resume. Since I have always done research work for the passion of pursuing it, I do not believe that I should continue when my motivation to stay in this particular project is now killed entirely by comments on my character or intelligence. I was taught that no matter 
the other person is right or wrong in any argument, even whether he is a criminal or a saint, everyone deserves respect to his/her dignity no less than anyone else. I have worked in previous places with high stress, complex political ecosystem and self-centered bosses. I have  also worked with other superiors and research advisers (many of whom I would gladly catch up with) but this is my first time I had experienced such a person. Even though her words may only sound disrespectful and physically harmless, I have also grown suspicious of what other  things she would do too. Since she believed that my FYP hinged on the success of her work and so has every right for her lack-of civility, then I do not believe that there is any room for me to stay too. P.s. I am already working on another research project which could potentially be used for my FYP instead. Just sharing to hear any other advice or whether there are also any other people with similar experiences too.

I used to laugh at the movie "40 year old virgin" when I was a teenager. But now it's just sad.

I am a girl who appears really 'guai' at first sight.  However,  as people always say,  never judge a book by its cover.  I've in fact had quite an illustrious past. I wouldn't say I have been a complete slut (in fact other than losing my virginity to this guy which I kinda regretted I didn't sleep with another other guy who is not my boyfriend).   However I did have some escapades here and there.   

I occasionally invited guys to my room to stay for the night and we did stuff but short of having sex.  Sounds mild enough but perhaps for someone who looks as guai as me it would be rather unexpected. 

These are all in the past and I had stopped since I met my current boyfriend.   However,  the problem is that I have to bring these secrets with me to my grave. My boyfriend has indicated that he can't stand girls who are easy and he wouldn't be able to take it if he finds out his girlfriend is such a person,  even if that was in the past. 

I really don't wish to lie, but I have no other option.  He will definitely leave me if he knows any of these. 

Guys,  I just want to know,  will you generally be able to accept a girlfriend who was kinda easy in the past?  It's kinda sad that one is not even given the chance to repent isn't it?

From the very first day I met you in Sec 3, I had a crush on you. To me you were the most beautiful person in the world from then on. All the way till we graduated from secondary school, i always hoped to speak to you but i never plucked the courage to do so. When we got our O level results, i wanted to go to the same school as you even though i can choose almost any other school to go to. I even picked the same subject combi in JC to see you in the lecture hall. Even in JC, i still didn't dare confess to you from fear of rejection. When i heard you weren't going to prom night, i was so disappointed as i wanted to ask you to go with me. Finally, NS came and i thought to myself, I am going to go through the hardest phase of my life and i am going to do so without regrets so i went to where you stayed, hoping to pass my birthday present to you along with my confession letter. As fate would have it, you told me that you used to have a crush on me too but moved on when i didn't make a move over time. Now, you have a bf and I hope that you two last long because you deserve it for being the wonderful person you are.
TL;DR : Speak now or forever hold your piece. Life is too short for regrets ...

 I have to say this from a girl's POV. You might think not putting too much feelings into it makes it hurt less for you, and true it does. But honestly if you were to move on so quickly, trust me the number of times you are going to get rejected will be way higher than what would have been. I have had 3 or 4 guys that confessed to me that were similar to your case. They asked out girls really quickly and that was a MAJOR turn off. That's because most girls would feel that all you want to do is to get a relationship and it doesn't matter who the partner is. Giving off that kind of signal naturally makes girls shun you, even if they were the slightest bit interested in you before.

I would say ask someone out only if you are really sure you like/love the person, and not act on impulse or feelings that aren't even deep. Even if you do get a girl in the end it might not even work out because you were not even that sure of your feelings. I get what you mean on wasting time hurting over someone for years, but that's what love really is. I never regretted loving someone for 4 years even if it was one sided. Yes it hurt, but it passed eventually. Even if it took a long time to get over it it was still worth it because I'd rather be single than be in a relationship for the sake of being in one.

I feel so alone overseas now but yet I hate hanging out with friends. There are friends whom you know can never be close friends with so I pretty much close up on myself. All of them like big group outings which I absolutely loathe unless I know everyone really well. They must think I am anti-social because sometimes they will make comment like “wow xx your actually here”. Little did they know that hurts me and make me close up even more. 

I always go out alone and although I like it, at times I really feel alone and hope I have one or two close friends with me. I always have to pretend that I enjoyed myself when I am out alone but in fact, I am envious of my friends who can enjoy themselves in their own outings. You know its really weird. I feel so lonely yet I isolate myself. 

I can’t tell my parents how awkward I was. Skyped my parents yesterday at night. They said I looked tired and ask me where I went. I told them I went out with my friends for dinner when what I actually did was to roam around aimlessly in the city looking at people, the buildings, soaking in the atmosphere and eating alone. Friends and families thought I am enjoying myself but I feel terrible. They always ask me if I feel unhappy and I always said no. Once I told my parents during a skype session that I feel that my friends are very different from me and did not want to reveal how I feel because I don’t want them to worry about me or feel vulnerable. 

It is not that I want to be alone. I just don’t know what to do. I wanted to join yall but I hate putting myself in a big group. I just wish someone will understand and allow myself to feel vulnerable in front of someone for once and not in fear for being judged. 

I am sure someone of there is having a more difficult time than I am having but I just feel that I have to pen down my thoughts so that I will feel better. I love you papa mama. I am sorry for cutting off the skype so quickly yesterday because I was feeling terrible. Please do not worry about me. I will get through this ordeal like always. Cheer up. Today will be better. Goodbye

I'm the one who paid the price for a mistake not mine. I fell in love with someone who had been cheated on. 
Though that relationship was long over, the pain was still there, very much there. His heart was closed and he could let no one else in. So I suffered, loving someone who just wasn't capable of loving me back. The pain was not just his - knowing he was in pain hurt me deeply. Unreciprocted love is really not as romantic as Shakespeare makes it out to be. It's like being so disgusted with yourself that you want to tear your skin off, because you want to stop it but you can't. It's like holding on tightly to a broken glass bottle, fingers clenched around it, not letting go even though you know it's draining the life out of you.  
Thankfully, this story has a happy ending - a new beginning for us. :) 

But the scars of being cheated on will always be there. The heart heals, the pain goes away - but you really have no idea what an excruciating journey it has been. Though I paid the price for a mistake someone else made, he makes it all worth it - every single day when I wake up next to him, I am thankful to share another day with him. I am also grateful that I was able to be there with him, on his journey of healing. 

Don't be selfish. Don't cheat. 

No one deserves pain and betrayal like that, that crushes your soul and plunges the best of men into an abyss of low self-confidence.

So I am in a pretty big dilemma. There's this one girl that lives next door to me. I kinda like her but I think she Dosent really see me that way as she does not seem really keen to hang out and all and I don't think I am of the highest priority in her life. Unfortunately  I do have strong feelings for her and this is hurting me a lot to let go. 

At the same time this other girl that I've never met in my life and only online has started talking to me. She is even coming all the way to sg (she lives in Fiji) just to see me and spend days with me. Again may I stress we have never met and we only had online converstations. (But she is a legit person and not a 40 year old creepy guy or something.) somehow this tells me that she likes me for who I amand not just for what I have. I really don't want to lose her under any circumstances at all. 

So my question is how do I let go of the girl I still have somewhat lukewarm feelings for and move on? The most obvious smart thing to do is to get to know this girl comin all the way for me. Please please help me!! Thanks so much.

Context first: I am an all around average girl. Average looking, average grades, average financial status etc. I am also evergreen and content. In fact I am so happy being single that there is a sense of inertia preventing me from wanting to get attached and lose my freedom. I'm someone who likes to just turn their phone off for the entire weekend and walk down orchard road to people watch. Or spend an afternoon alone at the movies. A whole day sitting at Kino reading books. Even just sitting under a tree singing to myself daydreaming about life. 

And that is where the problem starts. I have had maybe a little over a dozen guys confess to me and honestly, it is not because they aren't good enough that I reject them. I enjoy their company, they are not in the friend zone, I honestly considered giving 'us' a shot. But the timings are always terrible. Some confessed right before psle, o levels, a levels papers. Other confess the week before my cca had major events. Even now, before uni midterm or finals. Or just a bad period when I have multiple commitments with impending deadlines. See the pattern here? 

I am always too busy for relationships. In fact they are so good to me that I feel that they deserve more from me, more time that I am unable to afford and I felt it was unfair to make them wait. I didn't want to be selfish. So I straight up told them no and for them to move on. 

I wonder if it is an excuse sometimes. Because honestly the most recent guy I felt was way out of my league. He was incredibly patient, knowledgeable, intelligent, kind, cute etc. Basically most people would agree he is ideal. He was Oxford grad, and I'm... Well, I'm me. And yet it didn't work out, because I thought we are both too busy for each other that even though we were meeting up it was not sustainable. 

So currently there is a new guy who I suspect is interested in me, and the same pattern is happening. We are talking and becoming closer friends. But I feel like I am doing something wrong by not warning him. Am I leading him on when I genuinely want to give it a try but realise that it may end up as before because I am honestly too busy? (it's not excuses because I don't even have time for hobbies now the way my faculty is) Should I just warn him off and cut it off before he can get hurt? 

Tl;dr my busy schedule is probably going to make me nip another relationship in the bud. Should I warn all guys from now on before they start talking to me that we can only be friends.

My boyfriend dumped me a few months back because he said I've changed a lot but tbh I think he just wants to text a whole bunch of other girls without me questioning his motive in it. I'm not the possessive type but I would rather he tell me that he is texting so and so instead of always refraining from opening their messages in front of me which makes me suspect that something is going on. We had a few arguments about this issue and his replies are always the same "I have my female friends like how you have male friends". (However, I only texted at most 2 other guy friends and I would show him screenshots of the conversations sometimes too!) After the breakup I found out that he's been texting about 4-5 girls throughout...some that he knows from maplestory? He even met up with one or two girls one-on-one for movies and meals. I know I should be getting over him by now but I just feel very... lost? If he wanted to text so many girls in the first place then why bother getting together with me and messing up my feelings? Can anyone tell me if I'm thinking too much or if it's just typical for guys to text so many girls at one shot.

After reading all these confessions, I seriously wonder if anything is wrong with me when all these people who cheats on their partner are still able to find a partner so easily and I can't even seem to find 1 after trying so hard. 

It doesn't help when I have fallen for some attached person recently. Surprisingly, I am not being shunned even though that person knows about it. I am sure that person knows it as I sort of confessed indirectly and that person actually acknowledged it indirectly too. I think we are still on close terms. On one hand I know nothing is going to happen between us. But on the other hand, I am hoping that something will happen.

What's even worse is that the best way to overcome this is to avoid that person and try to forget. But I can't bring myself to do that and I wouldn't want that person to avoid me too. 

Now I think I am kind of going in and out of depression multiple times per day. Sometimes I think it would be better for me to just die. I really hope I can get over this soon. But from the way it is going, I don't think I can get over it any time soon... Why is this even happening to me... Life is unfair...

Nearly confessed to my crush last Fri, but according to my friends in his classes he seems to date mostly younger girls????? (We are the same age, I am a year above him)
I (am slightly ashamed to admit this since I don't usually but I) stalked him a bit, asked to see his private Insta account from friends who are following him etc... some girls show up repeatedly in photos with him as recently as a month back, and all of them look really young, like JC-level or maybe even secondary school young to me! One of them was even IN UNIFORM... from an elite JC too.
Before you accuse me of paranoia, no I don't think they are "just friends"... since they are doing things like rubbing cheeks and puckering at each other...
I just need to get this of my chest, but would like advice too. I am only average looking, I don't know if I even have a chance against the athletic and well-dressed sort of girl that he seems to prefer. But even before thinking about my chances... should I consider confessing at all? Some of my friends are warning me to run, and accuse his dating habits of being "predatory" and "paedophilic"...
I've only had one relationship before, and am quite unfamiliar with general "etiquette"... so tell me NUS, what is the general opinion of people who exclusively date younger people with an age gap of at least 3 years???

To , from 

You’ve misunderstood me. 

1) I’m not jealous of people who are in a relationship, I’m jealous of the people who have found love. Judging from the number of confessions about cheating, I think its safe to say that both do not always overlap.

I am also perfectly aware that I should be in a relationship because I like someone, not because I want to feel loved. Hence I’ve been single all my life. If I wanted a relationship in order to feel loved, I would have been in one long ago. I already feel loved even without someone to call a “significant other” – I think many of us forget that love need not be just romantic love. Love from your family, friends, and yourself should mean as much as romantic love. 

2) Do you not read – I’ve never been in a relationship. I did not “join” a relationship to escape some life problems. I don’t depend on someone to be my “pain killer”, I face life’s problems on my own, with the help of people I love. I have hurt someone badly before. It was unintentional on my part, but I can see the hurt I’ve caused him, and I’d do anything to fix the scars I’ve left behind. I guess karma is a bitch, because I got hurt by someone else in return, and I’m only all too familiar with the pain and the tears and the haunting words that just never seem to go away. 

3) I disagree, and still think that it is difficult to find someone you love. I don’t mean infatuation, or just the kind of “yea I like you coz you chio”. I mean the kind of love where you see – and I mean really see – the person for who he is, and love him despite his flaws. The kind of love where you will never think of doing something like cheating, because you just can’t imagine hurting this person. The kind of love where there’s respect, trust, compromise and teamwork.  This takes time to build, and there are a lot of other factors that come into play. Even though many people may be “the one”, it takes a lot to really build a healthy, loving relationship with someone, and I just don’t understand how people who already have that can so carelessly squander it away. 

He/she definitely isn’t the only one who posses these traits, but if you continue having that mindset while being attached, you will never be truly grateful and appreciative of the one who is in front of you. If you are not ready to settle down and want to keep fishing/ having fun, then don’t commit yourself to someone and hurt that person. Don’t be such a selfish asshole.

I am (very) evergreen. For seven years (since secondary school), I've liked four guys, none of whom liked me back. I guess it was because a) I wasn't pretty enough b) I wasn't cool enough c) I wasn't smart enough d) I was too easy. For seven years I've always felt as if something was wrong with me and now in university no one believes me when I say I'm evergreen and I don't dare to tell them why. I've never had a boyfriend because I'm nobody's type— who would want an eccentric and not-very-pretty girl, right? I'm better off as one of the bros.

So for seven years I've had to grapple with rejection and as a result I have a shattered self-esteem, even though I come across to others as extremely confident and outspoken. It saddens me that my self-deprecating could be seen as confidence but I guess each person perceives things differently, and I cannot fault them for that. Now, I always feel inferior to skinnier/prettier girls and I avoid all talk of love and relationships because no one likes to be reminded that they're lonely and worthless. This has gotten so bad that on occasion I go days without eating because it makes me feel terrible in general.

My non-experience with dating and relationships has made me very very scared now. I've met a guy in one of my classes and we talk a lot. He's really nice and really seems interested in talking to me, compared to back when guys would only talk to me because I was a bro/ they wanted me to hook them up with one of my friends. I'm scared that whatever happened through secondary school and JC is going to happen again because I've never been dealt the best hand at relationships. What unsettles me further is that this guy in my class is extremely popular in his faculty while I'm practically a nobody in mine. I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust that guys have no ulterior motives or if my self-esteem will ever improve. Is it too late to seek help?

Please, please let this be posted because I really need to get this off of my chest.

Hey  my boyfriend is the same way. For some reason he would go chat girls up - girls that are in his hall/his jc (not close). He's quite secretive about it but I give him the benefit of the doubt plus I also check his phone while he is asleep. My previous few relationships all ended badly so I'm plagued with trust issues and I tend to overthink a lot and jump to the worst case scenario but I've decided that since I agreed to get into a relationship with him, I should trust him. And if things don't work out then so be it, he's not the right one.

Hi, I've just started working, and I need help and advise regarding my direct supervisor. 

My direct supervisor is a male. He's supervising mostly females, and I'm one of them. He's the outgoing, laugh and joke a lot type, while I'm the more quiet, shy type. I've just started working so I'm still trying to understand what is acceptable and what is not in the workplace. 

The thing is my supervisor is comfortable around people and he'll casually laugh and joke with my colleagues who are mostly females. He also casually touches them (like brushing his hand against their arms while talking or making a point). At first I wasn't sure if it's appropriate but I see that all the female colleagues seem to be pretty cool about it, and they also do the same, so I thought it's pretty normal in the workplace. So when he does that to me I didn't think anything about it.

However, he also does other things to me which I'm not so sure if they're appropriate. When he talks to me he'll not not only bush his hand against my arm, but also holds my arms for a while and squeezes it. He also brushes his arm against my thigh while taking to me about work. He loves to tease people and laugh about things so I try to tease him back as well (my company culture is like this, people tease and "disturb" each other a lot). And then when I tease him back he'll pretend to be angry, and then he'll hold my neck saying things like "you ah, don't be so naughty!". And then there's one particular time when he rubbed my ear as well. 

I mean I guess my colleagues are quite casual in their interaction with one another, however, I'm not sure if all of his above actions are normal?

I'm a really shy person so of course normally I'm not the touchy touchy type, and I never do this kind of thing to others. However, maybe some of you guys who are more outgoing can tell me if these kinds of actions are actually normal, and nothing for me to worry about? 

Thanks a lot!

I don't have a good relationship with my brother and my family would sometimes ask me to talk more to him and have closer brother- sister rs. What they do not know is that- long time ago in secondary school, he asked me into his room one night, and he massaged my shoulder and touched my thigh. I felt uncomfortable and went out of the room. And nothing happened afterwards, we never spoke of that incident and I never mentioned to my parents. 

Now everytime I think of it, I feel very angry at him and feel ashamed at myself. Now, he is still like that, he always party at night and sleep the whole day away. He always creates a lot of mess at home and shouts at my mum. I feel very disappointed to have such a brother and i cant be in talking terms with him. 

But I still hope that something could change in the future, any advice to influence a bad guy to be good?

i think i'm suffering from borderline disorder because jealousy comes to me really strongly and I have no idea where to turn to because how do you tell a friend you're jealous they're hanging out with other new friends without coming across like you're entitled?

Everyone is bashing up the OP    in the comments  but here's what I want to say to her: 
Please do not go on with this. Sure its thrilling but at what cost? You know its wrong but do you realise what kind of damage you are going to cause? I dont know the nature of the relationship between you and your boyfriend but whatever it is, he doesn't deserve this. He will most definitely be crushed when he finds out. Sadness will be followed by self-doubt, self-blame, lowered self-esteem, crushed self-confidence. You'll most likely destroy him. Set him free; let him belong to someone who deserves him. Cos no matter how he might be, I'm sure a lonely girl out there deserves him much better than you do. 
Okay so lets not think about the damage you're causing to your boyfriend and that girl friend of yours; let's talk about you. You know its wrong, from the way you're saying it, seems like its strongly against your own morals. But you're doing it anyway. That can only lead to a never-ending path of guilt and self-loathing. Do you not think you're better than that? If not for your boyfriend and that girl friend of yours, do it for yourself.
-
 
To - I don't know who you are, but I have a good idea of the circle of friends you belong to. I'm exactly like you- I yearn for deep friendships rather than shallow ones. As a result, I haven't made many friends here, just acquaintances. But the friends that I do have, are very close to me. You have to pick and choose the people you can get close to, and who also want to get close to you- trust me, there are many. You wouldn't know, but everybody feels the same way; everybody feels lonely sometimes, it's just that there are some people who share it with others and some who don't. The ones who do- well, good for them, you can drown in each other's loneliness- but I'm one of those who doesn't. I don't believe in projecting my emotions to the whole world, except to my closest friends.
I am an international student as well, and I felt the same way in year 1. Sometimes the loneliness got so bad that I used to call up my old friends and cry on the phone. It didn't help that I lived in a single room. Then finally, I started hanging out with the people who would become my closest friends at NUS. Little by little, I opened up to them, and I think it's the best thing I did. You cannot always maintain a strong front for others- let it go!
Since you're an international student, you must be living in a residence. Learn to interact with the people in your cluster. Don't restrict yourself to people only of your own nationality- that's the greatest mistake you can make. Start by interacting with people on your floor, then with your course mates, and finally, CCAs. I place CCAs at the last place because you already said that you don't have much in common with them. Making friends with your floor mates is the best, because you'll have constant companionship throughout the year. Also, problem of eating meals alone solved :)

OP, you're not alone. I lived through this, so can you.  Sure, I do have my lows but you have to stop wallowing in your own self-pity. 
Life is amazing for me now :) and I hope it gets even better for you.

In my day-to-day interactions with girls my age, it is usually blindingly obvious to me if her heart already lies with another guy, be it officially or otherwise. I mean, a majority of girls in relationships don't deliberately behave as if they are single to fool others, do they?

I genuinely wonder, why is it that so many guys have trouble differentiating between girls just being friendly and girls who are open to something more? Or perhaps it is because their judgement is clouded by an overdose of self-confidence or false hope?
-
 
To 
I disagree with what you said. 

1) You shouldn't be jealous of people who are in a relationship because you should be in a relationship because you like someone, not because you want to feel love.

2) If you feel great emotional scar, it could be likely that you join a relationship to escape some life problem. After you broke up, you lose your source of pain killer which is why you feel great emotional scar.

3) It not that hard to find someone you love. Many people out there can potentially be "the one". Think of what make you love your partner in the first place. Do you think  he/she is the only one who possess these traits?

Reply to .

I'm 21, and I'm evergreen. I know it's not a nice feeling to have this void in your heart. Being involved in a one-sided love in Secondary school, I convinced myself to reset my priorities, focusing instead on my studies, hobbies, family and friends.

I know that void is still there, and I still feel it inside. But those years of neglect have totally changed my perspectives on Love. I'll avoid even conversation topics on Love, and would convince myself any eye-candy is attached/not interested. When others hesitate to take the first step, I'll just turn my back and walk away.

It's been 5 years, and I'm still learning to love myself. I implore you, please don't lose faith in love. These wounds as a result of not loving is deeper than those cuts you've sustained whilst trying.

 To be honest it will be hard for you to try to forge closer friendships with just attending lectures and tutorials. I wasn't used to this too when I was a freshman. Back in JC we had fixed classes like you with the exact same timetable so you'll pretty much be with the same people all day. But in uni it's impossible to be able to do so even for locals. It's not just you who face this problem, everyone else does. My advice would be to join more interest groups like CCAs, head to more events to know more people etc etc. And if you want deeper friendships, you have to make the effort to spend time with people you want to be closer with. (This goes the same for anyone who thinks its hard to find closer friends btw.) Back in the time where you have the same set of friends you can attend all classes together, no effort was necessary for the friendship to develop. It just occurs naturally over time because you are 'forced' to spend time with each other (I dont mean it in a bad way). But over time I realised that every friendship made in uni needs effort and is different from what you/we were used to. Hence, it is not impossible to make closer friends. Don't feel shy to be the one to initiate meetups even just for a simple meal with someone you think could potentially be a good friend.

That being said, try to put down the feeling of needing a year to consider someone a good friend. It's something emotional - you cant put down a value/time period of how long you must know a person for to consider a good friend. I personally have found a couple of close friends and they are not people whom I attend class with every single day (because we have different modules etc). Some of them I have only known them for a few months but they are much closer friends to me than others that I have known for over a year. Moreover, you mentioned that you are a foreign exchange student. If it takes a year for you to start feeling close to someone, wouldnt you have left SG by then?

I hope you find great friends in NUS. I sincerely hope you can have a good time in SG (which includes the meeting people and forging closer bonds) because that is what overseas exchange programmes should be for :)

I have a insane crush on a guy in Sports Club. He is always smart, funny and charismatic. However, he is in his graduating year and is leaving the Club really soon, and I doubt I will ever see him again. I do not even know if he is attached, but such great guys are always taken. I really hope to be able to see him again. Should I confess to him?

In response to 

Nope do not trust condoms.  

I misplaced my trust in condoms and ended up having an abortion which caused me a lot of pain and money. 

After the incident, I have started to shun sex a little and only do it with my boyfriend when it is absolutely in the safe period and with the extra protection of condoms.  Not 100% foolproof either,  but you either do that or find some way to curb your (and your boyfriend's) desires.

Recently, I had a bad fallout with a "friend" who is also one of my projectmate. I'm sorry but I have to let this out because I'm sick and tired of holding it all in for the past 2 years.

This "friend" of mine is a nice person don't get me wrong. In terms of being friends, he is cheerful, outgoing, sociable and has a large pool of friends. However, I am sort of the opposite, I am more of an introvert and having gone through a very dark past in both my school life as well as with my family, I tend to be skeptical and less sociable. Fortunately, I have managed to maintain an open mind to ideas throughout university and learnt to be more acceptable and understand different people's plight and backgrounds whatnot.

Now to the point, this "friend" usually has his CCA and social outings often thus he is often busy. To me, that is acceptable because sometimes I agree that not everyone is academic focus, even I hate studying and doing tutorials etc. and we need some time-out. But every semester we have projects and usually he would be busy with those activities. I often try to keep him in the loop on what's going on in the project so that he gets updated and he can still contribute despite his busy schedule. Unfortunately, I usually end up "tanking" the project for him because of the above reasons or he needs to webcast, catch up with the syllabus and tutorials. So fair enough, I tank the project and even take my time off my rest time to help and teach him some tricks so that he can catch up to the modules he's lagging behind. Trust me, I've given up a lot of time and effort to help not just for his sake but the rest of the team because I do not want to trouble the other team members on this. You can say this is partially my fault because I keep this a secret from the other team members (who are our circle of friends as well) as I do not want any bad things to happen.

However, despite me indicating to him that he needs to buck up multiple times, he still goes back to this old habit and abandons me. Only to come back later and apologize and promise to work harder next time. This semester I've been extremely busy and I'm unable to keep up with the workload and yet again this f--king bullcrap happens again because he had a major event and he apparently is very busy with his other modules, thus has no time to do projects again. So I sorta blew up recently and now I find it very awkward to speak with my circle of friends and consider placing myself on self-exile after this. I did get a message from this "friend" saying that I should not shut him out of the project and let him know what to do. So now I'm like, I'm at fault because you were busy and never bothered? Wow... In my already turmoil state you just had to add fuel to the fire. I think I've had enough of this crap. I know most of you people deal with this throughout your modules but I'm just very disappointed and disgusted by this person's attitude and irresponsibility. Now I look like I'm the one victimizing him when I'm the victim of all this. Sorry for any bad english/long post whatsoever and thanks for reading this post that I had to let it out.

I'm starting to wonder if any of my university friends are not merely friends borne from convenience.

I go to lessons with my usual clique every day, and we do tell jokes and make small talk here and there, but by and large my conversations with them are dominated by discussions on lesson topics. Or perhaps more accurately, by them asking me about lesson topics. There's been this growing, nagging feeling at the back of my mind that's become harder and harder to shake off, that maybe I'm more of an accessory to their academic endeavours than an actual friend. Perhaps it's because I've garnered somewhat of a "smart guy" reputation that I can't seem to shake off, but even in JC when all my friends knew that I was coping well academically things were not like this. Of course my JC friends still asked me about homework from time to time, but we could just as easily change topics to music, cartoons, games and pretty much everything under the sun. With my JC friends, it never felt like they approached me just to get tutorial answers. With my uni friends, I really cannot say the same.

Maybe I'm yearning for a simplicity and an innocence that's long gone. Or maybe this is just what happens when all your personality traits get overshadowed by a giant neon sign that says "THIS GUY IS GOOD AT EXAMS."

I have a great boyfriend and everything is good about him except for the fact that he's an extremely jealous person.

To put things in perspective, I am not allowed to go out one-on-one with guy friends and he tends to question me if he happens to see me texting guys.  This is not helped by the fact that I happen to have quite a pot of guy friends and they are sometimes quite suggestive in what they say (but I think they are just joking).

I don't want to lose my friendships yet I don't want to lose my guy too.  What should I do???

one word reply from my crush fml:(. But how do you guys keep up with all the rejections? I have taught myself to never ever fall too deep in love with someone because the one getting hurt will be ultimately myself. This allow me to move on more easily to another girl.

But my female friend judge me for being able to switch "target" so quickly. wtf man? Am I supposed to mourn for 7 years before moving on to the next fish? But still, it sort of hurts;( but I think I am getting better at this dating game altho I am still evergreen.  

So hard to find SO:(

There's this guy in class, that always sits right in front of me. We always think of the same thing, its beyond weird. I think it. He says it. But that made me attracted to him. He has tried talking to me once or twice before, but I always gave him really short replies; too short to continue the conversation. ( I hate small talk and I'm really shy) So we never had a proper conversation. I caught him staring at me once, as he walked into class but I didn't think much of it till now. Two weeks ago, he kept stretching in class.Constantly! His hands were right in my face.It was kind of annoying as it was distracting to a certain extent. Also, we tend to partner up for discussions and I would always get up to sit with him in the front. But during that week, he quickly got up to sit with me at the back, like he was doing me a favour? I would just like to know, is stretching a guys way of flirting through body language? I did read about it before, but never experienced it first hand. Do you think he's attracted too? Would like to know what guys think! Thanks!

To all my attached school mates out there, after reading all the confessions about cheating, I just really wanted to say...

Please treasure your other half, and not take him/her for granted. I've been single my whole life, and I've always been envious of the people who have found love. 

I've been in love once before - the feeling was amazing. I felt at peace, I was overflowing with joy, and it felt so good to know what love from the bottom of my heart feels like. I was one of the unlucky ones though; we were not meant to be, and now I'm left wondering if I'll ever find the same kind of love again. 

I've learnt from two failed almost-relationships that the kind of emotional scars left behind are really really painful, whether or not they are intentional. Before you cheat, or do anything against your conscience, please just think about the hurt that you are bringing to the one you love. Think about all the things you love about him/her, think about what made you love him/her in the first place. Think about all the amazing memories the two of you have together, think about all the times he/she was there for you, and think about all the sacrifices you've made to get to where you are now. Think about all the pain and hurt that you will bring to the one you love because of your actions. 

It's not easy to find someone. Once you've found someone to love, please love them with everything that you have. See their imperfections and choose to love them anyway. Remind yourself of just how lucky you are to have found each other, and know that there are many out there who would do anything to have the privilege that you have. Love is a privilege. 

If you don't love your partner enough, please just let him/her go. Everyone deserves to be loved wholeheartedly, and if you can't do that, you don't deserve him/her. 

Be contented and grateful for the one who chose you. Please don't hurt them, they really don't deserve the kind of piercing pain that you'll bring them by cheating. The grass isn't always greener on the other side!

I miss this guy a lot as a friend but we don't talk anymore. Should I text him? Problem is he has a girlfriend and I'm wondering if it would be weird. 
-
 
Why must it be me to start all of the convos but once we start talking, it seems like never ending
-
 
3 years ago, I confessed to you, but you told me that I was not your type; I was skinny, not exactly well-off, and not exactly good-looking either. Today, you cried, and you hugged me, asking me why was it not me, but him you chose. Today, I am already attached, and I have my responsibility and the resolve, reserved for my girlfriend. Sorry, but I cannot take you, much less be your rebound. Why did I return that hug? Because you needed it.

.

Well, that's one of the many scenarios that play out in my mind. Come back to reality, I'm a lonesome person, and one of those people who fail pretty badly at social interactions. I wish that someday, I will have a companion who I can cherish, to work things out with, side by side. It's so lonely and empty here, with me living by myself for years now. I am just a straight guy from engineering, but a guy can dream of a fairy tale, right?
-
 
Why do I keep obsessing about my boyfriend's history and the previous girls he dated? It doesn't help that one of the girls is a friend of mine and she has referred to him as a creepy weirdo before. She's also not the first or the only one to say that. If my unhealthy obsession is not bad enough, I can't help but think that people are judging me for seeing someone like him.

Other than that he is a nice person. Should I just retreat?

I am an international student in my freshman year. I thought it would be fun coming to a new country knowing no one at all beforehand. Occasionally, it has been fun. More often than not, I feel lonely and I miss my friends back home. If you want to know how lonely I am, suffice it to say I have almost all of meals alone. I don't mind being alone, 
Being a shy and reserved person, it usually takes me a long time to make friends. The friendships I made in my school years became "friendships" atleast after a year of meeting the person; And this was greatly supported by our class system, meaning we will attend ALL classes with the same set of people; Naturally, this made making friends a lot easier because you were forced to spend the whole day everyday with the same people. 
Now, in NUS, I am lost as to how to forge new, meaningful and deep friendships. I am adverse to "networking" so I am not a person to collect friends. For me to call someone a friend, I need to feel the significance of the relationship deeply. Though I find it hard to admit to myself, I think I am afraid to seem vulnerable and desperate. I tend to put up a strong front when something threatens my space and portray myself to be "self-sufficient". As much as I would like to believe otherwise, I do need friends.
Before commenting with the standard reply to join CCAs and participate in group activities, please note that I am involved in a lot of CCAs. During the meeting sessions, I feel like people just avoid me. I just feel ignored and left out. I don't have much to talk about to someone new because I am more comfortable with philosophical discussions, deep reflections and the like. I feel inadequate and ignorant when in social interactions and the constant nudge in my mind that says that I am younger than everyone is not helping either.
Am I the only one who feels this way? What am I supposed to do to make new deep friendships? I wish I had someone to talk to.
Thank you for reading till the end. All honest comments and pieces of advice are appreciated!
I hope this doesn't get filtered.

I met this guy a few months ago and I thought we could be friends. But after having like two meals together, he started saying things that made me uncomfortable like 'I thought about you when I walked past your secondary school', etc. I wasn't sure if he was interested in me or he was just being overly friendly, but my replies for his messages got much shorter and colder, and sometimes I don't even reply at all. He suggested to hang out several times but I kept saying I was busy. Still, he texts me once in a while, with messages like 'how are you?' and I don't know what to reply. I'm not sure if he really merely treasures me as a friend (he actually confided in me about his problems before and said that he feels comfortable talking to me, so I thought maybe he just needs a friend?), or he is interested. If it is the former, I feel that it is unfair for him if I just end this friendship like this. If it is the latter, I don't want to lead him on as I have absolutely no intention of getting into a relationship with him. What should I do?

My friend's boyfriend (who is also my friend) is a notorious cheater.  He is not objectively good - looking but somehow manages to get hot girls hooked on him and to be his flings willingly.  He is often the subject of gossip and always being eager to fit in,  I join in criticisms about how his character is completely flawed and agree with others that it is puzzling why others are even attracted to him.

All this perhaps is not an issue...  But the problem is that I have been going out with him... And not just as friends (I don't think there is need to spell out details).  If anyone finds out about this,  I don't think I can face anyone in our circle of friends anymore.  I will totally be ostracised for being a completely hypocritical slut. 

But yet I can't stop. I can't  put a finger to it but I enjoy meeting him and find it thrilling to do so (because I am cheating on my boyfriend too.  Okay I know this is sounding really screwed up). 

Yes and this is (part of) my complicated life.  I know it's wrong but I just needed to get it off my chest. 

Shhhh

I got a question for the helpful guys and girls here. I'm a single guy and want to get to know more girls, possibly even getting a girlfriend. However as they say, getting attached in the workforce is more challenging for several reasons, one of them being the environment itself. In school you get to meet all kinds of girls during the 3-4 years, but as soon as you get a full time job, the circle of interaction decreases exponentially. You are likely to rely on friends of friends, or otherwise, to get attached.

Back to my original question - if I happen to see a girl on the street (by street I mean on public transport, hawker centre etc) who I find decently attractive, what should be the line(s) I should use to get their attention and eventually their contact in a span of 1-5 mins?

I don't want to come across as a creeper or pick up artist, and I'm also wondering as a girl how receptive are you to a guy coming up to you to say hi? What tactics would lower your defenses and not slap a figurative "NO!" in their face?
-
 
to OP of . i had a similar experience. She is a foreign student. She would call me from her home periodically to chat and ask me how i was. I thought she is interested and I was interested in her as well. I confessed and it turn out I got friendzoned. :( Good luck to you though. I hope I am the unlucky one only.

Dear "slutty" girls, 
I put that in quotation cos that's what alot of people might label you as.
You've been through quite a number of men; relationships, one night stands, FWBs, FBs, etc. 
Some of you are ashamed of it. Some of you are very secretive about it. Some of you question your choices. Some of you regret it. Some of you are now over that 'phase' and are now in lasting relationships. And some of you can't even look yourselves in the eyes when you look at a mirror.
I just want to say, it's okay. Everyone has their own definition of morals and principles and values. No one has the right to judge you or your choices but it doesn't mean they won't. Just do what makes you happy, be that way if you want to be. Just be safe about it. 
That being said, you have to make sure there are no major casualties.
Don't hurt anyone on purpose. Don't play with someone's feelings. If you're in it just for the physical intimacy, make sure they know. if you're both in it for a lasting relationship and you genuinely try but it doesn't work out, that's different from you wanting him/her just for the sex while the other party thinks otherwise.
Now, "playboys", the above applies to you too. 
If you want her just for the sex but she won't put out, don't pretend to love her and then leave her after you get what you want. That is where we draw the line in calling you a manslut and a player.
If you're a single man who sleeps around with women, I personally don't think it's fair calling you a player. As long as you're not breaking girls' hearts on purpose, I think you're free to live your life as you wish. Minimum damage though.
And to people in relationships, do define your boundaries with your partner. How open/exclusive your relationship would be is dependent on how you guys as a couple want it to be. 
Is it going to be say...something like you're allowed to get physical with other people but just make sure not to develop feelings? Are you guys allowed to go have erotic massages but just to inform your partner about your activities? Are u guys going to involve a third person into your sexcapades? Or are you guys going to be absolutely exclusively for each other only? Understand and communicate. 
And don't label or judge. 
-sincerely, a member of society

to OP of ,

I am the OP of . Sounds like you are doing something that my bf had done, even into the relationship. Just wanted to share my views as the gf that found out. It was distressing and disgusting to know that he is touched by several women who touch hundreds of other men. It is cheating, period. 

If you think that the sleazy massage is just a massage with a bonus and a hj is nothing, imagine this (I have argued about this with my bf and it broke him down). If it is just a hj and earns such quick money I can do it too. Why not, who doesnt want some extra allowance. I just need to use my hands only and he will get it for free, save his money and I earn mine, why not. But if you really treasure her and love her, you wont let her do that, would you. Because it is dirty and betraying herself and you for money. And thats what you had been doing, dirty and betraying her to satisfy your lust with money. Money can buy you the momentary pleasure but the pain that you brought to your love ones lasts forever.  

It may be hard to recover from your addiction but I hope you can stand firm to avoid it at all costs if you want to continue your rs. No women will allow this to happen and will definitely leave a scar that never heals. I still get upset whenever i think back. But i choose to trust him again because he give me his utmost promise to never go again. Would you do so as well for your gf or even future family?

I gave my ex a birthday present although we have already broken up about 1.5 years ago. And she got me one recently for my birthday too. Does that mean anything even though she's attached now? I still miss her sometimes though. 
-
 
I've got a question about something rather silly. Recently it was my birthday and I noticed that all the friends/acquaintances who wished me didn't do so via a Facebook post. The only way they'd have come to know is through Facebook, since I'm not that close to a lot of them. But they chose to either PM or WhatsApp me rather than publicly make a birthday post. I'm of course glad that they wished me at all considering everyone's busy lives, but I found this to be a bit odd. I personally just write on their wall if I see that it's their birthday and if I know them reasonably well. What's this new trend going around? 
-
 
So i have been together with my current girlfriend for close to 9 months now. Things were great at the start, and i am really happy. However, as time passes by, i just suddenly have this hunch that she doesnt love me anymore and i did talk to her about it and she assures me that she is still in love with me. However, i still feel that sometimes, i am putting more effort in the relationship than her, like initiating physical intimacy, buying her flowers, caring for her etc. She is a really great girl as a person but there are times when we were to go out, she will always be rushing to go home because of whatever reason and it just seemed that she doesnt want to spend time with me. Other than just talking about it, i dont know ehat should i do anymore

My boyfriend's short temper scares me so much. When I don't tell him what I'm doing at least a day in advance he gets upset and he gets hostile and cold towards me, but most of my plans ae spontaneous, so it's been happening for a while. I don't know what to do anymore or if I'm in the wrong anymore.

It baffles me how some guys can accept the friendzone i.e. to stay as friends when their advances have been rejected. It is either romantic, professional (e.g. helpful at work/school), or nothing at all.
Isn't the friendzone a one-sided relationship? I'm not sure if they are overly optimistic, have too much time to waste, or are not confident enough to end it. Maybe someone can help me understand why...

With all the love confessions going about now, I felt the need to share my story. Before I entered uni, I used to be a RSAF pilot trainee but I was subsequently chopped halfway through because of my poor performance. Back then, I was too young and naive. Instead of studying hard and practising for my sorties, I invested too much time and effort chasing this girl who I had a silly crush on. I would constantly text her day and night and when she took a while to reply, it was as if my body stopped functioning properly and all I wanted at that time was her reply. It was so bad that the night before my flying assessments, I would have sleepless nights, thinking about her throughout the night and I ended up sleeping very little.
 Aviators would know that sufficient rest is extremely important before they engage in a mission and I failed that very rule. Needless to say, my performance began to show and my peers were surprised that my performances had dropped so much. Of course, in such a punishing environment, bad performances never go unnoticed, and I got "chopped" as a result. I shall not say at what stage I got chopped as it is too much of a give-away. It all ended very badly with my crush too, and after some promising progress with her, she just chose to be with another guy soon after. 
After some deep soul searching, I felt so stupid and foolish to abandon such a good opportunity for myself and a childhood dream for unrequited love. I spiralled into a state of mini-depression where several times throughout the day, I would just find a quiet place and cry every time I was reminded of that painful episode. It took almost half a year for me to recover from that episode.
Fast forward to now, I have learnt from that bitter experience and I hope that this story may be helpful to some of you who are in the same situation as me(i.e having a deep crush on someone). Never invest too much effort and feelings into a crush and neglect everything else around you. The only one that will lose out is yourself eventually. Your crush will most likely never appreciate your feelings and even if there are, it is often grossly one-sided. I don't disagree that sometimes the crushes may reciprocate the feelings after a while, but from my own experience, my friends' and reading NUS whispers, I concluded that it is seldom the case. So unless that the other party makes it clear that he/she likes you too and is willing take things to another level, then please never invest so much feelings and effort into someone you like. You may end up losing so much more than you could have imagined.

Dear 
I am the author of . I guess this is a problem many high-CAPs face... even though my CAP isn't that great. Many of these people I spoke to choose to avoid useless obligations through several methods. Some by upping Whatsapp privacy and responding slowly on purpose. Some by appearing busy with boy/girlfriend. A simple "sorry i'm out and I don't have access to my school work materials" does it. Or you can do it like how a girl wants to give negative signals to a guy she's uninterested in. Or you could pretend to have family problems, or simply problems with handling your school work. Some even pretend to have low-CAP but usually if people already know you are smart and thus make you their homework whore this wouldn't work...

If you are in Year1/2, I guess you still have quite some time to slowly flush the crap out and still have a shot at genuine friendships. At this stage people still mingle around and, look out to make friends that they will stick with for their remaining years in uni. Or alternatively you could find fellow high-CAP friends. I sound obnoxious for sure but when you observe study groups and cliques along with their estimated CAP, you will realize that they on average follow a certain pattern so I am actually suggesting something very... normal. If you search online for the experiences of others, they say that friendships in uni work like that because the friendship doesn't seem imbalanced. And where projects are concerned, similar CAPed people are more likely to have similar working styles, or at the very least compliment each other better. 

If you are like in your final year... where all the groups and cliques are finalized, I guess you have to resign yourself that you aren't going to be much better off than your current state no matter what you do, not even going ultra social and joining clubs and CCA will help you for reasons I am lazy to elaborate though it should be obvious.... (also touched on in my confession months ago) In my case I'm way past the optimal time so I am paying for it.

There are several aspects or ways to coming out of this not too badly. I personally avoid the confrontational outburst approach, though this is partially because I'm in my final year. I don't claim to know everything, but more of learning from seniors and people who've long graduated.
1. Be more positive about helping people! Simply this. I'm actually thinking of teaching. Am I supposed to demand some form of returns when I help students out?! No DUH? Though I know very well many people do not identify themselves with this kind of naive thinking.... And yes sometimes I feel stupid and angry for helping certain people and being a doormat people who exist to ask me for homework but okay la. live and let live.
2. Develop a good system to helping these people. Good in the sense that when they ask you for help, it's at least relatively effortless. In my case I have a dropbox which many has access to.
3. If networking is something you believe may be important to you, all the more you should at least appear in their "okay" books, instead of burning bridges. I'm being optimistic here; we all know very well many people in uni do keep people they dislike for utility.
4. Force some kind of feedback from people who use your work. At least when you make mistakes and your work doesn't make sense, some of these people may actually ask you about it and you can thus catch the mistake. Works well for graded homework.

So for now while I do feel utterly dumb and angry at myself at times, from a time-effort perspective I'm not performing too badly.... I guess...

I have never been close to my parents and have never really told them about what's going on in school or in my life. Although I appreciate them for working hard to support my education and other pursuits, I wish that I could also tell them how I feel about certain things that are happening in my life.

Every time I see my friends posting pictures of themselves with their parents, I really wonder when I can be 'good friends' with my parents too.

They say that your friends may not always be there for you, but your family will. Sometimes when I feel frustrated and need to talk to someone, other than my friends, I find that I have no one else to talk to.

It doesn't help that I can't express my feelings well and always put up a strong front when I am just a mess inside. To make matters worse, I am staying on campus and since I only see my parents about once a week, I feel like it's straining my relationship with them.

On the surface,  I appear like an ordinary good girl who came from elite schools and got into a prestigious faculty in university.   However I am actually hiding a whole load of secrets. 

After entering uni,  I got to know this group of happening friends who loved the nightlife.  This was something new to me and I grew extremely excited and started to get into this world of partying.   Ladies' night became a weekly occurrence and heavy drinking a norm.   I also became more sexually interested and thought nothing of making out with guys at the clubs.  In fact,  I felt rather proud at my conquests. 

This lifestyle went on for 3 years till I met this guy who I would call a typical goody two shoes guy.   He didn't belong to my circle of friends so I thought it would be a good fresh start for me.  Things were well and blissful for us as he is possibly the sweetest guy ever and I felt like he would be the one. 

Fast forward a year later.  I'm starting to get a little bored of being stuck with one guy.   Recently in a span of 2 months,  I have made out with a guy at a club and with one of my previous flings at a random occasion.  I felt guilty but at the same time I thought it was exciting.  Sometimes I despise myself, but I wonder if I am the sort who can't be faithful or it just means I'm not sufficiently in love with my boyfriend. 

It could be that it was a wrong match in the first place.  My boyfriend has from from the very start assumed I'm a virgin and a good girl and did not give me a chance to 'confess' my past.  For the fear of disappointing him,  I have not dared to speak of the past either.   I have tried to drop hints that I'm perhaps not all that good as he thinks I am,  but he trusts me too much,  too much for his own good. 

I feel that I may one day cause him a lot of hurt but at the same time I am am selfish and reluctant to give him up.   

To him: I am sorry and hope that if things don't work out between us some day,  you will find the good girl you have been looking for.

I've been dating this girl for about 10 months now (pssst I'm a girl) and I think it's going really great. 
I have introduced her to my family, my friends and they all really like her. But, I think she's embarrassed to be with me. 
It's been 10 months and I've not met any of her friends or family yet. I understand not meeting her family because she hasn't come out to them yet but she has with her friends. 

Everytime I visit her in school and I see her friends, she introduces me as 'a friend' to them. "Oh, she's just a friend." She's the best thing that has happened to me but she's making me feel as though I'm just a backup plan. I've asked her about it but she always avoids the question.

What should I do?

To  I've started out with a CAP of 1.91 before. Now I'm at 2.95. Not fantastic, but I've pulled it up. It's not impossible, you just have to have a drive strong enough (haze should be the least of your problems actually) and to commentor Do Hyun Kim: you have no idea how OP of  got 1.90, who are you to mock?
-
 
I feel conflicted by my friend. He says he lusts after a particular girl who happens to be his friend's girlfriend.

It was with some delight that he may have landed himself in trouble when he ended up having some sexual gratification with another girl. Not because she's underaged, but because he forgot his rubber.

But that also meant that my friend's girlfriend may well be next.

I pretended to lust for her in front of this friend of mine, but in reality I hope to stop him.

Enrolled into NUS this year after NS. Sharing a room now  with someone in school. I have a smelly bolster aka 臭臭, have it since young and I have to admit that the appearance might not be pleasant to people but the smell is definitely pleasant (I rely on my chouchou to fall asleep). I want to bring it to school however I am worry that my room mate might tease and laugh at me. Anyone advice? Will not post a picture of my chouchou here else my close friends will know.

How do you tell if a girl is interested in you? Say if she's overseas now with her group of friends, she would tell me when she is leaving and back at the hotel. Also, this morning she sent me a photo of her before she left the hotel. Am I dense or am I reading too much?
-
 
Looking back, I am really surprise (and sad) at the same time how I manage to get through NS without a girlfriend. Now, I have graduated for quite some time and was once again more surprise (and more sad) that I still remain evergreen.

These few weeks have been really rough for me... I went zouk alone last week, bought my own drink and sat in a corner, trying to cheer myself up and maybe get high enough to feel happy. The drink didn't make me feel good as I thought it would, I went straight to the sombre state.

Random guy sat next to me and tried to befriend me. He started being touchy and was damn insistent on asking me to follow him. He tried to engage me in a conversation, kiss me, dance with him but I wasn't in the mood to do anything.  I was already regretting going there. 

I left zouk after rejecting him. I felt so tired and a little dizzy I almost stumbled while walking to the bus stop. It was hard getting a cab back to bishan because the cabs available mostly had their intended destination on the green header on top which wasn't where I wanted to go. I finally found one and this other guy suddenly popped up and asked if the driver was going to yishun. He asked if we could share a cab, I'm like ok, the driver can drop me at my home first. He said something about getting his car then driving me back. I was in no mood to argue or find another cab, I just got in. 

He introduced himself and we talked in the cab. Ok he did most of the talking. I found myself at Yishun with the cab fare paid by him, he said he'll drive me back. In his car, he held me hand and said some stuff. I wasn't thinking straight already, and contemplated his offer. 

But I rejected him afterwards and, he just dropped me at Yishun mrt station. I slept at the bus stop outside. 

I thought my night and my life was even shitty enough. I woke up at 6plus to a text from my crush asking me if we wanna meet for breakfast and study together before our group meeting that day.

How was I in a good state to see him that soon after being so pathetic? I probably lost my chance to know him more.

I'm messed up, right?

I'm not very sociable and I'm an introvert, so I don't have many friends. My boyfriend on the other hand has so many friends, most of them girls, and he's always out with them. I feel so lonely in my relationship. :( Is this normal?

Is it possible for a girl to have a close guy friend without having any feelings for him? The more i think of it, the more it doesnt seem possible, at least for me.

I'm interested in this senior of mine and I know he's a really great guy cause he really has helped me countless of times from understanding what my major was about when I first met him before school started to giving me his notes and advices for the modules he had taken before. 
But I also realized because he's such a nice guy, his extroverted personality is so well liked by everyone that every time I see him, he's with a different girl.. And I there seem to be a clear barrier of us being senior-junior relationship, whereby if I were to ask him out for lunch it seems like I've overstepped that boundary.. I've known him for slightly over a year now and we have never talked about anythingelse other than school work, lest to talk about dating.. Can someone advice me on what to do to bring this relationship we have to another level ?? Thank you for reading !!

Suffering from psychological disorder while studying in uni is so hard. I have survived the first three years, though with many close-to-giving-up moments. Hope I do not crash before I complete my fyp.

I'm not the OP of , but my situation is somewhat similar to hers. We take a common module and I get to talk to him during lectures, but we are merely like 'acquaintances', too. I tried msg him like what the comment suggested (I asked him questions regarding the module), he barely replied. But he's been very helpful when I meet him in person, as he always helps me with my queries in lectures. Then why the feeling becomes so different when it comes to msg? I once heard that if a guy doesn't really reply you means he's not into you, really? I'm so upset when he doesn't reply me, should I give up? What should I do?

I wish to seek some advice on this and hopefully kind souls on nuswhispers can help me please because I have been agonizing over this for quite a while ): I have known this male friend for almost a year now and I harbour romantic feelings for him. I always get to see him in lectures but we have not been speaking to each other ever since last semester because up till now we are merely like 'acquaintances'. It's not like any of us has gone further than that. I'm aware that I do have many good opportunities to approach him since we take the same modules. However, I guess it's easier said than done.. It's pretty difficult to ask him out for a meal in school after not chatting up with him for such a long time and being a rather shy and reserved girl, I hope to not appear weird or scare him off too. Can you guys tell me how I can bring this friendship (or perhaps acquaintanceship) to another level or maybe just make the current situation better? Thank you so much.

Hi all. I find myself liking this girl who happens to be in one of my classes this semester. I got to know her as we happened to be sitting beside each other. I find that when I am with her, there's always something to talk about. Somehow though, that doesn't seem to be the case on whatsapp, and the few time I texted her, she would take forever to reply, and the convo would eventually die. Initially, I thought that maybe she just wasn't really the type to reply fast on whatsapp, but then I noticed that she replies to her other friends' texts pretty quickly while in class. 

Also, she's not exactly very active on social media, but I saw a few tagged photos of her and another guy. It looks like they might be together, but because the guy has a lot of similar photos with other girls as well, I can't really be sure. My gut feeling tells me that she is though, and even if she isn't, she may not see me that way. Still, I guess I just want to confirm and move on if she is. The thing is, how should I go about it? People always say to ask subtly, for example, "oh so do you bake for your bf", but to me, it feels really obvious/awkward to me?

Advice anyone?

Hello , my bf and I have been together for 3 years and 3 months. He often gets hard when we meet up to resolve an argument/ issue. When I asked him why does he gets hard, he will cheekily says, "it wants to listen to what gf has to say".
-
 
Okay hope this doesn't get filtered again

I'm a girl and I'm wondering how to subtly hint to guys that I'm interested in them...sexually. Without completely scaring them off. I would be a little more straightforward towards them if not for the fear of the horror and embarrassment of getting rejected and gaining a bad 'rep'. Any advice?

There is something weighing heavily in my heart. It was during my NS when I first visited a sleazy massage parlour. I still don't know why I did it; maybe because of curiosity. But I enjoyed the erotic services very much, and I lost my virginity during one of those visits. Till today, I visit massage parlours every few months. It might be fine if I'm a single, but I've a girlfriend now. Yet I can't quit this bad habit because of my lust. My girlfriend does not know about my secret life, and I feel guilty about keeping this from her. I keep telling myself that "It'll be the last one, I swear", but I just keep returning to get those services. I'm afraid that one day my secrets will be exposed, and I'll lose everything I treasure... What can I do?

Hey NUS peeps, I am an exchange student from the states and I find some singaporean guys particularly cute and I have also been really dry and hungry for the past few months. Yup, Tinder does seem to have some server problems and I am getting desperate :D Guys who are interested please leave a comment and I will chat you up and we shall see how it goes :)

I like to swipe through tinder not because I want to make friends, but because I want to know how many girls like me back. #buildselfconfidence

Why do some guys still keep on chasing a girl even when the girl already given so many hints of rejection -.- and the dude hasnt given up after 4 months... *facepalm*

I'm 25 this year, and I haven't ever been in a relationship. I have no trouble making friends, but a girlfriend... crossing that bridge from friendship to SO seems (and has proven thus far to be) impossible at this point.

I've been trying to get to know someone better these days, and it's been frustrating as hell. I'd like to know, is it normal for people to just ignore or forget to reply their messages nowadays? I make it a point to reply all messages, or at least those directed at me. If they do the above, then it's a clear signal they aren't interested is it not? Does this apply from the get go, or only after some trying do you come to such a conclusion? Most importantly, I'd like to know, how many of you feel like you had to let go of your dignity when you chased your SO? Cuz, for me, this is the pattern I've been stuck in for the longest time, so any advice would be appreciated.

Hi, this is the OP of .
I heard from my colleagues that today this friend of mine came to the building where I am working. He went one floor above my workplace to borrow somethings. In the past, he will then drop by to say hi.
However, he did not do it this time. He has been telling my colleagues that he is worried about me etc. But if this is the case, since we have not met for 6 months, he would have came to say hi (since just one floor below). His gestures are in contradiction to what he tells others.
I suddenly feel that he is such a hypocrite. Hearing this news today, I was reminded of the painful memories of the past of this friendship. I was upset and disappointed but at the same time glad that I made the decision to distance myself and move away.
Very conflicted, confused and hurt :(

Obsessed? Maybe. No... without doubt. I am infatuated over this girl whom I known for a semester and it's driving me nuts - I can't stop thinking about her. We hang out time to time but still, the weekends or time away from her is also driving me to a wall. I know we need our own space and time but I feel so helpless - it feels like I've thrown myself into a mental abyss. Midterms are coming really soon and it has became somewhat torturous/unhealthy. I can't seem to focus on studying and I don't want to be overbearing by constantly texting her. Dear community, how do I cope?

I am really worried about my future. I am quite shy so it is not easy for me to make friends much less find a partner. Also my CAP just hit 3.5 but it is really my electives that pulled it up so I'm afraid I will not find a job because I actually do not do that well for my core modules. I would not prefer to have self-pity but it is sad to imagine the future me as lonely and struggling to find a job.

Hi Miss KZQ,

I don't know if you're following NUSWhispers. You dont know me but i know you! I know your existence since your secondary school days. You were from an all-girls secondary school. Our age gap is 5 years apart..but now we are finally in the same uni! I know that youre a passionate dancer and youre studying in FASS now! I would really like to know you! 
-
 
To the OP of 
I'm in a similar situation as well. My boyfriend's closest friends are all female and his social circle is predominantly female too.
I think you might want to talk to him about this if you really feel uncomfortable with it. Getting to know his friends will help a lot.
My bf actually introduced them to me and even invited me along to some of their outings so it really help to prevent any potential misunderstandings 
We also tell each other who we are going out with. you may want to try these options out. 
All the best :))

Last night, the lights were dim and we got into the mood for kissing. One thing led to another and I was really excited of the prospect of bringing our relationship to the next level after 3 months and 7 days of dating. However everything changed after my boy removed his pants. I found it hard to contain my disappointment and gave an excuse that I am not ready for intercourse yet. In case you are wondering, I am a petite girl and I am afraid that his sexual organ would really pose an obstacle to the progress of our relationship. Readers, please offer advice on how I could solve our problem. I am definitely sure he wouldn't opt for a penis reduction. :(

I believe some ladies out there would take guys' chasing or kindness for granted and some may even frown upon/be disgusted by such gestures from these guys for god knows what the reasons are. While the ladies (I'm a girl by the way, so don't think of me as some guys ranting over this issue) are being 'served big pieces of meat' on their plates (I sincerely apologize for using this bad analogy on the opposite gender, but just forgive me please) it is most likely these ladies will cast them aside and seek for 'better' and 'juicier' ones. So I believe people tend to yearn for things they cannot get and frankly speaking, I think I'm no different too. While I always hope for a boyfriend, if any new guy comes along and has interest in me, I would shun away immediately and then go for someone who don't have the mutual feelings for me. I'm not sure why.. I don't even give a chance to others..

We have been together for almost two years. We spent almost a year overseas and were happy to have each other's as companions. Things were perfect. 
But everything took a turn for the worse once we returned to Singapore. We began to spend little time together because she was always busy with school and her personal life. In those little time when we were out together, we almost never held hands because she didn't want us to be seen by people she knew because we didn't share the same religious faith. We were falling apart. She got to know a guy in her faculty and begun to spend more time with him. Often flirting with him on chats and meeting up with him for late night chats, drinks and movies. I was kept in the dark about this until I chanced upon her chat history. I was heartbroken, and I realized I couldn't do anything about it as I was the one that couldn't let her go. She was okay to end everything. I was worth nothing to her. 
I forgave her and tried to woo her back again although it was her that cheated. Finding ways to spend more time with her, making my schedule fit her's often jeopardizing my own plans. 
She started working and got really busy. We hardly communicated, my messages to her were often seen and not replied after many hours later. We met once every two weeks for a meal together on average. I was always the one that have to reshuffle my schedule to fit hers as I was more desperate to spend more time with her. I was almost like her back-up plans. 
All these times I was hoping that she could change and that she could understand that it was about the lack of effort on her part rather than the lack of time. 
Finally, I took the decision to end us. She accepted it readily which doesn't surprise me because I knew I wasn't anything to her anymore. 
In a relationship, parties constantly change and make adjustments for each other because there's a threat that the other person will leave or end the relationship. When one party no longer view the importance of the other party, that's when the relationship will start to fail as no effort will be made to make adjustments. 
To those who made it to the end of my confession, I would like to say a big thank you. I'm looking for a channel to release this as I am struggling to move on from this after three month as I can't forget her.

With reference to , I think it is great that you help your girlfriend get over and overcome this phase of her life. However, after your girlfriend recover from her trauma, I don't think that she should be the one holding the "trigger". You should be more active and think for yourself. You cannot act in such a selfless manner because not only does it affect you, it affects those who care about you because your family would not want to see you sad. I'm not discouraging you from being with her but you need to take your own welfare into account. You have to be damn bloody sure that she would not do something similar again.

Take care...

I totally disagree that guys does not have biological clock. Isn't pattern hair loss make it obvious of the presence of biological clock in guys. For me, I am super worried that I may continue staying evergreen even after my last strand of hair has fallen off. If I am so lucky to have a girlfriend, will she love me even after all my hair has dropped?

Both my boyfriend and I are in our third year of medical school. We have been together since the first year. Just a couple of days ago, he broke up with me saying that he can't get past my weight and called me fat. I found out that he was trying to chase this model girl on the side. My self esteem has been shattered and I don't know what to think. I used to be confident in my own skin but I don't think I can be anymore. Why does it have to be because of my looks.

This hall vs. no hall thing... *facepalm*

If you chose to have a more active social life and a more vibrant NUS life, good for you! Do whatever you want. However, when it comes down to project work, you jolly well do your part as a team mate should, because you're ultimately still a student in NUS. Don't bring the entire ship (your team) down.

If you chose to be less social, or just prefer to go home everyday after school, that's cool. You may have things you need to attend to. Maybe school is something draining to you. Just make sure that, at the end of your 4 years, you don't regret not doing anything much socially, because these 4 years may very well be the last 4 years of studies where you could've done anything you wanted.

I respect whatever anyone does, because it's really none of my business. What is an issue though is when what you do is causing grief/problems to others or yourself. So don't be that kind of person, okay? :)

I can relate a lot to the recent bullying incident... bullies were part and parcel of my life in sec school and jc, and I had to live with it with no one to help me. Physical abuse (punching) and verbal abuse (making fun of my appearance) was pretty common. It gave me a lot of self-esteem issues growing up and I hated every single one of my bullies, which funnily enough also included some of my teachers, who were the supposed "caretakers" but still used their position to mock me all the same. But it also ignited a fire in me to change, and when I moved on to army and uni I grew out of my nerdy persona and surrounded myself with nicer friends. Looking back now I feel like I've become a better person because of it, because I understand what it means to have suffered. I want to encourage the bullied ones to stand up to the bullies - not in the confrontational way - but rather to channel that anger in you to improve yourself, to make sure you become better than the bullies who mocked you. When there's a will there's a way, you should know it better than anyone else. We all know that asking for help doesn't work, so you can only help yourself. 

Also to all the bullies out there, I don't believe in all the bullshit excuses about how you have changed, or how you have moved on for the better. A rotten egg will forever remain rotten, and I really hope that you guys spend the rest of your life attempting and failing to atone for your sins. I will never understand why you guys exist, or why you would chose to bully someone who has done absolutely nothing to you. But do note that if I ever meet any of you in real life, I will do everything in my power to make your life miserable. And to all my bullies. If I ever get the chance, rest assure that I will personally make sure you guys suffer for what you did.  

There is a poem/comic which I feel ties in with this nicely, enjoy: http://zenpencils.com/comic/william-ernest-henley-invictus/

I am the same OP for the post 

Thank you all for the response. It is rather heart warming.

I would be lying if I said that I am not angry/upset or manifesting typical human emotions. When she told me there and then, I was angry. But I think being upset does nothing to solve the issue and/or only serves to make it worse. I guess it is a by- product of my training during NS too after I have seen men under my command die. Keeping calm is crucial.

This has definitely affected the relationship, but I did not tell her that. I think making her feel worse would affect her performance for mid terms and ability to focus for the remaining semester. I actually listed down possible avenues for her to seek help ( government and private ). I reaffirmed her that while upset, I am still willing to listen.

In truth, I am willing to forgive and move on ( not completely, but on the whole ). I would like to help her get through this phase.  As for the reasons as to why she committed the act, I don't think I am in a position to criticise or crituque her for that matter. I can only offer her a chance to amend and make a concerted effort to repair this relationship, I guess...I will leave it to her  ( when ready ) if she wants to continue this relationship.

I'm merely the trigger, she's the one to decide if she wants to discharge a round - not me.

Can Singaporean boys fall in love with a pretty and lovely Chinese girl although she has just come to Singapore and known little about the local culture?
-
 
My girlfriend and I have been together for 1 year, 8 months and 27 days ( Sorry i'm an Engineer ). Recently during this reading week, she broke down like she never before and confessed that she went for an abortion. During the May semester break, I was on reservist overseas for a month and she went clubbing. From what she told me, the guy offered to use protection, but she didn't want to as it felt better doing it "raw".

One thing led to another and she was pregnant with someone else's child which led to her going to a private clinic for an abortion. But ever since then, she said she has issues coping with the trauma of going thru the procedure and has guilt related issues due to the taking of an unborn life.

Where do I go from here ? I understand that it is my duty to care as a boyfriend, but I too am in shock over her actions ( not the abortion, the clubbing one ). Seeking some advice from the community. Many thanks in advance

My boyfriend asked a total stranger for number, behind my back. I found out after, and he told me he asked purely to make friend with her. Should I trust his reason? Guys, please help, is there really no motive behind this? Thanks in advance.

I thought I would probably never fall in love. I was never so wrong. It wasn't really love at first sight cos I don't believe in it and more often than not, it's just infatuation. All this time, my close friends always called me handsome and I often had to correct them that I wasn't. This was because I was F--KING handsome. But jokes aside, none of the girls actually approached me maybe bcos I was a bit playful and they probably thought I wasn't in their league whereas I thought the same about them.

This all changed one rainy afternoon. She came into the classroom quietly, and gently closed the door while adjusting her spectacles. She was drenched from head to toe. All eyes in the classroom were at her and I knew she was shy bcos she quickly lowered her gaze and in quick steps put her bag down and went out to the washroom to dry her hair. She was cute, especially her eyes, and I felt my heart skipped a beat. Now it always happened whenever I saw an attractive face so I didn't pay much attention. When she returned, she sat in the second row, two rows infront of me and my friends. A while later, two of her friends also came in together with a guy. I thought she must have been attached, given her looks, but it wasn't true. 

There were 10 minutes to class so I decided to get to know her. I used an old trick from the book and dropped my wallet right next to her table while pretending to go outside of class. It failed miserably bcos she was focused on talking to her friends. I picked it myself and banged my head on her table purposely to get her attention. She was the only one concerned with her other three friends staring at me skeptically. She then spoke with her angelic voice to ask if I was alright and almost put her hand on my head before putting it away embarrassingly. With my best acting I acted as if I had hurt myself badly and stumbled a bit on the way out, giggling to myself. Right after about a minute, I went back in and apologized if I had accidentally hurt her. She reassured me and asked me if I was feeling okay. 

The class ended in an hour and half. I had forgotten about the incident earlier on when she reminded me again by asking me if I was indeed okay. I then acted again to gain more sympathy from her. She even offered me to go see NUH together with her. Not wanting to further lie to her, I told her I wasn't really hurt and also got her name at the same time. We exchanged numbers on the basis of being classmates and became friends on facebook. 

Slowly, we became closer with me asking her out a few weeks later. She was a little gullible at times but her shyness and awkwardness just attracted me towards her. We became very steady when I gave my first kiss to her on our 8th month together. Took me a long time to get intimate with her since she was felt I wasn't really serious but I got my act together and melted her heart with over the time we spent together. We graduated together and then eventually got married. 

Look at the recent turn of events, she got diagnosed with Stargardt's Disease and doctors say it will lead to blindness. Initially I wasn't even sure what the f--k that meant and went to research about it. Her vision has started to deteriorate at a very fast rate. I still love her as much but I am really worried about how it's gonna turn out. Sometimes you see these kind of stories in books, movies and fiction and believe that they will never happen to you. And when they do, you are in complete disbelief on what to do next. I will not leave her side and hopefully I can get some strength to carry in my next phase of life.

Let me end with a quote:

-
 
Whenever my confession on here gets filtered, I get very upset. I see all the nonsense and overly sexual posts and I wonder what was wrong with mine for it to get rejected. Was it too sexual or was it just deemed not important enough..or would it have done nothing for the TRP rates here...
-
 
 I have the opposite problem than you. I have a lot of close guy friends, and I tend to click better with guys ever since primary school so most of the people I text are guys. They all know that I'm attached and are all purely platonic friends. I don't flirt with them and they know that I'm not interested at all. Occasionally I do go out with them one on one, I do tell my boyfriend about it and my friend also knows that it's a friend thing and nothing more.

My boyfriend has problems with it and so recently I've cut down on talking to my guy friends. I feel really bad because I value my friendships a lot and naturally I would want to catch up and talk with them. It's hard for me to find people I can click with and being in a new environment I wanted to make new friends, unfortunately..again the people I clicked better with were guys, so I didn't let the friendships deepen which makes me sad ):

So far there really is not good way out, both sides will suffer in this and both side will have to suck it up. It hurts me but I know it will hurt my boyfriend more and for the sake of my relationship I guess some sacrifices will have to be made, but at the same time I get lonely a lot too. ):

TL;DR talk it out, communicate your concerns well, don't sound like an overly attached girlfriend.

There's this guy who kind of confessed to me but I did not respond in time. He probably knows that I like him too. But it has been so long already and nothing is happening between us because he is too embarrassed to mention that day again and I don't know how to bring it up. I feel that it is my fault for not responding but his message wasn't that straightforward to begin with and I'm afraid that I have misinterpreted it. 
Any idea on how to get out of this situation?

It's recess week and my BF just went to Bangkok with his guy friends. So earlier this week, a fellow guy friend asked me out for a movie and cuz I was bored and he's kinda cute, so I said yes. It somehow felt exciting and things got kinda crazy in the movie theatre when he touched me down below. At the beginning I resisted but it was too tempting... Sorry baby, we didn't have sex but I still feel really guilty about it :( should I just keep mum when he comes back?
-
 
Personally, if I feel that someone is paying special attention to me, I get freaked out and try to avoid interacting with them until I feel that they've lost interest. I'm used to being single and I have my reasons for remaining so. But maybe it's also because I don't want to find out if I'm difficult to love.
-
 
Am I m being friendzoned if this guy mentions stuff like thanks man and not like that man? I find it a bit weird or is it just being informal?

My boyfriend has a LOT of female friends, including his closest friends. I accept that, bearing in mind some girls just click better with guys and vice versa. I also trust him.

However, am I justified to still get a nagging pang of jealousy and insecurity whenever he hangs out with and talks to so many girls? My friend also once jokingly told me if she hadn't known he's my boyfriend, she wouldn't have guessed he was even attached because every time she sees him around campus, he's hanging out with a different girl. That really hit me. 

I choose to trust him, but I hate how this still bugs me deep down. Should I talk to him about this and how? I don't want to stop him from interacting with his friends either, but what's a reasonable compromise or am I supposed to suck it up?

We met a little more than three years ago - young, clueless and a little too excited to fall in love. We got together anyways, in less than a span of a month. You used to tell me that time shouldn't be a unit of measurement when it comes to love, and that we will be okay.

Our love was on an accelerated programme. We plunged so deeply in love we forgot to pace ourselves. We became reliant, we forgot what it was like to be independent. We always had each other, and that was enough.

But life continued to happen around the bubble we confined ourselves in. School demanded our attention, our friends and family wanted a piece of us, yet we prioritised each other above any other things in life. We meant the world to each other. We relied on each other. Eventually we became responsible for each others rights and wrongs. 

Exhaustion kicked in. We chose to take the shortcut - to blame each other on life's misfortunes and unfairness because it was convenient. All of a sudden I wasn't good enough for you. I became a burden. 

We tried really hard to fill up the cracks that were splitting not just us, but our hearts apart. One step forward, two steps back. We kept going back to the same problems, to our old ways. We exhausted all means to help each other. We fought about anything under the sun. And none of them make sense at this point. But we never truly got over any of them.

The good times used to compensate for the downs. But at this point I am beyond exhausted. I had never once given up, but held on when an old problem arise. But I now question if it's still worthwhile. 

-
 
I hate it when some people always thinks that I'm very free to plan for outings or thinks that I'm closet mugger when in fact I have to constantly worry and deal with my family problems, whether if my paralysed dad is having conflict or getting beaten up by my bastard sibling again. Seriously, I don't even feel like explaining my situation to this kind of people who just assumes this and that straight away. I don't even have a single day of peace at home. Everytime I will hear shoutings, door slamming etc. I seriously doubt I will want to get married and have unfilial children in the future, dealing with those uncertain relationships such as getting cheated on. I rather use all earned money on my nearly 60 parents than to raise some troublesome kids to prepare for my old age. However, I feel that I will disappoint my parents if I don't find a "good husband" or having the opportunity to have grandchildren to carry. When I see most of the posts are about relationship problems, sometimes I envy that their worst problems may only be on relationships. At least, they are not born in the family situation that can't be avoided. I really wish I was born alone, and be able to die alone.

Do you think it's acceptable if I ask my boyfriend to not talk to a specific girl just because I don't get a good vibe from her? I'm okay with him talking to other girls when necessary but just not that specific girl. Is this a reasonable way of thinking??

I have to get this off my chest. 

I've just heard from my friend that you are actually studying in NUS. I am really sorry for any discomfort/bullying I have caused you during your secondary school years and really sorry for running away from the truth and avoiding you after I saw you when we coincidentally transferred to the same school midway. I know halfway you started to ignore my presences also and it got a bit awkward to apologize. 
7 years down the road, honestly I still feel regretful for my actions and my inability to apologize to you, even a casual statement would be fine. But seeing that you transition into the school just fine, I don't know if you are affected by it. Honestly I hope not. And if you are, I need to grow some balls and at least apologize to you for that.

there's this guy who I've known for just over 6 months now. he's the sweetest bad boy I've ever met. he does everything I would want my boyfriend to do: takes care of me when I'm high/drunk, pays for meals, little gentlemanly acts like opening doors, allowing me to hide my face in his shoulder when watching horror movies, always ensures he sends me home after we are out late etc. but he's made it 101% clear he's not interested in me romantically or will ever be. I was initially not attracted to him at all but in recent months I think I've started to fall for him. how do I start to see him as nothing more than a bro again? ): he has had a past reputation for being a player/heartbreaker so I know there is no future for us even if he were remotely interested in me (he is 200% not btw). I want to distance myself from him for a while so that I can sort out my feelings for him but I really enjoy spending time with him. what should I do??? ):
-
 
Hi,  I'm the  OP. I have spoken to him today. I'd really want to thank the commenter who highlighted that I was judging him. I did not realised I have become a judgemental brother. We have closed the case with my dad still in the dark. But thanks to all the advices my family is still in peace. 

HAPPY ENDING! 

Although I don't know if my brother will really stop visiting prostitutes but I did what I can.

Hi , had to post this anonymously cos it's quite a revealing issue. Anyway, would like to say that yes my boyfriend (of 5 years, not sure if the duration would help?) does get an erection when we argue/ talk through issues! I'm not sure if this is normal but it's normal to me as it doesnt affect us or anything. Whenever we talk/argue issues, at some point, I would notice that he is hard. When I asked, he says that he has no idea, just that he feels turned on and that I look cute when I'm angry (I know, that doesnt make sense and this is his word not mine, in case anyone says NPNT). Also, this first happened in our first ever argument/talking through of issues. I dont know what to make of that though. So.. I think it's okay so long as you are both alright with it (:

My boyfriend and I decided yesterday to take a break from our relationship until my finals end. I called for it, because he has become increasingly selfish recently and yesterday was the last straw. He was rude to my mother and acted like a spoilt brat in my house. Honestly though, I don't know what happens when couples "take a break", and for what now seems like such a long period. It feels like being in limbo, not knowing if yesterday was the last time I would ever see or talk to him, or if I would hear from him again in two months. I hope that two months of not communicating with each other does not automatically mean that our relationship is over, but I really don't know.

My family is negative about him now and it would please them greatly if I broke up with him. Maybe I'm being stupid, but I still hope this relationship would work out, because I believe that a person can change if he wants to, and that he is capable of loving another person more than he does himself. Love is a choice, no?

I look at the calendar and cannot help but wonder how things could have spun out of control and into this nightmare so quickly.

To my brethren,

I come to you seeking guidance reassurance in my time of need. First, I should mention that I have been walking the Iron Path for several years now (off and on), but I have recently stepped up my worshipping over the past several months and have subsequently been blessed with noticeable gains.
Earlier this week, I went a date with a lady I met on Raffles Hall. The date started off innocent enough, with us going out to dinner then hanging out at my place afterwards. 

However, not long after we were sitting on the couch, the swolestation began. She simply could not keep her hands off my bis/tris, my pecs, my quads....she clearly felt as if nothing was off limits to her!

While it can be flattering at times to have someone notice and appreciate your swole, I feel that this type of swolestation is simply not acceptable. I also have a swole cardiac muscle....why can't I be appreciated for my swole heart? I also have a first class honours in engineering....why can't I be appreciated for my swole mind and the gains I've made in the field of science?

I have never felt so violated, and I thought I would share this story to make known that we the faithful worshipper of Iron are not to be treated like a piece of meat. One day we are all gonna make it, one day we will have be accepted for more than our bodies.

Wheymen.

Long distance relationships are incredibly tough. At first it doesn't seem so bad, but you can slowly watch your 4 year relationship fracture and unwind.
I'm desperately trying to salvage what's left of this relationship but everything's so much harder with the distance.
I'm still waiting for her to give me an ultimatum....the second she wants to work it out, I'm taking the dirt flight there.

My BF and I have been together for 3 years. We have our fair share of ups and downs. Whenever we argue, my BF gets an erection. I would like to ask all the couples out there, is there is a normal phenomenon?

Hi, guys, did you all have any experience of gals who shows sexual interest on you? I am not sure whether I am correct about that. I have rejected those gals who have boyfriends seducing me no matter how persistent are they as I have high moral values. However, I find myself having sexual needs and I have never initiated sex with those intended to have, how shall I go about doing it since I have 0 affair now and I am evergreen because I tend to reject most gals because I only hope to reserve my best with the most compatible person. After seeing the open culture in NUS, I am wondering shall I still be a man with integrity and despite my sexual needs since no gal would care about this, I felt like I am a dump. Can anyone introduce or guide me to have FWB relationships?

Hi, I have a problem of a severe inferiority complex. I cannot talk to profs, seniors, friends' parents etc without feeling palpitations of my heart jumping out and screaming "kill me now". I stumbled and stutter so bad when talking, I lose my train of thought. if I were in the same position with paper and pen, I would definitely excel.

The more people point it out, the more nervous I get and I stutter even more, or I just become tongue tied. It's really quite bad, and my friends have been noticing it more frequently and it has become more obvious such that I don't speak up in class (terrible class participation).

Any tips? -tonguetiedgirl

Well, I've known this girl for a few years, even before uni. She has been more of a confidante rather than a mere friend. We could share about almost anything with each other. We could go out for meals together, go explore different parts of Singapore together etc but it was always a platonic friendship. Nonetheless, she's always been sweet to me with all her handmade gifts for me on various occasions, the daily goodnights and good mornings etc.

However, I made a mistake - I fell for her. I was in a huge dilemma. Not only was the friendship supposed to be platonic, but also, we could never be together due to our different faiths. It was a double whammy for me. In the end, I confessed to her anyway as I didn't want to hide anything from her, as it has always been between us. We tried to talk things out and to mitigate the issues that arose.

Unfortunately, as the years went by, we've drifted further apart. I've resigned to the fact that things can never go back to the way it was before. As I try to move on, there's somehow a part of me that self-blames for the situation we're in now. Sigh.

Recently, I developed some feelings for a friend (not from NUS). However, he's a super cool stud (atas, cool accent and all) while I'm a really geeky girl whose life essentially revolves around academics and getting a good job. He still finds me cool but I'm secretly afraid that once we get closer he'll find me boring. I'm also not sure if I'll be able to find joy in the kind of social activities that he participates in and mix with his friends in future. How do I become cooler and start finding joy outside of academics?

It's been almost 5 months since we broke up. It felt so surreal when I finally gathered up the courage to tell you that I can't tolerate your bullshit anymore. Life felt so much lighter since then, I felt FREE. 

The first time I felt a missing gap in my life, was during my holiday in Europe a month after the break up. We had so much plans together - to travel the world, to climb mountains, to dive, to kitesurf etc. The subsequent 2 months passed by rather easily because I did not have the time to think of you, with all the camps that I was involved in. My social life was at its peak. I had outings every other day and more importantly, I was actually having fun without you. I thought that was it, that I was officially over you.

Fast forward to today, I still think about you occasionally and I'd feel strangely wistful. I'm not too sure if those feelings were an indication of remnants of my feelings towards you or that it's natural to feel so sad while thinking about an ex. 

I'm not sure why I chose to write this. Guess I just wanted to let off some steam.. while procrastinating.

I have a group of really really awesome and supportive friends, and I'm very grateful for that. Just that sometimes, I feel so out of place... Like I'm so different from them and there's just this distance between us. I know that the problem lies with me, and not them :( I tend to feel awkward easily, and very often, I find it difficult to join in their conversations as I have no idea what to say. It has been quite long since I got to know them but I still don't feel close to them.. What do I do? How can I change myself? :( it's so hard...

I'm strongly contemplating the prospects of a long-distance relationship with somebody. It would be with someone who is quite a stanch Christian and expects to be in a relationship with a Christian too.

While I wouldn't rule out entirely the prospect of going to church regularly and strongly immersing myself in Christian activities (on the contrary, I'm actually still exploring the faith myself), my friends advise me to just not even try, given that we'll be apart so often, and that I shouldn't convert just for a girl. This is also advised based on my bad experiences with Christian ex-girlfriends and a failed LDR, which left me quite broken.

Of course, I appreciate my friends and family (yeah mum and dad!) inputs and looking out for me. But I would like to hear from more people who have similar experiences if possible? Thanks! 

(If you know who I am please don't tag me k :<)

I've been using Tinder for the past year. Recently I realize that it wasn't serious enough. The opposite parties are either bots or people who don't really want a steady relationship. I've just graduated and it is quite difficult to find a partner outside of school. Anyone facing the same problem?

I met this guy at the club. He initiated conversation with me on the dance floor and we were just trying to talk to each other over the music. I liked how we focused on the conversation despite being at the club, where many of the other guys just came up to girls all touchy-feely or with the intention to grind them. He asked for the number at the end of it and we have been texting since. I am afraid of falling for him as I have good feelings towards him at the moment and I think he may ask me out soon. All my friends are telling me how guys at clubs are not looking for relationships, and for a guy to ask for a girl's number at a club is a playboy move or something like that. Should I cut contact with him to prevent this from becoming something that will let me get hurt? Because meeting a guy at a club is just... unconventional? :(

 - Don't be too worried about being a bad kisser. All you need is practice and some confidence.

My boyfriend "drooled" on my chin when we first kissed. (It was his first so he was inexperienced. Also the main reason why I decided to post anonymously instead of replying directly. Not great for the whole world to know that about him.) Now he has improved and I think he's way better at it than me. 

Just relax and be confident. You'll get there someday.

My brother is a SIM degree holder who is unemployed. It's fine if the economy is just bad and he just can't find a job but it's not fine if he's just sitting at home and gaming everyday. But that's not the worst. 

He frequents prostitutes. $130 for a single time and you can bargain to $100. Like what? $100 just to get a pussy?

My mum and I both know about this but none of us dare to tell my strict dad about it. 

Yesterday, he was heading out at night and my dad asked if he's going to meet a girl. He said yes and my dad gave him money stating that he's unemployed. 

I just felt like telling my dad he just paid for my brother's visit to the prostitute. 

Now I'm stuck. Can't believe I have someone at home who's unemployed and frequents prostitutes. I find my brother incredibly dirty and I just feel like spilling it out to my dad... Should I?

 I don't know if you are speaking of me. I know there are a number who helped out in elections in every little way. The cool feeling usually gives way to either a feeling or purpose or people just decide coolness alone isn't worth it.

In any case, if you want a contact for more information... sigh, how to give anonymously arh?

My girlfriend of 7 years just dumped me because I've been feeling kind of down lately and that's not what I'm normally like at all. That's not what you do to someone you claim to love. At least now I know that when things get tough she's not someone I can count on. I love her more than anything but I guess this is it. The plus side? I have rediscovered a burning motivation to do so good she  regrets not being there for me at my worst. - A

This is a post for someone who will never read or know that this is for him. Just need to let this all out.

I have no dating experience, or what people would call evergreen. But I've tried and took the initiative in going after a guy before, and it was a really painful process. To be worrying aimlessly everyday, to have a person constantly on your mind every sleepless nights. My feelings were not reciprocated and I took half a year to let it go. Finally I felt free, I feel happy and emotionally strong. I got my interests back and I got to live life the way I did before I met the guy. Everything was good until I met another guy. Damn it every ounce of confidence vanished the moment I fall into this endless trap again. However independent/emotionally strong a woman is, she will turn foolish in front of love. 

I do not want to try anymore, because I do not want to get the same pain I got back then. It was an unpleasant process I wish I would never have to go through again. I know there are bound to be failures in life and not everything will go the way you like it. But I can't help but to feel weak and timid in front of this. Would everything better if we just stayed as friends and take everything naturally? Or would it be better for me to go for it again. Sometimes I wish I will never have to like anyone.

Overseas student reading NUS whispers here: 
Half of the posts seem to be about guys/girls too afraid to talk to the opposite sex, or wondering whether they're in the friendzone or not, or wondering whether some other guy/girl likes them. What good could this possibly do?

The answer to all your questions is the same: 
Show confidence, take a dive, make conversation, put yourself out there. If you think you can't do it, just try. The more you do it the better you will get. Who do you think they would prefer: a nervous, shy, unconfident person confessing their love behind a computer? Or somebody who is outgoing, risk-taking, funny, upfront and honest?

Against all stereotypes, it seems like sex satisfy me the least of the least. ( I am a guy btw and rather preserve virginity till marriage and see how). It seems like what satisfy me the most is just spending time with my significant other.

Read a few posts here don't understand why people like to think negatively of their friends' comments, especially when those are not their real intentions.

To , They probably said that as a validation for their poor grades. You've got your good CAP, cannot let them feel a bit good about themselves meh? 

To , they probably said that to compliment you indirectly (that you're pretty), especially if it comes from a guy. Can't you just take the comments positively?

Seriously you guys need to stop taking comments so literally and think about why they were even commented. Tsk.

I'm almost getting engaged. It isn't official, there isn't any rings though we have looked at some and he hasn't formally asked for my hand in marriage yet. We plan to do so after i've graduated (year 4 now. woot, last year!).

But i think i'm starting to develop feelings for another guy. I feel terribly guilty. Ive been trying to avoid this other guy but we have mutual friends and a few mutual whatsapp groups too. 

And idk if im being paranoid or overthinking things but i think this other guy might feel the same way. 

Crapppp. 

Am I horrrible??? :( :( :(

For now though imma keep trying to stay away from this other guy because i really think my almost fiance is The One. 

HAIZ.

Dear C,
Not sure what came between us. I keep wondering if you're truly busy as you say or if there's something else keeping you at bay. 
I miss hanging out with you.. i miss the late night texting and reading your longggg whatsapp essays. I miss having someone to talk to about things beyond the mundane. :(
Maybe you've decided to move on, and maybe i'm lost in an imaginary reality that just doesn't exist anymore. If so, although you probably won't see this, i wish you all the best.

I have a problem that's been plaguing me since secondary school: I have trouble picking up hints from guys. God knows how many potential relationships I've missed. My last ex used to tell me I'm utterly clueless.

Now that the loneliness is nagging at my head, I wanna know: what hints exactly am I supposed to be looking for? How do I discern the difference between just being really good friends and something else entirely?

I recently found out that a "friend" (more like acquaintance) of mine has been crashing female friends' houses and planting a spycam in the toilet. I was initially totally completely and absolutely freaked out .. because I've definitely on more than one occasion used a toilet in a house when he was around. Initially, I feel really violated, but after discussing this with some (both male and female) friends I was more like irritated than personally violated. Perhaps because somehow the male friends managed to convince me that I should not subject myself to a position of vulnerability when none should exist in the first place. They say that had they been the "victim", they would be more annoyed or even concerned (for the culprit's mental health) rather than violated. After thinking about it a while I managed to calm myself down somewhat. It's like someone taking upskirt photo of me. I'd want to slap that guy but frankly no real harm done to me (unless I let it) right?

Anyway, after lots of drama, this guy is going to court for his actions. I won't post too much details here (e.g how he got found out, to whom this issue was escalated etc.), but all I can say is, I now feel really bad for him. Sigh, why...

I have a gay friend who told me that there is this particular guy in my group for a particular module is a gay. He is smart and cute, totally of my cup of tea, but he doesn't know I am. Typically, people I like often shut their doors from me. Should I attempt to talk to him about it? Sigh.

I don't understand why most girls don't like guys who are nice. From my experience, it really feels nice talking to them and I always share my problems with them.  I am a straight guy but if I am a girl, I really don't mind dating them.

I've always had a resting bitch face since young. Being quiet and shy didn't help much. My parents and relatives would aways nag about how a "lady" should always smile and talk more. I didn't bother to consciously change until in JC, where I overheard someone saying "Eh, that girl damn scary leh...". I got quite upset and since then, I would always tell myself to smile to others when looking or speaking to them. I also learnt to speak up more often. Not as great as naturally talkative people though. 

In NUS, my crush used to ask me why I always smile stupidly. (I got rejected anyway *cries in a corner*) Yet again recently, someone commented straight in my face that I kept smiling and it was scary. I honestly don't know what kind of expression I should pull off anymore. It's so frustrating figuring out how to express my interest in listening to others without having a resting bitch face or smiling and scaring people away, especially since I am too quiet. I don't even wish to get started on how difficult it is to make friends despite the efforts I've tried... Haiz.

If a girl reply you quickly on text or is kinda comfortable with you does that mean she friend zone you? We kinda laugh a lot together. I mean if she has a crush on me, shouldn't she be nervous around me?

To all the lesbians out there, I need some serious advice.

I am a guy and I never had a lesbian friend. Few months ago, I met this girl and we get along really well and we also talk for many hours. We also discussed about LGBT and I expressed my support for it. But later, I don't know why she started behaving weird towards me. I get a feeling may I said/did something which I should not have done to a lesbian girl. Later, she said , She feels I am flirting with her and she does not wants to be friends with me anymore. I said to her its nothing as such but she would not believe me. I felt bad about it and had a guilt in my heart that may be I said her something which I would say to a normal girl jokingly or something else which I should not have said/done.

Now recently, I met another girl and co incidentally she is also a lesbian. I want to learn from my previous mistake and would like to understand the Do's and Don'ts with a lesbian girl.

Things not to say or do when with her. Any help from Lesbian girls would be highly appreciated.

How do i convince this friend of mine to break her poisonous relationship with her friend? This person has already clearly said to my friend that she will treat her as the second priority but my friend still hold onto the hope of them being best friends again. And it is not helping that this person's parents has asked my friend to continue the friendship...

Things were going well between us...until we had our first kiss. I'm sorry that I'm extremely bad at kissing, but I just don't know how to kiss.

Before you appeared, my ex also rarely kissed me. I can't help it that I really don't know to kiss. 

It hurt me so bad when you told me not to be a bad kisser. It also hurt me when you mentioned my bad kissing more than once. 

Am I destined to die alone because I can't kiss? I know people say it's something that you can learn, but what if I start out extremely bad at kissing? (E.g. If it takes a few months for me to learn 1 + 1 = 2, I'll probably never be able to do calculus.)

Things ended between us and I know that the first turning point was that bad first kiss. My self esteem is crushed and I don't know what to do because I really suck at kissing. And it's not something I can improve on my own. And I don't even know if I can ever be a decent kisser, much less a good kisser. And I know bad kissing is a deal breaker for many people.

I am often referred to as the "gym rat" by my friends. I guess my built isn't that bad. I'm tall, average looking. Academics wise, i am doing pretty well with first class honors. But, i have never been attached all my life. I am not too sure why, but i often get "bro-zoned" by my female friends. Not that i am particular attracted to anyone of my friends, but my guy friends usually ask me "eh, with your looks and body, why no girlfriend! you can afford to even have 2-3 at the same time". I just find it hard to open myself up to others. However recently, in my few trips to UTown, i have been noticing this girl. Probably from FASS with all her Psychology books and notes laid out. She's really cute, tall and pretty. However, she's always with her friends and i am pretty apprehensive to approach her. Seems like she's there pretty often as even the baristas are able to recognize her and her name. The only thing is she is pretty curvy. My friends saw her recently and they are like "why you like this kind" which makes me pretty shaky on my stand now.

I dunno what is going on. I met a girl from tutorial class and I think I'm in love with her. People say that my lower head will feel excited but the feeling is actually on the TOP of my upper head!!!

Hello NUSWhispers community, I didn't really want to post this since the incident happened too long ago, but I fucked up. 2 years ago, my best friend of 10 years approached me for relationship advice. He had suffered from multiple rejections from girls, whereas I was the type who was in the position to reject girls. Naturally, I tried my best to advise him. In short, I told him to grow some balls and go after the girl he wants instead of stalking them everyday online. 

However, that was where I fucked up. Little did I know, that the advice I gave him, led him to harass them in real life. I immediately regret my decision. However, as his best friend, I stood by him and walked him through the entire disciplinary process. 

Fast forward, he is now a wreck, but he's slowly recovering. He has now graduated, and is having difficulties entering into a relationship. 

Did I do the right thing? Should I not have egged him on? I feel bad...

TLDR: Told best friend to grow some balls, friend got rekt.

I'm in my final year and I feel so lost. I have no idea what I'm going to do after graduation. Even now, I am supposed to spend time on my FYP but my thoughts keep getting derailed as I think about my life after uni. I suppose I'm expected to begin my job search some time soon but I have no inkling of what to even apply for.

I have been a student all my life and I'm reasonably good at it. Perhaps I should think about graduate school? But I have doubts about that too. I mean, I can't even focus on my Hons project, and yet I'm considering a Master's dissertation or PhD thesis?? That's not only crazy, but quite irresponsible too. I don't think "I got nothing else to do" is a legit reason for pursuing further studies.

It's sad that I can't even relate to my friends anymore. They are so adult. They've got new prioirities. They are talking BTOs, ROMs and CPF, while I have absolutely no idea/interest about those things. They are happily coupled up and have their futures planned. I, on the other hand, am still stuck in the Lala-land of idealism and fantasy.

Yes, I do consider myself lucky that I haven't faced any financial troubles, and I have had a very comfortable life, relying on my family so far. And that's probably one reason why I never felt a real need to move on and quickly get a job. That's why I feel guilty about writing this. That's also why I chose to write this anonymously instead of talking to actual people. I do realise it's a petty and douchey thing to be "worried" about and I just can't say it to someone face-to-face, no matter how much I want to.

Woah why do we now have girls talking about going bad right after the good guys' rant not too long ago?

Would be efficient if you guys are paired up, but it's a signalling game where you don't know if your partner is a bad guy/girl masquerading as a good one.

The only equilibrium strategy is to not play.

I am so sick of people being/acting surprised when they find out I'm evergreen. And the comments that come after their reaction is just...Urgh! An example, 'WHAT?! You've never had a boyfriend before?! Omg! You look like you have a long list of exes/You look really flirty! '... Huh? You can look like you have a long lists of exes or a flirt? Urm okay... Or another one, 'Omg! So wasted with your looks! You should start dating!' Now this just has to be the worst. What does my looks have to do with having a boyfriend? Just cause you find me attractive does not mean I have to be attached or have a long 'history'. Wanting to be in a relationship is a personal choice. Why can't people just respect that without these unnecessary comments? And character is so much more important than looks. But I guess I shall not get started on that now...

I'm tired of being infatuated over a guy and not focusing on my work etc. Midterms are coming. But boy, I can't stop thinking about you. So do you like me? Why are you so nice to me? Or are you always this gentlemanly to other girls?

I have to get this off my chest.

in year 1, i met this awesome OG in hall. they were really great people and i was glad that they were my first group of friends in hall. one of them was my roomie, and long story cut short our personalities clashed and we both made each other pissed. along the way i got attached, and spent most of my time with my bf, while she hung out with the rest of the OG. the distance between me and my OG grew, and one day my OG wanted to plan an overseas trip together. of course i wanted to go, but then they told me that my roomie was awkward with me, hence it was either i went or she went, and they wanted her to go, so i couldnt go. i was devastated, but accepted it. a while later i broke up with my bf and found out he cheated. and right after this news came another news that my OG wanted to plan another trip, and one of them notified me that they were going, not me. i was not allowed to go. at that time i was really devastated, because i just lost the people that meant the most to me in hall. i decided to leave the og chat without saying a word because i felt so suffocated and restricted. it really affected me. i cried every night and couldnt sleep with the lights off. even with the lights on i only fell asleep from exhaustion from crying. it was near exam period and my grades plummeted because i couldnt concentrate. i even cried because i was afraid that i was going into depression. the only reason that i didnt was because of my ever supportive sister. 

fast forward nearly a year later, i am still recovering, but i am writing this to my (ex)OG to explain why i left. i felt that i was being controlled; i was in the OG but couldnt hang out with yall, its like not being in the OG. i also didnt want yall to feel bad every time yall have to decide between siding her or me, because its difficult. but even though i left the chat doesnt mean i want to cut off all ties with all of you. i still would like yall to talk to me as a friend, just not as an OG. we are all in the same activity in hall, so i hope whenever we meet yall will not ignore me. and im really glad that one of them, W, is still such a damn nice ogl and continues to talk to me whenever we see each other. i hope this continues even when the (ex)roomie comes back from SEP. i have already forgiven her, even though she hasnt forgiven me, but it doesnt matter anymore. shes got attached to a guy in the same OG, and although i still think hes too good for her, i would still like to congratulate yall. last long! A, you're a great guy, and your skills in the sport has really improved. take good care of your gf! W, you're the kindest ogl i know, and words cant say how grateful i am. C, i dont see you around much in hall, but thanks for not ignoring me :) since im no longer in the OG i dont keep up with what yall are doing, but i hope everything is well with yall. 

this is like a closure for me, i hope admin can post this, because i dont know what other avenue to use.

I don't know what to do. I was dumped recently because I told my ex from the start that I don't date for fun and after 9 months while he slowly lost interest, he dumped me cos I wasn't his marriage type. Just 3 days after, I attended an academic event where I happened to catch the eye of some guy. I told him I wasn't ready for any relationship and in general treated him coldly to let him know I have no interest in him but he remained persistent, showering me with lots of emotional support as well as doing sweet things for me. I know I'm still not ready for a new relationship but the guy doesn't mind and wants to wait no matter how I treat him. I'm worried that he is slowly melting my icy  defences and I don't know how to get out of the situation since he said he doesn't mind being friends. He treats me so special, it's difficult to not feel touched. However I don't want to date for fun and frankly I don't feel like I could marry him since my ex was as persistent as him at the start but just gradually lost interest so that scar is still deep. I know he's a different person but I'm just not ready to trust a guy now. How do I just escape the whole situation???

Just needed a place to rant and have never posted anything here before so just thought I'd give it a shot. I'm someone that puts others before myself and have often found myself taking up the role of the 'responsible' one in various groups of friends. In my hall I've been a block head, helped set up various volunteer programs, been active in sports, play a few instruments in a music group and actively contribute in any and all communities I'm apart of. In my major, I also often take up leadership roles in project groups and consider myself a very dependable person. I'm a pretty warm, friendly and funny guy so I always try to brighten the mood in tense situations in various committees and stress-filled conditions. 

I used to think that these values and traits mattered to people. Lately though I've been feeling like shit. I've been seeing some close friends pay more attention to others, or actively just show more care and concern for them. This girl I got pretty close to started pulling away and I don't know, sometimes I feel that I am no one's priority. Given the fact that I'm always going around checking up on how people are doing and encouraging them, I might have given the impression that I'm pretty solid i.e. emotionally stable. Maybe that's why people don't seem to ask or care as much for me. I'm especially hurt because my close friends are aware of the various family problems I have at home. Maybe they don't understand how tough a struggle it is for me. 

I'm trying to be a better person by giving without expecting anything in return. I'm trying to be the person I know I can be. One free of insecurities and someone whom others can rely on. I eventually want to go into social services because helping others is a deep passion and my calling in life. So I extend this to my friends and the people I care about. When I actively ask about people and they open up I realize that these interactions do help them out in some small degree. I even am able to give advice at times given my familiarity with family conflict, relationship issues etc. Sigh I don't even know what I want or why I'm feeling like this. Just wish that given all I've done for others, that there'd be some who are willing to do the same for me. But I know I'll press on because when we help others, we don't do it for praise, recognition or even reciprocation (going against social exchange theory here). So here's a shout out to the under-appreciated out there. The unsung heroes who go about making other people's lives better in their own small way even when no one takes notice or appreciates it. Here's to you guys. May we all find happiness and peace eventually.

I have a crush on this girl in my block, she is quite pretty and capable. Only thing is that she and I don't really see eye to eye in some issues, but it had never been made obvious by me that I disagree. I like her, but I am unsure if I can win her heart with this kind of differences, and I wish she was more accepting towards me overall. Advice anyone? From winning her heart, understanding our different viewpoints and also knowing if she is ready to enter a relationship. Pls guide me ppl

In reply to , I also have a sergeant from BMT I detest, for the same reasons as you. I was tekaned like crazy for no apparent reason other than the fact that I was 'marked'...it wasn't explicitly said but it was pretty obvious. And mind you, I was pretty much a good boy outside. If you gotta give him a punch, well, if the situation calls for it, but I don't suggest you do it, since you're probably in the same course. But really, I guess time has shown me that the best thing is to just let it go. Don't do something you'll regret...just because of the 'revenge'. That's how Anakin was lured to the dark side..I mean, that's just my two cents. I still hate my sergeant but if there are consequences to that revenge I won't do it. Think about it. But don't be a pussy when you actually meet him. lol

I'm a girl in a male dominated school. Not bad looking and pretty likeable. 

But I have been single for a few years now. I don't even have a guy I flirt with! What's wrong with me? 
-
 
Looking through pictures of acquaintances on insta, I just realized that I can never be that kind of girl. The kind of girl who dresses sexily, who's confident about her own body, who's not shy to show off her greatest assets. The kind of girl whose parents are accepting, or even proud of her clothing choices. I'll always be the salient nerd, tucked away in a corner, worrying about everything and everybody, because I'm supposed to be the serious one. I'm too inconsequential to be noticed. I can never be confident or glamorous like those girls who wear bikinis and show off their hot bods and have hundreds of likes on their pictures.

Yep, I'm going to die alone.

To , amidst the waves of criticisms, I want to chime in to say that I think you will be fine. Just pretend to accept your parents' train of thought but know that you are more than what these doctrines dictate. After all I think it's difficult to change how our parents think about these things. Easier to just pretend. Many of my friends with religious families still continue to enjoy fantastic sex lives discretely. Could be more exciting to pretend to be virginal and hide under the radar heh. ;)

About healthy. I think as long as you can protect yourself and know what you are doing you will be fine. The danger of having multiple fwbs is not just physical stds but also the possibility of being numb to the spiritual intimacy that sex could bring. The good thing about it though is that it stops you from being emotionally attached to one person. Being emotionally attached to the fwb is really some masochistic shit you do not wanna be near. 

Lastly, do consider what you want. Are you doing it for the liberation that comes with not abidding by religious doctrines? Are you doing it because you are getting back at your parents? Or are you doing it because it brings true happiness? Because it would really suck if sex becomes a means to an end rather than a glorious end (pun intended) itself. 

Love, 

A once super sexually active and (but still) kinky, long time female masochist.

I'm a senior in NUS, and somehow all my friends are getting married. I bask in their happiness and am genuinely glad they found someone so amazing. But when the wedding banquet invites are sent out, I choke.

How much 红包 to give since I'm still a student and not working? Can I get them something else, like a blender or something?

I'm just so inexperienced with the opposite gender that it's frustrating for me. I admit that I've already come a long way from the past. I was bullied a lot by guys when I was in primary school, and went to an all girls secondary school to avoid the issue rather than confront it. My awkwardness and fear of guys carried on into JC, exacerbated by my own insecurities and lack of confidence in all aspects of myself, looks wise and personality etc etc. Things got better in university after I made a commitment to improve myself, which I did in terms of physical appearance, as well as on the inside as I slowly tried to put myself out there and out of my comfort zone, learning to deal with my issues and gain more maturity. I'm now able to hold conversations with guys and feel more comfortable in their presence vs in the past whereby I'm not even able to handle any eye contact, always stumbling over my words and feeling all self conscious. Still I guess even now I'm more closed off and distant i.e. difficult to approach compared to those cute-looking girls-next -door, and people who don't know my past always assume that I'm someone who must have suitors lining up and a long list of ex lovers to boot. Assumptions are always made, questions regarding the imaginary boyfriend I never had which seems to be deterring guys from even trying for fear of rejection? (Not sure if my hypothesis is true sigh) 'Is your bf picking you up later?' 'Why are you dressed so nice, going on a date?' etc Also, I have no idea how to interpret advances from guys. Does prolonged eye contact mean something in all instances? A meaningful look or just a random glance? It could maybe only be meaningful in my opinion.. Compliments: just said without much thought or hiding certain nuances? It's very confusing, and I'm just tired of repeatedly questioning myself regarding my own interpretations and all the self doubt. I think my strategy now should just be to friend zone all the guys and get to know them better first, because all the second guessing is making my head spin. At the same time, it appears like what I'm looking for in a guy is too tall an order. I'm not into super good looks nor materialistic benefits.. Just a guy who's driven, motivated and at the same maturity and depth as myself. Sometimes I think perhaps it's not only my own issue that's maintaining my evergreen state, maybe it's also the lack of suitable guys around me. All in all, things are just looking gloomy. I guess for the rest of my time in uni, I'd be better off devoting more energy investing in myself than in looking for a potential someone who might not even exist in NUS. At least for the former, I'm certain to get 100% returns in benefit.

Reply to  
1.  I will dress up nicely if I know I will see this guy on that day
2. I can't stop smiling whenever I look at him
3. I try to sit nearer to him in lecture, or at least somewhere I can see him
4. I asked him a lot questions about himself, because I want to know him more.
5. I hope he can msg me, with whatever reasons, just msg me.

These are still not obvious because I'm still too shy to make it so obvious. But I think you have someone in mind when you asked this question, because you may wish that girl may have dropped you some hints. There are still shy girls like me, so if you really like her, please show her some hints also? or at least, msg her, with whatever reasons, just msg her.

In lieu of the spate of lonely posts, I'd like to open up invitation to a chat group for similar people to  talk to each other. Activity isn't reallly hotcakes but hey it's a mutual effort! Comment below to be added ;)

I've been a victim of bullying myself in the distant past. It is disheartening to know how nasty and vindictive people can be. But you know what? I realised I was an annoying twat. It didn't justify the bullying, but it was the cause of it. I worked hard to change myself, and you wouldn't guess today that I used to be the class outcast. I think some of the haters have gone overboard, but at the same time, if everyone is all hating on me, I would take a long hard look at what I've been posting and understand why nobody seems to like me. I say this without malice: Nobody likes an arrogant egomaniac.

I'm feeling lovelorn. It has been many semesters since I last saw you. I've tried giving myself a chance with others, but they're not even half as good as you. Even when I'm with another, I try to fantasize that it's you, but I know it's a lie. I don't know what I've done to deserve this.

Dear NUS Whisperers, I require your assistance. No, I humbly beseech you to help me. If you see a milo van on campus, can you kindly post the location as soon as possible? Thank you so much. I will be so grateful.

To 
Not sure why you are so interested in being that kind of girl. Sure I suspect there are many guys who will want girls who show off their bodies in bikinis, dress sexily and are popular. 
However personally I do not want to be like that and I'm sure there are girls who feel the same way too. It could attract all kinds of wrong attention from guys and I do not want to be seen as a sex symbol. I am not willing to do that not because I'm insecure but I prefer to be more conservative. If guys do not like that I don't care.
I rarely dress provocatively and well I think I'm reasonably pretty enough and I get compliments once in a while so its not like I get lots of attention but that is fine with me.
I had image issues last time and I'm just happy to be comfortable in my own skin now. Maybe you should too and hopefully there will be guys who will notice your inner confidence and like you for it. Guys notice a lot of other things besides hot bods!

I am a girl who has recently started to get intimate with my boyfriend. He is sexually experienced while I am not so. The first time we did it, it felt pleasurable but for some reason I could not cum. Eventually he had to resort to other ways to make me cum. From past experience, I can hardly attain orgasm from penetration alone. This always frustrates both parties because we can't enjoy sex together. I don't think it is a problem of size cos he is relatively built, nor the technique (we probably tried every technique in the book). Would appreciate some genuine advice on how to overcome this problem:/

For the past months I have been tolerating you. You are very annoying but I know that's your nature. Lately,  you are getting more irritating, tensions are raising between us. I have enough of you. You are ruining my hall life. You have stayed here longer than me doesn't mean that you can do whatever you like. Why can't you leave me alone? For so many times, I wake up in the middle of night because my brain cannot ignore what you have done to me. If you want war, let there be war. I swear that every time I find you and your friends having uninvited visits to my room, I will make sure I kill you, all of you! Bloody mosquitoes!

Can any girls reveal what they usually do when they like a guy and vice versa? There are dumb people like me that could not identify subtle hints and needs help. I may have missed out many chances along the way TT

Hi all

At first, i thought Nuswhispers was some environment club as the word 'everGREEN' keep appearing.

Anyway, for those whisperers who are sad/depressed/lonely/backside itchy or many more, always remember this, there's 1 person who will always love you.

And that's me. 

Have a fruitful Sunday!

love you all muack

To all people discontented with their friendships, let me share with you mine.
There were 4 of us. 
1 is a gambling addict and is always complaining why his girlfriend doesn't give him sex or perform any sexual acts with him. On his birthday, she secretly invited all of us for a surprise party and even worked part-time to buy him a ps4. And she's an awesome cook. (I miss her food) Then he dumped her because she wasn't willing to have sex with him. 

Another one is a vulgar ass who treats his girlfriend like shit. "Aiyo... i saw every part of your body already, what's left to hide?" 
"I'm just gonna take my time and enjoy every part of your body in my room later." Right in front of us (clique). I feel embarrassed enough already, can't imagine how did his girlfriend felt. She is a very humble and hardworking person as circumstances dictate, she met this jerk at her part-time job and is very impressionable. During the last few weeks of our friendship, he shared with me that he's planning to cheat on her by wooing another lady, tossing his gf away like a piece of trash.

The last one is a controlling whiny self-entitled bitch who wants every gatherings, meals, orders to go her way. And she disrespect every other opinions and is always condescending towards others.

I'm glad I am done with these toxic people. I don't even like them that much. At the same time, they should be happy that I did all of them a favour; they got rid of one nonchalant acquaintance who seriously doesn't care about them any longer.

I made a pact with my sibling not to give each other birthday presents (not that she always remembers my birthday on time anyway) some 2 years ago, just a wish will do as I don't want to give sterile cash/voucher, and neither do I know what's really meaningful to get for her after she got married and moved out, and also I want to reduce consumerism (do you really need one more fortune cat?).

Eons ago, I sort of confessed to someone and self-friendzoned, or rather, self-strangerzoned. And I've been sending her a birthday present ever since and I don't know when to stop. I mean friends can still send each other presents right? But I feel that I can't really move on if I keep doing so.

So can I stop? I promised her that I will help her should she need it, and I intend to keep it. I don't want to hurt her one bit. I hope she finds her happiness and get married soon.
-
 
It is quite amazing (yet sad) to see how much effort people put in to hate a person. Just let it go. If you don't like someone, I think you're mature enough to just not associate yourself with him/her and just move away. Why dedicate so much of your time to a person you don't like? 
-
 
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - I wish I could erase myself from your memory. I hate being a burden to you. Happy and thankful one second, but filled with despair and hopelessness the next. 

I don't know who I am. How can you be okay sticking by someone who doesn't know who she is? My identity is fragmented. I feel like I've spent my entire life with a dissociative identity disorder. I'm so messed up that I'm not sure I could ever be whole again. 

I'm sorry I asked you to be my friend. It's my fault for getting you into this mess. :'( Please, I'm begging you to think through this. Is this really what you want till death do us part? I cannot bear to see you tear up anymore. I can suffer alone, but it pains me to see you hurt by my pathetic state. Don't give me your answer until you've done a proper analysis of the situation.

Hi, need some advice here. I have a younger brother who is in secondary school now. He used to be nice and talkative, but recently he changed a lot ever since entering his new school. He has tons of homework and enrichment classes, so he spends all his time doing them. I am suspecting that he is super stressed out due to his peers who are all super smart(he is studying in one of the top schools). My parents encourage him to manage his workload well but he still signs up for extra classes and competitions on his own without telling us beforehand. Then when he has too much work, he vents his anger on us. Recently, he has gotten even worse as he even threw his temper at my mum many times, and he had never done that before. He shouts at us the moment we step into his room and when we offer help, he throws his temper at us. It has gotten so bad that my dad has given up on him and my mum secretly consults our family doctor for anxiety medicine and recommended psychologists for him. When he gets desperate, he will allow himself to ask me for help, but when I try to teach him, he doesn't listen to a single word I say and refuses to accept my method. When my parents force him to go for a family lunch with nice food to relax, he ruins the mood by not responding to our conversations and only focusing on asking us when we would go home.

I am really worried. Is my brother just going through a rebellious phase? Or is he super stressed out because of the stiff competition in school? Are these signs of depression or something? What can my family do to help?

With nuswhispers so entertaining, it looks like I really do not need any close friends in uni. To be honest, I feel like I am spending more time scrolling through nuswhispers than talking to the people around me.

Hi OP of ,I am OP of . 
I totally agree with you that friendships are very fragile. A long time ago, I feel that compared to b/g relationships, friendships last eternally even though there is no commitment in friendships. After the emotionally traumatic event that had happened to me, I am more reserved towards believing both friendships and love related relationship. It will take a lot of courage for me to trust and open up totally to another person again.
I understand your pain, and not being able to ask the other person why he is treating you this way. For me, even though the event happened one year ago, I am still in pain whenever I think of it. And till today, I still dont know why he downgraded me. However, I have learnt to seek emotional support from other friends and upgrade them. And I hope you can too.
Take care okay? We have to both jia you, let go, move on and start believing in close/best friendships again. 
Somehow, I feel like knowing you better, since we had similar painful experiences but I dont want to reveal my identity.........

What do guys (and girls) think of girls who shave off their hair completely? I am a very self-conscious girl with thin hair, and I am worried about how my classmates, friends and other people will judge me if I were to do that. One thing I know for sure is that most guys who only go for girls with long hair will no longer pay attention to me. But that's not my main concern. Imagine how many times you have to repeat the reason for your decision to shave. I want to go around bald (probably with a cap for the first month) but I think in this conservative country, I might need to put on a wig to avoid the unnecessary stares. There are a lot of girls with really thick, long and smooth hair and at times, I can't help but wonder why is life being so unfair to me.
-
 
Let's say a guy likes a girl but the girl only treat the guy as a friend. Is it possible that the guy chases so hard that the girl falls for him? It might not necessarily be love at first sight but feelings can change over time can't it? Or should the guy just give up?

When I enlisted into National Service 6 years ago, I realised that you are gradually leaving me as I am spending most of my time serving the nation. 
When I  was about to ORD, you left me without saying anything. 
When I started school in NUS and got myself a girlfriend. You started to show signs that you want to come back to me. 
After 2 years of being in a relationship with my girlfriend, you have finally come back to me. My fat tummy.

I hope you are my ex and even if you aren't, it is good that you finally understood everything that had transpired and the good times you had . Life will be full of regrets. Try texting him even if he said he blocked you, you may be in for a surprise.

:) Cheers

Since someone has started the ball rolling about friendship problems, I will share mine too.

I am a girl and I met a really likeminded guy friend last semester. We hit it off right away and had alot of things in common. I would like to emphasize that we do not have any forms of romantic attachment for one another. Everything is purely platonic, like bros.

Lately, he has found a girlfriend and his girlfriend turns out to be one of my friends. I felt really happy for both of them because they look really sweet together!

BUT whenever I hang out with that guy friend, his girlfriend would join along and honestly, I felt like a lightbulb. I'm not sure if I am thinking too much or what, but everytime when we talked about inside jokes or things that his girlfriend doesn't know, his girlfriend would toss a distasteful glance at us. I felt really uncomfortable about it but I didn't want to tell my friend about it because it would appear as though I'm trying to sow discord between them.

As times go by, his girlfriend wouldn't even bother to conceal her discontentment. There was one occassion when my friend and I started stalking each other's Facebook, in hopes of finding unglam photos of one another so that we can "shame" each other with silly captions. As I was scrolling through my friend's photo album, his girlfriend turned and whispered to me, "Can you stop stalking him please?" It was not a weak plea, but a firm order despite the softness of her voice.

After that, I made a decision to break off all ties with my friend. It was a painful decision to make because it wasn't easy to meet a friend that understands me well. That friend seemed to have noticed that I've started to isolate myself from his life. So he started texting me and tried hard to talk to me to revive our friendship. It bugged me alot and I told him the reason behind my cold treatment towards him. I felt really bad because it's like I'm badmouthing about his girlfriend. He said that he understands where I'm coming from but he don't see it as a problem because he believed that his girlfriend wouldn't mind us hanging out together.

Agh. So what now? Am I supposed to hang out with him privately or to hang out with him and his girlfriend or to just cut off all ties?

Id like some legit advice. I live with one of my roommates for quite abit and i notice that he likes to use girls to his liking. he would sleep with them when he feels like it and still he would also make them cook meals for him, which they would make and even deliver it straight to him. I try my best not to poke into what he is doing but ive heard him call them words like slut and prostitute and at times ive even seen some of them girls run off crying but they still come back to him(its sad and upsetting cos its 2 to 4 different girls, not just one.) Meanwhile, me being an evergreen for 25 years(aka my whole life) don't do this kind of thing and even when i make a move i still get rejected. It is very tempting to become like my roommate as he is getting so much(foood!), and i feel that i also have nothing to lose, should I do so or nah?
-
 
I wish I could send this to my ex :'(

I miss you. I miss how things were so easy with you, how I could fall into your embrace at the end of the day and just let all my worries fall away. I could always depend on you to be there to welcome be back home and you accepted me and all my flaws. I took you for granted, I'm so, so sorry. I still love you.

I'm sorry.

Hi  i can relate to you so much!! I'm also so sick and tired of my life. Sometimes i just wanna disappear from the world, but i know i shouldnt. I wish i had the money to go somewhere and start afresh too. School, friends, family, everything is taking a toll on me. Idk how long more i can hold on. I also know that there are many others who are probably worst off than me, but sometimes i just wish there was a certain someone that could totally understand how i feel. But nowadays, i cant even be bothered to explain anymore. 

Just know that you're not alone. Let's just hope for our lives to slowly get better. Jiayou, to both of us.

In light of the many love related posts, I shall break the trend and post a friendship related post here hahas (I hope this will be posted.) I am not he very high or outgoing kind and have a smaller circle of friends whom I really treasure. 
Last week, one of my friends whom I see as my close friend returned from overseas. When I told him that he can always ask me out when he is free so that we can catch up more, he seems surprised and asked me why would I do that, as he is just a friend (I can't really remember what he said but it is along the line of him being shocked that I am actually willing to take time out to chat with him if he asked me to do so). I am really disappointed and sad as it seems that he doesn't see me as a close friend but a 'mere' friend. As a friend, of course I will meet him. Furthermore, when he returned overseas, he did not even tell me about it, and I have to learn about it from his social media platform. I really don't know if I should continue to value this friendship or not. We used to spend a lot of time in school together, but now, I am really suspicious of who or what is important to him. I may sound childish here, but there are a lot of 'hints' that show that I may be not as important to him, shall not reveal it here though, lest I reveal myself. 
As I read the love related posts here, I wonder, is friendship or love more fragile? How do you know when to stop treasuring someone as a close friend?

Sometimes I fantasise about being the female lead in a drama and having my prince charming shower me with love and attention. Then we will go on dates and do some lovey dovey stuff together. Then his mother will find out and try to break us up. But our strong love and determination will overcome all odds until we can finally be together. Finally, as he swoops in for the kiss, there will be a distinct keyboard typing sound in the background... and my prince charming magically transforms into my assignment. I glance around the library, sigh, and wished I am not evergreen before continuing my work.

Hi guys, need some advice. 

Background : So i have been hanging out with this girl whom i have known for close to a year. We have hung out a couple of times in the past, we talk quite often for rather long periods. Recently we have started to hang out more often, usually for dinner and movie. 

+ - Analysis

+ She proactively asks to hang out, not often though.
+ She maintains conversation 
+ She agrees to hang out most of the time if i ask her
+ She tells me about her life

- She takes long to reply messages
- She rarely initiates conversations
- She asks her friends along sometimes
-
 
I'm not sure if anyone can relate to me but I'm really tired of my life. Although I know that I am very blessed as compared to many others, I just want to run away from everything here and start afresh in a place where no one knows me. Sorry for this negativity but I just need an outlet. 
-
 
if a girl were to ask a guy out to lunch one day, would he immediately take it that she's interested in him? i wanna ask somebody out to lunch just to get to know him as a friend, but i'm afraid he'll get the wrong idea and get scared off /: and, no plot twists, i am a girl!

To  My boyfriend and I have sex all the time. We rarely make love. Sometimes it is the sex that is boring, sometimes it is the making love that is mundane. I don't think it's necessarily making love that's boring. Some days one of us is just off. But we make an effort to try new things all the time. And normally when we make love, it is because he is the one who suggests taking it slow. So I kind of agree that having sex is more fun.

Hi OP of  I'm a guy in the exact same position as you. Perhaps we can talk about this? You can contact me anonymously on kik. Id: nusguy   ; )

再靠近一点点　就让你牵手　再勇敢一点点　我就跟你走
你还等什么　时间已经不多　再下去　只好只做朋友
再向前一点点　我就会点头　再冲动一点点　我就不闪躲
不过三个字　别犹豫这么久　只要你说出口　你就能拥有我

我们心里面　明明都有感觉　为什么不敢面对

End of the story: Yes, we are just friends now.

Sometimes I really feel very fake. It's not that I purposely put up a front in front of everybody but I realized I behave differently around different people and at the end of the day, no matter who it is, I end up feeling very drain and tired, even with my family. 
Honestly speaking, when I sit down and question myself about my own personality and behaviors, I have no idea who I am. Being scared of conflicts I am very used putting on different "faces" to please those around me and now I can't even find my own "face". 
I don't dare to commit to anyone for fear that the person who is liked is just another "face" of mine. 

Is this just a phase, as this has been going on for several years already. Please tell me I am not the only one like this.

Ever since I came to university I found that it was easier for me to have purely platonic friendships with the opposite gender. When I was in secondary school, I had a few close guy friends and I heard rumours circulating that I was a flirt. When I was in JC, I interacted very comfortably with some guys (but we weren't even close), and a girl that liked him ended up hating me pretty strongly. I even saw a message of her complaining on a group I wasn't in of how I was laughing when in a conversation with him. Seriously?? I got so annoyed then.
-
 
Last time, actually I still do, I fall for boys who are more capable, and smarter than me. They serve as a motivation for me to improve myself so that I can 'matched up' with them. But now, I am with this boy who does not like to study. I fear that one day, I will fall for another guy who is better than him. 
-
 
To  Hi OP, I usually don't comment about issues here but seeing the comments just made me feel really appalled at what some of the guys responded. Sorry guys but just because OP got upset at what she saw doesn't mean that:
1. Guys are more controlled by their smaller heads (please give guys more credit as rational human beings - they are not cavemen)
2. OP never satisfy him enough? She's not just someone for his pleasure 
3. Males are not meant to be monogamous. I think it's quite an insult to say that about men after generations of evolution dontchathink?
4. OP is crazy and abusive. Granted she reacted badly and do need to apologize for using violence, it does not in any way suggest that she's crazy and abusive. 

To OP:
I can understand where you're coming from and why you're upset. it is perfectly normal for guys to masturbate (just not to pictures of female friends) so you should talk it out with him what it is that upsets you. 
-
 
How do you remain friends with a guy that confessed to you?
-
 
Never had a boyfriend. Didn't plan to have any in the near future. But recently I realised that a lot of my friends are actually attached. Seriously, we talk about studies all day until I would never guess that they have time to date someone. Heck, I don't even know the names of their boyfriend/girlfriend unless I stalk them on facebook. Now, I kinda wish I had a boyfriend, so that I can say something other else "oh, thats nice" when my friends talk about their other half.

我寂寞寂寞就好
这时候谁都别来安慰 拥抱
就让我一个人去痛到受不了 想到快疯掉
死不了就还好

我寂寞寂寞就好
你真的不用来我回忆里微笑
我就不相信我会笨到忘不了 赖着不放掉
人本来就寂寞的 借来的都该还掉
我总会把你戒掉

So guys, I need advice. I met this guy at some social function.During the course of our conversation, we realized that we had loads in common. He asked me for my number which I gave. Somehow or other, we started texting each other late into night though most of the conversations were initiated by him. We have gone out a few times now (just 2 of us) and I must say he has been very gentlemanly (e.g. paying for our food and always willing to go to places that I want). I'm not too sure how he feels about me but I only treat him as a friend. Am I reading too much into his actions or have I unwillingly misled him into thinking I like him?
-
 
There is this male friend of mine who enjoys asking other attached girls about their sex lives. I was one of them and he would probe about the things that my boyfriend has done to me or vice versa. I guess we are somewhat close but maybe I am close minded but shouldn't there be some personal boundary. Unless maybe if I had offered the information it would seem more appropriate? What's worse is that he has a girlfriend and I do not know how she would feel about this if she knows.
-
 
Hello y'all, I'm the OP of . I posted a confession in reply to all your lovely and friendly comments but was sadly rejected :( 

Anyway, I just wanted to say that sadly I have no balls (literally and figuratively) to reply all of you and would like to remain anonymous, but I guess y'all can try to spot tall girls in school and wonder if it's me. Good luck ;) 
-
 
I'm a tomboy and it's very obvious that I am one. Some of my acquaintances are asking me personal questions like if I am into girls or guys. I mean, I can say I am mostly into girls but I have not come out yet so I repeatedly answered that I like guys. 

However, I am getting closer to this girl and I think I'm falling for her. She's one of the one that knows that "I like guys". How do I approach this? I definitely don't wanna lose her as a friend but I don't know where she stand with having a lesbian friend? Or maybe her sexuality? Hahaha. 

I don't know man. 
Any advice for me?

It has been two years since we last met and I still can't shake you off my head. I tried to cut all forms of communication with you - fb, whatsapp, sms, and it was all because I want to get over you, but I couldn't. We used to go out together so frequently, and we helped each other with school work and outside work after we've graduated. It was until I handed you a self-made gift and you texted me back saying "actually I liked the way things were right now" did I realise (or rather, deduce) you only treat me as a good friend and nothing else. Our text conversations started to get less frequent since that day. It seemed like you were trying to distant yourself from me. And slowly after, I received no replies from you anymore. Months later I asked if we should meet for lunch and you said you will contact me again, but you never did. Till now, I am still very upset. I am upset not by how you treated me back then, but how I did not have the courage to confess in a straightforward manner. Even if you've said no, at least I have a definite answer, at least there is a conclusion. But now, there isn't.

I am from FASS and i must say I'm pretty well known for who i am and what i do. I know many people have good impression of me. However, I've done bad things that no one ever know. Except for the victim herself. I'm taking this chance to apologise to her and those who were affected...

You always sit to my right during lectures and I love the way you always place your left elbow on my desk arm. Sometimes your arm would touch mine and that might be the only reason I am still attending lectures with such an unbearable lecturer. That, and perhaps your smile.

It's been my guilty pleasure to stalk this particular fellow for a while now. I would actually feel sorry for him if he weren't so full of it. He has a massive-ass ego,  and seems embittered from having been kicked from his PhD programme. Please, first class honours doesn't mean you'll make it in the real world, humility and social skills will get you a lot further in life. Going by his behaviour on tinder though, it doesn't seem like he knows this. I have (until now) resisted the temptation to take snarky potshots at him. Not because I feel I should be nice to him, but because I have found the best way to deal with attention seekers is to ignore them. Nothing will frustrate them more. Don't comment, don't argue with them. Whoops, i just disregarded my own advice. Ok end rant. 
-
 
Nah. You know what's loneliness? When your friends talk about plans that you're not invited to in front of you. 

When they all go "ok see you there" and don't jio. That's loneliness. That's how you can be alone in an ocean of people.  
-
 
Am I friend zoned by my female friend when she started opening to me like how she feels etc etc...I only known her less than a month. We did went out alone for dinner before and I can feel that she is trying to spend more time with me by joining activities that I do. Although that might be my wishful thinking...
-
 
I used to look very tomboy even in JC but since I came to NUS I started to dress in a more girly way, with long hair now plus I started wearing longer skirts. Actually I am mostly curious lah, just trying a different look.

I have several close guy friends who I honestly think of as bros, and I realised a problem :/ was hoping yall can advice me....

I felt like ever since I became more girly, I have experienced more awkward moments with these guy friends, one of my close female friends say it's coz maybe now they are more conscious of the fact that I'm a girl and maybe they are confused about how they feel about me. 

Actually, I worry that they will think I'm leading them on, coz I really see them as bros. I don't like player types coz they have hurt some of my friends before, and I don't want to hurt my guy friends accidentally, what should I do? Any suggestions?

haha with all the stories about sex.. I just wanted to ask all the sexually active girls out there - is sex really that amazing? Does casual sex and sex with your boyfriend feel any different emotionally & physically? Is it really possible to separate emotions from sex, and just treat sex like playing tennis?

I've always had a high sex drive (I masturbate almost daily) and I've been tempted many times to fuck, but I've always stopped myself from doing so. I don't subscribe to sex after marriage only, but I've always believed that sex should be something that you do with someone you love, and I haven't been lucky enough to find that yet.. So for now I'll be patient. 

I know no one will actually reply in the comments, but please leave a confession anonymously, i'm really curious!  
-
 
I'm on exchange now, and I just got to know this guy. He seems so perfect--the more I see him, the more I like him. 

I'm so happy that I get to see him almost everyday although we're majoring in different stuff. But it'll never be. I've been 'sibling'-zoned and I'll never ever want to wreck anyone's BGR. 
And we won't be seeing each other as often when we head back to SG. That makes me sad. 
-
 
I made a friend and fell for her, unaware that she is attached. Her boyfriend is in my faculty and she's occasionally here. Many times I take the longer route in my faculty just to avoid her. 

It doesn't help that without putting in effort, I tend to associate words, phrases, habits, idiosyncrasies, objects, tunes,  songs, videos and so on with the person(s) who introduced or made an impression of it on me. Now so many more things are associated with her.
-
 
i'm really curious to read the posts about Herbert whispers had to reject.
-
 
Anyone else in the same situation? Year 4 already and still evergreen :( Most people would be attached by now so it's even harder to find someone :( 
-
 
I think guys who don't masturbate at all is indeed a very rare gem.
-
 
I'm a socially awkward guy, and I read a lot out of required readings. I am able to articulate my words coherently most of the time. But when I'm conscious of the attention on me, I stumble on myself. Those very words that empowered me. 

Reading became a joy on the premise of pain. I wanted to avoid feeling any emotions after falling prey to the sexual over-perception bias many years back. I resolve to distance myself from females I would find myself likely to be attracted to, hoping to prevent any seed from taking roots. But recently, it appears that I'm constantly reminded of that void in my heart which was dug out.

Somehow or another, there would be occasions where personal interactions with those that I'm trying to avoid become inevitable. Cases in point, after group gatherings are dismissed, one-on-one conversations on separate occasions happened this week.

I'm lost. At a lost of what to do. Lost in my thoughts. 
Help?

It's so hard going to school sometimes. I don't know if it's a lack of confidence or what, but I just want to avoid seeing people from my previous schools/acquaintances. I know it's bad, but I tend to pretend not see them. I always feel awkward and would try to avoid taking the same route. I even missed a bus once simply cos I don't want to be on the same bus with them. This actually made school life tougher for me on top of all the assignments and stuff. 
How I wish I could open up a little more. But then again, being alone is so much better sometimes.

From a scale of 1 to Hitler, how bad is it to casually ask an attached girl to hang out with you? (I am a guy btw)
-
 
I really like this girl. But she has been attached for 4 years. 

Should I make a move and chase her because she is not married yet? or just back off and not create any drama?

Hi, I have been hurt pretty badly in my previous relationships and I find it very difficult to trust and devote myself completely to someone else again. I'm currently in a relationship but I question it everyday. I find myself unable to completely trust my partner even though he has done nothing to jeopardise the relationship. I constantly check his phone, and he allows me to, but I can't shake the feeling that he is cheating on me whenever we're not together. A part of me knows he isn't but I just cannot help myself but think what if he is or he did. I get really paranoid whenever he whatsapps girls individually to talk because I am afraid that he would leave me if he finds another girl more interesting or fun than I am. I know its not his fault and that I am projecting my own insecurities onto him but I just cannot help it. Any tips or advices? :(((

To the mixed asian guy from New York in two of my business modules. I think I like you, but I'm too shy to approach...not sure if these feeling are shared, but I'd love to get to know you :)

so i met this particular guy through a mod this sem. after some interaction with him, i realised he has a nice personality. also, i didn't think he was cute at first. but now i'm finding him quite cute heh, appearance- and actions-wise. and i feel this sense of curiosity, like i wanna get to know him more! i don't know if i actually might like this guy, or if i'm just having a crush ! does anyone out there have anything to say that'll help me achieve some clarity :D thanks 
-
 
I had sex with my boyfriend yesterday. It was in the spur of the moment and I really felt guilty about it when I faced my parents at home. i know pre-marital sex is considered a sin for most people.  B..but I am still gonna do it again cos I loved the way we did it last night. Screw societal norms and mentality...

to  how much eye contact is optimal? I don't have anything going on on my phone most of the time so when I'm walking or sitting around I'm always looking around. Sometimes our (me and another girl or guy) eyes meet and I don't know what to do next. Sometimes I quickly look away hoping I was swift enough to not have been caught. Other times I just keep looking in that direction, or maintaining eye contact if I'm feeling particularly brave. Now that I'm in my final year and I'm still single, plus have never been anyone's eye candy, I'm of the opinion that I'm not an attractive person. So I hereby apologise to anyone who has been creeped out by my eye contact. I probably thought you looked pretty/cute or handsome/well-built :)

It's my third semester in NUS and there is something I have been wanting to get off my chest. I am doing quite okay with a CAP of 3.9+ but hoping to get to second upper by end of this semester. 

The main reason I am constantly held back in performing well in modules is that I am constantly thinking of girls I see during lectures for my UEMs/SS mods and going to stalk them on facebook or other social media on my phone. Hence most of the time I miss the crucial information that the lecturer is talking about. In fact, I continue to fantasize about having imaginary relationships with some of them long after I go home.

Usually it's right before I go to sleep that I feel it's wrong and I realise it's nothing more than lust and infatuation. But the very next time of my UEM or SS lecture, the urge to stalk the same attractive girls is back and I continue to daydream about them. It's just strong hormones that drive my temptation like a immature teenage boy and continue to distract me from focusing. Any suggestions on how to curb my desire and temptation during lectures?
-
 
Project Advice: Avoid working with female especially they are very popular. You will pick up all the work while they relax and act cute only. You must draw clear boundary who do what. Do a backup of what they are supposed to be doing also. Females are unreliable. Most they only make use of u only.

If you need to work with females, work with those who are less girly type.

Today I chanced upon my ex at Utown who left me for his current girlfriend whom he met at an orientation camp. Suay, I was alone and awkward, just wanna hide and die. They were lovey dovey and all sighs 
-
 
Having people to eat with or sit with during lectures is overrated. These are usually people whom you will not end up meeting outside of class.

Friends do not need to stick to each other all the time. Sometimes our schedules just don't match.

It's perfectly fine to eat alone or sit alone in lectures. I do that all the time, and I still have friends. You might feel lonely at first but trust me you'll love the freedom eventually.
-
 
I told my family today that I sometimes eat alone in sch. I most of the time sit alone in lecture. I always chiong from here to there in sch. And they think I'm a loner. And it is a problem.

I tried to make friends. Before I started sch, I joined camps. I made friends. But it turned out that we don't click. I think they see me as a weirdo. I'm just not the rah rah everything laugh and hyper type. I like to get things done efficiently. I like to chiong to places so that I'm not late. I like to faster finish faster go home where I can finally slow down. But somehow it didn't work out my way. Now it's too late to reconnect. 

Throughout my schooling years, I've learnt that making friends is a sensitive thing. You can be yourself sometimes but you have to gauge. For me, I learnt to be subtle, observe and decide whether I can be myself. I'm careful about how I behave in front of them. I'm cautious about how I'm presented to them and what I say. And this process is really tiring. 

Sometimes I feel that it's better to be alone than with ppl. But society and my family think I have a problem. 
-
 
I'm 21. A guy here. I have lost my sex drive for very long - I don't fantasise anybody, guy or girl. Although I do masturbate sometimes. It has been now for more than one year already. Is this normal or should I go for a doctor?
-
 
How does someone get almost an almost-ex? 
We ended off on a high note, where we decided it was for the better for both of us since she is already working while I just started my studies in NUS. 
Sigh, everything seemed so right yet so wrong. 
-
 
I am chatting with a girl and I have helped her incredibly in her assignments as her work is part of my hobby and passion.  She is getting an impression I m being too nice to her. I just want to be friends with her so that I have someone to talk to.

I am a foreigner and I spend a lot of my time in my room, barely talking to anyone with almost zero friends. Last sem, I also spent one whole week not talking to anyone, barely speaking few words at canteen to let the food stall uncle/aunty know what I want coz der was no one to talk to. Then I would also cook so that I can save money. Sometimes I get surprised when I listen to my own voice coz it makes me realize I am still alive. 

My question is, what will the girl think If I tell her that I don't have anyone to talk to with almost zero friends?
What would girls in general think of a boy who says like this?
Or am I speaking just to myself in a virtual room as well ?
-
 
A bit of relationship advice here: How do I approach this korean girl on exchange? I find her to be very cute and attractive and want to see if we could go out for a date sometime.
I am not really sure which course she is in but I saw her with a small clique around techno. Considering the fact that this will be my first time asking a girl out, what steps should I take?
-
 
I'm a WhatsApp user and like it commonly is, I belong to several group chats. What irks me is how sometimes new groups are created to exclude certain people, and said group chats are used to talk behind their backs. I've tried sticking up for the poor person, and then lurked because of negative responses. I'm afraid to leave the group chat as I fear that that might lead to me being excluded and bitched about. Sigh.

Are some girls (mostly western) open to one night stands? I would like to know them...#Desperate #DunWannaBeAVirginNoMore

So far none of my crush had touched my heart. The crush that I had previously were just on the spur of the moment. Never mind that I have not dated before, I know the girl whom I can love her from my heart is out there somewhere ( and vice versa). I know one day we will cross each other's path. I am willing to wait but please don't make me wait so long cause life is really unpredictable.
-
 
Not sure if anyone would share the same situation as me. So far, I have yet to make any friends in my major and I am in year 2 now. I did not go for any orientation camps also. Sometimes I feel lonely when sitting alone for lectures and tutorials. So what should I do?
-
 
It really sucks when I see someone confessing to my crush on this type of platform. What is worse is that people tag him to alert him and he liked the page. 

Even though it is unlikely that anything is going to happen in the end between them since it is totally anonymous but still I cant stop feeling threatened by this. 

Yes, I know you guys are probably going to start telling me that what I am doing is the same and why don't I just confess in real life. 
-
 
Just asking, how do people make friends when you don't go for orientation camps etc?
-
 
Has anyone ever travelled overseas with couples before? Few months back, I travelled with a group of friends for our graduation trip. I must say I am much annoyed by his girlfriend even though she's within our group. I have no issues with them being lovey dovey, but when it comes to decision making, it was never by the majority opinion but by hers.   
-
 
I can't let go of a girl I've liked for a long time. Even though she explicitly said she had no feelings for me and only wanted to be friends. I know she's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. I'm happiest and most comfortable around her. I trust her with my inner most problems and secrets. Both of us understand each other so well. And this is seriously affecting my studies :(
Is there no way back?
-
 
My JC friends have their uni friends. I am not that close to my uni friends. I feel lonely, yet I really love alone time. I did well in my studies up till JC. None of the courses seem to interest me. Struggling pretty badly now. Sometimes I really don't know what I am doing with my life. 
-
 
Is it really weird that I can interact so well with all my close guy friends and yet become a mute when facing the guy who always makes my heart flutters? Something must be wrong since it often gets awkward between my crush and I. :'( I don't even know how to get out of this situation.
-
 
Sometimes I feel as though some people keep me in their lives just so that they can make use of me. It sucks.
-
 
I've been following this page for a long time, and I would like to say that the commenters here are really so friendly! I kind of wish I could be part of this community :( Oh, and the frequency of posting over here is so much higher than NTU's confession page too. 

Sometimes I have a random urge to PM those people who expressed their openness to receiving messages, but I don't really know what to say. How do I get the conversation going? What if we run out of things to say? (especially since different school = lesser common topics) And I am attached... which means no sexual tension to fuel the conversation HAHAHA.

Okay nevermind. #sociallyawkward4eva #hitoallNUSengineers

Do you guys have experience of having a crush on TA or lecturer?
I did in Poly and he's a Maths lecturer. Now in Uni again, I am having a crush on this TA, who's really cute and looks shy when he smiles.
Recently, I saw a post about that female phyiscs lecturer and so just sharing mine as well. Any similar stories?
-
 
Hi guys.. I recently travelled with a group of friends, including my boyfriend, and during the trip, many of my male friends were topless and I saw some of them had nice pecs. Surprising because they look a bit skinny. One of them had such nice pecs that it resembled breasts (I am a female bisexual BTW) and it looked so nice that I couldn't resist touching poking it. It was so firm, but soft at the same time. Like breasts but not really. I didn't do anything else because my boyfriend was around. Now sometimes I think about his pecs and imagine groping it. I don't think I'm sexually or romantically attracted to my friend, but his pecs were very fascinating. My boyfriend has a bit of pecs but not as firm and well-defined. I think I just miss touching boobs... :(

I saw somewhere in the recruitment letter of a start-up.

"If you like to get cool shit done"

I have seen (or heard of) this sentence so many times that it has become pretty cliché. You know what I'm thinking of this time?

OMG, no matter how cool it is, it's after all, shit.
-
 
With regards to ... No, I didn't confess to him... I only said that it is kind of irritating to wait for close to 3 weeks for a reply. Then he said that we can stopped talking if it is irritating to me. End up now he completely ignored me. -.- 
-
 
People ask me why do I want to work in the States after graduation. 

For one thing, I can get married there.

Been feeling like shit for the past few days. Not suicidal, but just constant crying and sadness and hopelessness 

And it all built up to the point where I thought I can't take it anymore and I called NUS Counselling hotline - the one that's supposed to be 24 hours. No one picked up. Guess even they think I'm too hopeless case already 
-
 
I would like to know some of the pickup lines you guys used or know.
A few that I heard of:
"Hello, I'm a thief, and I'm here to steal your heart."
"Do you have a band-aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you."
"On a scale of 1 to 10, you're a 9. I'm the 1 you need."
I find some of them quite lame. Anything cool or heart-fluttering?
I am a girl btw.

Hi guys i think prof ben is kinda busy and i hope you guys dont keep directing your posts to him. Kinda puts some unneeded pressure on him. Hes already a prof, which shows that he would be very busy. 

Ps: i hope you guys dont think that this is prof Ben Leong, i am just a concerned reader who is honestly kinda addicted to nuswhispers :P

Seen too much posts about whether girls should take the initiative or sit back and let the guys chase. I thought I should share this article with everyone.

http://www.businessinsider.sg/mathematical-principle-reveals-how-to-get-what-you-want-2015-6/?utm_content=buffer470e6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer#.VfoNBzUZ7qA

Moral of the story: from a mathematical point of view, "it always pay to take the initiative" I quote. It applies to most situations in life other than relationships too.

I recently got attached to my senior and we have been together for about 1 month +. I'm not sure, since it's my first relationship, but something doesn't feel right. Maybe it's because our love languages don't match up, but sometimes I really doubt he loves me. It feels like he may have just chosen me out of convenience because I confessed to him. This is something that has been bothering me for a while but I'm scared to bring up the topic. What should I do?
-
 
I really don't like those kind of posts where the OP  writes a whole load of unspecific things and hoped that whoever he/she is writing about will read it. Well, no one knows whether that someone will actually read it or even if he/she reads it, it's so unspecific it's really hard to know who the post is referring to anyway. But I'm going to write one such post anyway, because I really have no idea how else to tell her this.

When I first met you, I really did not expect to become as close as we were in July. Maybe we are really fated. At that time, I was going through a very tough period because of that other girl and you were just like a ray of sunshine giving me warmth and making me feel alive. I don't know why you suddenly decide to stop replying my messages. Are you really that busy now? But somehow i was glad that happened. Because it's really getting more and more difficult to just treat you as a friend. Throughout this 2 months, i kept thinking about you. I really missed you a lot. Sometimes i wonder if it's the same for you too.

Yet I'm the one who told you we shouldn't talk anymore for the time being. The fact is I can't get over that girl. I can't understand what's my true feelings for you. Do i really like you for who you are? Or is it because I'm really lonely since my feelings for her is not reciprocated. I'm so afraid of giving you the wrong signals yet it's getting harder and harder to control myself. If I do ask you out again at the time that I promised, you would know that I got it all figured out. Maybe, if you want to, we can continue where we left off. If not, then just totally forget about me. 

You are too important to me to be just a replacement for somebody else.

I was from Computing, so were my 2 ex-boyfriends. My first ex is some sort of controlling, and he sort of control who I make friends with within the faculty. Basically, for almost 4 years of my uni life, I only kept close contact with a few friends. When we broke up, things ended quite badly, because he got some friends to pursude me about the breakup, and I guess till date many people still have some questions regarding how we broke up (but that's fine, because it doesn't really affect my life right now). We didn't really keep in contact.

My 2nd ex were also from my close group of friends. We got together abruptly and broke up within a few months (he stated that he wasn't ready and sure) so of course I felt hurt. I was already ready to settle into a relationship only for him to tell me that. So for a few months I just hid and cut off contacts with that group of friends, suffering the pain in silence. It took me quite a while and some bit of courage to join back my same group of friends (relationship fail, but friendship stays right), and till date we are still friends. 

After my second breakup, I got closer to another group of friends, also from Computing, and I do join them regularly for dinner and meetups. About a year ago, I started developing this weird feelings about another guy in the same group. He is those introvert type (kinda) and besides seeing each other almost weekly for some common interest group, we barely have any common interest. The interesting thing is, this sort of attracted me, and in fact we still talk quite a fair bit on random things, face to face, not yet on messaging terms. When my friends tried to matchmake us, he doesn't really detest the idea (as oppose to other girls) but I think I am not the type of girl he likes (actually I am quite unsure) and I ever thought of confessing but I also quite treasure the friendship we have between us, and I don't wish that it will turn out like the first two relationships. One side of me wants to work hard to this relationship, and the other side of me wants it status quo. Everyday, I pray for an answer to this problem but I am still unsure. ( I do consider how I felt with other guys before I feel that he is the type of guy I am looking for)

Prof Ben Leong lonely hearts club have any suggestions to this?

Thanks for your reply. I'm the OP of . I highly doubt he will read this page. 

That being said, I'm surprised this sort of "undefined close friendship" seems to be pretty rampant. 

If you like her, good luck to you. If you don't, maybe you should make yourself clear? 

But do it gently please, especially if you know it might mess up her... I dunno... Exams or something. 

Admin please post this :( 

May everyone find their better half soon :)

I know it's silly to take tinder dates seriously. We were not together for long but she left quite the impression and I still think of her fondly.

We were each other's first tinder dates but we hit it off really well. Our conversations were amazing. I have not had such sincere, spontaneous and long conversations with anyone else since. And I miss them the most. We were physically compatible too. But I was new to relationships and confused by my values. I did not handle our emotions and intimacy well.

We decided to remain just as friends despite both of us still being attracted to each other. I was so silly. Eventually the awkward pining was too much for me and I snapped. She was already dating someone else by then. I was jealous and said things I did not mean. I am a fool.

I know I should just move on and I will try my best. 

In the off chance that you read this, I want you to know that you are an amazing lady. I am glad I had the chance to meet you for however short a period and I am sorry I could not be the right man for you. Please be happy.

As a girl, am I supposed to sit back and let guys chase me? There is this guy I met recently at a CCA event and we meet quite often now because we are taking a common GEM module. We are not very close friends yet but I feel there is a possibility he likes me (I am not sure). I have feelings for him too but not so strong that I will confess to him. However, if he confesses to me, I will say yes. I don't want to make a move in case he gets freaked out. It would be good if we can develop the relationship gradually but I do not know how to go about it. Both of us are evergreen, but he is the more extroverted type while I am quite shy when it comes to talking about relationships.

I am writing about a friend, who I used to be very close to. We are still friends, just that now we are busier, so we talk less often. 

The other afternoon, I accidentally confessed that I had a huge crush on him back when we were in JC. Our conversation later changed topic and I didn't really want to explain why I became distant from back then even though I thought he might like me. Actually the truth is that I wanted to apologise to him but I had no guts to do so. Back then, I was scared because we have different religious beliefs. (We still do actually.) I was scared it would be a problem. But he told me he used to have a crush on me too. I realised it wasn't really fair to him, that I never gave him a chance to respond to my worries, and decided for him instead. But I wasn't even honest with myself back then, not enough to admit that I was the one who had an issue with it.

I guess this is the only way I am able to apologise right now. Sorry, friend. On the bright side, you deserve better than a coward like me anyway.

I started blocking people who always post happy photos with their bf/gf. 
I mean, stop giving people wrong perception about relationship. In reality, we all know that relationship is not always happy. 

It's the same for people who keep posting/posing for nice photos of themselves enjoying luxury life. 
In reality, we know that life is not that easy.
Damn bloggers - they are the reason why I deleted Instagram.

A question for Singaporean females: 
I'm new to this country and see a lot of beautiful Singaporean girls with skinny 'nice guys' with glasses. In my own country, I personally know that guys like these would have zero chance with the ladies. Only physically appealing, dominant and extroverted 'characters' would be considered popular with the fairer sex. What is going on? Are your relationships with these skinny guys sexual? What are you looking for in a sexual partner? Doesn't a funny, outgoing personality matter? Doesn't a physically appealing body matter either?

My two friends keep complaining that I steal all of the girls from them. When the three of us go out, I usually just sit there quietly while my friends banter and talk to girls. For some reason the girls always go towards me by the end of the night, and they leave the other two alone. What should I do? How can I transfer the girls to my lonely, sad friends?

Let me open up a little of the world that we depressed people live in. Some days we are accomplishing stuff, singing and laughing, and on other days you don't see us at all. That's when we are depressed. No reasons, no advice needed. 

For me, depression started with some family problems and tragedy ( I would not state what the problems are to remain anonymous) and few people actually know that I am depressed for many years. My family shuns depression like a disease and I caught that quickly when I saw that they are really worried about me. I'm the happy-go-lucky kid in front of them but behind I'm sad, lonely and tired. 

There are times when I binge-eat to satisfy my cravings and kill the hurt. There are also times that I skipped meal and let the melancholy sink in until I'm tired enough to sleep. Then there are times which I could do all my work at one go and other times I just stare into blank space and wonder about my life. Not to forget, sometimes I cry before I sleep or wake up crying from a nightmare.

For people without depression, it is hard to understand us I know. But do let us feel we can share our problems with you and you would not feel worried or think we have gone insane. We will avoid sharing if it hurts others. And also, do understand that we are not seeking your advice, we don't need your rant to teach us how to make life better for ourselves, we already knew. What we need is just your listening ear.

I have this female friend whom i knew for near 4 years since the start of university. All these while, we have treated other as close as siblings where we regularly call each other bro and sis. However, i've seem to fall for her recently where i found myself feeling upset over some of her actions or seem to show her more concern than what friends would. I am in a state of dilemma as i dont know what to do. Should i let her know that i've developed feelings for her but yet, risk our friendship or should i just bury the feelings deep within me and let it die off?... 

Advice please.

Prof ben leong ah... what is the best way to deal with false rumors spreading about you by an ex friend to shame you that even some of your good friends believe and leave you? It got me really mad and I'm unable to let it go and ignore it even after more than a year. I even went LOA for it for a semester and paid visits to the counselor, doctor.etc. Nothing helps. I felt this urge to make a public post or to text all those people to tell them the truth, to scold them. But I didn't dare, a part of me have a hunch that it will just make things worse. 

She is really clever...so many mind games...all the messages to ask me to suicide and stuffs. I don't even know who is myself anymore. I wish I'm not so stupid last time to delete all the messages back then.

Where are all the justice in this world... maybe the only way to get people to believe me is to jump and leave a note behind.

Sigh pie.

I'm a third year student but I'm still evergreen. People often get shocked when they find out, since I'm a pretty attractive girl. (Not bragging, just painting the scenario here.. Been told by a few of my guy friends that I'm the prettiest girl they've ever known) Anyway the reason why I'm still single after all these years is because I wanted to focus on my studies and none of the guys really got me invested enough to give them a chance. However, lately I've been considering giving bgr a try, maybe I'm starting to feel the pressure as I'm growing older and also starting to get more curious about it as well. The problem is I'm stuck in a course whereby it's pretty specialized and really small, so the pool of guys I'm exposed to and would consider giving a chance is really nonexistent. I've been trying to put myself out there but seem to not be making progress. Guys often say that they don't mind a girl who takes initiative but in reality, some get freaked out by it and turned off? I think in the end, though guys complain about why they are always expected to make the first move, most of them still prefer that and actually like the chase. Guys won't treasure a girl who's 'too easy' and prefer a challenge. Sadly in my case, maybe I appear too intimidating and too much of a challenge for them. Guess I gotta deal with this loneliness for another year and a half , and hope that I may find braver souls out there after graduation.

Anybody find that PGP's glass doors are retarded? I feel that they don't make you feel more secured, instead they annoy you since it is now harder to move around PGP anymore. And i feel that it is harder for disabled people to reach certain point in PGP now that most of the elevators are blocked by the retarded doors.

Did the management really think clearly when implementing this glass doors or did they just want to achieve something major during their time there?

@Justice Bao 包今天

I have a grievance that needs to be urgently remedied by Your Honour.

I had to turn to you because I have nobody else to turn to. I did not want to stress Prof Ben with more queries on nuswhispers.

I have been trying to drop hints by asking her out for 包 everyday. Recently, she told me that she no longer wishes to have 包每天. Eventually, we ended up quarelling about whether we should have 包今天 or 包明天.

I fear that if this keeps up, she will take advantage of this, and eventually ask for 包后天.

Please right this wrong for us!

I think I'm screwed up. I'm Bi, and currently the ratio of my ex is 4:5; 4 for girls and 5 for guys. How I date is usually to even out this ratio to 1:1. 
So I have been trying to get close to this girl from my faculty, low and behold, I think I have fallen too deep and I think she would be my last one. However I'm quite scared that she won't accept me for who I've been. What should I do?

Sometimes the lows are so extreme that the good seems super cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to
And you'll show up for school with a smile
You'll be better you'll be smarter
And more grown up and a better daughter
Or son and a real good friend
You'll be awake and you'll be alert
You'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
You'll be a real good listener
You'll be honest, you'll be brave
You'll be handsome, you'll be beautiful
You'll be happy

Hey NUSWhispers, OP of  here.

Some of you already know who I am, and thanks for the messages. My point of writing my parent's story was not to make you go "ahhh wow that exists.", or to trigger a sort of treasure hunt to find out who that person is. But more of letting you know that there isn't such a thing as a perfect love story, where every day you run through empty fields and watch sunsets together. It was 35 years long but it was tough and there were extreme ups and extreme downs. I'm sure all of you know that's normal for a relationship, even more for longer relationships, and yet more so when it turns into marriage and all the in-laws and children get involved.

I started off by telling you how different my parents are. And this difference has remained through all these years. Both are stubborn and have their own ways of doing things, but they always kept it balance - a mixture of compromises and one-way-give-ins. For as long as I can remember, I watched their relationship grow: from how they were so loving, till when I started schooling and they had differences in how I should be brought up, to them arguing and fighting, to be on the verge of divorce several times, to clear walk-outs on the house but eventually coming back. Those were tough days but it helped mould my idea of how relationships work. It was about overcoming adversity together, even if at times it felt like either sides were adversity. 

It instilled in me the idea that any two persons COULD be together, no matter how different they may be (um, I'm still trying to find someone who believes in that, though), and it was all down to how much both parties wanted it to work. Of course, it's easy to give up at small disagreements, big disagreements. As long as you've subconsciously given up, it's over. And no matter how much the other party pleads and changes, it'll never work out anymore.

Before I get too ranty/naggy, I just want to reiterate my main points, that is:

1) No matter which 2 people are in a relationship, it's not so much of the character or characteristics that determine whether the relationship lasts. It's down to your level of commitment and your willingness to ride out the tough times to strengthen your relationships.

2) No matter how small or big an obstacle is, always have the end-point in mind, that is ultimately marriage with children, or whatever your end-point is, and work towards that. If you keep thinking "Ah this won't work out", or "Wow, can't imagine living with that for the next 50 years" then yeah, it won't work out and you won't live with that for the next 50 years.

3) Find out what works for you both. Whether it's to compromise, or to give in when necessary. But never ever push people beyond their morals and values. No matter how badly my parents fought and insisted on their way of doing things, they never forced each other to compromise on something they truly believed in. And I think that makes a big difference.

Oh yeah, as per what one comment said, you really ought to find out your parent's love story. It may do you some good. :)

Peace out, guys.

I don't know whether this is normal but sometimes I will fantasise about my sister because she is really pretty (model standard). I don't know whether she knows about it but I am so jealous of her boyfriend. Every time if I am reminded of some other guys touching her I will rage. Oh no I am afraid I will do the unforgivable act one day.

Anyone has similar experiences?

I have been talking to a guy for 3 mths but we didn't meet before. Now it is too late because some things happened and the first thing he thought if is to burn the bridge. :( I haven't even meet him yet and he is so cute. :(:(:( Oh, and he was from computing before. Prof Ben, how arh? 
-
 
I've noticed that there've been a large amount of relationship advice posts on sex, how far should they go, is touching allowed etc. And I just want to say, it is not rocket science. Do what both you and your partner are comfortable with and what makes you both happy. There is no right or wrong. There is no black or white.

I'm the OP of .
hmm, I think I know how you feel. Especially, my replacement is a guy from my own clique. I don't dislike him for replacing me. I just don't like how she kept shoving their close friendship in front of my face. I wouldn't recommend you to ignore him so that he will supposedly pay more attention to you, like your friends did. Because most of the time, it doesn't turn out to be the way we wanted. Most likely he'll just move on with his new friend, and you'll be just as bitter as before because you can't get over the fact that he gave up on the friendship. Time might reduce the frequency you think about this friendship that you once had, but you wouldn't be actually 'liberated' I think.
Like I said before, perhaps you might want to face the friendship with less expectation like I did and focus more on other friendships that you've already been working on. You can try to have an extended friendship that includes the girl too. 
Occasionally, I do feel down that things weren't the same as before. But I usually brush them aside because I think that it's better to look forward than reminisce about the past that we can't go back to.
What I understand is that, nobody likes to be with a negative person. Sometimes, you just gotta act normal and be cheerful.
But if by any chance, your feelings towards him is more than platonic, I suggest you move on from this friendship.

I am on exchange from Australia and I'm Hugh Jackman's step-brother. However I told a so-called friend about my relationship with Hugh and thought he would keep it quiet, as I don't like to be in the limelight and have people recognise me everywhere. Unfortunately he spilt the news to a couple of others and rumours have start to spread. How can I best deflect and deny these rumours?

Hi , I'm . 
Thanks for sharing your story. 
Yes, I have been to form other friendships and upgrading my other friends as well. Initially I was very quite reluctant because I could not trust and was quite scared to be hurt.  With the emotional support from these friends, I am not as in pain as before.  Just that this issue is always in my  mind, whenever there is a trigger e.g. hearing his name, seeing his photos, going places we  have been together, I will be in a emotional roller coaster; all the sad hurtful memories will resurface from where I tried to bury them in my mind.
I am and I guess will always be afraid if I were to go out with him again. I am quite scared that he will boast about how well his friendship with his new friend is going, where they go together, how he thinks she is such a good buddy with him, what a fabulous person she is (which he had already been doing the last few times we meet up) and etc. I am afraid how he will say about how he has found better replacements to be with him during our usual meetup days/times or how it is more productive to his work etc. for him not to meet up with me. My heart might not be able to take such things again. I guess the expectations and disappointments will always be there. Somewhere I read that one will never forget rejections and emotional pain c.f. physical pain, the same parts of the brain will always light up when thinking about the events.
From online forums, I have seen many people with the same issues as us too. Some of them are still stuck and in pain despite the long period of time (some even decades) after the issue has past. I hope I will not fall into this category of people.
Any tips on how to forget this "friend", let go and move on quickly so I can get on with my life, concentrate on my career, go about making true friends?
Thanks.

I'm 26 this year and I'm a virgin(oh im a guy.). This has been bothering me a lot. I have had chances in the past but I said no even when I was very heavily drunk. And I tend to start regretting it abit now. Should I be worried about this and how much of a turnoff would this be to a girl?

Hi guys please help. I need some serious advice on this.

I'm a year 3 student and my JC guy friends have finally joined me in uni (as freshies). These are friends I treasured a lot but ever since their army days, we started drifting apart (while the guys got closer to each other of course) and we tried to sustain our friendship by meeting up over meals every 2 to 3 months. I thought the tradition would continue when they came into uni but they don't bother communicating with me any longer. On top of that, the only time they communicate to me is to express how 'busy' they are. 

I tried reasoning with them how every individual has their own activities and being busy is a part and parcel of life (and even offering some help) but they threw comments back like 'You will never understand how we feel. We have so much of projects and we can barely breathe.' This statement felt quite like an insult; I'm pretty sure that a year 3 would be able to understand how heavy the workload in university and I felt that the statement was quite unfair to me. The problem now is that I don't even have the urge to ask them out or sustain this friendship any longer especially since the countless rejections I've faced when asking them out over a meal. Should I forsake this friendship?

Thanks in advance for any advices.

I need some advice here guys. I've started dating this caucasian guy and he has made me very happy. I think what we have is special and I can see a future for us. But since then, I've noticed that my friends and family have started treating me differently. For example, they've started calling me a spg or 'jia kang tang' which I do find offensive and very much hurt by it. I feel that the change occurred only because I did not choose to date a chinese guy. Sometimes I wonder if the same would happen if he was of other ethnicity, indian or malay. I need some advice.

With quite a number of posts on how guys ask the girls out for dates or even tried to hint their love interests that the 'dinner/meal' together is in fact a date, it truly made me wondered if  our generation sometimes viewed things in an overly complex manner. Look... if you tried talking to people from the older generations (our parents or grandparents), you will probably realise things back then were more straight forward: Interested means interested, wanna ask someone out for a date? just ask. got rejected from the girl/guy? move on or continue to do the chasing. Maybe life in those days seemed to be less complicated than today? I'm not sure if you guys would disagree with what I just mentioned (it doesn't matter to me anyway), but I believe we will be happier if we can do things in a simpler way.

I am a girl who has a senior as her boyfriend. Recently I shared with him my problems of being too hungry for sex. Surprisingly that has made me more committed to me, but I wonder if he's permanently going to be with me. :)

Recently there were jokes flying around suggesting that I was going to hire some guys to satisfy me, but I hope it'd be my boyfriend to do it instead. However, he used to be a playboy and mind of told me that he used to enjoy different types a lot until he met me.

Ever since we got close, however, we even did it with each other such as in a rental car overseas.

I'm confused. Did I change him, or is he thinking I am a versatile bedmate?

To the op of 

You should feel happy for your sister, though it's inevitable you feel that way.
All my life thus far, i've always dream of finding the one i love and loves me back that i can enjoy the sweetness of being in a relationship.  Yet, none of mine worked out. It's to a point that i feel inferior cos I am fat and ugly. People always say that it's the character that matters but why is it that the guys i like don't like me.

Anyway, my point is, don't worry. U will find the one someday so be patient.. for now, be happy for your sister, she will appreciate it!

Ps. My youngest sister has a steady bf whom they are bto-ing and the other sister is happily attached too. Not to mention, my bff is married and another happily attached. You're not alone.

Hi.

I must admit, first of all, to have a crush on someone who already has a boyfriend. The worst part is that it's a sexual crush.

I really can't tell you very much how infatuated I am with you, but I shoot quite far and think of you each time I jerk off in bed. :)

Even if I am known to be quite a horny bastard in my circle each time we have parties, I am... really impressed with you.

Is it true that most girls want someone better than them in everyway? They want someone who earns more than them, taller than them, better grades than them, more popular than them, comes from a better family etc.? Whereas guys prioritise gals who are more chio, and ignore most of the other factors? If so, why? Prof Ben Leong, what's your take on this?
-
 
I think my whisper was not posted... But no harm trying again.

It feels good to be able to say what's on my mind.

I guess we've known each other for some time. Everytime we meet, whether in a group setting or just us, I feel that we're getting closer and closer. The conversations keep running, & your eye contact is just overwhelming. 

But I know full well that if I have my doubts, fears & reservations, it means that most likely this will lead to nowhere & that you are just not that into me. 

Out of sight, out of mind. Not true because I am still thinking about you. But I'm trying my best to stop texting you. I wish you'd invite or ask me to another event again (even if it's still an innocent group event), I wish I could just freely tell you about my day & what happened. But I have to stop now. I might fail & just text you tomorrow, or even tonight...

But I really wish you'd know that I'm trying to get a grip on myself, trying to control my feelings, & it is difficult because... 

I like you.

I don't mean to stop texting. I actually wish you could text me first. If you feel the same for me, I wish you'd do something coz... After all you're the guy. 
-
 
 I know exactly how you feel, coming from the perspective of a girl whose boyfriend has had a couple of exes, and some friends with benefits also. It's horrible, and sometimes it's hard to enjoy sex and put away my own insecurities and worries. I guess try and talk about it with your gf? The feelings won't go away for sure but they'll slowly fade (: All the best!!
-
 
To 

I can understand how you're feeling. I went through a similar situation and it's hard for people to understand because it's not common for two people of different genders to be very very close without being romantically or sexually involved with each other.

I had a male best friend too. (I am a girl.) I would go so far as to say I loved him, in a platonic/ familial way. I think he cared for me too, in his own way.

It took several years before he was able to trust me with real emotional intimacy and (I'm crying a little as I'm typing this) maybe I was scared or maybe I was tired and it was too little, too late, or maybe it was something else but soon after he shared his deep vulnerabilities with me, I told him we couldn't be friends anymore. It broke his heart. It broke my heart.

I can't remember now why I thought it was more important for us to stop being friends. I can't remember what exactly happened. All I remember is the pain and anger I felt. I sometimes wonder what he'd think of my current boyfriend, (my friend didn't like many of the guys I dated) and my new friends, my new job, etc. We were very close like brother and sister.

I have not heard from him since then though I've tried to speak to him several times and I saw him on my campus before (we study at two different NUS campuses). I wanted to say I was sorry in person and hope he is doing well, but when I went back, he was gone. Maybe he wanted to hide from me, because his friends were still there.

I think my heart is still a little bit broken. It has been four years.

OP, I hope you are able to get through to your friend. Perhaps you can accept him being closer to someone else, but still remain close friends with him and not expect as much out of him. I would prefer my friend to just be an acquaintance now that I only talk to once in a while than an elusive shadow I can't ever talk to.

I tell myself he is in a better place without me, as I am without him, but it still hurts. So goddamned much.

Dear all, I am in a dilemma right now. 
Just one year ago, my opposite gender best friend downgrades me for another person he just met, claiming her as his only best friend. I am in deep emotional pain ever since, feeling depressed, low self-esteem, worthless, didnt know what I did wrong, was there anything I was not good enough as she was etc etc. When I confront him about the downgrade, he blatantly denied it though his attitude and gestures showed otherwise (e.g. suddenly not replying to my text, emails, saying that chatting with me through WA was awkward (we meet up only once a week and we did those often in the past), while he chat/email/text with the new friend daily even though they work at same place and meet everyday). I have given him many chances, tried to empathize with him but nothing worked and I was left behind, alone and abandoned by my best friend.
Because of this issue, I lost many opportunities, e.g. lost focus at work, refuse to attend convocation because they will be there too, not to mention losing many tears and falling into depression.
My other friends, colleagues and family advised me to stay away from him and cut all ties with him and observe how he will react. After approximately 6 months of struggle, that is what I have done, I refuse to meet him, stating I am busy with work.
For the next 6 months, he didnt contact me at all, no text asking what happened to me etc. Recently, I heard from my colleagues who bumped into him that he asked about me. Although I feel that is for politeness only. His ex GF, whom I met once or twice only 4 years ago, suddenly added me to FB (he doesnt has FB) - I guess he is cyberstalking me through her. He meets up with her often though they have part ways.
I dont know what to do, to contact him and meet up again or keep ignoring him and work on the process of unfriending him. Well, he will always have a soft spot in my heart. However, this issue has caused me deep emotional scars. I have just started to trust others again and gain confidence of myself. I do not want to go back to the deep depressive emotional mire but I cannot stop thinking about it and secretly hope that we can be best friends again (though the pragmatic me know that it will not be true).

I have always wanted to get this off my mind. He might never see it but oh wells..

Hello,
You might not have noticed me in school before and thinks I’m a random, weird girl. So sorry for all the discomfort that I might have caused (through unwarranted staring). I am admittedly a socially awkward person. Just want to spill it out that I have been kind of carrying a torch for you since the start of U; when I first noticed we are in the same GEM lecture (and to my surprise, in the same course too). Long and weird right? I don’t even know you personally but you always set my heart pounding literally. I’ve always wanted to approach you but I never got the courage so I’m taking this chance today. I’m not irrational or crazy, just always wanted to get to know you and be friends. If you are not interested, then I’m writing this as a move for me to let go and move on. I’m sure you are a pretty great guy but well, maybe we can only ever be schoolmates. All the best for your future and congrats on graduating!

When will I find another that makes me feel as strongly?

To . I'm a female. Umm I usually would assume it as just "hanging out" and not a date unless it was explicitly said. I mean, even if I'm interested in him, I don't really want to assume and think that he is interested in me too. It feels a little presumptuous? And good conversation/1-on-1 dinners happen between friends too. 

Regarding paying for the meal, I might just think the other person is in a good mood/just got paid and thus treating me. I think to remove any confusion, it is best to simply say it. Mikhail's way of "okay it's a date" is a pretty good way of smoothening any awkwardness in trying to transit from "hanging out" to date. You can consider it I guess. 

Umm, I personally think a verbal validation of bf/gf is important. Not so much as a "I need it", but to allow both parties an opportunity to talk about it. I think when people go into a relationship with different expectations (like do I have to contact u everyday, how often shd we go on dates, ways of showing love, etc), misunderstandings/conflicts happen pretty easily. So yea, hope a female's pov will be helpful.

We all know that everyone has their own issues but I don't know if what I've been feeling is normal.

I hate myself. There are times when I sometimes see good things in myself but it has mostly been a very intense hate. I don't feel comfortable being me. I have some anxiety issues. Not enough to prevent me from leaving my house, but enough to keep me inside as much as possible. It's not all about looks. I just feel like I hate everything about myself and the idea of loving myself seems almost absurd and undesirable at times.

I can't form any meaningful relationships because I fear intimacy and opening up to people (i.e. I can't talk to anyone about my feelings). I constantly compare myself to everyone and find nothing good about myself. It's not like I'm miserable all the time but I just feel this deep, heavy emptiness beneath everything. I'm aware of my insignificance in this universe but that's not the only cause. It's like I'm observing the world passing by me.

I'm sorry if it's not coherent enough. I know I'm probably depressed, though only mildly. The anxiety issues started since long ago but got worse as time went by. I started having the desire of not existing (it's complicated but I'm not going to kill myself) since 3 - 4 years ago. I don't remember when all of it started but I don't think this feeling will ever leave me in future.

Even though I've been blessed with a fortunate life (and I appreciate this), living feels like torture at times.

 hey, I have about the same friendship issue with an opposite sex recently too. I did get really unhappy for 1-2 month because our friendship has been a decade long. I started to play more emphasis on my other groups of friends instead of trying to force a friendship to work. Imo, friendship should make you happy. While its true that you do have to make an effort for it to work, you shouldn't be constantly vying for his attention. If he asks you out, then just go out with him, but don't expect anything from the friendship. If it works out, it'll be great. If it doesn't, then perhaps the friendship isn't worth your constant investment. In your case, you can make the first move and ask him out again since you've been dao-ing him for months. You'll be happier if you have less expectations and perhaps you'll find new friends or discover friends that you've neglected in the past that are willing to make an effort to maintain their friendship with you.(:

Some time ago someone mentioned a pill that would put an end to one's existence, erasing every trace of you from the minds of all the people who know you and have known you.

I would take that any day, without blinking. I have never felt happy and i dont see myself ever being happy. I am a house of cards built up over two decades. Cards are slowly being removed from the base. It's only a matter of time before I collapse and injure a lot of people.

I am extremely unhappy about my dad. This weekend a relative is having a wedding lunch buffet but I do not feel like going. I ended up quarrelling with my dad about this and he threatened me that if I do not attend, all my allowance will be cut and I will not be allowed to go out with my friends. His reason being this relative is the daughter of my grandpa's younger brother and so I must go. He seems to emphasize a lot on the tradition. Like for instance, my dad's sister, who they believed "married out" and so my aunt and her whole family are not obliged to go. However the reason why I do not wish to go are these:

1) the people there are people I do not know at all. I have not met the bride in real life even. The people there are mainly older folks (60 plus years old). I do not have anyone there I could potentially talk to, if you get what I mean.

2) social events drained me a lot as I am an introvert and thus I tend to avoid social events if I can. 

Recently I am feeling that my dad is forcing me to attend other gatherings, for instance some other relatives' grandchildren birthday buffet etc. I will just be very honest, I do not like attending gatherings.

And btw I am not allowed to touch my own money if my dad indeed cut my allowance. My dad is not the kind who would listen. Whatever he say means must do, the authorative/bossy kind I would say.

Am I in the wrong not to go for such gatherings? Are my reasons valid enough to not go? Why must my dad force this kind of things? I'm a 21 year old so shouldn't I be given the freedom to decide whether I want to go or not? Is my dad in the wrong for forcing me to go when I simply just do not wish to attend? 

Ps: please do not flame me as I simply wish to know who exactly is in the wrong.

I have recently got into a relationship with a girl. She's my first girlfriend, while I'm her 2nd. Can't help but to feel what this guy posted on another site.

"How much you second guess yourself.
I was 25 when I started my first real romantic relationship, and yes, I was a virgin up until that point. My then SO was much more experienced than I. It surprised me how much it bothered me. It wasn't even a logical thing. Even when you know the person loves you, accepts you, and finds you attractive and awesome you second guess yourself and compare yourself to the people they've been with."

Any way to curb such feelings?

Hi, I am the OP of .
I have known him for 6 years already.
I knew him since undergraduate and then we took on post grad studies at the same time. We took many modules together and supported each other in difficult and lost times in the past. The issue happened around the time I graduated one semester ahead of him. I dont know if that it the trigger for him downgrading me. The new friend of his graduated at the same time as he does, so they have the same thesis dateline etc.
Maybe he treats our relationship as convenience only but I treat our friendship as those kind of truest, sincerest and everlasting. Having experienced many friend of convenience friendships in the past, I was convinced that this friendship of ours will not fall into this fate. I was looking for a true friend, not convenient friend. This discrepancy, I guess is the cause of my emotional pain and despondent...
Well, this issue has seriously damaged my confidence, self esteem and mental health. I can only hope to let go and move on as soon as possible and wish that another door will open for me. Maybe one day, I will finally have a true friend.....

when I found out that my younger sister got engaged before I did...My heart sank... I tried my best not to cry in front of my family. Then later I cried myself to sleep. A few days ago their engagement was officially announced and I left home and cried in my car!  I felt like as if I was doing something wrong...  And I am genuinely scared of being in my late 20s and still not married.... Although I am genuinely happy for my sister... I feel like I am getting left behind... How do I overcome this feeling!  :(

Is it just me, or are guys in uni really generally less "serious" than girls. "Less serious" meaning like joking around a lot more, poking fun at each other, and just talking a lot of nonsense when they are together. I mean, it's fun when I hang out with them but sometimes I don't really know how to join in their conversations as i am quite "serious" in nature and i'm also an introvert. It seems like I also put a lot more effort in schoolwork than them too.  Are guys hardworking too but just don't like to show it? Will they think girls like me are boring or is it normal for girls to be like that? (or will they not think anything..?)

Clueless engineering girl

Hello everyone, I have a problem.

My boyfriend "disallows" (I put this in " " because he doesn't really disallow because he can't but in a way he still does) me from talking to other guys and every time when he sees that I do he insists that I stop talking to said guy immediately. He gives the reasoning that all these guys are trying to take me away from him. Possessive as it may seem, I can understand where he is coming from BUT he constantly pm girls himself. Recently, he met this girl and has been continuously texting her for close to a week. Now, I'm tolerant and I want to be the "cool girlfriend" that is okay with him talking to girls so I have not brought it up. But the thing is, he does not open messages from these girls in front of me, choosing to reply them when we're apart. 

Am I doing something wrong? Or am I not good enough to keep his attention?
-
 
Recently, over these past few months, I have been getting quite close with a guy friend of mine whom I knew for about 1 semester. We have talked everyday, sometimes even late into the night, and shared things that not many others knew, including people we liked in the past.
Recently, I have been developing some confusing feelings for my friend, but I don't know whether it is because I might have felt closer to him and have seen him as a suitable person to continue our relationship to the next level. However, he has told me he is happy with singlehood and not looking for anyone at the moment. So now we have mutually acknowledged each other as best friends, but he is unlikely to cross the line into more than friends.
Sometimes I'm able to control those feelings for him and treat him as just a friend whom I like talking to, but other times I get overwhelmed with emotions for him. Those times are painful because I know he is contented with being single and will probably won't feel the same way as I do. I also do know he is close friends with other girls, but probably not as close as the both of us.
Any advice on this kind of situation?

I am addicted to masturbation. I do it almost everyday since I was in JC. I'm afraid that this may affect my health and my chances of having kids in the future but I can't seem to kick the habit. Advice anyone?
-
 
Seeing how so many "confessioners" (or whats the proper term) here are looking for friends in NUS or looking for soulmates, I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in setting up an event. Lets say a makan session or tea session for people to mingle around, network, chit chat get to know more people? Prof Ben you think its a good idea? Theres no polling system here so I would take it as the number of likers of this post are roughly the number of people who are supporting this event.
-
 
To . I know how it feels. It doesn't feel good being alone. And not being able to have a conversation with others that last for at least 5 minutes. But at least you are sitting with your friends in lecture right? At least they still sit with you when they see you right? Well..mine don't. We say hi. But we don't interact. I think they see me as a weird person. I went to camps and knew them there. But somehow they clicked but I didn't. 

So you should count yourself lucky. At least there is someone who is there to make you less awkward. For me, haha. I'm used to being alone.

Sometimes it's hard to tell what a girl looks for in a guy. So I'm gonna put mine right here:

Large guys who have a soft spot for small kittens :3 imagine seeing them gently handle them little things (and struggling to be as gentle as possible to not hurt them), is both amusing and really really cute :3
-
 
Hmmm I've submitted like 4 posts now and none of them got posted. Is it my phone/computer? something wrong with NUSwhispers? Or am I really saying inappropriate stuff?
-
 
Took so much courage for me to put up this post.

I feel that I am suffering from low self esteem. I feel that I cant interact socially well but problem is, I really wish to fit in and have a group of friends but I really don’t know whats going wrong that’s stopping me from doing so.
I used to be worse. Up until secondary school, I have been living without friends and I come to school not speaking more than 5 sentences a day, and of that 5 sentences probably just “ May I go to the toilet?” Even when the teacher tell me to self intro I would just stand up and shrug.

I gotten a lot better since then. And I am proud of it. I always told myself if I can reach this far, I can always reach further. But I feel that something is always stopping me. 

What made me become all this emotional now is cause of a series of events now. Btw Im a freshie, and a guy. Particularly I introduced a good friend of mine from another course to my course OG, we just went for a few meals/supper, and now he is closer to them than I am to them. Same for another girl friend whom I thought I was closer, but I brought them tgt(as friends), they became much closer than I am to her. Then I just shell up myself, though I always think that to be close of course must keep going out tgt with them, but how can he become closer to them so much faster? Its not just that particular friend, some other people too they become much closer to my original group of friends even though I am in a much better position.

Then what else, I sucks at texting. I seen that friend of mine keep texting my girl friends, and some are even initiated by the girls. I know its unhealthy to keep comparing, but I am not saying I want to reach his level or wad, but I’m just wishing for a group of friends.  And this self-esteem thing is holding me back I think. Is it really practice makes perfect? That I have to keep on trying to do all these stuff in order to become better at that? Like, I think I sucks at texting, so I just keep texting my girl friends and practicing my skills?

And I realize I cant hold up a good conversation like a man too. Looking at other people while they chatted, they were laughing and also at the same time having a meaningful conversation. While with me, especially when its just me and another person, I could feel that both of us is trying to come up with stuff to talk about to prevent awkwardness. It just doesn’t come naturally. And got the feeling people feel uninterested or bored or awkward around me…. Argh… 

I am tempted to withdraw back into my shell, but I know that its not good for me. I want to improve but I don’t know how..

To OP don't worry, take small steps each day, you will get better in your socializing skills. Please don't overdo it, you will lose you true self.

As time passes, people will change, your personality, behavior will also change with time. When I was young, I used to be very good at socializing, I know everyone from my cohort, even my siblings' close friends, with friends I even got punished for being a chatterbox. But when I was in secondary school, I only speak to people whom I am closed to. 

OP, practise texting your girl friends is a good idea but before you start doing that do sufficient research to make sure that you are not talking too much to an attached girl. If you want to practice face to face, here's some conversation topics: daily activities, hobbies, weather? , school work, news, gossips? :p if you are close to the other party you can ask about their family, their future, etc. 

Hope it helps!

I have a crush on this guy in my course. But I feel abit inferior when it comes to my looks. I dont think I look ugly but my teeth juts out abit. Actually alot. My friends used to tell me I look cute but nowadays I dont dare to show my teeth when I take photos. Recently I told him I never slept well and woke up with red eyes. He joked that I would look like a rabbit. I felt really affected by that comment, thinking he's referring to my teeth? Should I let it pass? Or should I seriously consider braces?

To .. Here's some advice from someone who started masturbation at the age of 12 and have been doing it multiple times daily. While I don't know if it has any effect on health or fertility, it could affect you in other negative ways. 

This may just be from my own experience but after awhile, around the age of 16, I began to get less sensitive (read up on ED) and couldn't get satisfied with just the normal routines. It causes us to view women as objects rather than people. I began to search for more heinous stuff to jerk off to and I finally reached the lowest point when I looked up CP. 

At the same time, I noticed that over the years, my self esteem and social skills have deteriorated (especially with girls). I was once a cheerful and active kid with many friends but nowadays I spend most of the time alone and depressed. The last time I spoke to a girl longer than 5 minutes was back in jc 2 years ago... With my project work team. 

The stuff above could or could not happen to you but my suggestion is that you try to kick the habit. I have been trying to quit for two months now and have been successful for 2-3 weeks at a time before relapsing. I realised that it usually happens when I'm bored and alone so I suggest you find activities to fill up your day and try to be around others to get your mind off it. 

The first few days/weeks will be the hardest but I believe it is for the best for our own improvement... Hopefully one day I can revert back to my old self :'(

serious qns…how do you guys know when ‘hanging out” become a date? I had dinner one on one with this girl for about three times already and whenever the bills come we would go dutch (I did not offer to pay for her..afraid of making it awkward). 

So for the next dinner, do I explicitly have to tell her it is a date or should I just offer to pay and hopefully she will take the hint that I want to make this a date? Another question…do guys still ask do you want to be my girlfriend or somehow we will just magically become a couple without any verbal validation? This is so confusing.

Both of us are introverts who hate socializing. But we are pretty chatty to each other. 
-
 
i'm just an average looking girl. i'm generally cool with the way i look, but sometimes i can't help but envy those good looking girls yknow? cuz they look so effortlessly pretty and have good bodies and all heh. and they're the ones that the opposite sex would usually notice first. face it, everybody craves a little attention from the opposite sex. but oh well (: i guess its best to not compare yourself with other ppl, but just be happy with who u are, and keep on shining and ppl will naturally gravitate towards u (:
-
 
although people say opposites attract, i would like to find someone that is similar to me in terms of character.

somehow, it just feels more comfortable knowing that the person is like you, so you know what they like and don't like. 

but then again, it seems creepy? machiam like dating &or marrying yourself.
-
 
Is it normal for couple to not talk/minimal talking for 3-4 days. I have not really talked to my SO for almost 3 days and whenever we did, she seemed kinda aloof and unlike her normal self. Shd I be concern???? 
-
 
Guys, I have a question. When you hear "computing/engineering girl", what's the first thing that comes to mind? Just curious.
-
 
I liked a computing guy before but he basically couldn't follow through any conversation! I knew he was smart, but it was like he couldn't expound upon his interests, nor did he ask any questions, which makes it hard to have a good long conversation. He was the cutest guy in the batch though. I couldn't remain interested, and he became just eye candy. He's still single, I believe.
-
 
Escort from yesterday, to answer questions. No, sex doesn't have to be involved, sometimes clients are just lonely and want to take a girl out for a dinner date. You can turn down any client that you don't like because sex must be consensual. As for STDs and such, I get a full test every few months to be safe. I try to be as safe as possible within this line of work but I do realise the risks and if I really get anything, it will be my own fault. Also, this is just a stint, not a career. I do plan to quit when I've saved up enough. 
For people saying that I'm throwing away my morals, that is fine. Morals are relative. Everyone has a different opinion on moral values, and I will tell any future partners of mine about this. If they can't accept me for it, they are not right for me then. 
-
 
I find it so tragic that the guy who cheated on me has the exact same birthday as the girl whom he cheated on with. Everytime when the day of the year nears, I feel so down. But come to think of it, at least it's one day only right? ;)
-
 
 yeah bring back the sex and relationship posts.

Say, Prof Ben, I hear you're running a dating agency by night. Any geek girls from computing to recommend? Bonus points if she's cute too. 
-
 
 I actually liked a Computer Science and uber cute guy but it is so hard to get him to talk. Luckily for me, none of my female friends find him cute at all. While I can understand the technical puns but I wish it was easier to get to know him more and develop further. So Prof, do you have any recommendations to deal with such guys?
-
 
Wa! Talk about real life applicable skills. Any profs/students wanna share about the art of finding a girlfriend for keeps? Hahahaha
-
 
yeah. so far like all my confessions have been posted, except like only one.

Don't see what those "STOP FILTERING POSTS" buggers are bitchen' about.

You always make my heart flutter when you message me. But you only talk about schoolwork :(
What can i do?

To the girls who complain they are evergreen and tall, have you ever thought about why this is the case? Let me tell you why. It is precisely because most girls have a minimum criteria (e.g. must be taller than them) when finding their SO that causes short guys to have low self-esteem. Eventually most of them do not dare to confess as they might see for instance, height as a barrier to finding their true love.  So for the last time, please fix this social stigma among yourselves before you girls start ranting again!

P.S : I'm a tall guy speaking out for my friends
-
 
Hey Prof Ben. I'll like some help in that department too but mine's kinda different. 

I'm a girl and I'm looking for a girl to date. Can you help?
-
 
How long do couples take to be completely physically intimate with each other? 
-
 
To    HI here's another fellow 1.73m girl!! I am also single. Evergreen actually. sucks when everyone tells you that you are model material but you're just actually rotting at home reading NUSWhispers.

This is nothing interesting. Just a groupmate I met this semester. A pretty and interesting girl. Been trying to drop jokes, comments, questions in the group chat, but all I got was lukewarm responses. Looks like it gonna be real tough :(
-
 
 I also want. But I am too shy to pm you. > . <
-
 
I don't know if I really like you or if its just the comfortable friendly feeling I have when I talk to you...But sometimes I m afraid I might sound a bit too clingy as I have been initiating all our convos, well not at least face to face. How I wish I could know what you actually think about me..
-
 
So my parents had a major fight last week. It wasn't a new thing of course; there were many fights since many years ago. However, they have opted to take this to court, and it seems that they are heading for divorce.

Should I bother to stop/intervene or anything? While I can't say that I'm jumping for joy, the reverse is definitely not true. Admittedly, I'm kinda happy but uncertain about why am feeling happy/should i feel happy. 

I dislike taking sides so I really don't know what I'm going to tell them/court whatever. Advice?
-
 
I hate that i am so sensitive. I can actually feel when someone is just uninterested in carrying on the conversation. It doesn't really matter if that someone is a normal friend. It really hurts when that someone is your best friend or SO. Feeling utterly dejected these days due to studies and i just feel like there is no one to talk to :(
-
 
To  and  Hello fellow tall girls! Gosh it's nice to know that there are girls like me who feel the same way as I do... I'm 1.74m myself and not 'skinny/slender'. I've been approached by one or two guys before but I felt as if they weren't genuinely interested so nothing ever developed. I've never been in a relationship too. 

I keep wondering if there's something wrong with me because my friends are all getting attached but I'm still not scoring in the love department... I'm very average-looking, a book nerd, not active in CCAs, and rather passive in terms of seeking a r/s even though I'm ready for one. :( 

Just curious... what do guys think of tall girls, and would you approach a taller girl (initiate a convo, just as friends)? And what do less-tall/shorter girls think of tall girls? I'm asking because I having a nagging suspicion that I tend to give off "intimidating" vibes because of my height... or perhaps it's my sian expression... lol

I have a friend who was a social escort for a few months. It was the biggest mistake of her life and she is still seeking therapy for it as she has been mentally affected. I don't see why anyone would do this line of work unless you are really poor amd desperate. Chances are, the other op here is just materialistic. How can you compromise your morals for money. It's pretty low. Besides, you have a high risk of stds. Even a kiss might seal your future. Good luck
-
 
There is this guy who is super popular and i kind of like him but i am not sure if its just the excitement of getting to know someone new or if i really do like him. i want to get closer to him and spend more time with him but i dont want to seem clingy. We only interact when we see each other in school. if we message each other its only because i initiate the conversation. what should i do??
-
 
I'm a 2 year old guy who's never been in a relationship. Let alone touched a girl in an intimate way. I'm currently studying engineering at uni and I feel that I would be single for life(hey it's 27 years of being single, what are the chances of things changing..zilch or close to Anyway.) 

I fell for this girl in my first year but things did not work out. Ever since then things slipped into sadness and depressed mode and I've ended up making a vow to myself that I should never feel for a girl or ever even think about liking her again. 

At the same time as i don't ever want to fall for another girl. I don't think I will get married as well. So I also had wished to maybe consider adopting a child to form a mini family of my own(and maybe even die a virgin..probably) I've given up all hope on finding a relationship and even considered being a very mean/jerk/douche guy to every girl I meet and know except my mother. Cos frankly most of them deserved it but I can't because I've been brought up the wrong way of being kind and gentlemanly to people(pun intended.) 

So what is your opinion on this? Isit worth sticking to my plan of probably just having an adopted son or should I rethink my life planning?
-
 
I spent 3 semesters knowing this girl. Well we were from the same society in NUS. Naturally our interaction was frequent. Yesterday evening, I confessed to her. She was surprised, but told me that she had feelings for me too. However she said she would have to reject me as she wants someone who is academically superior to her. Her rationale was that someone who is academically superior would get a good job, thereby giving her the security that she or rather girls sought after.

I can't even... where do I go from here ?
-
 
i recently met up with my friends from secondary school and we had a catchup session since we had not seen each other for a pretty long time. Then most of them had started talking about their ex gf/bf and all their heartbreaks and all the good times they had and whatnot. I, being an evergreen for 26 solid years had nothing to say and felt very left out. When i had pointed this out, my friends claimed that i was very lucky not to have had a heartbreak and that i should not feel that way. But i seem to yearn for that day i would meet my SO. Although it seems pretty unlikely(im not being negative, just looking at myself by gauging the past when all the girls i confessed to rejected me.). So, what i would want to know is that are they right when they say that im better off as i am right now? And any legit advice for an fat old man like me to find a partner might help as well. Thanks for reading :)
-
 
Advice needed. How do guys hint girls that they don't like them? I need to validate where I stand with this guy that has always been my best friend and I'm unsure what I feeling towards him.
-
 
In the past two years I thought I am fine alone and did not pay much attention to relation. Now I am in my 3rd year and all of sudden loneliness is striking me hard. Now that I look around, all those girls I know seem to have their partner. I have no idea where to start.
-
 
He must be totally 100% not interested in me right? I mean, it has been a year since our last meeting and he has yet to contact me at all. No texts/calls etc. Even if he is THAT busy, cannot be so busy until it's as though he disappeared from the face of this earth? Hahaha *bitter laugh
-
 
Prof: Everything is on Wikipedia. I just tell you what to type. 
Thanks ah, but I think a 12 year old kid can tell me that without having to pay 7k a year

Does anyone know, what happened to the fishes and turtles, at S3 Level 5? Instead of being culled, I hope they were given, sold or at least dissected for science.

I used to look at them, the few things in school, that could offer me some comfort and hope. Wherever they went, I wish them the best, in their current and future lives.
-
 
So for the past few weeks I have been noticing this girl in my CCA. She looked really cute, and after noticing how she interacts with people, she seems like the type who can get along with me. I can't exactly get along with most people as I am the shy and awkward type.

Being the evergreen shy guy that I am, I deliberated over whether I should confess to her for quite some time, and I basically mustered up my courage to ask her out a few days ago.

The words came out slurred and choppy as I was nervous as hell, and long story short she said we don't know each other that well yet to be dating. This is kind of true considering the fact that I haven't spoken to her at all prior to the confession.

So does that mean that I don't have a chance? Or should I get to be her friend first before asking her out again? I am so confused.

To  and ,

My ex dumped me on 1st Jan. It was a painful start to a new year, but I'm now so glad he broke up with me.

I wish you both all the best in your healing! Maybe one day you'll be celebrating the breakup on your birthday...Who knows?

who here got an email from their faculty asking for a meetup due to their low academic scores?? my cap dropped to around 2.5 cos of a bad sem and im really scared rn :( 

it seems like this sem is already to a bad start:( can someone advice me on how to go about improving my cap? i have been keeping up with the lectures and tutorials and its been so painful this semester. its my first time doing my assignments before the tutorials and while it seems like i got my shit together this sem, I didnt need this scary wakeup call from nus honestly... I know my cap is bad and im working towards making it better. Im getting so many panic attacks from this I just want to come out of this and work hard :( 
ive been feeling pretty suicidal the past few days as I dont know if I can pull my scores up in time.

everything seems like its crashing down on me, and to make matters worse, my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me... I know employers/nus wont take this as a reason but its been so hard for me to see the good in life anymore. I cant name one good thing that has happened to me ever since uni started. Ive been losing my faith in God and this is coming from a girl who prays and gives thanks to God even when the bus arrives on time. I dont know if choosing NUS was the right decision at this point in time. 

Im in a challenging/difficult course and Ive tried to change faculty in sem1 but they rejected me. I lost hope in applying in sem2 because my cap was so bad. I mean the reason WHY i would want to change fac is because I cannot do well RIGHT?? So this sem, I decided to turn all these challenges into something positive. It has taken a long time, but I have finally come to terms with my challenging course. 

I just need someone to tell me its all going to be alright in the end, because my faith is waning and its becoming hard to live a happy life with all these matters burdening my life. 
theres really nothing more i want in life than to improve my grades and to be a happier person, I just need the motivation and i couldnt find any other place to rant than here. :( 

For all the well wishers on this page, could you all offer a short prayer for me ? even though you may not know me, or know exactly what im going through, to those who will pray for me, thank you :)

tell me, what kind of guy would break up with his gf on her birthday?
-
 
I feel like I'm always in need of validation. If I do something, and I feel it's wrong and I talk it out with someone and they say its fine, I feel better. But it makes me feel like I don't have my own opinion :(
Not only that, I think I spend too much time thinking about whether guys think I'm attractive (no plot twists, I'm a girl). When I step out of the house feeling like I look good I keep wondering if guys would agree with me. I wonder if anyone notices me or takes a second glance. And I, being one of the minority ethnicities, also wonder how much my own ethnicity plays a part in how people see and judge my looks.

 it's okay, my gf dumped me on my birthday too.

Don't we all hate it when we make an appointment with people and they cancel it at the last minute? Come on guys, I've already reached!!!

so i'm a girl, and i've always been single. i mean, some guys have asked me to go steady before but i didn't have feelings for them so we remained friends. i recently developed a crush on this guy. but a voice inside me is telling me that i'm not good enough for him so i shouldn't even bother trying )': i don't know why i'm feeling this way. i could use some advice ): 
-
 
I secretly liked you quite a bit but I never told you. I don't feel any affection from your end, and sometimes you don't seem to care about me at all. I'm very scared that you know how I feel and that's why you're putting distance. And now I'm scared you know how I feel so I'm putting distance. It's all rather silly. 

Anyway you said you're not ready for a relationship and you're enjoying being single (is that a subtle hint that you're not interested in me?) Anyway, I being the evergreen I am, am kinda scared by the idea of a relationship since I feel like I can't match up to your ex and your experiences.  

Oh well. I'm just going to kill these feelings and hope we can even stay as friends.

My significant other is overseas now. I want to give her some gifts on her birthday. As I have not deliver anything overseas in my life before, can any kind souls who are familiar with this help me on what is the procedure?

Not sure what it is, but since around 2 semesters ago, there have suddenly been a fair few girls in UTown who seem to be wearing long dresses to Starbucks. 

So different from typical shorts and t shirt that for awhile i thought it was kind of weird. Till i realised that i like women in long dresses :x sadly now i don't have much time to be there to people watch anymore  haha 

Also girls in sundresses. Not because of anything but it's different :)

How can I learn to deal with regrets and poor decisions I've made in my life? :( 

I have so many regrets. I regret not studying harder for A levels to study in my dream course. I regret spending almost my first 2 years hating my current course that I fell behind so much, when I should have sucked it up and worked my bum off. I regret not joining any clubs and ccas. I regret not joining halls. I regret not being more sociable because I was spending so much of my time hating my course. Now that I'm graduating soon, I feel like I've wasted my entire university life. I wish I could turn back time. There are so many things I would have done so much differently. :(

Please help me. These regrets are eating me up inside everyday. :(

There was this girl that I got really close to a few months back. Messaging the entire day, updating each other about tiny details in our lives. Back then, I was deeply troubled by some emotional issues but talking to her, being with her always made me forget about all these problems, even if it's just for a little while. Initially I thought I only treated her as a friend or a little sister. I even teased and tried to match-make her with a common friend. For reasons unknown, I tend to mention her a lot in my conversations with another circle of friends and they kept asking me if I'm interested in her. At that time, I repeatedly deny it. Sometimes I even asked myself the same question but I always thought that it's nothing more than friendship. 

Fast forward to today, I no longer message her anymore. One fine day she suddenly decided to stop messaging, claiming that she was busy. And we no longer have the chance to see each other in person. It's like we have cut off all contact. As the days go by, i find myself thinking about her more and more. Little things on the streets remind me of her. Every new instagram photo induces a cascade of emotions. I'm not sure but I think I'm starting to fall for her.

Why do I not feel a thing when she's so close by and then start to have all these feelings when she's so far away. "You will never know the value of what you have until you lose it." I  could finally truly appreciate the meaning of this phrase.

Why do attached guys and girls always have to bring their partners along for every outing with their own groups of friends? Undeniably, it's good to introduce your so to your friends. But please people, if you already know it is a group outing, do not bring your so along. There's a time and place for everything and leave your dates to the one on ones. Do not even bother asking for "permission" because honestly, no one is as thick skin as you to tell you for fear of ruining the friendship, but it doesn't mean they like your self-initiative to bring your so along for every single group outing. So please, unless you want to appear like an insensitive douche, do not ask buay zi dong questions. 

Stop trying to make your so a part of the group because relationships can never be forced. They will just find this annoying and see your so as being overly sticky which defeats your initial intentions.

Don't feel sorry for not being able to hold on to your loved ones. It's hard when they're all you think about. It get worse when you realise you won't be sending each other texts as often, calling each other and having carefree conversations like you used to. Everything the two of you once had is now gone. 

It's tough to accept it. Nights spent crying and thinking how you could have done things differently. Train/bus rides home listening to your music when suddenly a wave of emotions comes crashing back. Trying to see how they're doing and how they're moving on by stalking their social media accounts twice a day. 

Future may seem bleak, you'll definitely feel lost, but one day you'll be over it and one day you'll be glad and relieved to know that you're no longer held on by all these emotional baggage. 

You are never alone. Hopefully they'll be people who like this post in support of this and realise that countless of people are facing the same problems just as you are.

Hi i got a story to tell. Some time ago there is this evergreen boy. He went to NUS. Being evergreen that he is, he jump to conclusion that any girl he was slightly closer to is a potential dating partner. But soon he convinced himself, after seeing that that those girls are close with the other guys as well, that they are just being friendly. But there is this particular girl that the feeling is much stronger.

But he just couldnt wave off those feelings! But he kept supressing his feelings, telling himself and his friends that nope, he dont like her! But the feelings just doesnt go away. 

And now the story becomes worse, and close friend openly say that he likes her, and frequently text the girl in front of him. He is now very sad..

So whats the answer to this problem? Why life is so hard

Everyday I struggle with self-doubt in my work. I'm always afraid of overlooking figures or news in reports, pressing the wrong button and clicking the wrong options, because sometimes I/people can be careless like that, no matter how cautious and careful you usually are. Just a wrong move and I can lose a huge amount of my clients' money. So far, I haven't made any mistake, but I've seen people making those mistakes and the consequences weren't pleasant to say the least. I'm super paranoid and terrified that I'll commit such a mistake one day. It really is a battleground out there.

One year ago, i first saw you during a camp. Didnt get a chance to interact with you during the camp, but somehow you just catches my attention. maybe bcuz you are high profile or bcuz the councillors kept mentioning your name or maybe its bcuz of your cute braces-smile. wanted to talk to you during the finale night but i thought it would be weird for a freshie to approach the ocomm members randomly, so yea i didnt muster the courage in the end.
 
after the camp, i decided to join some volunteering programmes and projects, hoping to get to know you more through volunteering. didnt get to see you during regular volunteering sessions, but i was so happy to see you again in one of the volunteering projects. But you are always surrounded by girls ): so again, i didnt dare to approach you

alright, i dont know what is the point of this confession. i guess it is just one of those nights when i am thinking of you. hope to see you again soon!

My friend told me that when you go for SEP with the opposite gender and if parties on both sides are single, there would be lots of stuff that could happen. Is that true? Anyone has experiences/stories to share?
-
 
I'm the OP for . With regards to treating them the same as my guy friends, I don't really much basis of comparison because I hardly hang out with guys (I only have like 2 guy friends whom I regularly talk to).  But I'll maybe take note.

Thing is, I'm quite reactive. I think the friends I've mentioned tend to get on a good footing with each other, to the extent that we eventually start talking random stuff in a matter of time/go out for food etc. And they would leave me notes, gifts or nice texts, and I feel happy at that, so I would try to reciprocate. I just try to be nicer if you are nice to me (and I guess it happens quite often), so should I 'tone it down?'

Recently, I have been hitting the gym on a daily basis. Will you be my girlfriend when i attain that hunk body figure?? 

Please do not reject me when that day arrive. I won't be able to handle your rejection and I will degrade myself by becoming a social escort =(

I have a confession to make.

The half truth: I tell my friends that I stay back in school till the next day of lectures to study since I cannot study at home. I don't stay in any residences or halls or anything of that sort, just finding a comfy sofa would do.

The whole truth is that I can't go home if there's no home to go back to. 
What remains is an empty house, filled with so much negativity and "independence" that no one talks to each other. There is no "how's your day?" or "let's eat together.". 

No discussion on politics, current affairs, life in general, friends- nothing. There's no signs of family life. What remains is a void that was once filled with happier, simpler times and when I start my own family, I'm so determined to change that because it seems impossible now.

Any advice?

I'm in a science course where everyone in a level sticks together. I'd been with a girl prior to entering this course, we broke up recently while I was doing my summer internship. 
I got over her pretty quickly, partly because I could feel that the breakup was imminent. But partly because I was falling for another girl. Perhaps she is just a rebound. 
She is my senior, a cute senior. I've never got the courage to tell her. She's attached and is still attached, I was attached. Things didn't progress, and now I am back in school to suffer for a long period before it's all going to be over. I'd think about her once in a while when my stress hits a certain level. 
I think sometimes tilting a balance will bring the original state to the left instead of right. 
Missing you on...

I'm a slightly unfit freshie in Utown and I'm really interested in learning how to dance. I'm just worried that I'm not physically fit enough to handle it, and everytime I think about gymming, I feel really intimidated by all the buff Team NUS guys. Anybody care to give advice?
-
 
My friends said guys in science are very shy and they don't take initiatives to chase those girls they like. Is it true? What will you guys do if you like someone? My crush is from science, so I really want to know.

The society is so tiring. My friends ask me before, eh why you always sit alone in class. Eh you no friends is it. 

I'm those quiet ones. I don't talk much. Cos when I talk, I stutter. My pronunciation is not good. And I know from experience ppl don't like to hear me talk.

So I practise silence. Silence is golden. But sometimes I feel a bit sad. I yearn for ppl to sit beside me in class. Ppl to eat with me. But at the same time, I'm afraid that being myself will make ppl leave me. I'm like a magnet that is neither attractive or repulsive. Oh that is a normal metal haha.

Do girls judge guys who reveal about their vulnerability? Was having lunch with a girl today and I felt that both of our personality are so similar that I felt a connection with her.  I revealed a bit too much of my loneliness/insecurities to her and I feel bad now.  I am afraid she will judge me for being weak etc 
-
 
I'm at that awkward place where my current SO and I are realizing we don't have long-term chemistry, but haven't done anything to each other that's worthy of a break-up. I'm feeling that it might be time to move on, but I'm not sure if that's fair to him. What should I do?
-
 
This is my first post here and I am not sure whether there will be a second one.

My result is unexpectedly good. Did 2 internships in big companies. Had leadership positions in 3 different CCA. Currently doing FYP with Prof really happy about my project proposal. Part timing in relatively big firm also. (Yaah, for those who like to bash OP who boost this kind of stuff, please by all means bash/bully/comment this post, gladly accept it)
I have some people that I can call friends. Some people even thought that I am their close friends. They share their secrets saying that I am good listener (I'm INFP btw), and never share it with others. They trust me they said. And I never betray their trust.
The only thing is, good listener is not always a good speaker. I will never ever share my story with them.

I still don't know why I want share it here but just want to rant I think

Day: Dad kisses my cheek saying "Have fun in school!" Mom makes me breakfast & sometimes pack my lunch (Don't judge me, I still bring lunch to school okay, mom's cooking is the best!) 

Night: Dad takes out his belt, while saying " I told you not to hang out with XXX/YYY/ZZZ! Make u not focusing on study! Delay ur graduation also! Faster work!" Mom just watches me while drinking her favorite beer. Or sometimes sleeping pills. (Lucky no gambling problems)
Red/blue black, pain, scars everywhere. Lucky they're hidden under my clothes. :)

Probably if I tell my close friend about my story they will just say "You are 24 years old boy leh! Fight back! Report to police! or MSF!"
It's not that easy u know, I love them. but I hate them. And I really hate hating them. But I can't help it. I love and hate them.

Lucky I don't have any siblings. If not I can't imagine them going thru same experience.

Seems my family is the best representative of family in drama/manga/ series . Happy family outside, inside.... oh well.

I used to think that it's normal to have this kind of family. It was only when I was in JC then I realized that my family is an odd one, different from other families. 

I really don't know why I'm sharing this now and in this platform. Just bored and tired I guess... Too tired to run, but still want to run from this reality. 

Yaah, probably my story might not be believable to some people. Too harsh to be true I guess, but I leave it to you all to decide.

Sorry for the long post!
Don't have a potato, coz my father just threw few some at me for coming home quite late and miss dinner  :/

Social events are my kryptonite.  With so many events lined up in the coming few months I wonder how I am going to skip them without looking like a complete anti-social and weirdo. I love to connect with people but why do I have to pretend I am not? I just wish to hang out with my besties and chill together:/
Please don’t put me inside a big group of people I don’t know. I know I put myself in this situation because I want to force myself to socialize and try to change my personality. I thought that if I tried hard enough I might really change but I failed. I just wish my children would not have to go through what I do through. Shyness and introversion have been the bane of my life. It is hard to love yourself when you are constantly forced to feel that you are different in this environment. 

Hang in there.  I can do this!

-
 
I think I am starting to fall for you but I think I have missed the timing completely. I'm sorry if I seemed to jokingly brush off remarks of us being stirred together for the past few months as I didn't know how I should react, given that I am not exactly demure nor am I pretty or skinny. Hope I didn't completely missed it and it is salvageable. 
-
 
Wah.... really buey tahan. Sorry I need to complain about this. I cannot accept statements from girls that claim they are "above average in terms of look". First thing is how you know where is the average among all the girls? Ok ok. Even if you think you know what the average girl looks like, how the heck can you say you are ABOVE the average so confidently? Maybe it is just me but the two things "above average" just screams ignorant to me and turns me off totally.

To  OP:
I am an alumni. Uni life was lonely for me too. I entered a course without any friends, and struggled through a major I didn't like. There were times when I cried thinking how life was unfair. But I sucked it up and decided to push on regardless. After all, getting the cert only benefits me, and will be stuck with me for life. So might as well put in my best.

Fast forward to the present, I am working now, have lost a loved one, and have to deal with workplace politics. How life can be unfair is magnified multifolds. Nice ppl are shoved to one side. Everyone is selfish, including me. Yet I chide myself everytime Others exhibit that character towards me, thinking that everything is my fault. Even though I am friendly towards my colleagues, the workplace competition is so intense that one cannot have a true friend to confide in. There are many days whereby I feel down, yet am compelled to keep up with appearances. Loneliness has never been more apparent in a place whereby you think you have friends, when all you have are enemies. Work life has put a toll on me, and I have lost touch with a majority of them. I barely have a handful of friends left. And everytime they ask about how I am doing, my reply has always been negative. I am forever complaining.  

Someone once told me that "everywhere you go is the same: same s**t, different pot". Though I am not the best person to advise you on how to live your life, I know that losing a close family member makes you question about the meaning of life, when the person you've been living for, striving to do your best for, is gone. Everything just seems trivial that you just don't care anymore.

I have an inferiority complex too. I purposely chose to wear oversized clothes to hide my unsightly body, and often get remarks on my bad dress sense and how my clothes are so baggy. These comments obviously make me feel even more inferior about myself. But I know that I am not dressing to attract the opposite sex, so it doesn't matter how I dress.

So I understand how you feel, but in a slightly different context. I dread every working day and go to work thinking "FML". But I do what I can to get by emotionally, hoping and praying that I can go to the place my dearly departed has gone, soon.
-
 
I don't know who to talk to about my break up because all my friends seem to have bigger problems in their lives or are having so much fun with their SO and other new friends. I feel like a freaking burden.
-
 
I just found out something disturbing. A friend of mine has been accepting invitations to be fwbs from guys she meet from certain apps. In her defense, she makes sure the guys are actually legit. Thing is. Some of these guys are attached. 
This is what I cannot understand. Isn't it the most basic rule to keep your hands off those who are attached? If you're out to have fun, fine nobody can stop you from having some fun, but seriously? Does being the third party adds to the excitement? Or people just don't give a shit about it? 
Similarly, in milder cases, people should know better than to flirt with attached persons. This is to both guys and girls alike. Of course you can be friends, but know the boundaries. It will not feel good to be the partner of someone who always receives overly-excited texts from people of the opposite gender over small nothings and mundane chats. If you're that bored, go find something else to do or at least not an attached person to play with.
-
 
I want a nice house. A big condo. 

I want a nice car. A branded big car

I want long holidays. A far, expensive holidays. 

But if having all that, means not having you to enjoy whatever little we have together, than I don't want them all. 

I rather have a small flat, with u inside.
I rather have a small car, with you in it. 
I rather have short holidays, together with you. 

Doesn't matter what I have in the future. It matters who I have it with. And life, as we soon realize, is not about what you have. But who you have it with.

Don't we all have this friend who scores really well but always claims that he/she is terrible, will fall on the left side of the bell curve, will help you because he/she will confirm score super low?

I have such a friend and I am so conflicted. On one hand, he is great as a friend. On the other hand, I cannot stand it when he keeps claiming he sucks. I cannot do the tutorials while he does them easily even though he proclaimed that the tutorial is "super hard this time". He claims he failed his exams but scores A+ and A while I score B... then when I tell him that I score really low, he claims he is "lucky". Wow, in that case, can I have some of that "luck"?

Guys how do you feel when your girlfirend writes you letters or give you gifts or surprise you? Been with my boyfriend for 2 years, but everytime I give him a letter etc, he has no reaction. Just read, puts it aside and say nothing. Am I not doing enough? Any girls who are in the same situation as me? It's like I put in so much effort preparing and all, but he just doesn't show that he appreciates it. Can't help but to feel upset.
-
 
I used to have a really close bunch of friends and we hang out all the time talking all kinds of nonsense. But ever since some of them got attached, their whole life revolves around their SO and i kind of pity them because they seem to have no other friends other than their SO :-(  its like they spend all the time in school and at home, be it studying, eating, going out etc. Im not being jealous here, because i do have my own SO and i really love her a lot, but i do miss those times when we were all single and carefree :-( 
-
 
If you like a guy, would you wait for hours and hours before texting him back? I feel so frustrated when the girl would reply in a group chat and not text me back.:(

And when she does text me back, I will reply according to the roughly the same duration in which she makes me wait. This results in a vicious cycle. Oh man.

everything that i loved is either dead of has walked out of my life.

To OP of ,

People are going to judge, and yes I agree that we'll all be affected by judgements somehow. But it's up to you whether you think that he is worth it. If he is, why give up the opportunity of what could be a lifelong relationship? I have 2 cousins who met their partners in a club, and I would most certainly say that my extended family judged them for that. (Behind their backs of course) They said that the relationships wouldn't last a year. Fast forward 4 years, one couple is still happily together, and another couple just got married this year. If you think he's worth it, go for it. You never know.
-
 
You know the kind of guys and girls who everyone likes and loves because they're smart, good-looking, witty, and have a good personality? The kind where everyone assumes that they have tons of suitors? I'm one of those people (or at least that's what everyone tells me), and when people ask me upfront why I'm still single, I really don't know.
-
 
Sometimes I just feel like my bf wants to breakup with me whenever I'm having PMS
-
 
I think I might have creeped out some females due to my tendency to be "a nice guy". Thing is, I was never interested in them at all; I don't have that kind of attraction to females; I just thought I should do certain things as I was their friend (and friends disappoint from time to time, and as a friend, I want to avoid that). If I think I can help it, I do it. 

Is there a need to make myself clear or something? Feeling whether I need to change some things, cause some of these friends are relatively close (ie I hang out with them from time to time)

So basically I recently got rejected by my crush and I learnt many lessons from this episode and I would like to share it here. 

The notion of love
The greatest change that happened after this episode was the way I saw love. I was too young, naive, idealistic. I thought he was 'the one', and somehow everything would eventually fall into place and he would be mine. After all, he checked all my boxes and there can never be anyone more perfect than him. Now the heavens would create the perfect environment for him to magically realise that he loved me as much as I loved him. It was the perfect fairytale. However, evidently this wasn't the case considering that he is now happily in love - just not with me, but a random girl he met in SEP. I realise now that love is a construct, and he can only be 'the one' AFTER all the stars have aligned and the feelings were mutual. Just like how he probably thinks that she is 'the one', because the stars have aligned for them with the perfect opportunities to get close, the right environment, the same bouts of homesickness. Just like how it doesn't matter how much I sacrificed for him - joining year-long committees I didn't like so I could get another sentence of conversation with him, replacing my own hobbies with his, texting him into late at night while he was at SEP just because he briefly mentioned that he felt a little disengaged from his life back in SG although I was dead tired from weeks of camp preparation; he decided to choose the other girl whom he enjoyed his weeks of SEP with. This brings me to my next point: the loss of the sense of self.

With all these sacrifices, I unknowingly fell into an abyss of self-denial to the point that I lost myself. I didn't engage in the activities I loved anymore; no more ball games, going to museums, reading non-fiction, discussing politics because he just wasn't as interested in them as I was. Instead, I spent my time listening to mainstream pop, watching concerts, joining high-profile CCAs so as to mimic his likes and interests in the hope that he would notice me more or just spend 5 more seconds in conversation with me. After the rejection, my friends urged me to take up activities that used to like. I was doubtful that I actually liked them anymore after 1 year of pretending to like what he liked but I went anyway. And I felt joy, unparalleled joy. It was the joy of finding myself after a year of self-denial and trust me, you would have never appreciated the idea of your individual identity  so much if he haven't lost it before. 

In conclusion, I now feel that people should never sacrifice so much effort, time, and most importantly your sense of self for someone that might not see it, or have seen it but still proceeds to choose someone else anyway. I do not mean that everyone should be selfish and not chase for what you desire, but be wise on the amount of sacrifice you give for a person, or you might end up being hurt as deeply as I have.

I got many guys hitting on me and flirting with me, but none of them are the genuine kind of guys, and they can be quite superficial (I guess I'm above average in terms of appearance). C'mon, I'm ready for a relationship! I don't want anymore attention, I just want a nice guy who likes me not for my looks, but for my personality. And no, I'm not desperate, just feel let down by the guys I'm attracting.
-
 
Sometimes I wish I had an older brother who wasn't mentally disabled. I know it's an awful thing to say, but I'm tired of taking care of him. My life revolves around my brother. My mother expects that I'll take care of him when she passes on, but I honestly don't know if I want to. I just feel like I cannot live my life.

So if girls who are yet mature go for bad boys, while those who are mature will quietly sit and wait for good guys, hence be a good guy?

Mai la, since u say gals will mature, and we know these good boys can turn bad and likely vice versa, how abt these good boys all be bad boys and enjoy while waiting for the gals to mature then switch back to a good boy? Best of both worlds right?

My significant other is not from Singapore and don't live in Singapore ( in fact she live very far away ) and can only visit me twice a year since both of us are quite busy and we are not very rich either. Moreover, she does not speak much English. But somehow we seem to enjoy each other's accompany when we meet up and I am always look forward for those days. We are soon going to enter the third year of our relationship. Some of my friends thought that I am crazy to date someone who is living far alway from Singapore and does not speak much English. I am pretty upset by this. Don't they know love is beyond geographical boundaries and language barrier. But it seems easy for me to just say that but I really need some advice on this, will our relationship work out?

Was once fat and ugly. Starting going to the gym and is now just ugly. But that did not stop girls from swooning over me.

So many relationship posts, I figured I could try and give some advice from experience. 
I used to have a crush on a guy in my class back in high school, after three months of secretly liking him I couldn't stand it anymore and straight out confessed. He didn't like me, but being a gr8 guy he was still willing to continue being my friend, even with my stubborn feelings for him.

 So, 1) if you really wanna burst with your feelings for someone, tell them. Pent up feelings are never fun. Even if things get awkward after a while,  try to keep up a (non-despo)  conversation, sooner or later the awkwardness will disappear. 

Don't even talk about being in the friend zone. Hell, you should be glad that you're still friends, if you truly "care about the friendship" rather than trying to get into their pants. If you even start to think about that, take a step back and question your motives about starting a friendship in the first place

Fast forward 2 years of unrequited crush that WONT GO AWAY he started to like me too, and we carefully ventured out into a relationship with each other. 

2)a relationship means being independent together. Learn how to be alone without constantly spamming your crush with messages and expecting a reply. Learn how to spend time alone. It's not a easy thing, but it is so important to be independent, because a rs should not be you relying on someone else to be complete. 

Because I grew a habit to rant to him about my feelings, our disagreements don't usually have a chance to fester into something huge and gross, and we make it a point to meet up every week, especially during the weekends when he books out of camp. 

3)TALK TO EACH OTHER. Communication is so, so important in a rs, and messages aren't enough to convey feelings. If you can call, call. If you can meet up, plan a date. It doesn't have to take up an entire day, just an hour for dinner and enjoying each other's company is enough. Talk out problems face to face. Don't hide your discomforts. But this doesn't mean to blow up at each other JFC, discuss. Nicely. Try to agree on a middle ground if the problem seems to  affect the rs. Remember that you will be one of the greatest support pillars for your so. Act like it. Relationships are never smooth sailing, don't even try to pretend it is. Take challenges as they come together, work through it as a couple. There are so many ways it can go wrong, but as long as you are willing to fight for that one path of happiness, it'll work out. 

And holy shit don't say that "your partner doesn't deserve you, they are much better than you". Don't. By saying that, you are putting your partner on a pedestal, and it's not healthy. You both have flaws, and if you think you are lacking, work to make up for it instead of pushing your partner away when they really want to help you. Grow as a person, and grow together. 
(ps if you think your partner isn't good enough for you, you are a horrible person. Stop it) 

Sorry for the long post, but I hope it helps

SOoOoO...about a year ago i met this guy and he became my friend quite quickly...and as you would probably guess i developed a crush on him...last semester i confessed to him but he wasn't interested. we are still friends but he mentioned that we shouldn't be alone together (i dont know why he said that). so to help me get over him i didnt contact him the whole summer and it worked i was over him....but now our paths cross quite often and recently he has been initiating meetups and conversations (only when we see each other..he never messages me) Does that mean anything? is he suddenly interested now? Or i am thinking to much about it?

I just counted, it's been four years and it surprised me how much time has passed. four years on and I haven't quite moved on from our failed friendship. school back then was so bad for me, I almost wanted to ask for a repeat of year to escape it. but I didn't because my future >>>>> bitches who bully wtf. because of you, I was able to get through the really dark days. my skies looked better. with you around. and those lame and stupid jokes.

I still don't understand why did you have to go. I don't think I can ever understand it. I still think of you once in a while. tonight is one of them. and everytime I think of you, I catch myself wishing you well. wishing you safe. 

maybe one day, we'll meet again. I don't know when, where or how. but till then stranger. study hard, live well.

I am the OP of . Thank you to all the girls who had offered useful suggestions and thoughts on such issues. I am glad to know that I am probably not the only one who keeps having sexual thoughts during the ovulation period. I always thought that from the people around me, usually it's the guys who talk sexual stuff but not so much from girls. Thus I assumed that girls generally have lower sex drive/doesn't have sexual thoughts. On the other hand, don't you all think it's puzzling that hormones, which is simply a protein, can exert such great effect on the mind to make you think of sex and to the extent of making you touch yourself subconsciously sometimes even as you tried to control it. Oh well the power of how Mother Nature created us to be haha

To people who doesn't reply their messages after seeing them, think about people who are waiting for result after their interviews for jobs. At least give a reply saying that you do not wish to continue the conversation, the victim would not have to continue waiting your reply and it is less hurting... T.T

Hi, guys. So there's this one girl who I'm currently interested in and would like to know her better. The thing is, I'm am evergreen and personally, I think I am easily anxious and not so sociable and hence, I'm not good at starting and holding conversation with an opposite sex. 

So to those who are already experienced, what are some tips or cues that I can use to make me appear less boring and quiet? Apparently, her best friend told me that she doesn't really appreciate a guy that is too quiet. 
-
 
A few years back I was told that I was not pretty enough to be the girlfriend of a guy who was interested in me by others. So over the next few years I lost weight, got clearer skin, experimented with clothes, basically fixed myself. What seemed to my family and friends as normal growing up behavior to beautify myself was actually driven by fear and sadness so that I would never be told that I was not good enough for anyone anymore. Well I actually managed to become much prettier and guys started paying attention to me. But no matter how much I changed on the outside, I am still the same person and I always feel jaded about relationships as I really do think that guys really just want pretty girls. So I had to buy expensive skincare products and starve myself so that guys would like me. How romantic. Whatever happened to my character. Why must there be a certain standard to be loved by someone else. As depressing as this sounds I consider it reality.

If there is a pill that when upon consumption, erases all traces of your existence in this world (i.e. you just *poof* disappear, with all records and logs of you erased, and memories of you wiped from your friends and family, and the stuff you left behind become nobody's), would you be tempted to take it?

my bromance is unrivaled. be jealous, be very jealous!

When girls claimed that they have many suitors, do they mean

1) many guys confessing to her
2) many guys getting her number
3) many guys stealing glances and trying to find opportunity to talk to her?

Just curious on what you guys think.

I am a year 3 science student and quite a while ago i found my other half. I love his attention and he dotes on me alot, like he will send me home almost everyday, even after his work. 
The thing is, my friends find it annoying when my bf wants to tag along for outings. I mean I can feel it when they became so cold towards us.
Because of these tensions, my close friends became not so close anymore. It feels like I dont have any real friends anymore. I just hope that they will stop being jealous of my lovely bf and stop bad mouthing behind me.

Just wondering if there are any (legally/officially) married students in NUS? (undergrad, around age range of 19-27 approx.) and do you two live together alone or with either one's parents? how's the general experience of being married so young? :) just curious!

I'm not really sure why so many OPs here think that "awkwardness" is something that should be abhorrently avoided, especially in terms of "I don't want to spoil our friendship/make things awkward so how do I confess/turn down their confession". 

To put it most blandly, things are going to get awkward as soon as one party wants something more than the other party wants. As much as everybody wants everybody to get along, the reality is that once this sort of situation occurs, it's unavoidable that someone is going to get hurt.

If you somehow do manage to maintain the status quo by not doing anything, then all this leads to is to increasing stress on at least one of the persons involved even if you yourself are very happy with the current status of your relationships.

So, why try to preserve the status quo in the interests of "avoiding awkwardness" when doing so is just basically moral self-indulgence for prolonging the pain of one or more parties involved?
-
 
As much as I don't want to admit, I secretly like you a lot. You were always so sweet to me, that I can't help but fall for you. But I know you don't want a relationship right now, and I don't even know if you'll ever see me in that light. And, you are so innocent that I don't want to risk losing our precious friendship by confessing to you. So, I can only enjoy your presence while resisting the urge to recklessly reveal my true colors. Already my intentions of treating you as more than just a friend is starting to show in my actions. Maybe it's a good thing that you don't want a relationship so soon, the news of you getting a partner would make me incredibly disappointed and sad even though I know I should be happy for you.

Word. Im a girl and im at my horniest during ovulation and when im stressed. I watch porn almost regularly (this i admit i must stop, its almost becoming an addiction) and i touch myself too. Youre only human and normal. dont feel bad over your sexuality.

I read the post where the OP got into a relationship with a senior 5 years older. I do acknowledge the difficulties of such a relationship, be it from parents or even from the whole world judging.

I was just wondering: what is the general consensus of guys with regards to dating older girls? Is there a cap on the age gap?

I have been getting close to a guy who's younger... I'm just not so sure whether everything is out of his respect for me as a senior... as a result I'm in a dilemma as to whether to invest more feelings or to take a step back in case I get hurt... Also, some friends would also tell me that if I were to really take a step further, I need to be prepared to be judged by the world.

Our attitudes towards love nowadays are just so full of trepidations huh?

Hi! I refer to ! This is a post to all those 'good guys' who want to become 'bad' because they think that's the way to win a girl's heart. I am a girl who has been through what your friend has been through and I really want to advice you to the following: If you become like one of those guys, sure, and i can guarantee you, you'll get a lot more girls chasing after you! But what kind of girls do you want to date? girls that can take care of themselves, or girls that can't? The reason why these girls accept shit from guys, is because they don't know how to love themselves and put themselves first. they think that love is constantly making excuses for the guy when they have done something wrong, thinking that doing such a thing makes them 'nice' and 'patient' and 'tolerant' 'for love'. the truth is, these girls are insecure about themselves, and think that having someone else's love and attention can fill up this void in their heart which should come from their own self-worth. There are many girls like that and I have been through it too. Hence, if the girl you are looking for fits the above description, go for it, but I think you know that the girl you want is someone that can really love you right, that you can love right as well. After all, these girls will grow and mature, learning to love themselves and wouldn't want to date guys like that anymore... that is if they have learnt their lesson. They will know what they want and not want when looking for love, especially when they're finding a long term partner. They will look for a nice guy who can support her, appreciate her for who she is and make her happy. Not someone who takes her for granted. (take care of your friend, i'm sure she needs you right now.)

Hello everyone,  a socially awkward male turtle here. Somehow throughout my 21 years on planet earth, I have not learnt how to interact with girls. I could never find the right topics to talk about as my mind is always blank when I am with them. Whenever I see guys talking to girls with ease and making them laugh, I wonder wtf is wrong with me, as girls always seem bored as hell when they are talking to me.

This issue has been plaguing me since forever and it has prevented me from getting any close female friends at all, much less a girlfriend. And it certainly doesn't help that I am currently in a course where 9 out of 10 people are sausages.

Can I get some advice as to how can I form closer relationship with girls?

Why is my confession always rejected...

to the OP in  : Girl I feel for you, and stay strong! You are really brave to have done what you've done to be the person you are now. You are also a keeper yourself too. Your situation is not an easy one to solve, and I hope you manage to contact him and sort things out with him soon. He deserves an answer, and so do you. Keep us updated on your status!

to  I'm actually around 1.73 cm too! Hi-5. That height is pretty rare amongst Singaporean girls (or Asian girls for that matter). Perhaps... guys could be intimidated by that height?? Anyways, what's the point of having a lot of guys chasing after you just for the attention? I'd rather just have one meaningful conversation with one guy/get to know him better. Just wait patiently for the one who would appreciate/love you as you are, or you could try and take the initiative and approach guys! Anyways, I know how you feel. Even though I've had guys approach me, I've never found one that I could really click with.

Will I be removed from the electoral registry if I spoil my vote? I can't seem to find the answer to this question online. Someone tell me please.

Sigh. I really need some help here. I don't even know how to start.

I got to know this friend through a summer programme and we only got to know each other on the last day before I left. Nonetheless we hit off quite well and we talked quite a bit after I left. However after some time he'll blue tick me and he wouldn't say anything after opening my snaps. But guess what. Whenever he's drunk he'd text me. He did it once and we actually chatted through snapchat and he did it again today. He even sent a photo I took with a guy friend and asked if he was my boyfriend. 

I'm so confused right now. Please help :(

To the sweetest bf who came to school to bring me home at 1 am cos he was worried about me:
Thank you <3

I fell in love with a girl. The most perfect girl. Sure, she has her flaws but so do I. Unfortunately, my flaws were too big to ignore, as much as I struggled to fix them, I was too late, and she left me. I was selfish and self-absorbed and I should have doted on her and loved her and cherished her more. I failed to grasp how attention-seeking I appeared, and how these selfish acts had shaken her faith in me over time.

She was my first love, so perhaps that's why the loss cut me so deeply. Every day I lose myself in pointless indulgences, and every night my mind drifts back to happier days, and what could have been. I was even suicidal for a period of time. How pathetic, isn't it!

I can feel myself slowly recovering, getting better as I learn to appreciate the small things again. The warmth of the morning sun, the comfort as I ease my fatigued body onto my bed after a long day of work (i.e. the distraction from my pain) and I feel the recurring thoughts bleed away into slumber. But I am afraid that a part of me is destroyed for good; I can never be as happy as I once was, I can never bring myself to love again. I am afraid that some day I will just give up on holding out, that I have been deluding myself that I would get better.

Seeking help is pointless. There is no point telling my friends or family this because I do not believe that it will help. I do not need their help. I'm just using this as an avenue.

I would never wish this sort of pain onto anyone, and so I hope this serves as a warning not to take your loved ones for granted.

May I ask how do you girls make a confession to the person you have been secretly liking for years? To tell you the truth, I'm an evergreen and I have zero knowledge on how to confess to my guy friend (I know him for quite a while) without making the situation overly awkward. I mean if it happens that he rejects me, should I laugh it off or thank him for his time? How should I respond? I know it's so silly to ask this. Things may go awry if it turns out that he has no feelings for me, but I do think it's better if I can be honest with my feelings than moping silently, wondering if he feels the same way as me...

I am fuming mad now. I am a person who likes to complete work on time. Hence, especially when it comes to projects, I will make sure I complete my work several days before the deadline, while ensuring that it is of quality work too. My group mates only handed up work just a few hours before the deadline and they don't even put in any effort in their work. Hence, I have to sacrifice my night away trying to edit their parts and I am always the one who is compiling everything. They don't even have any idea what is going on in the project and I am always the one reminding them. Furthermore, I really dislike last minute cancellations of plans especially if the matter is so trivial. Every week, my bf would come to my house to study with me and guide me on some of my work. I have already told my mom and she will normally do some other extra preparations like our food etc. Just at that moment when I am so angry with my group mates yet I can't possibly express my anger at them since I am going to be stuck with them for a long time, he told me he can't make it the next day without a good reason. This sent me on a rage and I just off my phone. Whats worse still, he seem to not be able to understand just how angry I am. And when I am angry, I will not talk to that particular person for a long time. Sorry just had to rant. I really cannot take this kind of shit anymore especially when I have other work from other modules to finish up. It is just so unfair that I always have to take responsibility for other people's work and every negative, shit, bad thing just have to happen at the same time. I just want to faster graduate and get out of this project nonsense shit and lead my own life. I am actually tearing as I write this. I really probably should  be on my own for awhile. It is probably my anxiety issues acting up again, but I really cannot handle this anymore. I want a break from everyone, everyone in school, my bf and friends. It is so tiring to handle them all at once. Why do they have to exist in my life? Sorry got to stop and continue with my project. I really have this strong urge to start screaming at people now.

So, im one of those guys that was helping a girl out with her relationship problems(basically my shirt being the tissue paper for her tears). She kept telling me that her guy took her for granted and just kept ignoring her everytime she initiated a message. As an evergreen for a solid 22 years, i just happened to say that i should probably do the same so that maybe a girl would like me and chase me or something but then she went "NOOOOO please please dont do that!" and the girl will hate you and such. But from my observation, I notice that this seems to be working for whoever that guy is. Can someone explain this to me and should I actually do what that guy is doing to maybe some girl i am interested in?
-
 
A week ago, I was still an evergreen until my friend introduced his female friend who is still single to me. I started chatting with her and this eventually grew into never ending messages that last late into the night. I eventually started meeting up her and we like each other's accompany and has already planned a list of things to do and eat for the next meet-up. Is that really too fast? I hope I wasn't controlled by my desperation.

I hate people who judge me when I stayed home all day during the weekends. 
“So you stayed home whole day?”
“Yea I did”
Walks always making a condescending laugh.
F*** you that is why you will never get to be my friend.
You will never understand how I do not need to be with friends constantly to feel validated.

You guys are uni students for a reason so kindly act like one in real life and on FB.

My uni friends are so dumb, not in the academic sense, but if they show me one more horoscope thinking that it's real, I will lose my head. HOROSCOPES REALLY?! 

That was so primary school when we had nothing better to do. if you're gonna meet the love of your life today, or wear a certain colour, or let the stars determine how you should lead your daily life (or not since they are all fake and premade rubbish), its really sad. It was cute while it lasted, like believing in Santa Claus (sorry spoilers, he ain't real kiddos).
it ain't too bad when you post it on FB,twitter,insta etc since I can unfollow it, but if you try to convince me it's real on what's app, and in real life, it gets so annoying.
UGH.

I had an interesting conversation with my little brother today.

Brother: My group for the new project has 2 girls and 2 guys.

Me: Ok...so what?

Brother: I don't wanna group with girls.

Me: Why not? You will have to interact with them sooner or later.

Brother: My friends say that if you spend too much time with a girl, even if it is schoolwork, she will end up liking you. And the guy will also end up dating her.

Me: I seriously question your circle of friends. There are tons of platonic friendships between guys and girls. I have a lot of guy friends but we are just friends.

Brother: Maybe they like you and you are super dense so you don't know. They got friendzoned. So sad.

Me: Just........ go do your homework.

Gosh, kids these days. Wonder what they have been reading. It seems as if everything has to revolve around bgr.

Hey whisperers, what do you all think about meeting a potential SO in a club? People tend to judge when you introduce him/her and you say things like "We met on the dance floor at zouk". I met this guy recently in a club and we hit off really well and did the endless texting of conversation for about two weeks now. I think I'm starting to like him but I don't know if I should pursue this or just leave things be and find someone else under more "socially acceptable" circumstances eg. in school/tutorial classes. 

Now before anyone gives me advice like "Why do you care what other people think" or "Are you dating him or are your friends dating him", I know, but people will still judge me nonetheless and as humans we all are, even minimally, affected by these judgements.
-
 
8 months down the road and I still tear whenever I think about him....sometimes I felt as though our time together was a very long dream. I felt like my life has been split into pre - him and post - him.  When he broke up with me, the sadness I felt was indescribable. It was then that I realised, he loved me much less than I loved him. Maybe right now he's already long forgotten about me and living life happily now. Maybe he's even relieved. Yes we were so different, we were so incompatible, and yet we were attracted to each other in the beginning. It's strange, how lovers turn into strangers. We texted each other almost everyday, went out every week for 2 years....and poof he vanished from my life. It wasn't a clean breakup. I messaged him for many days after the final quarrel. He never replied. It's as though our relationship never happened. Sometimes I look through the photos in my phone, and that's the only evidence that we knew each other. I feel a huge sense of grief, that he never bothered to keep in contact at all. I think I'd be more comforted if we could still be friends.

How do you differentiate a 'nice guy' from a 'loser'?

The 'nice guy' (imo) usually focus more on books and are more genuine. They tend to be less sociable but deep down inside they are nice people and mean no harm. Most don't dress very well or are very charismatic and tend to be viewed by others as being unpopular and loserish.

On the other hand, the 'bad boys' (and girls) are usually quite nasty and wild, they are not very nice people but they are charismatic, dress well and have a nice body. Such people attract more friends and are very popular in school and all.

So how do everyone view and rectify this matter?. :/

(pls don't give me 'pls be yourself' and 'happy can alrdy' kind of comments because obviously I'm neither happy or fine with status quo.

To 
Oh man. Here goes. 

I'm a girl. It's normal to be horny. It's normal to wonder what sex feels like. It's normal to fantasize. People have sex drives, male AND female. But it is true that one tends to be more horny during ovulation, because well that's when you're fertile!

Please don't feel guilty about it. There is nothing shameful about "touching yourself". It's called masturbating. Some people enjoy doing that, some people don't, and it's fine either way. I don't think you have a "rather strong sexual desire", I think you're normal! So don't worry about it! :)
-
 
is it normal that in my entire life, i had never had any guys confessing or even expressing their interest in any way? Admittedly i am not the most gorgeous looking girl around. I am a bit on the bigger side as i am about 1.73cm. Sometimes it just gets to me as i see my other petite friends getting their numbers asked for all the time, chatting with different guys, getting all the care and attention that i have never ever gotten in my entire life. Yet, i want, or at least feel that i deserve it. I have always been alone. I shouldnt be feeling this way but somehow i just do, and yes it a terrible feeling. Am i doing something wrong that is repelling all the guys away from me?

I still remember the first time we met at our first tutorial class. I was sitting down there hoping that my guy friend beside me would just stop talking, because I found the conversation boring and getting nowhere. Suddenly, the tutorial room door opened and there you walked in. Our eyes met briefly and I smiled at you as the much-awaited silence finally came. I said hi to you as I saw your eyes checking me out quickly for just that split second, before you smiled back and sat at the last row of the room. 

I admit that you were just an average guy based on looks. But I felt there was something different about you from the other guys I know, something which attracted me to you after that first encounter. I tried getting to know you better for the next few weeks since then, and I am glad I did. Perhaps you didn't realise how much effort I have put in just to be able to sit next to you in tutorials and also in the LT, even though it meant sitting away from my friends who often wondered where I went and I had to look around the LT just to see where you were, until we finally exchanged phone numbers and added each other on Facebook. It was also a blessing in disguise that you took this module alone.

We have gone out and hang out so many times together since then, and as time passed it became obvious to me that you are a keeper. I know you know I like you, and I know you have the hots for me too. You were shocked when you found out I was still single and I haven't had a boyfriend before, and you asked why. I told you I wasn't ready to date anyone seriously yet, and you didn't seem convinced although you were amused and assumed I must be having a hard time fending off suitors because you said I'm pretty and hot in your eyes. You have no idea how many butterflies I had inside my stomach when you said that, and how happy and heartwarming I felt when I heard that.  

It's true I wasn't ready to go into a relationship, although that was only half the truth. Until recently, I was carrying a burden for a number of years, something that only a few friends outside school know about besides my family. I wished I could share my burden with you and confess to you back then at that moment, but I didn't know how to break everything to you. 

I know you saw it as a rejection when you held my hand as you walked me home that night after our last paper, and I said I wasn't ready to go into a relationship and I needed more time, even though I didn't let go of your hand and held it tight too. I saw what looked like a heartbreak in your eyes, even though I reassured you time and again it wasn't your fault and I wasn't rejecting you. All these months I tried my best to assure you I wasn't seeing other guys or interested in anyone else, and I'm glad you trusted me. You asked "why not now" when I told you to wait for me and give me two months, and you left me at the MRT station with many question marks in your head after I told you I had personal matters to settle and I would explain to you in future. I had no idea this would be the last time I saw you ever since that night.

I was at the airport just a few hours after you walked me home, and flew to Bangkok to correct what was a mistake of nature on my body. I had no intention of ignoring your messages after that night for days, because I was drifting in and out of consciousness as I recovered on the hospital bed and was relieved of my burden for good, my physical body now matching my soul. When I was finally well enough to contact you after returning home, you ignored my phone calls and Whatsapp/Facebook messages. As I continued my recovery at home and became an emotional wreck on many occasions after I found that you deleted me off Facebook, I finally understood what you have been going through in your head that night, only magnified many times for me this time.

I wished I had taken my elder sister's advice and confessed to you earlier. However, I only wanted to be a complete girl for you by the time I confess to you, so that it would lessen any shock/disappointment/disgust from you as much as possible. I have no intention of keeping this from you at all because a couple keeps no secret from each other, and whether you want me as your girlfriend after that, I can only hope and harbour no ill-will if you decide to give up on us. 

It's already the 4th week of the new semester, but my whole mind is still consumed by your memories every single second. I wonder how you've been all this while. I guess you are probably away doing your IA now, after stalking you on Google and Facebook. I've been to our favourite places around campus almost every day at the usual times just to think about our happy times together, and I've waited for you at the MRT station every morning and evening until I had to leave for school or home. But I've never been able to bump into you at all. Every time I go to school behaving like nothing has happened, but deep down inside I am nothing but an empty shell devoid of your presence. My girl friends are sensing that something's not right about me, and I guess there's a limit to how long I can continue putting on a brave front.

If you are reading this, I want you to know that I miss you so badly all this while and how much I want to be your girlfriend if you don't mind my past. I can't wait for you to add me back on Facebook, so I can change the relationship status on my Facebook profile to being in a relationship with you and tell the whole world I like you and I love you :'(

"People are replaceable." That's bullshit actually. Honestly, I'm really tired of looking. I don't think I'm looking for much - down to earth and adventurous. But 2 years after I let her go, no one has ever caught my eye. This is despite increased efforts to increase my exposure to the opposite sex by going out more often. Actually, to say that no one ever caught my eye would be overstating it. A few special ones have come and go but as I get to know them more often, I realised that they're just playing a game. 

There's this one girl N who stood me up on my birthday. Not that I've known her for long and she probably didn't know how special it was but that's entirely my fault. Hell, not many of my "closer" friends know when's my birthday. 

Then there's this other girl K whom I share a common group of friends with. Well, she deleted me on FB. Pretends like nothing went wrong in front of others. I probably will never see her again. And the f-ed up thing is, I can't even specifically pinpoint what I did wrong. I think I'll eject myself from the clique.

Whatever. I'm tired. I really am. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm screwed up. I wish someone would tell me in the face though. N and K, may you find what you're looking for.

My schoolmates always refer to me as the 'popular one'. Just because I am always saying hi to people in school and it seems that there are many people who knows me. However, I actually don't have many friends. Knowing people doesn't mean that you are popular, but my schoolmates doesn't seem to get this point. I have many acquaintances, but I don't even talk to them out of school. I don't have people who I'll text on a regular basis, and I rarely go out with my 'friends'. Genuine conversations? Don't even talk about it.  

So please, don't ever think that that 'popular' schoolmate of yours is lucky and envy him/her for knowing a lot of people. He/she might just be lonely deep inside too.

Feel kinda lonely. How do you guys feel about second level jio-ing (Like she's going for some activities and shun bian ask me)? Feels as if my friend think that I'm kinda sad cos no1 jio me for anything. I feel that its kinda condescending. Since the main organiser did not even invite me, why should I self-invite? 

Altho it kinda sucks that all my hall mates are having some activities now=/

What is friendzone? If you ask me I honestly dont know. I have difficulty talking to guys most of the time, obviously i dont have any guy friends. For this i blame my secondary school. Going to a girls only school  is the worst choice ever, after being seggregated from guys for the 4 years of most significant puberty growth phase, I lost my ability to treat guys as normal human being. I feel very awkward and shy (not because i like them but because i just dont know how to talk to them anymore.) around them and they just dont enoy talking to me. 
At this rate i wont ever be attached. Even if the guy is interested in me, I will just be too awkward and push him away until he just gives up.

I am a feminine-looking girl who likes other girls. Most people don't know, they can't even guess my orientation. I only tell really close friends, usually to their utter shock. I have not had problem with acceptance, including self-acceptance.
Okay the problem is, I tend to be attracted to straight girls. Needless to say that has never worked out for me before. I recently tried online dating apps, but all the girls who hit me up are too masculine for my liking.
I'm what you might call 'too closeted', maybe that's why I'm not a part of any lesbian clique, and really have no clue where to find potential dates.
Anyone who has been in my situation? Where should I start looking?

Looking at the posts about LDR, I need to add this: Toughen up.

Back in the day when I was in an LDR, my girlfriend at that time was studying at a remote place which did not have proper internet connection. Still on dial-up modems when it was already DSL in Singapore. This meant that our exchanges are confined to just daily emails (and more than once if we happen to reach each other at the right time). There was no such thing as data plans to facetime or skype, and I would scrimp and save from my meagre JC allowance to buy an $18 prepaid card for $15 from the parking coupon auntie for 30 minutes of talk time.

When I enlisted, it became worse because we couldn't even email daily anymore. I would read her backlog of emails for the week when I booked out for the weekend, so I paid extra careful attention to not to cock up and get confined. 2-week confinement, field camp and BTP weeks were the worst because it meant 12-14 days instead of the normal 5-days-of-missing-out.  Apart from the occasional prepaid card and weekly emails, we also wrote letters to each other, although these usually only arrived every 2 weeks at best, up to a month sometimes.

I wish this had a fairytale ending, but unfortunately, our RS ended about a year into NS because it was simply too torturous and draining on both our ends to maintain such a long period of sparse communication, and lack of physical proximity/intimacy. I still kept the stack of 50-60 starhub prepaid cards from JC and NS days, because it served as a reminder to how hard we tried to make the relationship work.

And you guys really have it so much easier now. Please don't take stuff like Skype or Facetime for granted.  Plus with the increased affluence of people these days, you actually get to see each other maybe more than one sustained periods a year (we're both relatively poor, so she only flew back for Chinese New Year, 1 week, and that was it.). Please appreciate the convenience and ease of communication you have now. Don't get wound up by small things and bicker over insignificant problems. Treasure every moment together and always align yourselves with the same outcome, that is to be together at the end of the LDR (back to SDR la). 

There were many temptations along the way, and it was tough to resist. I'm sure we all agree that there are needs and urges to satisfy, which may not be possible due to the LDR. But if you never intended to last all the way, why bother starting in the first place, right?

I guess I'm kinda going nowhere with this, so I'll just stop here. :)

I have a crush on an average looking girl. She keeps thinking herself as an ugly girl.

I am a bit angry about that because it implies that I have bad taste.

I treat all my friends equally, no matter their gender. I don't chose friends either, I don't judge even if he/she has problems and deviate from social norm. But whenever I become close friends with a guy, they would end up liking me. Problem is, I have friendzoned them from the beginning. During the friendship, I would explicitly say things like "You won't like me right?" And they would usually say you are not my type anyway. So I would chat with these guy friends like how I do with my female friends, going on meals with them sometimes, sharing with them about my life. However, usually after a few months they would post statuses on fb or a mutual friend would inform me about how they confessed to liking me, and how they changed themselves for me, and one even self professed having chased me for months( I have no knowledge at all). I don't think messaging daily=chasing? There were totally no signs at all(presents, dates, sweet talk), and they would claim how much I hurt them, saying how much they changed for me and why I still cannot accept them(from conversations when they casually asked me what type of guys i like) and opened up emotionally to me, and then I hurt them by rejecting them(indirectly by telling our mutual friend I have never considered them as a potential partner). It has happened a few times for the past few sems and now I have a phobia of guys being too nice to me. Usually after being directly/indirectly rejected they would just disappear from my life and become very bitter about it. How am i supposed to have guessed? I have shared with them about my crushes, and they have also confided in me when they experience heartbreaks. It is troubling because I have already lost a few close guy friends this way. And guys that I like never do like me. :( Help!

I want to reply to  post. I am from polytechnic and I entered nus 5 years ago. I met a lot of people who gradually stop talking to me after knowing I am from poly. They will say bad things about poly students infront of me and after they know where I come from, they dissappear from my life. Elistism is a real issues here in Nus. But after I graduate, I am proud to say I have earned more than those JC peer in term of salary and respect in my workplace. Cheers to poly-graduate! U will come out of uni with a brighter future than those who looks down on U!

I know of this guy that i know through tinder. like its one of those moments i chose to reply him nicely since i have been trolling a lot of people on it, plus he was from the same school as me. so we met up and had a smoke every time we had a break. but after a week or so, i started getting a bad vibe about him but i still continued to give him a benefit of doubt. He constantly guilt tripped me when i flaked on him because i didn't want to meet him. We kind of came into terms to be fwb because we werent getting any and i was somewhat stressed into agreeing because i, myself, easily give in when people stress me or persuade me. but i constantly backed out when he was about to come to my house and i gave really stupid reasons just so he wouldnt come over. I know its my fault for doing this but i did told him why i didnt want to be fwb with him TWICE. and being the relentless person he is, he kept guilt tripping me by saying "eh you already agreed on it and you want to back out from it.... you're breaking my heart". until the very last straw hit him when i told him i didnt want to do it with him, he just started hurling hurtful words at me which, in short, is me being a slut. im selective with  the people i want to have sex with and i dont think im a slut. honestly, it hurt my feelings knowing that a person who looks so kind can be the spawn of satan. he told me to block him and save myself the energy from talking to him... but in the end, its him who blocked me ON FACEBOOK. so, coincidentally he was on my steam chat, so i asked if he blocked me. and he said, "wow didnt know you'll check. you're just like any other girls (my name), i see through you la" then i replied him, "i wanted to show my friend which loser im talking about but you blocked me so i can't show..." and he didnt reply me after. i know this situation i put myself in, is partly my fault, but i dont know if i should blame him as well for being such a SS (shit stain). someone give me clarity on this situation

after reading about the posts about bullying, i just wanted to share my own experiences from secondary school and even as recently as NS. I found that when people try and bully you, it doesn't help to go away quietly or to ask them nicely to stop. You gotta get in their face and show them that you are not afraid of them, and that you have the capacity to be crazier than them/go apeshit on them, and they would leave you alone. Of course any reasonable person could disagree, but i was just wondering if there is anyone else who could share any stories or ways to deal with bullying, especially workplace ones
-
 
Was reading the confession on LDRs and I'd like share my thoughts too! 

Am currently in year one of LDR (with two more years to go) and yes, it sucks. The 7/8 hour time difference, the weird hours you have to Skype at, the constant lagging of Skype and of course, the physical absence of your partner. Arguments about who's making more time for who begin to surface and when you look at his/her photos travelling to new places, you wish you weren't the one left behind. 

But with all these experiences comes the maturing of your relationship. The physical absence of your partner forces you to be more independent; not only will you have more time for your friends, you'll also have more time to invest in your personal interests. As for Skype, you'll find yourself asking "can you hear me?" more than you imagine but at the same time, laugh at how ridiculous everything is. With enough maturity and understanding, the arguments will soon cease and the next thing you know, you're counting down to the hours you see each other on next Skype. As he/she embarks on their new journeys, you will embark on yours. 

Sure, the road may be unbearable at times but as long as you guys are clear on what your future is, I'd say to give LDR a chance. I was very much against LDR and my friends didn't believe in us either. 

It sucked but at the end of the day, my man's determination to make the relationship work made me to do the same. With ample trust, understanding and love, you'll be that couple who can take pride in being apart but very much together at the same time(: 
-
 
The ideal happy couple that I envision is two people happily chit-chatting together, talking non-stop about their daily lives, but me and my boyfriend just sit in silence most of the time, is this just another way of enjoying each other's presence or should I be concerned about this?

Another thing, he expects me to do ALL the household chores when we get married in the future. Shouldn't this be split equally? 
sometimes i wonder if we might just break up because of these two issues... 

-
 
I'm an evergreen so I'm inexperienced and curious. How do guys in a relationship talk to their girl friends? Do they often initiate conversations? There's a guy friend of mine who's attached but he keeps talking to me even though the conversations are quite unnecessary... Another guy friend of mine who's also attached is also quite known for always initiating not needed conversations with other girls. Is it normal?

To OP of , the commenters and fellow friends,
Hi, I am the OP of . After talking to my friends about it and reading the comments on what I should do, I decided to firstly inform the parents of my tutee and let them contact the school. Should they not decide to do so, I intend to email the school to highlight this matter. Not sure if I can get the email address of the Level Head, but the school's email address can be easily found. 

To a commenter asking what's the race of the bullies, it's Chinese and being a Chinese myself I am so critically ashamed. When my tutee told me about it I didn't exactly know how to react, except to comfort her and told her not all Chinese are like that, she's great the way she is, and that karma would get those bullies etc. How I wish I could personally teach those kids a lesson.

The purpose of me posting my encounter is not to take anything out of context. It just saddens me to hear things like that, and why cant we all just be friends with each other, without worrying what race I am, what race he, she is. Ultimately we all belong to one race, the Human Race.

Dearest OP of  although I do not know you, I hope that things did get better for you. Hopefully you didnt grow up having the wrong idea that all Chinese are like that (sorry i couldn't think of a better way to phrase this). After hearing from my tutee and reading your post, I feel that I really have to do something, and I will definitely do so. Do not EVER feel inadequate again just because of those nasty remarks. Those people are the worst, and are the most pitiful ones because they do not know how to care and love the different kinds of people they meet. They even had to put down others based on their phenotypes just to feel better. Pity them, my friend. Hopefully you have found many great friends along the way, who stayed by your side, stood up for you etc, and that's all it matters. All the best in whatever you do OP!

Sorry I have two questions which may be a little silly to ask, given that I am already in Uni. 

I had this problem ever since my menses started. I had the habit of sleeping with my face facing the ceiling because it's easier for me to sleep this way. However, if I face the ceiling the whole night, the blood stain my pants at the area near the top of my butt, which failed to be covered by the 41cm sanitary pad. Why is it that even a 41 cm pad cannot prevent blood from travelling to the top of my butt?!?! I did not want to use a tampon as I don't know how to use it and I'm afraid it may hurt as well. Do you girls sleep facing sideways when having menses? If not what do you all do to minimise the chances of blood leaking out to your pants at the top of your butt?

Another issue about the period was that during the second week (ovulation period), I felt strong sexual desire and fantasize very easily. I'm still a virgin but it is during this ovulation period that I kept thinking how sex felt like. Worst, i think I "touched myself" sub consciously in the middle of the night sometimes, when I am half awake and half asleep. I know when my ovulation had ended because all sexual thoughts will cease immediately. I am very sure I will not have sex anyhow but still, I felt quite guilty about these sexual thoughts. I can't understand why the ovulation hormones make me have such sexual thoughts. Is this normal for girls? Or is it because I may in-born have a rather strong sexual desire?:(

I know this may be a little embarrassing for some girls to reply in the comments so I would appreciate if some girls can reply annoynomously in another post to give your thoughts on such issues...

What would be considered 'taking too much initiative'? I think I may like this guy, but I haven't really gotten that close to him. I don't know him well; not even his current relationship status (but my hunch tells me he isn't attached). We only got to know each other through taking a similar module this semester. 
-
 
I'm currently year 1 NUS student and my girlfriend who went the ITE route is now studying in polytechnic. We knew each other from primary school. 

I made some friends from my orientation and we hang out together a lot, cos we're in the same major and take almost the same electives. One day, one of my friends went to stalk my gfs profile and found out about her ITE background and they were talking about it. Although they said nothing condescending, I felt like they were judging her for being a ITE student. They were saying nice things like "Oh at least she continued her education blah blah blah" although there was no need for them to say "comforting things" to appease me or whatever. 

I got pretty mad inside and really wanted to just beat the hell out of them. 

After that day, I'm not sure why but it feels like they're distancing themselves from me. What should I do? 
-
 
so many stories about girls treating their guys nicely, but the guy doesnt reciprocate.
i wish i could have found myself a girl like that too

while i was still attached, i did everything within my abilities to keep my ex happy. doing stuff that she likes even if i dont particularly like it, pampering her, spending as much time as i can with her, even stayed away frm all other girls because she felt insecure about me hanging out with other girls in sch.
helped her and encouraged her endlessly to get her through her uni life, corrected her major flaws to make her a better person, and really just loved her unconditionally throughout our whole relationship.

yet despite all that, she cheated on me with a guy whom she barely knew frm her office. then broke off with me in the coldest possible fashion, and has never contacted me again ever since..

im not saying that im a great guy or anything. i just try to be my best for someone special to me. but i just wish i had a gf who appreciated and understood me. more often than not, the girls i meet simply treat me like im just a tool. someone to be used and then thrown away when im no longer needed. 

thanks to her, my social circle for the opposite gender is non-existant. and i have no idea how to get to know other females now, much less mix around to find someone better. looks like ill b single for life from now.
-
 
Just wondering, is it true that guys do not like girls who take too much initiative? e.g starting the convo, adding on fb, smiling at him randomly in class, etc.. Also, if the intention is just to make friends, will there be a chance of misunderstanding?
-
 
Sometimes I just feel so inadequate. Like I'm already 24, I really really wanna settle down but all the guys I like seem to be either attached/married. :( I know this kinda thing cannot be forced. Still..... Is there something wrong with me that I just can't find my better half yet? It's so hard sometimes.
-
 
I'm a girl who enjoys doing adventurous stuffs, solo travelling, hiking, diving and backpacking. As much as I enjoy the current lifestyle of solitude that I'm having, I crave for a companion in life. I don't really wanna settle for any nice guy who's just another couch potato. I want someone who can inspire me to be more adventurous in life. I did come across a few adventurous guys who are kinda cute from time to time. But they just seemed to be players (maybe they're not). And to some, I was seen as a player (but I'm not). Too many times, things just didn't work out for me. There seems to be so much relatable points in those elitedaily and thoughtcatalog posts of "Don't date a man/woman who travels". I wonder if I'll be able to find a life partner. One who is faithful yet adventurous, inspiring me to live a life of memorable expeditions. Till then, I'll continue to travel hard. And hope that I'll meet him one day on the roads.

In regards to the bad boy question thing. 

If I did change to be that guy, would it be more worth it? It's not like I don't have confidence, I just keep getting rejected by every girl and it hurts me a lot. I'm Always that guy that ends up with a wet shoulder from the tears of the girls crying from their bad guys behaviour and for once I wished I could switch roles. So, as I feel that i have nothing to lose, should i? 
-
 
To OP  & ,
I'm in the same situation and i just wanted to say it feels really really comforting to know that I am not alone in this heartbreak. I recently fell for a guy who is attached. When I felt that i was falling too deep, i tried to control my feelings but of course it doesn't work that way. I try to do other activities to keep myself occupied, talk to friends, etc and it works to a certain extent but when i am alone, i think about him all the time. many things remind me of him, and the love we never had. i am heartbroken to say the least, but i try to tell myself it is not worth it feeling so sad over someone who was never mine in the first place. it is not easy to let go, and i am still trying to get back up. but i sincerely hope there will be someone more suitable, and available, for us in the near future.

The feel when you text your crush and she does not reply you but said something in a group chat. Maybe she is too excited that I text her and do not know what to say!

Is it common for guys to become so touchy-feely with girls? Like putting his hand on my knee to catch my attention (I was sitting) and putting his arm around me when I keep trying to move his arm away. 
-
 
So we got together before my current bf entered nus. I know he loves me but part of me feels like I shouldn't be with him and it's depriving him of a chance to be with someone else who is better than I am 
-
 
I have a boyfriend since last year. He knows that I love him so much, that if we have a fight, I will give way to his argument. Recently I noticed that he chatted with one particular girl. I tried to convince myself that they're just friends. Platonic relationship. But then there was a point when both of my phone and her phone were broken. I didn't know why, but I thought he sort-of paid more attention to her. Like he said he would help her contact her friends and all that, but said nothing to me. He said he would help me repair my phone but it remained as words. 
I felt jealous over her back weeks ago but now I think I'm already tired. So although it's like my boyfie who asked her to meet like for breakfast or what, I tried to press my jealousy since I don't want to have fight with him. Last time we had fight about this girl, I never won. 
So what I want to ask is.... is that normal for a guy to offer help to his "friend" and like care to her more than to me? Cos he wants to give good impression to her? And maybe because he knows that how angry I am, I will stay as I have given all my heart for him?
Or what?

Hi , I'm not sure why but after reading your post, I felt compelled to reply to you. I'm currently in a long distance relationship and we've been together for 5 years, with him overseas and myself staying here. LDRs aren't as bad as what you think of it to be. Indeed, the initial stages are tough, you'll definitely miss the physical presence of your significant other and you'll feel that tinge of sadness whenever you go to places where you two have left treasured memories there. But that doesn't mean LDRs don't work out. Both of you would need to commit yourself to each other, ensure that there's constant communication between you two. It need not be hours of conversation everyday because both of you will have other commitments, like school or work. For myself, we usually talk on weekends, catching up and updating each other on the latest happenings around us. Instead of adopting a negative view towards LDRs, you can try looking from another perspective: it allows you to keep looking forward to the next Skype call (Skype is seriously awesome) and the next time you get to see each other again. Do plan ahead together and have a common goal. Do you see your paths converging after the overseas stint is over? Are you flying over or is your partner coming back? I think these are important but tough questions which you two need to find an answer to, and not run away from. Also, it's definitely possible to fly over and meet your partner (if you have your parents' approval and finances) I myself worked during the summer holidays to fund my trip overseas, and honestly, the anticipation built up over the months and having him pick me up from the airport compensated way over the tears and missing pangs when he was away. 

LDRs are never easy, but it takes both to stay strong and committed to ensure that you would continue walking down this path together with your partner. What matters most is constant communication and planning ahead, having the maturity to aim and reach a common goal together while in this LDR. Ultimately, I believe that relationships are built on trust, and if that trust is broken (which can be really tempting when your partner is not with you), then it would be hard for the LDR to continue. Your partner would be pursuing something better overseas, be it for studies or work, and I think that itself is worthy to be happy for. So, do not fear embarking on an LDR, there are many success stories out there to prove that it can still work out. I myself continue to strive and keep it going, so OP, have faith and courage in yourself. Good luck :)

During my internship at a small legal firm, I dated my senior who is solicitor. She was then 29 years of age while I was 24. She is caring and attractive with a strong dose of humor coupled with wit and sophistication. When I was first introduced to her, her serious demeanor frightened me. But after several lunch sessions at the hawker centre, she opened up to me and we got along well. Since we were both unattached, within a few weeks I confessed to her and we became an item. A partner of the firm often teased our relationship. When an individual teases me with somebody I adore, I feel very happy.

We enjoyed our time spent together at the movies and eating out. When my internship at the firm ended, we still found time for each other. Her parents and brother are nice and friendly to me when we occasionally visited her home. They made me feel so welcome, as if I am part of their family. However, when I brought her home to visit my parents, they were very unhappy and showed signs of disapproval. In our private time, my parents brought up to me the issue about the age gap. They grimly reminded me I was too young and have yet to finish my studies, while my girlfriend is an adult in the workforce. I told them to stop treating me like a child. I was already 24 for God sake! And it's not as if we are planning to marry. We were just dating and we shall decide our future only at a later stage. It was a helluva heated argument. I don't see the reason why there's a trend of older men having the privilege of dating younger ladies, while older women are discouraged from dating younger men. Perhaps 20 or 30 years may be the case of a cradle snatcher worthy of gossip, but 5 years of difference should be acceptable. 

 However, their unrelenting resistance paid off unfortunately. I discussed with my girl about this and she was very upset. Then she told me it will be for the best if I follow my parents' wishes, since our relationship will head nowhere without their approval. I was so heartbroken and I wanted to strangle my parents. Although we broke up, we continued to meet up often to talk about our lives, interests and current affairs. We became platonic friends for a while. 

Over time, I felt the frequency of our meetups significantly decreasing. The excuse was either I was too busy, or she was. But I speculated the real reason was probably to give each other some personal space since we are not romantically attached anymore. And after a year, she had a new boyfriend, who is someone older. I think he works as an auditor.

Earlier this week, I received a wedding card from her, which led me to write this confession to express my sadness. I am tempted to cut out the groom's face on the wedding card and replace it with my own to make myself feel better. Ahahahahahaha. Nonetheless, I will be attending her wedding held at the end of this year. Maybe it's the last time I want to see her since she has her own family now, and I must move on with my life. I commit myself to stop thinking about her as it's affecting my mood and productivity. 

Despite the regret, I do not blame my parents, since they brought me up well by providing me a good living and education. And I understand they always have my best interest at heart, even though I may not immediately see it. I suppose it's bad timing I was not born earlier. And even if I was born earlier, I might not even know her at all. Who knows. Life is a complex web of interrelated forces beyond our control, we just need to make do with whatever that's thrown in our way.

Hi OP ,
I'm in the same situation as you. It really sucks to fall in love with somebody at the wrong time. Your head tells you to let go and move on but your heart insists on hanging on, praying that the right time will come. When it doesn't, you force yourself to move on but every single thing reminds you of him. You struggle to fight the urge to text him whenever you have something silly, happy, angry and sad moments to share. You wish time stopped in the happier past. You fall asleep by thinking about how happy you guys could have been if the time was right.

But I wish to tell you, if you know that things are not working out for you, support yourself and move on. I know it's not easy to let go but it will only get more difficult if you continue holding on. Re-focus your energy and thoughts back to yourself and other people around you. Live your life for yourself again. Why drown yourself in misery for someone who stopped caring for you? So pick yourself up, get back on your feet and see that there are other things in the world that matter more than this relationship that could have been. Have a few supportive friends close by for moments when you stumble back into misery. I am not completely over him yet but it does get better :) 

As my bestie always says, "You are single not because there is something wrong with you but you are too awesome for anyone right now and you haven't met anyone as awesome as you yet." Tell yourself you are awesome, regain your confidence and live that awesome life that you are capable of without him.

I am a lesbian but my friends from school doesn't know anything because I know how homophobic they are. I am really tired to be somebody I am not. Why is it so hard to find friends who can be accepting  and not judge? I just need friends that will accept me for who I am. I just need to rant.. :(

Hey everyone,

Heads up! This is gonna be a really long and emotional post but I really want to vent it out.

I posted here in June  about my breakup, how we couldn't work out our future together and decided to break up. 

Truth is, despite that, I still loved him alot. After the breakup, we decided to remain friends. However, he hasn't been a good friend to me... Insulting me, lookin for me when he's lonely and showing off to me all the girls he's trying to chase. 

So he created a dating app account early last month and been targeting different girls. Within a week, he met this girl and they hung out twice. Hell, they even hugged and held hands on the first date. A week after that, I bumped into them around my neighborhood.. Turns out that she's working in that area. He walked pass me like I was a stranger. He even carried that stupid smug face. That was the day I told myself.. Enough is enough. I couldn't text him as a friend everyday anymore.I blocked him out from all my social media and messaging app.

I just felt so broken and angry. There's no more tears anymore, just anger whenever I think of them. Yesterday, i stupidly went  to check on his  whatsapp photo and her instagram photo. He changed to a couple-ish profile picture. I was shaken with anger. 

By logical deduction, he only met her one month ago from an online app and they are together. I know my friends have been telling me, he has the rights to do whatever he wants...You are not in his life anymore. However, I can't deny that it still hurts. We were so happy together for 3 years. How can he just moved on like this? Did I mean nothing to him at all? 

I don't know what I can do to get rid of this anger, except time...? 

TDLR; It's unfair how soon my ex  can find a replacement in a month through some stupid app. What should I do to get rid of this anger I'm feeling?:(

Girls who need to chase after guys are so pathetic. Come, I share one of my many suitors with you.

Sorry, but not everyone wants to get in your pants, just because you're in a course comprising of many other guys. I am very kind towards you because it is within my nature to do so. True, I may have liked you at one point in time in the past, but I am not interested in you any more.

I see that you might be annoyed at my supposed attempts to hit on you, but I am sorry - since I am not welcome, I guess I should make myself scarce. I really did see you as a friend, and had hoped to mend a friendship that was lost.

I would like to share this article, for those who are like me, in a love purgatory.

Simply summarized, the tragedy of loving someone at the wrong time is different from breakup. In breakups, you may tend to forget someone after a long time but losing a love that you are only halfway through/not even started makes you yearn for your lost even more. You can't wish them all the best and move on because you still want to stay on. That's being thrust into a 'love purgatory' where there is no end.

Yes, you can try to do many other activities to keep yourself busy or meet someone new but guess what? He won't just go away. You'll think, 'If only he is here...." or "he's not like him, he's different". You can't seem to replace the person that is caged in your heart. Such connections that last so long are rare to come by but nevertheless your irrational heart cannot help you at all. Though, sadly this article provides no solution except the torment of going around in love purgatory. Yes, goodnight to all those who are in the same boat as me. Lay down the picture and get some sleep. T.T

If I can't have you as my boyfriend, then I wouldn't want to have you as my friend. It's really painful to see you everyday, knowing that you can't be mine..

Disclaimer: Sharing love advices and basically ranting. Recently I deleted all whatsapp conversation, messages, pictures etc of my ex and I. It's hurts more than my previous relationships because he was a guy that I wanted to marry to. He was someone that I could see myself spending the rest of my life with. I know for a fact that all relationships are never smooth sailing but I was hoping that we could make it through together. I see ourselves pretty much like a typical campus couple and hence I suppose these advices are highly relatable. To all couples out there:

1) Love is never equal - one of you are giving more/receiving less. True but here is the catch, you can't always be the ONE giving more. It's an alternating role, not a fixed one.
2) No matter how busy both of you are, at least communicate once everyday. It can be a simple text, short meetup etc. Just show his/her that he/she is on your mind. 
3) I'm okay literally means " I'm feeling like shit now and there is so much that I wanna tell you but I don't know how you might react to it"
4) Something better than I love you? Words from the heart. Even if it makes you embarrassed as hell to say so. 
5) Do not count the hours when you are together but count your blessings instead. 
6) Lastly a hug and a kiss sounds like a good idea.

My bf's friends from all his mods are all girls... Like literally all his mods. He has 3 different school cliques and he's the only guy in all of them. So he'll study and have meals with them after classes. He knows I'm abit uncomfortable with this. I told one of friends about it and she said her boyfriend made the effort not to hang out with his girl friends too much because it made her uncomfortable too. Are boys more like my boyfriend or my friend's, when attached? :(

I like how Prof Ben Leong always give useful advices.

I need some advice. I told the guy that liked me that I don't feel the same way towards him as he have, after a long time. I mean since he doesn't get the message so I told him.

And since then, we are not really on talking terms. But he still fufill promises he said he will do, but just very awkward. I really don't expect him to do that (afterall I rejected him) 

The confused part is... he will update his facebook status about "how he fufill a promise even though he dont have to, and to treat it like losing money to the sea and expect nothing in return" 
And this is not the first time he post messages like this. And I sort of feel bad towards it. I mean if you do something, shouldn't it be what you want to do out of willingness?

I feel like asking him but I am scared it will get too confrontational and I don't feel good about him posting all these with a hidden message. What should I do?

I am about to start on a long distance relationship for a very long time. I probably will get to see my significant other once every few months if I am lucky enough. Actually, I kind of envy those who can meet their significant other on a daily basis. Is anyone out there in similar situation as me? Will this relationship work out? Any tips? I am quite worried that I will eventually be interested in someone else overtime. I am worried as I sincerely do not want to hurt her feelings.

I am a engineering guy and I feel inferior about myself among the group of my more “outspoken/hippy” friend from Fass/BIZ. All of them are extremely well-spoken/articulate and often I will not be able to get their references. The similarities I found is that they are knowledgeable with trivials. Because I come from a chinese speaking family, I am not able to converse as naturally as they do and that sort of embarrass me. Would you guys laugh secretly at people who cannot speak good English? 

Maybe I should be more confident of myself.  Nobody talks about science here☹

I've been together with my bf close to 2 years. And he's just making me feel less and less secure. He has so many female friends in his cliques and is hanging out with his different cliques more and more often, unlike when we first got together. I guess because the honeymoon phase is over... But are guys always like that? Or is he just getting sian of me.. Sigh what to do leh
-
 
My prof is only 35 and is this super lanky, awkward but geeky cute type. He's so incredibly smart and I think I'm falling for him. This leads to me not concentrating in class >< Should I drop the module :(
-
 
There is this guy who I became very close to when we were both on an overseas programme. But everything changed after we came back in NUS. He seldom talks to me anymore and everytime it's me who initiates the conversation. I'm so tired now and have no idea how to keep our friendship...
To all the guys out there, if you don't like the girl/ don't want to develop further relationship with the girl, don't be too nice or too close to her. Girls will always take it seriously. At least I do. Sigh...
-
 
I don't know if this will sound weird or anything but sometimes when I think about my boyfriend I can get emotional and start crying. We're very happy together, in fact, we can't remember when we've felt such happiness together. But sometimes when I think about how much I love him I just start tearing up. He's the best person I know and we're both in it for the long run, and I love him more than anyone else. 

Is something wrong with me? 
-
 
I was the one who posted  .
I'm really really sorry for not having enough courage to approach any of you. I couldn't find a way to anonymously contact through Facebook.

However I want to thank you all for being willing to hear me out, and honestly seeing about 83 people offering help has already made me feel a lot better than I was yesterday. 

I hope that anyone else who needs a listening ear can contact these wonderful people too.

Anyone here who was a previous fat kid but now attractive? Can't seem to get the fat kid mentality out of my head, and I struggle with handling my attractiveness because I don't know what to do when so many guys hit on me or show interest in me. I tend to 'run away' from them or act blur about their advances, which leaves them thinking that I'm stuck up and arrogant when I'm just scared and confused inside. Helpppppp

I have a small group of friends and we take a lot of modules together, being in the same major and everything. Out of this small group however, I am the only one who is not going for exchange. Nevertheless, I discussed with them about their exchange opportunities and researched with them as if I am going on exchange too. They are the kind that won't really do much research and only realise at the last minute. So yesterday I found out that there are actually limited places for each uni for exchange(around 2-4 places each) and I became worried for them, since the whole bunch of them (4 people + their other friends too) plan to apply to the same few unis to be together. The unis they plan to apply for are also super popular but I won't say which few. So I quickly typed a short message about the limited places on our group whatsapp but at the last minute....

I didn't hit send and I deleted my message away. Around 5 minutes later, I realised with horror that I didn't send that message as I wanted them to stay with me in nus. Judging by their current CAP and CCA participation, they are unlikely to get the places if they stick to their current uni choices. I was so shocked at myself that I started pinching myself all over to make myself feel some pain.

In the end, I sent the message to them. But until now, I still feel guilty and I hate myself for having such selfish thoughts.

Barely made it to college and now i feel incompetent in everything. Reality is a bitch and i just got a bitch slap in the face. Not complaining. I just feel a bit demoralized. I can't even say this openly on Facebook so now i have to let it out here. This is so sad. 
-
 
I do not know whether this is an admiration or a forbidden crush on you. But while taking your CS2100 and CS1020 course last sem i am intrigue everytime i see you at the front of the LT. Haiz... i think you would not recognise me in the crowd of students.

For OPs of    and other similar posts...

Love isn't for cowards. 

If you feel that you are a right fit with an intended partner, gfi! Be respectful though, and sensitive to that person's thoughts and feelings. Some people might be hurting inside, some might be unsure, some may feel bound to cultural pressure to be "chased"- and some might be really oblivious! 

But that's what communication is for, right? C'mon the usual commenters here have said this enough- don't expect the other party to read your mind.

can someone educate me about the etiquette or mechanics of using instagram? My circle is small - about 120 followers and following - and on average I get about 15 likes per post, so by now I roughly know who are my regular likers. I have some friends who follow me, but for some reason they never ever like my posts. And these are people who I meet in school at least once a week. This really confuses me.
I know my photos aren't artistic, nor are my captions meaningful or witty. I also don't go out a lot so I don't post "cool" stuff i.e. cafe hops and pretty food, group outings/meetups. But does that mean my posts aren't worth a like? Or is it because I'm not part of their inner clique? 
I'm generally quite generous with liking friends' posts that appear on my feed, but when it comes to these people I get a bit apprehensive...perhaps it's a self-created vicious cycle of withholding likes?
Could it be an issue of timing? Maybe they only checked instagram some hours after I posted and my post got buried below. But cannot be so suay right, by now I've posted at all kinds of different times and still nothing. Is it common practice to scroll all the way down to whichever post you last saw whenever you check instagram? And is it common practice to still like those older posts?
Finally, is it normal to like every post on your feed (or at least posts from known friends)? Or is it more normal to be stingy with likes? And for what reasons do you decide that a post is worth a double-tap?
I know this post is superficial as heck (but wow it got so long), and living for instagram likes is not the way to go, but I can't help but feel a little offended by the perpetual lack of likes from some friends.
As mentioned above I don't have many followers or followees, so maybe the way I use instagram is different than normal. I hope a social media expert (since that's a legit title nowadays) can enlighten me. Thanks.

P.S. yes I admit one of these friends is a girl I have a crush on, but in the bigger picture there are also quite a number of friends who never like my posts.

To a certain girl wearing a grad cap in her profile: I heartily agree with you on all your posts, you're like a dream come true! Helps that you look really cute too (if you disagree pls feel free to take more profile pics to demonstrate your point :P)  I bet there's lots of guys chasing after you though. Are you single?

Theres a girl from my engin clique (Im a guy) I started to have feelings for. We (everyone in the clique) have known each other for close to 4 years. But its only recently after an overseas trip together with the clique then I realise I have feelings for her. Shes not the best looking girl out there and maybe thats why I was never attracted to her before. But she has a really unique one-of-a-kind personality... and after getting to know her much better I feel like she is really someone I will really want to be with.

The saddest part about this is... shes attached already ): I know my boundaries and im not going to be a third party. Couples can get together and stay together really not easy. I just gotta let my rant out here cos I obviously cant tell anyone (much less my clique) about this. Or do anything at all. Dont want to cause any problems. It just kills me to not be the guy who can be with her and make her laugh and smile ):

Need some ideas on how to start a convo with a pri sch female classmate whom ive nt talked to for at least 6 years! Recently came across my biography book I did back in p6 during cleaning and all the memories brought much nostalgia which somehow triggered a feeling in me to want to talk to her haha.
-
 
I have been together with my gf for several years. Apart from her occasional tantrums/pms, there isn't really much to complain about her. Recently, I have found myself to develop liking for another girl whom I haven't talked to in real life. I am unsure if this is a passng infatuation or what. As much as I want to pursue this other girl, I do not want to break my gf's heart. I do not want to have any regret in the future. What should I do?
-
 
I wonder if anyone is like me. I like girls but I cannot tell anyone. Not my family, not even my friends. Just wondering if there are any girls out there like me, that are too afraid of going out there to find a partner because of the fear of getting found out. 
-
 
I recently met this guy - he's cute, funny and incredibly charming and pleasant (: I feel like asking him if he'd like to hang out some time, as I'm keen to know him better! But he always seems busy with his activities outside of school, and i'm feeling so shy ):  
-
 
I have a guy friend from JC who keeps asking me out for a meal/movie and I keep rejecting him. I suspected for a while that he might be interested, but I think not now. First, our conversations on whatsapp are about anything under the sun but the language used is quite "jokey"(?), we would make fun of each other like best friends. Also, he also asks other girls out too, just not as frequently as me. So is he into me or are we just friends?
-
 
There's that kind of girl. Quite a few guys chase after her, and even other girls think she's an eligible girl to date. Why do girls like this remain single?! 
-
 
In school, I always feel a little like a character from The Wizard of Oz, breaking a sweat down the yellow brick road.  On some days, I’m the Cowardly Lion desperate for courage, on some days I’m the Tin Woodman worrying about my missing heart, on an odd day, I’m the Scarecrow wishing I had a brain and on the very worst days, I’m Dorothy and I just want to go home. Today I was Dorothy.

Am I the only one here who is not really happy when people keep correcting my pronunciation for minor mistakes? As in, I know it may be for my own good, but i feel uncomfortable when people correct me in public as I am aware that others will judge. I used to work in a workplace where my colleagues' English standard are up there while my English is not up to their level, so they would always correct my pronunication. Because of this, the introverted me became more cautious when i speak, and made me more closed up than before. I feel very childish because of the fact that i am so affected by it. 
Also, do allow me to ask as i am curious - does Nus whispers post all confessions? Or do they do so selectively? 
-
 
I need more friends in nus who wouldn't judge me for what I tell them. Friends who respect confidentiality and can offer a listening ear. 

Like this post if you can keep secrets. I'll contact you if we have no mutual friends (I have trust issues). 
Ps I'm a guy. 
-
 
I  am posting here in the hopes that she will read this. I really like this girl since our poly days. I used to buy her small gifts whenever she had major achievements or when she was down,to cheer her up. Unfortunately she brushed it off as "friends" even though we were really close. 

She is now studying in nus and im serving the nation. We still keep in touch but not like before. Furthermore I did not do well in poly and have no chance to get into nus. 

I know she is the one for me, but should I let my feelings go? She is bound to find better guys in nus right? But what if they hurt her? I know I want to take care of her and she is the one i want to marry.

What should I do?

Is it my fault if my girlfriend commits suicide because of our failed relationship?

My gf is suicidal and she is extremely insecure because of her past. Even very minor things such as me messaging my friend for some work related stuff would make her feel very uneasy and she'll get mad at me for doing so. I told her countless times that I need to interact with other people not because I like them or am interested in them but she just refuse to believe me. I'm already trying my best, by showing her all my messages and providing her with the support she needs, but it seems like the situation may never improve. I don't want our relationship to end because I really cherish the times we had together. But yet right now i'm in a lot of stress because of schoolwork and other commitments, and I'm really drained by this. I thought of leaving her but the thought of her taking her own life is unbearable to me. What should I do now? Please help.

I am an evergreen guy who have never gone after a girl before :( just last week I met a girl in my CCA and I knew she is the one. She looked so cute and sounded so sweet. I got her number and have been talking to her over whatsapp for a week. Though she don't reply often (which i understand she is probably busy), she still replies :) she do ask me questions sometimes to continue the conversation but I am mostly the one initiating :/ Sorry for the long story, but here is my question. How do I go after a girl? :/ When is the right time for me to try to ask her to hangout so she wont find me creepy?
-

University has honestly been the loneliest time of my life. You need to take responsibility for your own life, such as joining CCAs, camps. It is a place where you can do everything or nothing. 

University life has, sadly, literally displayed to me my flaws and fears.

I have an eating disorder, and i have a very bad body image, to the point that i would not go to school for weeks, missing lectures and tutorials because I felt too ugly to be seen walking in school. 

I went from binging to anorexia and now binging again. It is a daily struggle and I can't see myself getting out of it.

I lost interest in making new friends because it's too hard for me to juggle between school, my personal problems and my social anxiety. People are all over the place, it is hard to really find really close friends. 

I stopped complaining to my close friends because they are tired of me. So i always try to remain cheerful, but i feel terrible inside. I didn't complain so much in the past, but my complaints when uni started were so bad that my close friend of 8 years wanted to end our friendship. 

I joined a few camps and made new friends but I am distancing myself from everyone. I feel bored being by myself but i am too embarrassed and disgusted to meet others, even my old cliques and best friends.

I feel sad for no reason, and i just want to leave the campus once lectures are over. I can't bear to even stay in school for more than a minute.

My dad committed suicide this year and sometimes i see this as an option too. But i don't have the balls yet. He used to tell me he wanted to commit suicide when he was in university, that's like 30 years ago. I never thought he would do this since he had a family. Now, I don't know if i'm going to follow his path in future.

I think I am a boring person, and i beat myself up every time i cannot seem to click with someone. Recently, i broke up with my 2 year plus boyfriend, hoping that my life would be better without him. It has turned for the worse. Our relationship had always been rocky, so this was like the 4th or 5th break up we had, so I am sure we are not getting back together ever again. 

I want to get better but university life is making me miserable to no end. I really want to be more positive about life but I just can't seem to.

I want to have a rock by my side but I know I need to get better myself before I can really find someone again.

How do you deal with two-faced people? The kind where they pretend that you are such a close friend to them and you discover that they've been bitching about you for over a year now. Also, virtually everyone in your group of friends with them have faced the same problem. We wanna ditch them, but they keep playing the self-pity card.

I always thought this kind of drama dies off in secondary school or JC. 
-
 
Sometimes, when I read stories on nuswhispers about people needing friends, I so badly wanna leave my contact and be their friend. But I'm too scared of not being anonymous to the rest. 
-
 
This is more of a question than a confession...but I always wanted to know what being a typical jerk to girls is like (the type that treats girls badly and makes some of them fall head over heels for.)..as a guy that respects the opposite sex and was raised that way..I'm now seeing that if it's worth benign like that as I feel that maybe I should change. Any solid advise is welcome thanks. 
-
 
To the girl I met at SciLib 2 nights ago, I think I was too shy to accept the hints you were giving.

If you do appear again, be prepared because this time I won't give a damn about my shyness anymore. I will chase you.

-
 
OP of  To me, it's false that time heals. Sure, given enough time one can slowly begin to lead life normally but events do trigger the flooding of memories back. I haven't seen him for 2 years now but neither have I moved on, apart from putting on a show in my life. We shared many songs that until now are still in my morning jam. Though we hardly message each other nowadays (once every 3 months, maybe), he's the first thought I still think of everyday. Für immer, du bist nicht allein. Turn to your best friends. They might be a temporary distraction but at least you can be happy for the time being. PM me if you want, I'm sure you know how to. ;)
-
 
When I listen to any Ed Sheeren songs now, I think of all the time we spent together. Not just because those are our love songs, but because you introduced those songs to me when I was feeling down. I dont know when I fell for you, but when I finally did you seemed ready to move on. 
Was your affection for me that short lived? 
Irregardless, I am thankfull for all that time we spent together. I still cannot get over you even though it wasnt "official". 
Is it very stupid of me to still think of you everyday, and to start planning for your 21st birthday even though it is 3 months in advance? Will you even come to the party I planned for you?
I really miss you.

I am completely and utterly lost in calculus, and I'm devastated! I was never bad at math... I even competed in math Olympiads back in my home country. But for some reason, I'm more than confused and lost in it!! I don't know what to do... I'm depressed and devestated over it and I need help! If anyone, anyone at all, can help me out with this or atleast point me to someone whom you can help me, that would be great

Hi people, need some advice here. I'm an evergreen guy who recently managed to know this wonderful girl. We have went out a few times and we text each other too. In front of her, I don't feel awkward at all and we managed to hit it off really well. From those times that we meet, we managed to get to know each other so much more (her interests, family background etc.) . The messages that we exchanged used to be lengthy, until these past few days it seems that she's trying to avoid me, the replying time between messages seem like eons to me. I don't understand what happened, is she trying to play "hard to get" now? Is this normal while trying to pursue a girl?
-
 
You said you like to fix broken stuff, why don’t you trying fixing me? I think my inside in broken from the tears and emotional that I kept within myself. I can feel that you somehow understand me although you do not say it. I really want to reach you. But there is a barrier. I want to tell you how I feel. But I am scare of rejection. You hinted you like me before but I was scare. I know I have no game. I can’t make you laugh like all the other guys do. But I have a simple and sincere heart. Every time I see you laughing with other guys and not with me, it makes me even more unsure of myself. I am such a pussy. 
-
 
So many posts about relationships!!! Break ups, heartbreak, two timing, failed confessions and a few success stories. People do go through a lot eh. Is it even normal that I'm not really into BGR and what not? From these posts, seems like I'm doing myself a favour. Oh well, hope everyone lives happily ever after :) 
-
 
I think I may have mild depression or something similar. 

I have no motivation to do most things, and hardly go out of my home excluding lectures and tutorials which I sometimes skip. I have a few friends outside of school and nearly none from school. At times I wonder if I should call them acquaintances rather than friends, and whether they care about me at all. Most of the time my face is expressionless because I find smiling tiring and only do it sometimes when interacting with people. I feel really empty inside.

Fortunately(?) I do not have suicidal thoughts, but I occasionally think that most of the people I know would be happier if I were not in their lives.

I hate it when people judge my photo-taking (not professional, just overseas trips or casual photos) and think their angling is so much better than mine. Sometimes they say it, sometimes their smile just droops. Look, I tried my best okay, and I may not have the steadiest hands. Don't you know how patronising it is to talk down to me AS IF I didn't know basics like the 'two-third way' or 'golden ratio'. 

There's no such thing as a bad photo on a holiday trip, only bad perceptions and sentiments.

Is it normal to suddenly develop feelings for a girl you have known in primary school when previously u didnt back in primary school years?
-
 
Sometimes it gets really really lonely in school. Even tho I live in campus, my house is really inactive and only the exclusive group of people have meals tgt and organise parties. All I want is somebody to ask me out for supper whether it's my house or my level and we can all chill and talk about our day while munching on butter chicken. Uni is really a far cry from what I expected. I thought that it will be lots of fun hanging out with my neighbours and friends without realising that all of us have different schedule. I'm really blessed to have met a fun og during one of my camps that I still hang out with and to have some close friends coming to nus with me but even then, there are times that I have to take away food to eat in my room alone like an introvert. I feel like this is the most friendly I've been in my whole life yet I'm still unable to make close friends. I really miss having a group of constants in my life who will study, eat, play and do everything tgt with me. It really feels like my uni life is a failure even tho this is only the beginning. Will it really get better from here?

Ever since I came back from exchange in the States, I have been getting lucky. 3-5 Tinder matches every day. Impossibruuuu

This week is especially crazy. How did I set up 3 consecutive dates with 3 different ladies? Not that I am selfish to want 3 dates, I would really love to know each and every one of them, their individuality and their way of life, through heartfelt and intellectual conversations. Does anyone know how it feels like? :/

The taboo that I had committed, is coming back to haunt my life.  Years ago, I was giving tuition to my cousin at our grandpa's home. My cousin was 17 at that time, she has a sweet appearance that can mesmerize any guy. Sometimes I wished that she wasn't related to me, the "family barrier" is preventing me from developing any feelings for her.  While explaining the questions to her, I felt a pair of hands caressing my thigh under the table. Initially I tried to ignore her actions, but she sat on my lap and gave me a naughty look. 

Instead of performing my duty to educate her as a responsible elder brother, I did the opposite and gave in to temptation. We went all the way and I used her to fulfill all my darkest sexual fantasies like anal. 
After that incident, I can never look into my uncle & aunt's eyes with a clear conscience. Always living with the fear of viewing her as a "tickling time bomb". 

Recently, she broke up with her boyfriend and became emotionally unstable. During our family gathering, we took a night walk together after dinner. She suddenly hugged me from the back and told me how much she missed me and the intimate moments we shared. My worse fear has finally materialized and I got really really scared! I'm not prepared to face the consequences, therefore I kept pushing the blame to her and warned her sternly,not to mention our history ever again. 

It seems that she isn't going to let me off so easily, after all. Recently, she has gotten really close to my girlfriend, actively inviting her out for dinner and shopping. My heart always contract with fear, whenever my girlfriend tells me stuffs like, " wow ! your cousin told me some interesting things about you...". Recently, I'm not having a good appetite nor sleeping peacefully because I'm afraid that she will spill the beans and jeopardize my future and my relationship. 

If she want to exact revenge on me, I will gladly go down on my knees and  accept whatever punishments. Day and night, I'm praying to god hoping that she will not target my girlfriend. She is an innocent party and I don't want her to suffer for my mistakes.

How do you guys feel about friends who ghost? Whenever I feel like being alone, I would just fade into the background and disappear. I really wanna join y'all for dinners/outings but sometimes when the group gets too large with people I don't know, I know I won't be able to enjoy myself.

I feel so sad when you guys think I don't want to hang out with y'all because that is not true. I hope you guys can understand whenever I ghost I don't feel good about it too and theres always an internal struggle within me. I know you asked me to stay for dinner yet:( but I still left without a word. Please please please don't think I don't enjoy your presence. It is just too energy draining for me. I would rather spend it on people I care about.

Im never good with expressing myself so I can't tell you how I feel. Somehow I hope you will be reading this.

Sometimes it gets really really lonely in school. It does become a struggle to make friends in school, especially how frightened I am to talk to people. And it takes a while for me to warm up to someone. All I want is somebody to ask me out for lunch or something. Or even a study buddy? Someone or some people I can chill around with.

University life is really a far cry from what I expected. I thought that it will be lots of fun hanging out with people, much like the times I had in Poly. What I didn’t realize was how important it was to go for the camps as a freshman because that’s where all the cliques formed and I missed out because I had to work and pay off my study debts. There are times that I to find a quiet corner to have my meals alone like an introvert.I find that right now, I’m really at my most vocal and friendly as I can be.

I grew accustomed to the quiet in university. Still it wouldn’t hurt to have company once in a while.

"The Best Place"- can be any location or people, it is a boundless paradise where we can truly be ourselves.

The 3 years that I had spent with you guys are the most memorable and crazy fun times. Till now, I'm still quite confused. I'm just a average Joe with no talent or what so ever... But somehow you bakkas always look upon me as a almighty Senpai with those eyes of admiration. 

We would move from faculty to faculty, searching for our "Best Place", where we can hang out and do crazy stuffs. That is the only time we are truly immune to the merciless and cruel world around us. We are just a bunch of rotten social rejects, no matter how other people judge us or ridicule us. Our "Best Place" has kept our heart warm and prevented that burning passion inside of each and everyone of us from being extinguish, isn't it? 

Here are some of the beautiful and memorable moments that I will kept with me forever.....

1) When we gave 小胖 courage to confess to that hot business chick, although we knew that it's a kamikaze mission. He got rejected without even uttering the 3 words. That chick simply told him, "Your B.O is too strong!". In the end we had to offer our brotherly arms to that crying pig XD. We just couldn't contained our laughter, what rotten bastards we are!

2) On one occasion, we nearly got expelled for playing a prank on our professor by sending her multiple emails to confess our love. We even gave her a nickname "Old virgin". These are the reckless times we shared HAHAHA!

3) The night when we laid on the grass patch of U Town gazing at the stars talking about our sexual dreams. It's really gay for 6 guys to be doing this sort of things. We are all unwanted toys, no chick will ever find us attractive.  

The news of me dropping out of university had struck you guys like a 10000 tonnes truck. No matter how sad or depress you are, please continue to search for "The Best Place" where you truly belongs. When I'm typing this farewell message, I cried a thousand times for you bitches! FUCK YOU ALL! FUCK YOU ALL SERIOUSLY! 

Gomen'nasai ! Gomen'nasai ! I wished I can stay with you guys a little longer...just a while longer... But life is still life, I'm still finding my "Best Place" in the outside world.

I guess I'm still the almighty and incorruptible Senpai since you guys haven't seen me crying like a sissy bitch yet! Best of luck to all of you!  

"Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh! Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad bromance

I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad bromance"

Hi, a question for the girls. Let say there is a guy going after you and you also reciprocatr his feelings, but later he told you that he is bi and had feelings for guys before, would you accept him ?
-
 
Does it surprise you that after so long, your scar still didn't go away fully from my life?

Does it surprise you, that after so long I actually still remember your name, or want to know if you're doing fine after the way you hurt me last time when we were still in the same environment? 

It surprises me even now, to know that I feel jealousy and disgust at the identity of the senior you are with now. I don't know why it bothers me, just that it does. 

I'm not inferior to anybody. But when it's someone I also know that you got together with, invariably my judgement meter goes from 0 to 100 faster than you could blink your eye.

It surprises me, why I'd still wish you best of luck in life when it is all I do to try and get over the image of your face appearing on my feed.

We weren't in that kind of relationship, but now when I hear songs about the aftermath of breakups, I always think about you.

What if I never meet the love of my life? 
I've never been attached to anybody. I don't think any guy ever sees me as a potential romantic interest, probably because of the way I behave- like a hobo. Maybe I should join NUS hobos HAHA. Long story short, everybody around me is either attached or in the process of getting attached, and I feel as lonely and hopeless as ever. Will I ever find someone? What if I found him but let him go? What if I never find him? Btw evergreen here
The assurances of the right person coming along in due time do nothing to assuage my fears. I'm as skeptical as ever.
- scared girl who's gonna die alone

RE: 

Evergreen here too but in these few years (of university) I've learnt that it's alright to be single. Recently I met someone who erased my doubt about there not being someone for me out there at all. We are not together currently, but now I know there is at least one out there & maybe even more. I wish I knew in the past that I didn't have to feel so bad because it was just that that person hadn't appeared in my life. The wait made an outstanding person stand out even more. It was really special meeting someone like that. 

In the meantime, please be the most awsm single person your family & friends will ever know :) Being single isn't something to be ashamed of. It is pointless to wait to be attached in order to start a life you want to claim as 'your life'. Because you are already living life right now. Live it up!

I have been with this guy for some time. Nothing serious, really. Occasionally, we would hang out and do what couples do. Both guys, we do go all the way sometimes and we both know we enjoyed it after it all.

I would say that we are low in profile. Not many people know of our sexual orientations. Of course, other than our close friends or previous partners. This went on for some time. It was only recently that I found out he has a girlfriend of 5 years. They have been together since JC days!!!!!! Thanks to the power of Facebook and mutual friends, I got to know that they were getting a BTO. (They received the HDB housing grant.) BTO would probably mean an engagement, a marriage, a possibility of long-term commitment in a heterosexual relationship.

Less than a month ago, his app profile stated that he was going to leave this life and be faithful to his girlfriend. Later in that week, he stated that he is trying to leave this life. Note the added phrase: trying to.

In all honesty, I have no idea what this guy is doing. I am not jealous or anything. We were never exclusive. We were both having our own fun when he went on exchange. I am feeling more unjust for this girlfriend of 5 years. Does she even know of her boyfriend’s actions? Is he going to continue this double life for the rest of his life?

Poor girl, or let's call her P since that's one of her 2 Christian names.

I am a girl and I think I like my best friend. It just feels so comfortable with him, y'know. Why are things like Love so complicated. How do you know if you really liked someone or you are just comfortable with someone or is the above two sama sama?
But the most important problem is that he likes another girl. I am good friends with the girl and she told me that she does not like my best friend and would hope that he stopped chasing her. He does not know about it. How should I tell him? Should I even tell him?
-
 
I'm so used to getting hurt that, now when the blow falls, I don't even bat an eyelid. That gutted feeling gets partitioned quickly into another box, and I go on speaking as if everything was normal. It's amazing, and at the same time, I wonder if I'm dead inside. The burn, the withering, and yet I laugh, and I smile.

I found out today you already belong to another, and from a certain standpoint, this is such a cruel, cruel joke. Perhaps the Joker isn't the most iconic villian due to the depths of his insanity, but because so many can relate to feeling like being part of some huge joke fate deals out, just for laughs.

Let's appreciate the absurdity, the coincidence, the pathetic state of things, and laugh, laugh, laugh. 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Guys. Would you look at your girl friend's cleavage? It's hard to resist sometimes.
-
 
Years ago, when I was in the same project work group with you, I already had enough problems with you. You were bossy, biased and judgemental. Almost all or none of the ideas I contributed were more than often quickly dismissed by you. Perhaps they weren't practical. Alas, we went to different universities. Years later I don't know what you are up to. Sometimes it just makes me wonder what's your school of thought. What kind of thoughts you harbor. Regardless, thank you for having been throughout my growing up journey during secondary and JC days. For the person you are I wish you all the best for your future endeavors. And hopefully, we will cross paths again someday, anyday :)
-
 
The guy with the Hollister t-shirt in my chem lecture today! I finally found you, the guy who two-timed myself and another girl! Worse, you even dared to get into bed with me telling me how dedicated you are!

I can't wait to... maim you. Don't think I don't know where you live.
-
 
It's very sad to like someone from your clique of 12 years. Unfortunately, I've hinted him so many times but he chose to ignore me every time. It doesn't help that his best friend from the same clique has liked me for the longest time. Maybe that's why he ignores me.

What is love? :'(
-
 
Dear friends, I am the OP from . Thank you all for your kind advice. Because I never had a girlfriend before, not to mention having a girl telling me that she likes me, hence I was really excited yet bewildered at the same time when they confessed.

I decide to go steady with my JC friend. I asked my kaki and he felt she is more suitable for me. I also feel that she likes me and needs me more than my project mate from the way she quietly helped me with some little things over the years without asking for a word of thanks. And this is really something hard to come by.

Yep, and some of you guys are right, it doesn't have to be an exclusive relationship. I can still hang out with my project mate as a friend, because I'm sure she will be totally cool about it as far as I know her; she's definitely more open-minded. That is something I respect a lot.

 Whew! Finally got this out of my head. Now, let's just pray everything will turn out the way I hope. *fingers crossed*
-
 
I am an introvert, and I prefer spending my limited social mana on the people that matter, namely my family and my two best friends.

I am in *a design-related course in SDE* and as much as I expect workload to be heavy, I hate the copious amount of "meeting-up" I have to do with group members whom I'm not close with. Neither am I intending to get close with them because.. I just can't see that happening. They are a bunch of sociable, talkative people. A lot more extroverted than me. They practically look forward to meeting up with one another, even for work. On the other hand, my heart sinks whenever I see another message on Whatsapp going something like, "hey, let's meet up to discuss ______ !"

Sometimes, I feel the urge to suggest to "meet-up" online instead of a physical meeting, but this might make them think I'm a lazybum, and possibly raise it to our profs. Sometimes I just want to tell them hey, I'm an introvert. Can we please don't meet up so often? I know you guys have no problem with meet-ups but to some other people, it's draining and mood-dampening and anxiety-inducing. Please try to understand that what's seemingly effortless, even pleasurable to you, may actually be hell to others. But I'm afraid I'll be blacklisted because of my stupid demands. But seriously, sometimes, communicating online is just as productive as doing so physically. And it saves time and money, so practical! You don't have to worry about forgetting to bring something, because home has all you need.

Speaking of home, I overwhelmingly prefer working at home than in the studio. The studio is an assault on my senses. So much noise, so much discomfort. At home, I am in my element. I can do whatever I want - get food from the fridge, blast my music, rest my legs on the table. At home I am surrounded by familiarity, by the love of family, it's a hotbed for inspiration. And you need inspiration to produce good design. It all goes back to being introverted. Sadly, my studio mates seem to be hinting to me that I should be in studio more often, perhaps implying that I should work harder? Because being seen in the studio means you're working hard? The model student sleeps overnight in the studio? It doesn't help that I do not produce outstanding work; my lack of exceptional quality in my work is now being attributed to being absent in the studio most of the time.

Neither am I saying physical meet-ups should be completely abolished. I know sometimes physical meet-ups are necessary. But I do not want to see your faces all the time. Putting up a smiley front whenever I meet you all is mentally draining. If the work delegation ain't complex, by all means stay at home. You get to save your time and transport costs. I get to save my sanity.

Last summer I was with this girl briefly. A summer fling if you'd call it. I matriculated this year and am currently staying on campus, the same accommodation as her. She has a boyfriend now but i can't help the pang of heartache whenever i see her. And i see her a lot. What do i do? 
-
 
Whenever I hear the song Kiss the Rain, the song you introduced me to, I would think of you and all the times we spent together.

It was so short-lived, and sometimes I regret taking the plunge and get into a rs with you, because after it ended, not did I only lose you, I also lost the friendship.

Till today, almost 3 years after we've parted ways, I still haven't found the closure that I need. 

I would lie to myself that I've moved on, but I know I haven't, because I still miss us.

In a dilemma. Two girls confessed to me last week, and I told each of them to give me some time first. Both of them are my close friends. One of them is my NUS project mate and the other is my JC friend. 

My NUS project mate is average looking, darker-skinned, wears thick glasses and talks very loud. She is more independent and sharp-tongued. She's like a big bro to me who often buys me meals and drinks. And she's fun to hang out with and we can talk a lot without any restraint. But she's a head taller than me, which is quite annoying due to my male ego.

On the other hand,  my JC friend is very pretty, fair, soft-spoken, and polite. I know a lot of guys who have a crush on her. She is like a cute little sister who I must take care of and look out for her feelings. But when we hang out, she's usually walking beside me and not saying anything much unless I talk to her. And she usually doesn't say things clearly and doesn't get to the point, which is also quite annoying.

I like them both. Since they don't know each other personally, I was considering dating both of them simultaneously and then deciding who is more suitable for me, however I feel it's very unfair for both of them if I am selecting in this manner.

Btw, I am an average bespectacled biz school guy who is slender and outgoing. I do not have any fixed set of criteria while choosing a girlfriend as I tend to follow my feelings but my feelings are now confused choosing between my two friends.

Based on my brief description, who do you think suits me more? Or should I stay single for now until I start working? Maybe someone more suitable will appear in my life such that I will say "YES!" without any dilemma?

I've had a crush on an engine girl for a year now. But she makes me feel like such a dumb woman, especially when she scolds me for not being able to help with her Matlab problems. And inspite of that, I'm still saving up in hopes of buying her a Segway :(

(Happy anniversary girlfriend!)

To the op of  I'm the op of . I can never forget the closeness that we had to before he got married. We shared a bed on one overseas trip (I swear we never had sex because we knew we were only friends). But to see him smiling in his sleep and waking up beside him was already itself a gift better than any sex. I feel for you, OP. We had so much interconnection during that short period that we knew what we were thinking.

I could share with him all the depression that I went through because he has been there and could advise me. It was the best time of my life in the short time we had together. I cried everyday after he got married, wondering why I did not confess earlier. Though I know the circumstances was not right (he was on sep, I was in Singapore) but until this day I always blame myself. 

Without him, my depression continued. But  whether he's married or not, I will always love him. Hopefully, someday I can leave this memory without feeling the pain and stabbing of my heart. To me, he is my best temporary gift. To you, OP I'm sure you appreciated a lot too. But that is all you can do for now. Hope we both can overcome this.
-
 
To OP 7577, after reading your post, it reminded me of my current situation. Like you, I have feelings for this person the moment I got to know him. Unfortunately he was always seen with the girls from his og. While I secretly wished it is purely a platonic relationship between any of those girls with him, no one can predict what may happen in the future. Truly, I'm pessimistic. If you get a chance, why not gather your courage...ask your special one out? Unless you tell me his or her og is all filled with opposite gender. You got to embrace the opportunity while he or she is still close to you. Wish you luck!!

To all those who are heartbroken and lonely from a break up: IT WILL GET BETTER. 

There are literally so many other people out there that you have not met. There is no point pining and moping after someone who has left, for they clearly do not share the same sentiments that you do. It is just unfair to yourself, and to those who actually DO CARE about you (family). 

Being a student now already puts you in a very good position. What other situation in your life would you be placed amongst people with roughly the same age and maturity, and in such close proximity. 

Do everything you can to make yourself happy. You are the only person in this whole world that owes yourself your happiness. Get out there and join whatever activities that are available in school (there are tons). 

To have already made it this far into university is already a very commendable effort by you. You are more fortunate and blessed than you think you are (: . Remind yourself this everyday when you are feeling depressed and down. There is always something in your life to live for, as a relationship is only just a small portion of your entire human existence. 

Remember, you are not alone! I too have gone through the days of endless crying and pining, and even feeling suicidal for a period of time. In fact the feelings of desperation and loss are still fresh in my mind. But here I am, still alive and getting better everyday. 

Do also note that there are numerous avenues in Singapore to seek help from if you have no one to sob to or share your pain with. Call "Samaritans of Singapore" at 1800-221-4444. I did when I was at my lowest emotional point, and was greeted by the most heartwarming and helpful person ever. 

Take care of yourself alright! Lastly, here is a warm hug over the internet from your fellow NUS student (: !

Do girls always go for buff boys? I'm a guy who is not buff and I wished I was, because everytime when a muscleman walk past, I will observe the girls, they will look at them and sometimes smile at them. Then they will giggle abit with their friends. I will be envious of the guys and will go to the gym. However, I'm still the same me... Any advice please... I'm still evergreen and I want to change myself :(
-
 
I have this friend. We have been friends for years actually. Whenever we are alone, whether in person or on the phone, she's nice to me. However, when other friends join us, she completely ignores me as if I'm a stranger. We hardly say a word to each other when other friends are around. Even when I talk to her around others, she just gives me this expressionless face. But when others talk to her, she's got tons to say with full expression. Plus, it's not like she hasn't met the other friends in a long time. She does chat with the other friends very often too. It's so weird! Why does she behave like this? I really don't understand. It's happen multiple times but I thought nothing of it till now. It's really starting to affect me. Would she be considered a 'toxic' friend? I mean real friends wouldn't behave like this right? 
-
 
I have met someone who is open-minded, extreme left wing, love to learn general knowledge and other languages. He is also the kindest man i ever know. I fell in love when I first talked to you. Though you are short, not handsome nor popular, even with your long hair now I still fall in to your bubbly laughter. I want to be with you forever but alas you have graduated and married. 

To those nerds out there, there are girls who will chase after you too, not just popular guys. Just have a good character like him. And maybe someone will come by and appreciate your inner beauty. Alas, not for me. :(
-
 
Saw you in town last night and still can't get your face out of my mind. We've known each other for a few years but haven't really spoken in the last year. I really miss you; miss talking to you. 
-
 
Most of my friends are interested to go on exchange. I am a bit interested too, but I have health problems and I don't want to risk it by staying overseas for a long period of time. I feel so left out when my friends discuss about going on exchange among themselves because they know that I am not going. Is going on exchange really that important? Why do I see everyone talking about it?
-
 
are the any couples who have nothing much in common? How did it work out?

It appears that there are mutual feelings between me and a girl but I always feel I do not know what to say to her. She's at the same wavelength as my other friend as she is always laughing with him. It makes me feel that they are more compatible:(

Is it advisable that if she accepts my date can I be straightforward and tell her how I feel about being with her? Something along the line of...I feel that we have nothing much in common but I would really want to try this relationship out? Is it too pessimistic?  
-
 
OP of , I don't even know if it really is you but certainly, reading the post brought back a flood of memories. 

When I think about us, I think about time. I think about how the clock seems to stop ticking when we were together, how it appeared as though the rest of the world has fallen away and it was just us. I think about how our conversations through the night appeared to hasten the very rotation of the earth's axis and before we know it, the sky is light again. I think about how excruciating each second was, when you were away and it seemed like we would grow an age before we could be in each other's presence. And then, I think about how time dictated our circumstances and brought a jarring end to a connection that neither of us expected, or thought possible. 

I have been, and will remain, a cynic when it comes to matters of the heart. But with you, all the outdated notions of a grand, all conquering love seems well within the realm of realism. So much time has past but still I dream sometimes of how things have been in another time and place. I hope that you are well. I hope that you have chased down all your lofty dreams and I hope, most of all, that you are happy. I don't think that there has ever been a day when I stopped loving you and I do wish that love is all you need. The pain we both feel, even today, reminds us otherwise. 

I hope one day to see you again, if only from a distance. And I hope that when I do, I catch a glimpse of your real smile. The one that speaks of excitement, and more importantly, of a deep seated happiness. The one you used to reserve for when our eyes met. Because then, I would know that you have found love. 

Till then, I miss you, and I always will. 
-
 
The first time I saw you, I sensed something was different about you..maybe love at first sight? Not only your personality, but your unique perspectives is something I am starting to admire. Though you are closeby, it feels so distant cause of the ogmates whom you always hangout with. How I wish you didn't have that boundary around you...
-
 
recently this person that i am interested in kept poking me to tell her who exactly is the person that i like... but isn't it obvious enough after all the things that i have done for you??

To  When I started NUS, I was 24. I must have been the oldest student in my major. I went in with an open heart, open mind and a clear goal - which was to get my degree. That clear goal I had in mind really helped me in being less self-conscious about how much older I was compared to everyone else. 

And here's a secret, everyone else assumes that everyone is about the same age. Besides, I never felt the need to tell my age to the people I met in NUS through that compulsory camp I went to (where I met most of my friends who stuck with me through my three years) or through the different modules I've taken because my age pales in comparison to something else I have to offer - my personality. 

In fact, the fact that I'm much older than my friends became a source of entertainment for me. When they find out my actual age I get replies like, 'Really?? But you look so young!' or 'I don't believe you.. Show me your IC!'

So open your heart, open your mind and make that goal of getting a degree even clearer in your head. Let your personality shine through, make new friends (and keep your age a secret until they ask you, it's fun!) and keep your eye on the prize. The road to getting a degree from NUS is tough enough, don't let anything break your spirit. 

And it is with that unbroken spirit that I am now a proud NUS alumnus who graduated at 27. I am proud because an NUS graduate is a quality graduate at any age.

There is this girl that I like and known for 2 months and we have been chatting and going out together at least 5 times for nearly one and a half months. You could say we were on really good terms with one another. Recently, we went out together and things were still as it has always been at that point of time. We were happily talking and eating, even till when we parted ways to head home. However, on the same night, she suddenly just stopped talking to me. I thought she was busy or something but this has actually continued on for 3 days straight, even up to now. Hence, im in a rather confused state right now and would be glad if someone can enlighten me on what could have happened.
-
 
With you it was different. You didn't just make me happy, you made me feel at peace, protected, and whole. Even though it was short lived, thank you for teaching me what love feels like. 

I hope you're making progress with your battles, and that you'll realise that you are worth so much more, and find the courage to not just settle, no matter what the consequences are. I hope that someday, you'll find someone that loves you as much as or even more than I do. Know that I will never stop loving you, and I'll always keep a part of you in my heart. 

After so long, not a day has gone by that I don't think of you. I've never quite experienced hurt and pain like this, but I'd do it all over again anyway. Maybe someday we'll find our way back to each other, but for now, I wish you well. I wonder if I'll ever find love like what we used to have ever again.

I miss you.

 hey dear chances are that he won't change. find someone who loves you for you, not the pleasure you can provide

Sincerely,
Someone who has been in a similar situation before

I have been friends with this girl whom I'd met during camp for 2 years already. She's kind of introverted but we've somehow gotten really close and are comfortable around one another. For eg, we can talk about almost anything, including our eye candies, et cetera. We've met up a couple of times before for outings, but always with a group of friends. When she left recently for her SEP, I realised that a part of me felt like it was missing. What's more, I won't be seeing her for a whole year. I'm currently very confused with what I'm feeling now and have no idea what the heck is going on, or how to proceed. Need advice ASAP.
-
 
After all these years of friendship, I am still someone you can dispose anytime, someone who you made used of. And you are still the very selfish being that think of only yourself. Thanks for letting me realize that there are much better friends in the world. Although I still find it really upsetting that I have to purposely drift apart from you and the squad, I think it won't matter much to you anyway. Thank you.
-
 
OP of  here.
Thank you all for your comments I feel much better. :) 
I think it's not a lot about my age as well, but the fact that my friends, like my jc friends, are all in year 4 already whereas I've only just started my University journey. It makes me feel ashamed even though I shouldn't. :(
But thank you all for your kind words!

Am I not suited for a girl if I am not able to make her laugh as much as her other guy friends does?  It appears that she likes me too but I would always doubt myself when I see her laughing so much with her other guys friends.

OP of  here.
Ok well, adding on, for the past month when things were still normal, we would normally take pictures together and she would like it on insta. But the photo from the recent outing wasnt along with my other photos which were food from the past 3 days. Just as i thot she will not like anymore of my photos, she actually liked the photo i posted today. As for the messages i sent her, its more of like she replies them at a rate of 1 msg per day compared to last time and its definitely not because shes busy since she was able to talk on a group chat in which both of us are in whenever shes online. So im still puzzled.

Dear  ,  
I think I understand where you're coming from. I tend to feel like this sometimes, especially so in the past 2 years of uni. I joined orientation camps and got really anxious and uncomfortable because internally people were bitching about each other but infront of them they acted like nothing happen. I guess what helped me feel and think better is the acceptance that in this society, nobody is ever 'good' , including myself. Everybody is flawed and makes mistakes and that's okay. Sometimes, we see ourselves in others too. I guess you just have to do what you think is right and surround yourself with people you love and trust. If they don't like you, then it's ok, just move along. U dont need their 'okay'. 
And also, feeling like you have no one to rely on and trust in Nus, isn't being 'toxic'. 'Toxic' is only when you hurt/bring others down intentionally. 
All the best for school and i hope you feel better <3

I'm posting this again since the first time I submitted it, it got filtered (i guess). I'm currently in a stable relationship with my gf and even have plans of getting married. however, I've a dark past that only a few of my closest friends know. I went to prostitutes before and got addicted to it for a while. It all changed after I met my gf. I don't know whether to tell my gf this or not. I want to leave the past behind but I sort of feel guilty for not letting her know this. can anyone advice me?

Is there such thing as love at first sight? More of like attracted to his/her character because of something they were doing

To my bf of 4 years,
I really hope I can tell you this in person, but you are a person who values physical affection and I am really afraid that this will affect our r/s… I feel very dirty each time after it… I end up cleaning myself thoroughly, crying myself to sleep sometimes and there were even times when I had suicidal thoughts… The thought of having your body fluid on me makes me feel really disgusted about myself… 
Because of how conservative I am, you used to joke about me coming from another era, I thought I could accept it as time passes, but apparently I am still me… I’m sorry.

To the two business sch dudes talking REALLYYY loudly just beside my table, stop showing off alrdy. Got one pretty girl share table with both of you then talk about going to Google and how fun it is to take CS1010. Dudes she maybe from computing, but no need show off, she obviously not interested in both of you. =_=

I really look up to people who go for relationships. I'm an evergreen who would rather stay as an evergreen than take the gamble. The mere thought of a possible failure has the ability to throw my mind into chaos. I am just too afraid.

I posted  and I must say I'm really touched many of you offered your advices and encouragement. To OP , you're strong, and I really admire you. You're right. I hope I'll reach that stage you're at as soon as I can. But right now this period is really hard for me. I'm hanging on to my closest grp of friends now. This incident has shown me how awesome they are, that they are so willing to put everything down to be with me. They've done so much for me I feel so fortunate and I wonder what have I done to deserve then. Because of them, I want to be strong - because that's the only way I can repay their kindness. Nevertheless, they cannot be with me all the time. There will always be times where I have to be alone. These are the toughest times to get by. In the day I work really hard to get my mind off him. I've blocked him off on all social medias. We're no longer in contact. I work my ass off at work, I exercise a lot more than usual, I keep trying to reach out to new people, making new friends. I mingle around a lot more than I used to now and I laugh a lot with my colleagues and new friends. Each day I make myself so tired that I crash on my bed and sleep. But in the mornings I'll wake up and feel so hollow I shed some tears. It's been like this ever since the break up. I can't believe that he could really just let go of whatever we had- that beautiful 4years. Will he ever come back? It's a silly thought I know but whenever I look back, it's almost always happiness and sweetness. We had differences but we always managed to overcome them. This time round it just broke apart, so quickly, so drastically. If you're a guy and you've done this to a girl before, I wish you would explain to me why you did it. How? How did your feelings changed? How did you let yourself change? Why didn't you mention anything when you felt unhappy? Why did you bottle them up and let it all go at once? Was the relationship not worth giving it another try? I'm sure it's not easy for you either, but why would you still give all these up? Is all this chasing and excitement really so worth it? Which idiot would give up on a girl who loves him so much- to chase after someone who doesn't? To chase after all the superficials? Because she was your first love and you don't wish to settle? Because YOLO? I need answers. 
To those who are going through the same thing as me, I wish I could give you a hug right now. It's tough being strong, but you have to do it, even if it's not for yourself, do it for your family and friends. Embrace them, and accept all kinds of kindness. It made me feel a lil better bit by bit. 
To boyfriends out there, please don't make promises you can't keep. If you want to break, do a clean break and don't leave any threads behind. 
To third parties, I don't know if you even have any conscience at all. To give all sorts of false signals to a guy. It's mostly the guy's fault yes. But I think if you're aware you're the reason your friend's relationship is on rocks you should have the decency to back off a little. Sending him a photo of yourself to 'cheer him up'? What were you thinking? Being able to attract a guy's attention makes you feel great, feel superior? Do it to a single guy then, why fool with someone attached? Your own excitement and happiness was rooted on someone else's misery, just so you know. If you're really not interested in him, please stop dragging him around in circles.

In response to a particular comment on  post , it simply tells me something. Some guys are simply ignorant of how a girl may feel when it comes to being ogled at. Obviously the girl must have noticed something amiss before making comments on such things, but yet there is no evidence to proof if this is indeed happening. Some guys must have thought the girl imagine too much (possibly because guys are unlikely to encounter this problem). Worst, i have heard people said that guys ogling at girls is normal and there is nothing wrong. Why does such mentality still exists at this age??

In response to ,

That's where you're wrong. Admittedly in NUS you'll meet many hi-bye acquaintances, but I have actually met people whom I've gotten closer to. Join more activities, camps, ccas etc, and when you meet more people, there's a higher chance that few out of the many you meet will stay a close friend. 

In short, dont seclude yourself and complain that all people you know are simply acquaintances. I'm a Year 2 that has met close to 100 people ever since coming NUS, many of them stay hi-bye friends, but there are like 5-10 I can call close friends. And I still intend on being more active and knowing more people.

It's possible and it just depends on you. Not too late to start joining more ccas and events now.

I'm a y2 evergreen and I'm not really interested in dating. I do want a relationship eventually but I'm still waiting to meet the right girl. And no one I've known so far has been the One for me. My bros call me dumb and tell me I'll be alone forever. But I haven't found someone who fits and I just don't want to waste time dating around or meeting new people on dating sites just for the sake of it. I know people enjoy it and find life partners through dating apps, but it's just my personal preference not to. I'm sick of people with multiple exes and relationships telling me how I'm a "naive evergreen" with "romanticised ideas of love", like it's something bad that I should feel ashamed about. I know my friends mean well, but I wish they would stop trivialising my optimism. Yeah, I can wait for the one to stumble into my life. I don't think I can find her by swiping a few pictures online. I think I'll find her through shared experiences in life. I think that if a girl I might have crush on doesn't like me back, then she isn't it for me. What's the point in trying? I'm only interested in dating the one. I will do whatever it takes to make things work when I've found her, and I would rather be alone forever than be together with someone who wouldn't last a lifetime. Yes, forever alone. I'm "very evergreen", "naive" and a "hopeless fool". Yeah, I'm a romantic at heart, but I'm also practical guy... What's wrong with that?

I understand that there are people who have it harder but sometimes it gets really hard living life as a shy, socially awkward, introverted person with low self esteem, bad body image and a history of mild depression and eating disorder... :(

In before any "dat plot twist tho", I'm gay. But that's not why I'm writing in. I'm seeking advice. I was with a schoolmate for two years, but we broke up in the earlier part of this year due to him not being able to commit fully to the relationship. Two years was a long time, and I didn't want to waste any more time on someone that was afraid of a shared future with me.

We've a common class and that's fine. I'm not weirded out or anything like that. After all, we ended on good terms. But I'm worried for him. I suspect he has a drinking problem. He comes in late for classes reeking of alcohol. I asked - in secret - some of his friends whom he clubs with if they've noticed any change in  behaviour and each one said that he's drinking more and uh... getting really violent when drunk. I found out too that he didn't do well at the last round of exams. 

What I want to know is... how do you approach someone whom you suspect has a drinking problem given that a shared history? I knew him intimately as my boyfriend before we became strangers, but I'm still genuinely concerned for his well-being.

Long post ahead.

Just stumbled upon some lyrics which quite perfectly describes the mess that's been in my mind for some time.
"You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I’d live to see today
You’re still in my mind, but not in my chest
I’m a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought that I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don’t really need you
I’ll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don’t stick around at all
I was the boy that was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind and left me all alone to die
I’ll sit on my basement floor, turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I’m down there I’ll know that I won’t be running through your mind"

I'm Guy and she's Girl. Guy is one of the typical confessors here: shy, awkward (especially with females), introverted, antisocial, lack of friends, alone most of the time, etc. With very few female friends, any positive female attention makes his overthinking mind go crazy. Perhaps that's the root of the problem here.
Guy and girl met two years ago. They clicked and soon had a never ending WA convo going on. Guy thinks maybe there's some good chemistry between them. Starts falling for her.  Even mutual friends notice that they're close and stir them. Girl vehemently denies these, making guy wonder if there was ever anything between them at all, or if she was just being normal and friendly. So as you can expect guy keeps his feelings hidden.
Some months later the WA convo starts drying up and they drift apart. Guy accepts that perhaps it was never meant to be and understands that he must move on. WA contact is still intermittent until present day, but guy knows it is nothing more than small talk.

Fast forward half a year later. Guy was in the vicinity of girl at a canteen. They definitely saw each other, but nothing at all happened. Both ended up dao-ing each other. Yet guy still felt the butterflies, and jealousy when friends stir girl with a new man now. But what right does guy have? Guy and girl are like strangers again.

Sigh, I know I must move on, but it seems impossible to find another girl to at least make me overthink about, so that I will forget girl-from-story.
-
 
Why is it that some guys who are attached like to pretend that they are not? Both on social media and in real life. My boyfriend does this and I've mentioned it to him a couple of times but he just brushes it off. Is it a red flag?
-
 
Sometimes, or many times, I can't help but wonder how we would be like if religion didn't tear us apart. As I wonder, I start to sink into a state of sadness or even depression. And so, I lose my focus to do anything which includes studying. And so, I am having difficulty in catching up with my academics. And so, I find myself sinking into the state of depression even more often. And so, I tend to isolate myself from everyone. And so, I feel lonelier than ever. Sigh, life sucks. I want to take a break from breathing

I understand how hard it is to find true friends in uni. I am in Year 3 now, and I never really participated in much stuff (is this bad?). 

But when I do, the friends (or should I say acquaintances) I made there are really the hi-bye kind. It's so hard to connect with people. 
-
 
right about now, i really wish i had someone by my side. 
someone who really understands, someone who really cares, someone who treasures relationships.
This silence is deafening. this emptiness is eating away at me.

to the OP of 

right about now, i wish i could somehow contact you.  but we're hidden behind this veil of anonymity. 
your story is so scarily similar to mine. i thought i was the only one going through such a ridiculous situation..
its really absurd, and scary how people can change so drastically and so quickly.

but please, keep your faith in guys like me, who strongly believe in staying loyal and faithful. Just like you, i was planning a future with her, everything was going great. but half a year into her job, she left for a guy from her office. to be honest, i too probably cant place my trust in others again. but slowly, i'll still try to, in hopes of finding someone like you.

To the OP whose boyfriend changed after entering the banking industry, don't get discouraged by this incident. Instead, what has happened should teach you not to depend too much on anyone else and start building on yourself. No matter how stable things might be, it is hard to say that nothing will change, because people change. Often, this happens during the major transitions in our lives (e.g. entering university, getting a new job...etc). I have been through a similar experience, whereby I had once believed that my boyfriend would me forever and we would get married. But as we entered university, he changed. Similar to your experience, he wouldn't stop talking to certain girls despite the fact that I had expressed my discomfort; he had also never disregarded my feelings previously. It is a hard truth to accept but in his eyes, you simply aren't as relevant and important as you were before. Now he has his sights on girls whom he perceives are what he desires. My life had once revolved all around my boyfriend; It took me a long time to stand up by myself again after I broke it off with him. But in the process I realised that him changing was out of my control - it wasn't my failure, it was that his love for me was so easily manipulated by the environment around him. In some sense, if he was so easily enticed by other women, this incident could have happened at some point much later in your lives, even if this girl never appeared. At least you know now. So pick yourself up! Your life is your own.

im a year 2 student and honestly i feel like i've failed damn badly in terms of trying to find friends around me. I've joined a lot of events and projects and honestly i thought that I've made close friends only to realise that everyone probably treats me more like an acquaintance instead.

it's so hard to try to find people whom has common interests with you (even though I kinda already exhausted a lot of my options) and to try to live through each day alone is tough when the curriculum gets tougher.

right now im not even sure why im waking up everyday for? and even in school i try my best to hide my real emotions because i don't want people to know that i'm this negative inside and even shun me away more, but i feel so tired and helpless from the situation im in right now.

Admin, if you guys truly filter properly then why is 7654 published and several Of mine aren't. Is it is you know who is sending what and thus you're biased? Or are you just gonna ignore this as usual. 
-
 
I greet my days with a smile. Regardless if the day is packed, assignments are due or I'm feeling tired. Because what's there not to be happy about, right? 
When I leave my house, I am reminded of exactly why others to smile. People, people are the reason other people don't smile.
So be kind to each other :)

I met my first true love during our yr 1 engineering freshmen orientation. I was his first love and we dated for nearly 5 years before we broke up a few months ago. 

During the 4 crazy hectic years in engineering, I struggled badly. I really wanted to give up at some points, yet I persisted on with his love and encouragement. He was always there when I needed him. He never had much difficulty, he was really smart and could ace most of his exams.

We were inseparable. People were envious of me because they could tell how much he really loves me. My family and friends approved of him too. They felt that he was sincere, simple and down to earth. He too, was always thinking about marrying me, talking about children, about future. On our fourth year of relationship, I was pretty much set on building a future with him together. But we had to get our career on track first.
Just when things looked rosy, things suddenly went downhill after 1 year into our job after graduation. I went into engineering field, while he found interest in the banking industry. I didn’t think he would be well suited in the banking industry. He is more introverted, and prefer to stay home instead of socialising. I expressed my concern, but also encouraged him to pursue his passion. He was fascinated with the money the banking industry could bring him. I felt that it was good for a guy to be ambitious. However, as the time passes, he started to become nearly obsessed with investments and trading. Not just that. He was hungry for career advancement. He wanted to jump from back office to the front office as quickly as possible. He started to leech on this female colleague who is really popular amongst everyone including the bosses. He became great friends with her, and they went for coffee chats with big bosses to gain connections and all, in hopes of climbing out of the back office one day. 
Their relationship turned from colleagues to good friends within a year. When I found out he has been constantly chatting with her, I told him to stop because it was making me uncomfortable, yet he refused to. This was the first time he refused my plea. I knew then that he has more feelings for her than just a good friend. But he denied. Within just 2 weeks everything fell apart. He confessed to her before he broke up with me. She rejected him. But he broke up with me anyway. He said it’s not me, it’s him. He is lost and he wants to find himself. Later I found out that right after we broke up, he began to actively chase her. 

I don’t know if they are together now. But sometimes I still find it so absurd. That a guy would give up a long term relationship with his soul mate. Yes, even after we broke up, he still called me his soul mate. We never had much problems. We were stable, and just really comfortable with each other. I don’t understand why would anyone give up someone he calls a best friend, confidant and soul mate, without even trying to make this relationship work when he felt that things weren’t right. He never expressed any unhappiness. We hardly ever quarrelled. This abrupt end in relationship is somehow making me lose faith in true love. Because I think we both agree that what we had was true love.

The truth is, I really hate NUS. 

If you have heart and show your emotion, then people treat you as weak and stupid.
If you choose to show the logical side then people just use you as a tool to ask for notes and help for homework.
If you're the intuitive kind, then people just pretend to be nice, so that you will be nice back.
If they don't even like you, they talk behind your back. Some pretend to be friendly in front. Some give you a slap and run away* (they think you deserve punishment, but they don't even give you a chance to reason or fight back).

*No man, you are not a good person. If you laugh at someone, insult someone, make fun about someone, gossip about someone, talk negatively about someone, but do not dare to admit to the person face to face, you are NOT A GOOD PERSON. 

And the worst part? Your respond to this is probably: "hey, this is life. The real world is like this, you should get used to it too."

I rather be working right now. I'm so exasperated. 

An SG50 in utter despair.

Will a girl ever date a feminine guy?

After I came for my exchange, I just realised that I'm really a socially awkward and introverted person.

I really don't know what to talk about when hanging out with my new friends - yes, I do observe, and I found that they normally talk about US dramas, movie stars, or just other random stories they've encountered during their trip in the previous summer. I don't have much of these materials to say, and even if I have, I don't know how to express it in a way that the other party in the conversation would be interested. It is thus always the case that my friends would be able to talk to each other endlessly and (seemingly) with pleasure, and I am usually the (only) one that shuts his mouth. When I don't have much to share I would feel left-out, uncomfortable and will have the drive to leave first.

Also, my friends have all this and that kinds of activities to organise and to go for, e.g. barbecuing, mass-swimming, hiking, clubbing, or maybe just travelling to some random places. I do want to go for some of these, but I also feel uncomfortable doing them with people that I'm not very familiar with. I don't know many people here either - there are very few NUS exchange students - and everything just makes me feel lonely.

That reminds me of what happened before. I'm an introverted, shy PRC guy. I have been trying to integrate myself into the NUS community, joining different kinds of activities in the past years and trying my very best to make more friends, but the results all ended up the same. I did make some friends, but most of them are the hi-bye kind, and I don't think I really know any of them well. It is really the norm that, from my honest point of view, outgoing people are more welcomed and popular, whereas introverted people are more easily ignored, although I don't really see anything wrong with the latter or anything superior with the former.

Now think about it, I don't really know why I came for SEP, or even came to Singapore for studies in the first place. I guess everything would have been great if I did my university education in my own country. Who knows.
-
 
To my friends I'm someone who always smiles but when I'm alone the façade drops. I have so much going on in my life right now I don't even know where to start. I don't share my problems with anyone because I don't want to affect them. Sometimes I see others hurting, I just want to go up to them and give them a big hug. To tell them that I understand them, that it's all going to be ok. I guess it doesn't really matter in the end. We all end our story the same way. Some lives are just not meant to be happy. I'll just do my best to make sure no one else has to suffer.
Stop what you're doing and give those happy people a hug. You never know how much it means to them.

I am just being worried and curious. Is it true that it is very hard or near impossible for guys to find their significant others in the workplace since most girls will have been happily attached or married by then?
-
 
how do you guys actually do the confession talk ?
1. "we need to talk"
2. "hey i need to tell you something serious"
3. "i like you"
4. others
5. dont do it
-
 
I tried. That's all I can say. I really tried. To others, it may seem like nothing, but to me, it took a lot of courage.
I'm going to focus on my studies. I will make it for exchange, and graduate. 
Pls dun text me ever again, and give me false hopes. Much appreciated.

I feel so jealous when I see other guys making my crush laugh so much. I feel that my crush likes me too but I am quite awkward and am not able to make her laugh as much.

Girls, would you really like a more boring guy? I feel that I will always compare myself to the other guy and feel that they are more compatible. Fk this man...I really cannot get past myself thinking that she is laughing more with the other guy.

Is it okay to date your friend's ex?
Okay maybe not a friend anymore because I dont keep in touch with her after JC. But both of them broke up quite long ago.

Recently I have been talking to her ex because we happen to be in the same uni batch year. Surprisingly enough, he was going to the same faculty as me. We could hit off pretty well. But sometimes thoughts like "he was your (not so close anymore) friend's ex afterall and the both of them remained friends, occasionally talking to each other. So you should not be even thinking about dating him etc"

What should I do
-
 
With regards to OP of , i felt the same way as you. We have been together for a year, yet not a lot of his friends know that he is attach and everyone thought he is still single  He does not post our photos on fb or at least to publicise it. I felt that our seems to be an underground relationship. Don't get me wrong, I do not mean that he has to publicise our photos to make our relationship known, but at least, this shows that he is proud in having me and making it known. Sometimes, I do get jealous when I see my friends posting photos on fb with their Bf, while for me, even when I upload, I cannot even tag him.

With all the 'does he/she love me' kind of confessions starting to appear, I have two points I would like to share:

1. Follow your heart. Instinct will tell you what you need to know. 
2. A partner who is 'not spending enough time with you' does not indicate that he/she is not in love with you. Different individuals show love in different ways; for all you know, he/she is trying to show you their affection to their best effort - google 'Love Language'. 

From: A senior who is about to get married soon :)

Have been seeing a few confessions related to whether a girl would accept a guy who is shorter than her or not good-looking etc. A bit paiseh to comment so I'd just like to give my 2 cents here.

Most girls would have a "dream guy", with all the characteristics she wants e.g. good looks, wealth, intelligence, romantic enough to sweep her off her feet. Being individuals with our own likes & dislikes, every girl would value different traits differently. Physique-wise, some prefer buff bods, some prefer the lean kind etc. If you ask around, many girls would say they EC guys who are taller and good-looking.

But at the end of the day, it is hard enough to find someone compatible in terms of personality, lifestyle & chemistry. If a girl is able to find that in a guy, I honestly doubt she will reject him simply because he is of the same height or not the hottest guy around. 

Maybe there are girls who die die must find a boyf taller than them/above average in looks, but I don't know of any of them personally. 2 of my attached girlfriends have partners of the same height; both couples have been together for 4 years. 2 years ago, one of my friends got together with a guy who we secretly thought wasn't as good-looking as her, but have since grown to like because of his personality and how sweet they are to each other.

From a female perspective, physical characteristics are only part of what we consider when finding our other half. Don't let height or looks deter you from pursuing or accepting someone who could be perfect for you in every other way.

Need insights with regards to women. I got to know this lady, who is single, in FASS. We exchanged numbers and contacted one another almost daily. The thing is, I have been the one initiating the conversations and these conversations are short -lived. Also, I get a mix from fast replies to no replies at all. I have slowly accepted the notion that she might not be interested at all. Should I just walk away or try harder?
-
 
to  Well, i guess i know how you feel. I am in a similar situation as you but I am the one that likes to keep things private. Maybe i can help shed some light into why your bf is feeling that way. As you might already know, there are many different kind of love language. Like physical affection, acts of service,gifting etc. I am almost a non physical affection kind of person, I do not particularly enjoy touching or kissing. I am someone who would show love by doing something that i know my SO would appreciate. From buying food to even just printing notes. On the other hand, my SO is more touchy and likes holding hands and kissing.  But i feel like as long as we both know that we are committed into the relationship, i really see no point in telling the world that you are attached. We should stop seeking assurance and gratification from social media and other people irl. Once you accept that you dont need "approvals" from other irrelevant people, you'll definitely feel happier
-
 
Admist all these confessions about unrequited love and relationships etc.: You'll always have an 'ideal' partner in your mind - like them being tall, dark, sporty, evergreen, humourous, rich etc. Those were mine but honestly when the right person comes and the feelings of (not necessarily love) adoration and affection hit you like a truck, you'd see that these things don't matter. 

Sometimes I wish I was able to tell my ex this, that you can't mould me into the girlfriend that you already drew a blueprint for in your head. Relationships and love doesnt work that way. I do miss him from time to time but I realised recently that I'm in a much better place right now, with someone that I love even though he may be far from what I would describe as my "type" but he makes me happy and that should be all that matters.
-
 
I have a secret side of me that no one knows. Under the facade of a nerdy and quiet guy, i'm actually the submissive in  a BDSM relationship with my gf, (something like 50 shades of grey, for those not in the know.) Specifically she uses me to vent her stress in school, and somehow after each 'session' I too would feel less stressed. I wonder how common such a relationship is in NUS, since we are quite closeted about it, and we don't know anyone else in the same lifestyle.

I have been together with my bf for some time and I do really like him for who he is. While I think I love him, I don't feel like he is loving me enough, at least not in the way that I can feel it... I have talked to him about it and tried to reinstate the relationship but things are not getting better.  I feel like he is not proud of me as a girlfriend and he doesn't cherish me and make me feel special. This has really began to affect my patience for this relationship. It makes me wonder if he really loves me? And how do I tell if I truly love him? Can someone just tell me how do you know if you are in love and if the other person loves you? Thanks...

To . I'm in the same situation as you. My bf is also a social butterfly and doing really great in his studies, while I'm just the girl next door. At first, I felt a little inferior too, but I got over it by being kind with myself. I've made peace with myself by having the mindset that I don't have to live up to anyone's standards, and my self-esteem has improved. Yes, my bf will always be the better person, but this is me. If I don't enjoy getting out there to socialize and make new friends, then I don't have to. If I don’t accept and be happy with myself, then probably no one will. Though it doesn’t always work the other way.
About confiding in your boyfriend about your troubles, well, I’m sorry to say that it seems like he’s not being caring and concerned enough for you. No matter what problems couples share with each other, they should be empathizing and lend a listening ear to each other. Your boyfriend should accept you for who you are, and maybe you can make it easier for him by accepting yourself first. I’m not sure how long you guys have been together, but if it still doesn’t help, then give him time, talk through it and hopefully you guys can grow and mature together. Also, it boils down to compatibility. All the best, babe.

Currently feeling lost while stuck in a certain NUSSU club that has a majority of international students from the same country...and word is that they keep letting their friends in. Guys, that's not cool. Give others a chance.

Girl, if you are not interested in this guy, pls dun give him false hopes and just tell him directly. He can take it. It's as simple as that. Why make things so complicated?
-
 
I will always steal glances at guys with nice bods. How I can have their arms, their abs and just about everything. I will fantasise abt whether they want to date me or not.
And yes. I'm a guy.

I don't give a fuck about anything and i feel so happy going to school every single day. Mostly just to sightseeing...

My bf and I broke up close to half a year now but even till now, I still cant get him out of my mind. I cry whenever I pass by a place that hold memories to the both of us... and to-date, I cant forgive myself for the things I have done wrong..

Two common quarrel topics between us - the issue about me not giving him personal space, and the issue of him messaging his other female friends instead of messaging me.

He asked for more personal space, and he wanted to meet me less. He didnt want to see me so often. He wanted to have meals with his school friends. He wanted to play computer games and not have to tend to his phone at all. He wanted to be able to meet whoever he likes, whenever he likes, and talk to anyone he wants to.

This, coupled with the fact that Im an insecure person, made me doubt him a lot. I kept asking if it was because he didnt love me anymore, that he didnt want me anymore. I began suspecting that he loved some other girl instead. I constantly asked to check his phone, and in his message threads, I read his messages: "Good Morning", "Good night", "Sweet dreams", "Talk to you tmr", "I miss you", sent to his female friends. Because I always got upset reading these texts, he stopped letting me check his phone anymore. In the past, he used to always assure me that these female friends of his were only his good friends. But eventually, he stop assuring me. He got pissed that I kept doubting him. He felt that there was no trust in the relationship.

One day, we quarrelled again.... but this time, he didnt reply my messages at all. 2 hours later, he sent me an sms that said: "I think I dont love you anymore.."

I still remember that day, I still remember his words. I still remember how angry I was that I demanded him to give me an answer as to whether what he meant was that he wanted a break up.

Yes, our relationship ended that day..
Im still holding on, but I know he has moved on..

Strangers, friends, lovers.... now strangers again..

4 years relationship, ended with his last words: "I loved you. but that was in the past." This is the end.. I lost him for good..

Will I still believe in love again?

sometimes i wonder if i am anyone's eyecandy or crush.. :x

Has anyone had this feeling of loss or mistaken opportunity? 

Initially we did not have much chemistry, but both of us took some effort and in the end we mature together as a couple. Eventually we ironed out our differences and solved many issues together. We are in a very stable relationship and marriage after graduation is pretty much on the back of our minds now.

Just this month, I got to know this other guy, who have so much in common with me, we clicked with each other immediately. Make no mistake, I still love my bf very much. I just have this sense of lost opportunity, where I imagine in a parallel universe, if I met this other guy first, will it be any better? And sadly him, in our this reality, is still waiting for the girl for him. (He is a great guy and I feel sorry for him.)

We might not have much difference in interest, and thus less friction in our relationship (My bf and I argued a lot in the earlier stages of our r/s). For example, I initially can't stand why my bf has to gym more than twice per week. At first impression, this guy seems like a much better fit for me, and me for him. 

I am just curious. How everything can be different if I just choose to sit somewhere else in my first tutorial. Maybe I didn't have to go through all the shouting, heartbreaks, tears at night in the past just arrive at where I am now. 

I guess I will never find out.

will girls even consider dating someone who is equal in height or just 2-3cm taller than them

Sometimes I just really feel so inferior when I'm with my boyfriend. He's extremely smart, witty and sociable. These are among many other traits he have, which is why I've been attracted to him in the first place. However, I'm just an average student, with very average grades and struggling through much of my Uni life. I don't have much friends either. Sometimes I just find it so difficult to confide in him regarding my studies and troubles faced in school. Because he just can't seem to understand what's troubling me, everything just seemed so easy to him. I often feel worse after confiding in him, he shrugs it off so easily, making me feel as if 'it's so simple, why can't you do it? Why are you even troubled by it?' I just feel like we can never communicate on the same level. It's like hurt adding onto my hurt.
Anyone out there feels like this too?? Be it your friends or boyfriend/ girlfriend making you feel this way. Please let me know I'm not alone.

Met up with some long lost friends today and we were talking about each other's dating statuses. When I told them I was attached, they asked to see my bf's picture. I scrolled through all our photos only to realise that I could not find a photo that I felt that I could show to my friends even though there were a lot of photos of my bf. For almost all the photos, I would treat it as it was an "unglam" moment of his that he didn't look very good in the picture. But after a while of scrolling through, I realised that I found his looks to be not very presentable to my family and friends, in a sense that I felt ashamed to tell people that he is my bf even though there is nothing wrong with the way he looks. We have been together for about six months, is this weird?

I am a pretty shy guy (quiet in groups but can be pretty chatty within a small group of close friend).  I sense that a outgoing girl might be interested in me but I am not too sure how and when is the right time to ask her for a date. I am the type of guy who do not know what to say/do in awkward moment and she knows it and has told me that I am too honest. 

When would be a right time to ask her out? Should I be completely comfortable with her first or some awkwardness is fine? It has been months since she first indicated interests (she is quite aggressive at first – at least to me…like openly flirtly with me when with other friends) but I was too shy to do anything and it made me sort of scare of her. But until recently she approach me more like a normal friend and encouraging me to hang out more and that makes me more comfortable with her and we talk more. From time to time, she would still say stuff like I should go to her place more often to hang out which makes me think that she is still somewhat interested in me. 

Another thing I am afraid of is her group of outgoing friend. I cannot click with them because I always feel intimidated around them and I am afraid they will say bad stuff about me. I don’t think they hate me tho. Maybe they will say I don’t suit her? Is it just my insecurities?

I am evergreen so there is no time that seems like the right time to ask for a date. What are your opinions girls and guys??

Really appreciate it.

I have a significant other, but I'm concerned that he's afraid to fail. Everything he does, he takes the easy way out. He's not willing to think outside the box, try new things. He is caring, but to the point that its convenient for him. He thinks about me often, but is never concerned if I could be tired, frustrated or would need help. 

In short, I feel like I'm dating a child, not an SO. You can't teach people these things easily, and I'm starting to lose hope. My family is complicated, with one parent carrying all the burden, and I don't want the same thing to happen to me. 

How can I think about starting a family or going through hardship if he might just give up or run away? Is it time to end this relationship?
-
 
I'm a year 2 student and I have a crush on this pretty, evergreen  freshie. I am hesitant about asking her out because she is very pretty, and looks like the type that will have many guys chasing her. Sigh... I am confused. She is so pretty and has a cute face and personality but how come still evergreen?! I am worried because from past experience, evergreen girls are very easy to "scare away" and I don't want to look like a creep or a weirdo.

Once, there's supposedly this chiobu from my school who always comments a lot on nuswhispers but somehow I cant find her name in the school register.. and worse still, I got so many mutual friends with her yet none of them met her in real life! Scary right! 

To all the gullible guys out there, don't see chiobu on fb then just add. You'll never know who you're actually befriending with.

I've been noticing this senpai of mine and have seen how much he changed since his JC days till now. 
To this senpai, Y: 
You used to carry this 24/7 smile on your face, and your smile just have this miraculous effect on those around you. However, recently when I saw you again in school on various occasions, you don't seem like yourself anymore; there is just this tinge of coldness and sadness coming from you. 
I just want you to know, whatever that is bothering you will soon pass, please smile more because I miss your smile.

Your Kohai since 2011.

To the OP of 

Yeah I get that feel too. Happens a lot with institution allocated groupings (e.g. class, OG, CCA batch), because the people aren't necessarily going to get along amazingly together, so they usually break up into smaller cliques that may or may not have inter-clique interaction.

My secondary school CCA batchmates have always been "close" but not all of us really "click" together. Being one of those typical quiet kids, I wasn't very close with them. Even now, 7 years later, the core few will go out for meals, but when I or any of the fringe ones come along, our topics of interest diverge so much that it's just awkward and conversation gets mundane and stilted. It's painful all around.

So, as much as people may say that one's happiness shouldn't be dictated by the presence of other people etc etc, I know that subtle disappointment when you find out that you just don't mean that much to the rest. Another example would be Whatsapp group chat birthday greetings, the difference between that for a core person to a fringe person is obvious.

((Before all the "SO SHALLOW" comments start coming in, I make no excuse other than the fact that humans are undoubtedly social creatures. We seek (crave?) attention. It is unrealistic to expect everyone to survive on zero support.))

However, I have found friends who can really be counted as friends, and they can be counted on one hand. They are those I can trust and rely on. Anyway, to cut the long story short, we were the quiet few who found our voices with each other when no one else would bother to listen. #poetic

As a group gets larger, there's definitely going to be inner and outer circles. Getting in is really hard and tiring, especially if you are an introvert. I suggest finding people you don't have to act with. I know it takes a long period of trial and error, but keep at it okay :) Meanwhile, it would be good to develop your own interests and work on becoming "ambivert." All the best!

///

tl;dr: It happens. Find people on your wavelength, and have fun on the long road.

Right before entering university I went through a bad breakup.  At that point of time my esteem took a big hit and I isolated myself and did not join any orientation camps. My ex, on the other hand, has joined many camps and ccas. I thought once university starts I would be able to make more friends and have a more meaningful time in university. But one year later I still find myself having no friends and I am doing badly in my studies. Even though I tried to approach people during lectures and tutorials, I still have no friends. Most people already have their own cliques. Even up until now I can't help but to feel angry that life was kinder to him despite all the horrible things he has done to me (and to others). Most of his facebook photos shows he seems to be having the time of his life in university whereas I'm feeling extremely lonely and depressed. The loneliness and dissatisfaction with myself is killing me..

Is it true that guys with girlfriends still check out other women? And it's not supposed to be much of a big deal?

A guy told me he liked me many months back but we didn't get together for various reasons. Soon after, we lost contact as he unfriended me on social media. Fast forward some months, he initiated the conversation and wanted to chase me again. I didn't want to commit as he had just broken up with someone else. Yet, after I convinced myself that the relationship will turn out ok, he told me that he was facing some family problems and didn't want to be with me for fear of hurting me and having an additional burden in his life. We have since stopped talking. But sometimes when I see things on his social media (he didn't unfriend me this time round), I long to comfort him when he's down or congratulate him for the things he did. Should I try to message him again? 
-
 
The only thing that stops me from moving on is how I can't figure out why we stopped talking. 

(sometimes, I miss you too. But I won't waste feelings on someone who can't appreciate it.)

My bf is my direct junior whom I got to know through CCA and we've been together for quite sometime. Sometimes I just feel like he's using me right from the start. He had requested for all my textbooks, notes and reports. Of course I would have given them to him, but it's just the way he demands for and take them with no thank you, no nothing. Can't help but make me feel that he's gotten together with me for a purpose. Overtime, I also realised he tend to get close to people (I wouldn't call them friends) with academic benefits. It scares me sometimes.

I always tell people I'm just a student. However, in reality, whilst concurrently juggling my studies, I actually have a 6-digit portfolio of assets and I'm working on my start-up as well. Truth to be told, I am very selective with my acquaintances, even more so for my future partners. To others, I am just a regular student, probably from a rich family, running in the same rat race. To a select few, less than a handful, I am this financial whiz kid who has been financially independent since 2011, who is probably on the road to be a self-made millionaire by 30. Sometimes I hate my selectiveness as it leaves me lonely at night. I do enjoy the solidarity sometimes as it does allow me to focus on the tasks at hand but sometimes I just want to hug/be hugged to sleep. I am not haughty, I just want to build real relationships and not have people popping in and out of my life in revolving door fashion. Recently I met this girl who sports just about all the characteristics that I look for - spontaneous, mature, intelligent. I shit-test girls (guys too) a lot. Only a handful actually make it through. I don't know why but I lost all sense of discipline that day. I put her through a different set of criteria and I put her down too much. I think I've lost her for good. Sometimes I really hate myself. C, I wish we had another chance.

I have to admit this is a fairly disgusting confession. I once dreamt of a friend of mine in a particular science society (let's call him VH) who was teasing me and asking me if he could crash my place. I said yes and VH came over to RH for a night. Of course, as such stories go, I ended up blowing VH and watching his orgasmic reactions. Being a fairly naughty guy, he didn't tell me he was climaxing. He did, shot his load of jizz into my mouth, and then I swallowed it all. i reciprocated too, but by clit-licking instead. I had to pubish him by giving him a peace of my mind on his face.

Of course, it was all a dream.

I'm an evergreen. I'm not pretty nor slim hence my rs don't work out or should i say i still choose, having standards which i don't  succumb to. I believe that feel is important, age and height as well. The longest crush i had so far was 7 yrs. I thought i won't fall in love again till P came by last September.
I met P online and we started talking casually. He is a businessman and has to fly around alot. We chatted for about 1 month, on and off, and stopped till he came back again in December. 
Things got closer in December when we skyped, talked about the future and our lives. I liked him for being romantic, that he didn't mind my looks, that he tries to make me comfortable and confident with myself. 
Fast forward to 2 months later, he disappeared. He probably left cos he is not interested in me anymore. Then again 2 months later, he came back and we chatted a bit. Then he disappeared again and last month, he came back and we chatted yet again.
I want him in my life yet I'm tired of all these. I'm foolish and gullible for trusting him still. But i still hope someday we will end up together.

"If you're a "nice guy" to a girl up till until you realise she doesn't want to date you, then go about telling everyone about how she is a bitch that friend zoned you and how no girls date nice guys, like no dude, girls do date nice guys. You just aren't a nice guy. You're a passive aggressive male with internalised misogyny and a serious victim complex"

This is a legit question please do not roast me. I think I am falling in love with a slightly plump girl (she’s pretty cute). I have been stalking her old photos and she seemed really cute and hot back then. I am afraid I am liking her for what she could have been and not what she is right now. Another factor is that I feel that she likes me too so that somehow makes me attracted to her? I am pretty shy and she would say that I am cute every now and then.  I would never want to hurt her and I feel pretty shy around her (normally not as much for other girls). Maybe her hinting me that she is interested makes me want to reciprocate? I really don’t know. Am I just in a confused state? I feel really happy when I have a great time with her but incredibly sad if I cannot connect with her during some occasions. She’s pretty sensitive and observant which I like.

But Shes also making me experience a lot of mood swings.Help plz

I don't know if you'll read this, but you used to read nusconfessions so maybe this will reach you.

How are you doing? I've seen you around; you seem happy. It's been over 7 months since we broke up. I still do think of you, I still do miss you. I hope you really are happy. Maybe sometime down the road we could meet and catch up. 

Until then, I wish you all the best, with my whole heart. You are an amazing person, and never forget that. I'm sorry I couldn't be the one for you, even after all that we've been through together.  I pray you'll find someone that will treat you right, better than I ever did or ever could. You deserve it :') 

Au Revoir

I agree with . Im a guy and in the army many of the guys try to spread this form of reasoning, that once you fuck the girl she would be yours forever. As such many guys out of the army would be looking for a girl to make theirs, as two years in a full guy environment would make them desperate. For release? I really hope all virgins think twice before doing the deed. Sex a beautiful thing. Dont let the wrong guy sully the experience.

To be very honest, when I was a freshman last year I participated in 3 orientation camps with the primary aim of looking for a girlfriend. (Not too sure if I am the only one ) I took all the SP games very seriously, hoping to break my evergreen spell. I have confessed to some of my crush but sadly nothing works out. Now in my senior year, the new semester has started and I am still again evergreen. I am starting to feel I am very likely to be evergreen when I graduate. I am too sure if I am going into depression as my self-esteem is affected, I start to become very withdrawn and will inflict self-injury sometimes. And needless I can't stay focus on my study.  I really wish NUS can have a module called relationship head start program and hope there will counseling service for evergreen 'relationship' problem like me. I am in dire need of that.

I met my boyfriend 2 months after graduation. This March i found out that he is married with an autistic kid and currently living apart from his wife. He claimed that they got married because of shotgun incident. I also found out that he actually also lied about his real name, age, and dating history. He had his way of explaining and i decided to give it a chance to stay with him until he finalises his divorce, which is supposed to happen next June. I love him very much and felt that we have good chemistry together but sometimes i cant help to think that i am just lying to myself. We have sex regularly and he wanta me to abort the child if i get pregnant. pregnant with his child and he wants me to abort the baby which i am deeply hurt. if what he told me about his marriage is true, how can he allow stranger from one night stand to keep her baby while forcing me to abort ours? Is this guy still worth staying for?what should i do as i do love him very much and want to give it a try?
-
 
Sometimes I'm very envious of other slim girls who don't need to do much to stay slim. Even though I eat lesser and healthier than most of my friends while working out more, I'm still not as slim as them. Coupled with the fact that I'm really short too... These remain as my greatest insecurities and contribute greatly to my low self esteem which sometimes get me really depressed. I guess I'm just not the "skinny" type and it's taking me a hard time to come to terms with ): 
-
 
How do you reject a guy and stay friends with him, when he has a crush on you? It has happen to me a few times, and my reaction has always been to avoid them completely and never speak to them again. I feel that them confessing just ruins our friendship.  But me behaving and thinking this way, makes me seem immature and stuck up.I'm sure there is a better way of handling such situations...? But I only do this, cause I'm putting myself in their shoes. If I told my crush that I like him, and if he would rather remain friends with me, I would still feel there's hope. So if I were to remain friends with him, would he still feel there's hope too? How do I handle the situation better, when I learn that someone likes me, without leading them on?

Hope to get some advice on multiracial relationships! I have been dating this malay guy for abt 3 months now. It started off on a wrong start as he was too touchy. But once we started talking and hanging out more, I got to better understand him. Recently, I even went for lunch with his family. But, my friends seem to be objecting my relationship with him due to his actions from the start. This leaves me to be in a very confused state. I know he didn't meant to be so touchy at the start but I think because of that my friends thinks I should cut it off with him. Anyone in a rs with someone from another race willing to advice me? Should I continue to get to know him better or cut it off because of my friends? 
P.s my friends have not met him before but seeing their reaction now I don't know if I should let them meet. I'm happy being with him.

Do you consider texting someone (who is attached) daily cheating? Because we currently have long conversations daily and even frequent meet-ups. But i have never flirted with him; although he sometimes says some weird things that make me uncomfortable(but then i could be thinking too much). Even though i didn't flirt with him, recently when I heard one of my female friends complaining about how her bf keeps texting another girl(not me), i feel immediately ashamed for even talking to him for so long and frequently. Should i cut off contact? Sigh
-
 
Dear OP , I have a somewhat similar situation as you, except that in mine, my friend and I were both attached (to other people). I thought this meant that things were obviously platonic between us, since we both already had someone else. But it became the case where he also made certain inappropriate comments that made me feel uncomfortable and wary. I tried to convince myself that he was just being overly-friendly, until I heard stories of how he also behaves similarly with other girls (who are attached as well). I stopped being friends with him entirely. Thankfully though, because I soon realised how much of a judgmental asshole he was. Save yourself the trouble of being caught in an awkward (and unnecessary) situation. 
-
 
To all the people asking for advice about liking or even loving someone who is attached:

Run far, far, far away; please do not be the third party. It is better for yourself and the couple as well. My ex had this "good friend" whom I was really really really uncomfortable with, but he continued talking to her (A LOT). In the end, he broke up with me in the most insincere way ever (not even a phone call) and got together with his "good friend". 

You might think that there's nothing wrong with talking to your attached friend whom you have feelings because it's "just friends", but sooner or later, something will happen. 

It's been two years but there are still days when I can't get over it, get over the betrayal (I'm way over him). 

And in case you are wondering, they broke up. It won't last because it might be because he's just looking for someone else and you are "always there".

Hey not everyone has the time to participate in activities. Some people have to make ends meet and to make sure that their study loan can be repaid. Please understand that I really do want to participate. It is hard to explain this to my friends/acquaintance when such difficulties are considered as private. Not everyone has the freedom to roam around campus, to volunteer, to participate in outside activities and to socialize with friends. While I do have close friends, I have a pretty much dead social media account. Recently, social media is the platform for others to gauge how interesting you are. I can't help but to feel left out ...

I have an amazing boyfriend. Sweet and loving. In our 2-3 years of relationship, he has not forced me to have sex. My bf respects me and believes that I should keep my virginity for him till we are officially married. However, we have lots of heavy petting. Those sessions usually last around an hour each time. If we were slightly busier with our schedules, the sessions can be as short as 5mins.  While I am thankful for his understanding for not forcing me into sex, but at the same time, I know that petting is unhealthy, especially when we do it almost every night. 

Very stressed over this issue.

I've been having serious struggles to fall asleep lately. I will take hours trying to drift into sleep and nonetheless, I'll tuck in at 11PM every night in the hopes of getting a good nights sleep - which of course disappoints me every time. 

The thing is, as I close my eyes and try my best to fall asleep at night, my mind seems to wake up even more. All sorts of thoughts hunt me as my mind gets clearer and clearer - my mind will wonder n think whether slicing the wrist will actly make everything better as some claims to be so. And it frustrates me. It's become so tiring to lie in my bed and it's starting to make me feel so sick and tired of going to bed at night. I think I can say that im afraid of going to sleep. 

Well, eventually I will fall asleep, from the frustration and exhaustion that knocks me out at 6am in the morning. Unfortunately, even this 'hard-earned' sleep wont last long, and ill wake back up at around 8-9am no matter how tired i am. And the day will go by, without a nap as i fear taking a nap would disrupt my sleep at night. I will walk through the day with lingering tiredness, just like a prisoner slowed down by a chain and metal ball shackled to his ankle. 

This has been going on for more than a week now and nothing seems to work. I dont know if the lack of sleep is causing it but I've been having issues with remembering things. For instance, I cant seem to recall the names of my friends i met a day ago, and the things i intended to do the day after. 

I dont know. I just wanna get some help. Feeling helpless about this is not helping me in any way too.

School has not been treating me well. Feeling really overwhelmed with work and damn now I doubt myself if I can even survive till graduation. Worse still, someone who used to be my friend is now giving me a hard time. He just kept making fun of me and saying things that I am going to do badly as expected. I'm really tired being treated like this. I hate going to school because of this. It might seems funny as people take it as a joke but it's not anymore alright. School is hard enough and I have people putting me down and telling me I'm going to fail. I really don't know what to do. I wish I could just hide somewhere. I cried so many times and I don't know what to do. I don't really want to talk to people I know because others know me as someone who is always the happy go lucky person and who is always full of smiles. I feel tired having to live on this kind of expectation. 

Now I no longer stay in school so much because of this. I spent most of my time at home feeling worthless. I feel tired all the time and usually I'll sleep it off. I'm starting to think that maybe he's right. Maybe I am that bad and I am not meant to do this. I feel like giving up on everything.

I've known this guy for 2 years and as I got to know him I realized he's an amazing person. When this new semester began I felt he became nicer, more affectionate and more caring towards me, which got me pretty delighted... Until he used "man" and "bro" to address me #friendzoned
What to do? ):

The weird feeling when your longtime crush likes your photos with your girlfriend on social media...

I found out recently that you are attached. Then what the hell were you trying to do when you kept initiating conversations with me, even resorting to Twitter message since you conveniently 'forgot' my number, asking me if I have applied to uni. Great, now I am in the same school as you again. I know we used to talk, but last I checked, you were attached all the times you attempted conversations with me. I pity your girlfriends. Stop all your nonsense and scram. Thanks.

A question to ponder: I wonder if a girl who has a one-sided love for her male friend should take a step back (hides her feelings and acts normally when he is around) as she is too timid to show her keen interest in him for god knows what the reasons are.. People may suggest confessing/hinting him to avoid any possible regrets for life or something. However, she just doesn't have the guts to do and have issues with expressing her affection someone. No doubt from now on, she'll wait or all talk no action while any possible chances with her future love interests slip by since she lacks the courage..

The ultimate solution to get over someone you cannot have.

There is no such thing as "soul mate". There are more than 5 million people in Singapore. Do you really think you will only be attracted to only one person in your lifetime?

If for some reason you cannot be with someone you like, just find someone else. There are many people out there who can potentially be your "soul mate".

In case you are wondering if there is no such thing as soul mate, Why do people choose only one mate in their life?

The answer is intimacy and commitment.

Why do people cheat on their partners? 

My friend got cheated, but she chose to stay. Nothing I said helped. I know I am in no position to say this, but I wish she would just open her eyes. Look at the world out there. There are many other guys who would love you genuinely, who would not put their own sexual pleasures before the basic rule of any relationship. Girl you are worth so much more. I can never understand why she would accept these nonsense. That's why they say, love is blind. It is saddening. I can only await the day she finally wakes up, and hopefully a true good man can save her from this. She deserves to be happy. 

And to the cheater(and any cheaters out there): You choose to satisfy your own pleasures than to stay faithful to your partner. If so, doesn't it mean that you do not respect and love your partner enough? You want to seek sexual pleasures, but you are still with him/her because you want to feel the genuine love from him/her. It is selfish to the core. Karma will come.

I am a year 4 male, evergreen student and since year 1 I have been liking this female friend of mine in my clique. I would say the bonds of our clique are strong, as we would always meet up for lunches in school, and outings after school. In year 2, I asked her out secretly on a date and I screwed up pretty badly; my subsequent advances were all rejected with excuses. I stopped my advances for I did not want to disrupt the the chemistry of my clique, and second, she means a lot to me as a friend - I do not even want to strain our friendship in the slightest bit. To me, the character traits that she embodies were all ideal - she's pretty, smart, kind and caring. In my heart, she is my ideal partner, the goddess and the star that I could never reach. Sadly, I wasn't her star. Sometime last year, I heard of news from my friends that a guy is trying to pursue her and fast forward till now, they have went on quite a few dates but they are not really official yet. Since hearing the news, I tried again to pursue her, yet at the same time the back of my head constantly reminded me that she isn't interested and I should probably move on. It was only until few months back had I decided to give up on her fully - my feelings for her were back to the platonic friendship level but occasionally my heart would ache when I see tagged photos of her and the guy.

I would then like to ask the whisperers, does one spent a greater time in the 'rebounding' period when the love for a person get longer? 

The reason for all this is because, I find myself getting drawn to a girl M, who is few years younger, in one of my volunteering session. I don't have that fuzzy, lovey feeling for M but i'm just drawn to her. I am not sure if I am still in the 'rebound' phase and I definitely do not want to hurt M in any other way; should i decide to pursue her.

Thank you for reading up till here and I am sorry for the long post. I can't really make a tl;dr portion as it might change the context.

I'm a Chinese guy who has always had a weak spot for Malay girls when it comes to relationships. I think that partly has to do with the fact that I went to a neighbourhood secondary school, where there were more Malays than Chinese and Indians. I've went on dates (if you can call it) with girls (Malays and Chinese) as far back in secondary school, but nothing serious ever developed.

Then in JC, I had a classmate who was a Malay girl. The first time I saw her, I thought, "Wah, damn hot. Cannot take it." And she really was. I got to know her as a friend and developed feelings for her from there, but never told her about it until much later. I didn't tell because I was afraid that she wouldn't want to date a Chinese guy. We were walking to the bus interchange when she confessed her feelings for me. I thought she was joking and I asked if she was for real, lol. In my heart, I was jumping for joy. I told her then that I've had feelings for her awhile too So we got into a relationship, but kept it secret from our classmates...

We've been together for four years... It would have been five, but I made a mistake somewhere along the way and we broke up for awhile. She's met my parents who are okay with me dating someone outside of my race. So no problems there... After all, my parents have known of my dating history with Malay girls for a long, long time now so there's precedence. Her parents seem to like me as well, but I'm not v sure... Some days, it feels like they disapprove of our relationship.

The problem here isn't the parents.. but... with me. She comes from a religious family and she is as well. Her religion is something important in her life, but despite of it, she still holds liberal ideas in the sense that she's for equal rights - specifically concerning LGBTs, and I love her for it. I can't imagine raising kids with someone who's anti-LGBT. Now I believe that when you marry someone, you also marry into their family and in some cases, their religion. 

At some point, if I marry her, I know that I'll have to convert to Islam. I don't mind giving up pork or alcohol and I'm already circumcised (sorry if TMI) but the thing is, I can't see myself as a convert. I'm an atheist, always have been. I've read about Islam, I know just enough, but it still doesn't speak to me. Sometimes, I think I've wasted her time. Maybe it would have been easier had I dated a Chinese girl, but I can't help whom my heart chooses to love... I love her, but I feel the issue of religion is beginning to affect me and my relationship with her. I've not told her about this, but I sense she knows. 

I've spoken on this issue to a friend of mine - a Chinese girl - who dated a Malay guy for six years. She married him, converted to Islam and embraced the religion willingly. Talking to her gives me comfort. She understands where I come from, but tells me that this is a decision only I can make. That it would be unfair to both of us if I drag on too long on this issue. :( Haiz... Very stress just thinking about this...

why is it so difficult to find someone who stays loyal and faithful to their partner. why do people give in so easily to temptations and love another while in a relationship? why do people cheat on their partners?

ive been broken far too many times..i dont know how im ever going to trust people again..but yet, i cant stand the silence in my life. the void she left behind in my heart is far too large to be filled no matter what i do to distract myself. Why does the world have to be such a brutal place.

To the girls out there who are feeling pressured to satisfy your 'boyfriend' demands, just end off the relationship by stopping all contacts. Better to remain a virgin than to give in to someone who does not even respect your decision. Once you lose your virginity to the wrong person there is no turning back but if you lose your 'boyfriend', you can still find someone better. If I am the girl faced in this situation, I will have end off the relationship without hesitation and move on with life. Hopefully this can be helpful for those in this situation. (From the opinion of a guy)

I've always pride myself in being a virgin. Also i've never been in a relationship before. However, earlier this year I've gotten really close to this guy and he invited me over to his house for dinner and to study which i gladly obliged. Well, one thing lead to another and we had sex. I felt so ashamed of myself afterwards. And what's worse, he slowly began to take a long time to reply my texts and slowly began to ignore me. He eventually blocked me from all his social media and whatsapp. I was crushed. I guess it was my fault as well and i don't blame it on him. All my friends still believes that i am a virgin and it just pricks my guilty conscience. I am just really conflicted with myself and the worse thing is i have no idea who i can relay this to.

The pain is killing me. I just found out that my bf has been actively looking for sexual partners. I am not sure if he has already done it with them. I have not confronted him. I am at a complete loss. I feel like I am going insane. Maybe he only loves me but is simply seeking for temporary external physical pleasure without emotions. But I have given him that as well, am I not enough??? Am I lying to myself?? Is it because he doesn't love me anymore?? Then why couldn't he just break up??? Does he still genuinely love me?? I really am going crazy. I cannot control these freaking tears even as I type this. I hate myself. Someone please save me.

My boyfriend keeps pressurizing me to meet his parents. I do not feel ready for it and feel very unhappy his parents are judging me through their comments. We are not even anywhere near the stage of thinking long-term and marriage. What to do in such a situation?
-
 
To begin with, I'm an evergreen guy but not gonna complain about how I can't find a girlfriend etc. I actually find it a lot easier to click with girls than other guys. There are some stuff which girls would listen to better and i find girls generally appreciate htht-moments more. These are also purely platonic, good friendships or bro-ships which I really treasure, without the complications of r/s.

What's the real downer though is when people constantly think you're "hunting" or "casting your net" :/. I get that it's natural to judge, but it doesn't help when people start spreading rumours without even getting to know me first. Needless to say, I don't have the best of reputations.

Perhaps I'm just finding an avenue to rant about how superficial I see society as: Exercising our judgment as we see fit without really affirming anything beforehand, since it doesn't affect the "judge". Thanks for reading this though if you did.

Ps: To evergreen posters who were complaining and making it sound bad about being single, maybe just know there's an opposite end of the evergreen spectrum too. Chill guys, we're barely at quarter life crisis. We'll find somebody eventually.

My friends and I were talking about female anatomy and how I didn't the names of the various parts down there. And then somewhere further down the conversation it was about threesomes. I had just one threesome in my whole life and I was not very proud of it, because the level of excitement and anticipation was so high, I did not last very long.

However, that wasn't even the butt of jokes. Friends proceeded to roast me by suggesting that it was not a threesome at all because I had no idea where the clit was! I tried to defend myself by saying that I was more of a hands-on learner and I wasn't very good with names but it was futile. They continued roasting me by suggesting that it was more like a threesome where I watched the girl + another girl/guy.

It hurt me a lot but I did not want to show my hurt side to my friends so I decided to rant here instead :( I wish they joked about me lasting not more than 10 minutes instead.

Me and my friend (we are both single) recently met a nice and cheerful girl while we are taking bus. We have a nice talk along the journey and we have both gotten her number. To me, outlook wise, she is pretty and her attitude is really good that I think I like her. 
Day after that, I try to control myself not to message her too fast as I worried I might scare her away. I try to suppress my feeling and slowly planning my way towards her. To my very suprise, after days when I meet back my friend, he told me that he has taken his step and start approaching her, and she responded very well with him. I feel sad, but aside from that I am also feeling very worried. He is a playboy and I am worried that he might not be serious with her. 
I am confused what should I do. He is my friend since primary school and I really don't feel like going after the same girl as my friend. But on the other hand, I feel guilty for not saving her from my friend. Please advise me.

Last christmas, i gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away~

The girl I love got a boyfriend last christmas. I have mentally prepared myself for that day during the many years I had a crush on her but I just can't accept it. 

After the past few months, I thought I am so over her and I had enough. But nope, it's not over. 

Now my chouchou is too wet for me to sleep because I just cried buckets. How unmanly of me. :( This must be why she "only accept the love she deserve". Stupid overrated quote.

I have 2 friends whose bfs have cheated on them and are still together till this day.

1. Me and a friend was waiting for the train on KR station, to see a familiar guy touching the head in an affectionate manner and holding hands with an unknown girl. Thing is this guy was featured on an instagram post of our common friend as the new caring bf during her birthday celebration. Definitely not an issue of mistaking people for someone else unless its twins though I actually checked. This happened like 8 months ago. Oh we took a picture of this pair.

My female friend and this guy are still happily together today, with lots of instagram posts affirming that he's the one, that he's marriage material.

2. My friend was very sad about her bf cheating on her. The catch is I think she wasn't sure herself and the funny thing is as a guy i'm surer of it than her when she relayed the story to me. though i'm not sure if she's not sure. In the end I think she forgave him, which I think was for the better since their relationship appeared to be still strong today.

Now in the case of (1), I have long been living with the guilt with not breaking the news to the female friend at the start. But at the same time they appeared so happy throughout, I would really feel like some troublemaker ruining the illusions of others if I were to tell the truth. I'm not sure what to feel for (2). At the start I didn't push the truth into my friend because I thought 1. all info was filtered through her 2. guy was young and (maybe) inexperienced so I gave him benefit of doubt. though on hindsight it was actually silly to give this benefit of doubt because everything that transpired was obvious that the guy was cheating. 3. it felt wrong to act on my personal vested interests.

People happy can le right? :/

Hi guys, I'm here for some advice... Hope you guys will help out... I'm a girl and I've been in a relationship for a year. I am a very conservative girl who is actually against pre-marital sex. I am also uncomfortable if my bf gets too touchy (under what I wear and stuff). But unfortunately, my bf is a rather touchy guy and we have tried to talk about this before. He's a guy rather open about intimacy and sex and has done it with his ex before. Things are fine now but he has frankly told me that as time passes, he'll expect more intimacy and I find this hard to cope with. I'm not sure if we were to really stay till the end, can I cope with such a lifestyle? Unfortunately this is an issue bothering me for quite a long period of time. I understand that he's a guy and he has his needs, but perhaps we are kinda on two different sides of the spectrum. While I really think we are compatible in terms of our attitudes towards life and we have endless topics, I don't know if I should end things now to prevent myself from falling deeper or just deal with what's going to come. It's not that I don't want to satisfy him, it's just his appetite might be too much for me to handle. It's not his fault I know. Sometimes I do wish I'm not as conservative as I am.

I fell in love with a guy who has a girlfriend. please tell me what I should do.

Should I stop all these nonsense? I know it's impossible between us. But I can't control myself. It has been such a long time already... Maybe I shouldn't have fallen in love with an attached person...

I had a bad group dinner today and I am feeling terrible today. I hate group dinner but I had to go every once in a while. I just cannot function in big group. So many conversations going on and so much noise. Its too overwhelming for me. I can't wait to leave the house and for the dinner to end. I feel so f*-ing wrecked inside. The feeling of walking around trying to enter a conversation, feeling awkward at every single spot and feeling people are looking at me just makes me so so so so so sad. 

I hid in the toilet many times through the night where I felt safe and every minute felt like hours to me. I wish I had a invisible cloak which I could don on and just disappear. I feel so drained now. Why can't I just be normal? Anything more than 3-4 not-so-close friends I would just clam up. I wish I could tell other people I am like a catalyst. I function at a very specific condition and environment. Right now as I am typing this, my friends are laughing and joking outside in the room right now. I feel so trapped. I want to breathe. 

I want to be alone please. Just 1-2 friends will do. I wanted to socialise but it is so f*-ing painful for me. It feels as if I am having a anxiety attack in the toilet. Sorry for the rant, just wanna pen down my feelings. I feel a little better now.

And to my friends who think I am anti-social and not trying hard enough, f*** all of you because you know what? You are not me. You don't know the pain I am going through. I am so sorry you guys have to read through all this negativity. I just feel that no one understand me. 

TLDR: Feel terrible in a group dinner.
-
 
Why can't you leave me alone. Not everyone wants to have companies and friends you know? I got 7 modules every semester. Practically I have no time for any other social matters. That's what happen to mature people. Their upper head had outgrown their lower head. They know what they are doing and I can assure you their priority is not banging your brain out all night. Go and look for a boy he will do just that to you. #%^?+#€%?^£%*#%£?£#^%€?£#£%^^

Since I started school in NUS, my other friends who are currently in poly and ITE seem to be less friendly to me. I don't get it. I know that my intelligence is superior to theirs and I am always helpful to them by pointing out their mistakes and giving them advice so that they can improve and become like me. 

Yesterday I went out with them for supper and I noticed that they kept rolling their eyes at each other when I was explaining to them some new things I learnt in lectures. 

What did I do wrong? Should I dump my group of friends because they are jealous of my intelligence? 
-
 
I am quite shy. I think I am falling for a guy in my chem class. He usually sits with a tall guy who my clique says cannot be found on facebook and a slightly shorter guy who I was told to be humble yet out-of-the-world smart.

But I dare not approach him... idk. I heard he is quite a player from my own clique, so I am not sure if I'd be noticed. But... I still think I like him. Hope to muster my courage to talk to him.

Hello does anyone have any tips on how to deal w needy boyfriends? My boyfriend is superrr needy while I on the other hand is more independent lone wolf style. Like he plans his timetable in a way such that he can go for all his lectures w his friends and have lunch with them while I just choose the mods I want and if coincidentally my friends are taking that module then I'd go with them. Also we both stay on campus but in different halls but he wants me to go over and accompany him every night to sleep or study or have supper together if I have no activities ongoing or when I'm done with my activities. He also constantly want to have lunch together in school even though our faculties are not exactly very near each other. I see him nearly every single day, like 6 days a week and even on weekends too when we go back home, and as we both live in the north, he'd request to wait for each other to travel back home together.

I talked to him several times about this issue, about how I need my space and alone time but all he does is get upset and it ends up in a fight. I'm really at my wits end and it has only been 4 months into our relationship but I feel so smothered and confined. Any help would be appreciated and thanks for reading.

On the surface, I seem like an outgoing girl with lots of friends and I guess I'm considered high profile. But the truth is, most of my peers are 'hi-bye' friends. Most of the time I feel really lonely. It sucks to be in a room full of people, yet feeling lonely.  I do have friends, but those I considered close are few and they can't be with me all the time right. I also stay in hall but I think hall makes me feel even lonelier...

Just want to let this out. 
-
 
People see me as a strong independent girl who can take any shit thrown to her. I take up many leadership roles and I am in various CCAs. Fact is, I cry every time I am at home. I am grieving over death of someone I am close to. It's so hard to contain the guilt and I feel like I am going through depression. Yet I can't find anyone to talk to because I don't want to destroy the image that people have of me. 
-
 
I am attracted to him and to me (at least) he seem as though he's self-sufficient, fit, involved. In other words, really up there. Is it weird to say that instead of making advances on him (which i did very subtlely attempted but had no real progression) i feel motivated by him to become a better person? Admitedly, i feel a little out of his league (though he claims to be evergreen) as i feel that i am an.average girl and to me (some of my friends would beg to differ) he is really up there. Some days when i see him around campus esp when i was caught off guard, i will feel so panicky and anxious (is the good kind of feeling though) that warm fuzzy feeling:) maybe one day when i become a better person, when i have better control of my life and if the feeling is mutual we can get to know each other more in depth :)

I'm currently on exchange and it has been only a few days and I've been approached by a korean girl whom has dropped several hints. I don't think she's looking for a serious relationship. I'm so afraid that I won't be able to hold the temptations and that I'll "sin" although I'm evergreen and always have been very principled. It has nothing to do with my religion but just the values that I personally hold. Crap..
-
 
Correct me if I'm wrong. When a guy says something insensitive to a girl, he's being a douche. But when a girl says something insensitive to a guy, the guy must be magnanimous and take it as a simple joke?
-
 
 I think it is worse for me. Recently almost every time I am about to sleep, I always fantasize making out with my closest female friend (evergreen but having both gf and wife material). I fear that my lust and impure thoughts will ruin our friendship as she is quite conservative on sexual issues and so am I, actually.

you are not alone. all im really looking for in life is to have a stable and loyal partner. i may not be the best guy on earth, but i know i will love my partner with all my heart.
But it's really difficult to find someone who wishes to settle down as well, someone who is willing to tough things through, communicate with each other to work things out. both my last 2 ex left me for another guy. maybe i wasnt doing enough for them, maybe they didnt know how to appreciate what i was doing. i dont know. it still hurts to even think about it. but all i know is that i always stayed true to them and only aimed to give them my best. 
i guess you just havnt found the right guy yet who understands you, just like i havnt found the right girl too. 



everyone deserves a partner who listens attentively to problems, communicate with each other to work things out, and love each other unconditionally. ive been in that situation for quite a bit too, ive always given in to my ex gf, i did everything i could to keep her happy. at the end of the day, it still didnt work out after a couple of years. she still left, chasing after another guy. its really incredibly tough to leave a relationship. my ex just left me last week. im still feeling so much grief, agony, pain, anger. i cant concentrate in lessons, im becoming more introverted than i already was before. i still want to hold on to that relationship, but deep down, i know it wasnt going to work out. im still learning to let go. i hope ill be able to find someone compatible with me in the future, and i know u will too.

on to my own confession now.

this week, has just been total hell for me. i walked such a long journey with her. i dont even remember how i used to be like when i was alone. all my memories are just filled up with her, and all my thoughts for the future was a life with her. for so many years, ive always look forward so much to receiving msges from her daily (we lead quite different lives, we couldnt meet that often), and ive always looked forwards to spending time with her. every moment i had with her, i treasured it so dearly.
now that she's gone, my world just came crumbling down. ive been crying for 7 days straight now. all the msges i looked forward to is gone. my phone is just so silent now. all the times i spend with her and treasured is never going to happen again. 
since im very introverted, i dont dare to initiate conversations with people i do not know well. as a result, my social circle is so incredibly small, i can count the amount of people i talk to with my fingers. i think they are getting tired of me hounding them daily. this loneliness is really something ill never get used to. 
im sorry if my confession is so fragmented and doesnt link properly. its probably just reflecting my life and my thoughts now.

What does a boy think when asking me if I love him or my ex-bf more after refusing my love? We used to be best friends, and I found it hard to face him, so I just unfriended and blocked him (the common action I always do to walk out of somebody's life). Then he used another account to keep asking me to unblock him and add friend again. 

What should I do now?
-
 
Just momentarily, I try to blend myself in the crowd only to find myself later having to face reality. I'm different and will never fit in, not for me. I wonder if there's a place I truly belong, to escape solitude. And then, the cycle just repeats itself..

To all the lonely hearts out there on NUSWhispers: 

if you miss someone who does not miss you, or who is no good for you, or is unattainable, take all the love you once felt for them and spread it around other places. put your love in worthwhile people and things, turn the romance in to passions for hobbies or admiration for others- enrich your own life. focus on yourself and those who actively make you happy.
-
 

On your confession:
Don't dwell on it too much, don't pour your guts out on other friends too much, and most importantly, don't let it get to your studies. 

You know that it is a tad bit annoying to keep imposing on your friends, to let them listen to your anguish and rage, so you should take the actions to recover. If not, you will lose friends who cared, and you will jeopardise your future.

Your world came crumbling down, it's about time you built a new one from its ruins, not centered around others. Put on a false front if you have to, and fake it, til you make it. Grab your loneliness, use it as a stepping stone, and leave it behind.

Sorry if I sound crude, and sorry if I am not that experienced on the matter, though. My world also came crumbling down on me before, because of an extremely short-lived relationship. What happened next, I do not want to see it happening to others.

I realised a few of my ex-course mates have found their partners, and they look truly fortunate. I am genuinely happy for them, but if I'm honest, some part of me die a little along the way along the years I should be dead by now - single as ever.

I admit I'm not a handsome, not muscular, not rich or smart. I don't know how but I manage to find 2 fwb in my three years in NUS. RVR's toilets, my RVR room, our club room and the male toilet at MPSH are some of the places where we had fun. Having got together with my gf this summer, I hope that I can stop those fwb activities. Though deep down I don't want to disappoint my gf and I love her, I realized I don't have the same level of sex drive on my fwbs for my gf. Please advice me what to do. Do I dont love my gf as much as I think I do?
-
 
I have been lucky enough to fall in love once but unlucky enough for the girl friendzoned me before I can even confess. I am still in love with her, and it hurts so bad to see that she doesn't treat me in that way. I would just like to ask, how long will it take to get over her?

I am interested in a lady that I met and befriended in campus, recently. Not sure whether it is platonic or romantic at this point of time.

In my efforts, I encounter two stumbling blocks. Firstly, our conversations are episodic; they randomly occur and are mostly short-lived. I figure it might either be me being a noob in holding a conversation or her not being interested. Secondly, I'm going on SEP very soon.

Any advice？ Thanks for reading and have a great weekend ahead.

I am just a normal simple average girl. I have no lack of suitors and my studies are not that bad either. Whatever things that I do, I will put my bf interest first. I am willing to compromise anything. We are together for a short while yet I have went through with him most of the goods and the bads. After our honeymoon period was over, It came to my realisation that he could probably be making use of me.There was once he misunderstood me and asked me to leave if I want to and I was really devastasted and disappointed. To him, love is something he can give and take back easily. Of course there are times where he was sweet to me too.  I just couldn't bring myself to be harsh enough to walk out and break things up cleanly.

In response to the poster of , look.. here's the deal. No man is ever afraid of a woman who is well put together. I would suggest you put down cosmos and get down that high horse. Stop believing the "men are afraid of women" BS - yeah right. From what it sounds, you want a good, capable man. Well, the truth is ..no one owes you deep conversations, warm company and loving embrace. If you want it, put yourself out there. Beyond looks, what else do you offer? 99% of people fail at this stage. There are a handful (not a lot, sadly) of really great guys in NUS. Some of them run their own companies, some of them have made strides in getting that dream career started while others are very focused and accomplished. 

The problem is that girls (yes, girls) like yourself tend to overlook them and instead waste time on frivolous camps and pageants to look and act cool. Instead of talking to that airhead of a guy who has been clubbing nonstop and wasting his life, why not make an effort to sieve out the wheat from the chaff? Take the time. Pause. Listen carefully in class. Think. Pause. There are gems, really, its whether or not you can see/find them. Good luck, girl.

Do guys get scared off or feel inadequate in front of a girl who's put together, knows what she wants and likes to be independent? And on top of that, a pretty girl as well? I've always believed that it's not about finding two halves that fit but two wholes that can support each other and grow together. I like to have my own space and privacy but I think that sometimes come across as apathy and being antisocial. Somehow most of the guys I've interacted with seem pretty content with just going with the flow without putting much thought into life. In my opinion, most guys in university are still boys, not yet men. (Sorry Ah Boys to Men, NS doesn't really help guys gain that much more maturity and depth, but it does help them look better physically haha) I'm giving up hope finding someone who can appreciate and understand me. I guess I'd rather be a part of the growing trend of educated, career driven and accomplished single women rather than settling for a relationship just for the sake of achieving the end points of marriage and having kids. Anyone else share the same thoughts?

Please do not be fooled by OP of .

OP of  was not completely transparent with me about his text. I had no idea he was so close to this other girl until one day I wanted to borrow his phone to text one of his friend regarding something else and he didn’t allow me to take it. I started to sense something fishy. Was there something he was hiding? So later that same day, I demanded to read his texts. That’s how I came to know that he has been bitching about me and flirting with this other girl he claims he has no feelings for. He picked out the smallest things about me to complain to this other girl, making me seem like an ungrateful, unappreciative, demanding girlfriend, and he, the best boyfriend ever. He also confided in this girl that he does not think I am the right one for him. In contrast, he compliments the other girl that she is very nice and has a big heart. He showed her an overwhelming amount of concern for her, waited for her at bus stops, wishing her sweet dreams every night etc. Do you call this just friends? I felt so naïve, believing that he love me wholeheartedly while he goes around flirting and bitching about me to other girls. I am honestly not that mad with the girl because she did not seem to reciprocate as much. Instead, I am utterly upset and disappointed with OP  for his behaviour. He was the one enthusiastic one in the conversations and reading the texts made my heart sink. Since I came back from NOC, I thought that things were getting better and we are becoming a healthy and more mature couple. I also strived to become a better girlfriend after I came back because I wanted to show OP  that I appreciated what he has done. I thought we could get married one day. But little did I know that these things were happening behind my back. Can you imagine how shattered I was when I read those texts? To make it worse, as tears poured down my face, OP  kept dismissing my feelings about this issue and scolded me for being immature and said “its not like I cheated on you” as if it justified his behaviour. He also started to hurl vulgarities at me as I tried to walk away. He accused me of not prioritizing our relationship by not talking things out at that moment. But I felt too hurt to see or talk to him. I honestly love him but I don’t know whether I can trust him again. 

I’m trying to take time off to cool down and rethink our relationship. But till now, I doubt OP  has yet to realise that he has done anything wrong and have not apologise to me. Yet he expects me to go back to him just like that. After I read his confession post , I was slightly moved and decided to unblock him. But of all things he could have said, he has just gave me a deadline and pressurized me that he wants to talk this out before Sunday.

By the way, also about the going overseas matter, his friend shared with me an interesting experience of hers flying around the world as a SIA stewardess two weeks ago. I thought it sounded pretty fun and shared that idea with OP  to know what his opinion is about it. He expressed he wasn’t happy that I would be flying around a lot. It was just an idea, not anything serious. I was just sharing a conversation with a friend with him. But since he expressed such concerns, I have since dropped the idea of doing so already. And I have told him umpteen times that I do not want to embark on that route and anyway I think the job would be too tiring. But he seems to keep using this point to prove that I am a selfish girlfriend.

My head and heart is very confused now. I still feel for him and our close to 4 years relationship. Yet I feel so betrayed and am afraid things may recur.

Any advice?

Guys, remember that girl you'd put on a pedestal and practically worship? You'd do anything for her, anything to make her happy, her smile makes your day and you care for her unconditionally and tirelessly. Her being upset drives a stake through your heart. You respect her endlessly and even if she has a thousand flaws, you look past it all. Sure you want to get physical with her but that has very little to do with lust and everything to do with love. Reading this, you prolly got a smile on your face or maybe shed a few tears remembering her. She has such a hold over your emotions. You were/are crazy in love. 

Also, remember that girl...? The girl you'd do anything to have in your bed, to have your ways with her? What she feels doesn't matter all that much; she's only an attractive face and body to you. Being able to have sex with her would be something that's going to make your friends envious (if you're that open) or just give you an overall ego boost. You were/are crazy in lust. 

Oh you probably don't remember the second girl. Cos her face and body were all that mattered to you. 
Trust me, it sucks always being the second type of girl. Guys may or may not find you attractive (idk whether looks matter when guys wanna bang a girl) and they surely want to get into your pants, but to them you're not a person, you're an object.
Being objectified is something we can't avoid; it's how we see ourselves that really matter more. But the feeling is really terrible, when you know that you never meant more than that to a person. 

Fortunately I've never given myself to any guy, but sometimes I really wonder what's wrong with me, why hasnt there been any guy in my life who cares about me like that, who would love and respect me, though he's not in love with me. I've had guy friends who are good, reliable friends and they seem to respect me but I found out that if given the chance they'd sleep with me.
You know when you just respect a girl so much that u can't even think about her that way? I wanted to be that girl for my guy friends, for any guy in my life, even if I can't be someone a guy is totally in love with. 

Is it something I'm doing? Well I know for sure I'm not giving out the wrong message; I'm not promiscuous; I dress fairly conservatively; Im not very touchy with my guy friends; I have my personal space and I respect others'. I respect people (those who deserve it) and I'm not overly sexual when it comes to jokes and such. Then why am I viewed as a sexual object by people who should be respecting me.
Not only that, whenever I read/see/hear about this guy falling for this girl or that girl, or how they still feel about her, I get so jealous. Why can't a guy feel that way about me.
And I feel ashamed of myself for thinking that way cos no, I don't need validation from a guy to find out what kind of person I am. I believe I don't need to be loved to feel good about myself. I have a great personality and I'm my own person, for myself. 
But that doesn't change the fact that I keep thinking about not being 'loved', wondering why hasn't anyone ever felt that way about me...

I've had it with being a nerdy guy. Everywhere I see other guys more handsome, more fit, smarter, more charismatic, knowing how to talk to girls and grow close to them. 

I'm going to transform myself. Hell if I know how to do it. I'll starve myself and work out. I'll force myself to club, do stuff popular guys do. I'll stop being myself, I'll force myself into many other selves as I need. I'll stop being the nice guy no one remembers or pays attention to. Nothing is worse than that. I'll bring together an apparent clique of friends I may or may not actually like. I'll give up on my dream on having just one love to dote on and become one of those playboys. I'll look cool, popular and normal, and I don't care how empty I'll feel in the end. It's a game we all play here in NUS, which of us is better than the others. I have no intention of losing any more. Just two weeks in as a freshie, and I've had it.

I only hope I'll turn out from this for the better. I'm not turning away from my true self, because there will not be a 'myself' any more.

Two weeks into the new semester and I'm already breaking down. I've always prided myself on being independent, but the truth that it translates to is that I'm actually a loner in NUS with no friends, attending lectures alone. In exchange I put everything I had into my club activities, and managed to find myself in a position with responsibilities despite my loner personality. But all it really does is keep me even more distant from everyone else, with a gap that can't be crossed when our ways of thinking are just too different.

A week back I lost a friend of mine from outside NUS, and I can't even find myself able to vocalise the amount of emotion and emptiness it's giving me, and it's just building up into frustration and self-hatred. People have been trying to reach out to me but all it really makes me do is withdraw deeper into my own shell from shame. I don't even know how to begin dealing with this whole mess: I'm sure somewhere here there's a lesson about living life to the fullest and staying connected to people and reaching out when you need it but knowing, acknowledging and doing are three very different things, and I'm just afraid, tired and lonely right now.

Sorry if this confession is a total mess. That's just how things are, and look to be for the rest of the semester. As stupid as it is, I just want it all to end.

In year 3 now and I unexpectedly made friends with some freshies and suddenly I'm the "cool senpai" who they look up to. I'm okay with being friends with them, but I feel a bit uneasy because I don't think I deserve their "respect". I'm not even good in academics - my CAP is crap.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to have them as friends, but I feel like I'm cheating them or something. But it's not as if being smart is a criteria for being friends, right? I'd be more than happy to share notes or show them around school, but I'd be hopeless in teaching them or giving academic advice. Sometimes, I wished that they didn't notice this senpai.

I really dislike random dudes/acquaintances calling me bro. Like c'mon, I don't even know your name

I've been trying to date this girl for years, but so far I've never been able to get her to commit (it was always stuck in this weird pseudo-rls). I want to move on, and perhaps try to find someone who is right for me, but part of me is worried that it is unfaithful (because I gave up on the previous girl) and that it's unfair for the next girl (because I haven't really got over the previous one either). I'm also worried how the next girl will actually view this mess... (I don't want her to think she is a replacement for the previous one either).

Is it even possible to actually get over someone? Or do we just try to find someone that we like more...? *sighpie*

Any couples with extroverted female with geeky shy guy? I am always intimidated by her "cool" clique and don't know how to fit in. I think she is interested in me and she will always play it down so I would be comfortable around her. There are so many alpha males around her that could make all the girls laugh. I am afraid that if I get too emotionally attached to her and found out that she is just toying with me I will not be able to take it. 

I don't let my barrier down easily so if I were to accept a friend/gf, I would be really loyal to them. I am not needy because I am always alone. Why would a girl even like a shy geek when there are so many popz guy ard her?

It seems there are quite a number of girls in NUS who likes girls huh.

I posted previously about this guy I met on exchange that I was (and maybe still am) interested in. Some commenters mentioned that his actions suggested that he may be interested in me as well. But as I shared in another post, we stopped communicating after I returned from exchange. He took super long to reply to my messages, saying that he's busy (he said he would be busy until about mid august), although he is quite active on facebook. So I decided to give up because I thought he really didn't have any interest in even developing a friendship.

Recently, we started to email each other again. It started off as my desperate attempt last time to create an opportunity for us to keep in touch, something work-related. Our email conversations are like semi-work-related, some parts are about work and some are like casual, personal topics, like what he's up to, and funny stuff. He made a joke that was a reference to a joke I made over lunch before I left, which I took a while to remember. In our interactions he always remembered our conversations with a lot of detail, which last time I interpreted as him being interested in me, but he probably just has an excellent memory I guess?

So anyway, he said to keep the conversation going over email, and also suggested some other interesting opportunities that we could work on together (as in, legit work stuff). I don't know if he is genuinely interested in me or is just a good networker. But I am also not an extremely valuable resource for his projects.

I'm just super bummed because I had such a hard time getting over him, and now he's being friendly again, and the opportunity is here again. I can't help but wonder if he's interested in me and if I have a chance at all.

And I am not those type that will just tell him that I like him right now, because we aren't even good or regular friends yet. 

WHY IS LIFE SO COMPLICATED! Or probably it's just me complicating things on my end alone. 
-
 
I'm OP of . We have talked about it and I have decided to give him a chance. He gave me his promise, showed remorse and I accepted it. His reason for continuing special massages after we getting together was that he doesn't want me to feel used and want to lessen the times we do it. Not very convincing but I decided to believe him.   Thank you all for the advice.

To the senior that i am attracted to and would love to know more about.. maybe one day... till then~~

This is to the poster of . All I can say is, bro to bro, sometimes when one volunteers more info that you expect, one might be trying to hide something. From your posts, you are likely insecure. It's ok, you have good reason to. Meanwhile, just enjoy listening and laughing together. It's good for bonding. You'll need it. Ok, nuff said. =)

My girlfriend and I are about to break up.

My gf and I have been together for four years already. I've reached a point whereby I start to ask myself if she is the girl that I am going to marry. I love her with all my heart, but sometimes, I really feel that our personalities are different. For example, whenever a problem arises, I will want to talk it out. She on the other hand likes to ignore me and would rather have some alone time. She is also a very adventurous and ambitious girl. She has gone on many overseas trips with the school. She went to Thailand once for a month and then went to NOC for a year. All this while i waited for her patiently, skyping her every night, making sure that we would at the very least communicate once a day. Recently, she expressed her interest to me about going for an overseas program which would last 2 years. I really didn't want to stop her from doing what she wants, but at the same time, I didn't want her to leave me again. The past year while she was in NOC was hard for me. Due to the time difference, i'd have to sleep at 1-3am every night just so we could have a conversation together. Anyway, when she mentioned that she was interested to go on the program, it suddenly struck me hard whether this is the kind of person i'd want to marry. I mean, first it was 1 year, then now it's 2 years, who knows what opportunity will pop up next and then off she goes again. But even with all these doubts in my head, I still love her for who she is. It's a little hard to explain, but it's just how I feel.

I have been talking to this other girl in school for the past two weeks. The both of us are just friends, I know it in my heart that I have 0% interest in my friend in the romantic sense... Furthermore, that girl already has a boyfriend. She's just a good friend, like the kind who is not fake or pretentious. The only girl in my heart is my girlfriend, and I'd do anything for her. I have been very transparent with my gf about me talking to my friend. I'd let her read our text messages too just so she doesn't feel insecure. I could feel that my gf was getting a little jealous of it and i told her that "if you want me to stop, i'll stop, no questions asked, because I love you and I don't want a friend to come in between us".

She didn't tell me to stop. I thought it was pretty mature of her to trust me like that. My conscience was also clear because I have 0% interest in my friend as a partner. 

Yesterday, she read out text messages again. She cried. I've never seen her cry like this before in my life. I wanted to hug her, but I could tell she didn't want me anywhere near her. She accused me of liking this friend of mine. She felt betrayed. I was shocked. Because not only did i not like this girl friend of mine, I loved my gf with 2000% of my heart. I immediately felt like shit. I would have given up everything I had just for her to stop crying. My fingers, my organs, my money, anything. I couldn't bear to watch her cry like that because of me. She left me and blocked me from calling her and messaging her. At 3am, she texted me that she needed some time alone.

Today, i went to wait outside her lecture with some food in my hand, hoping I could talk it out with her. I couldn't find her when her lecture ended. People streamed out of the LT and i desperately searched for her everywhere. Fearing i might have missed her, I ran around the school, searching for her. I tried calling her again, only to remember that she had blocked all my calls. I called again and again, hoping for the small chance that she would unblock me. But she didn't. I felt empty. I felt like shit. I felt like breaking down. I was perspiring like mad. I felt so helpless.

I don't want things to end for us like this. I know i have my doubts about us, but i always thought I'd have it figured out along the way with you. I don't want things to end between us.. over nothing...

Does any1 have any advice?

I think I am near the end of my relationship. At the end we still cannot understand each other. We have talked about this multiple times but it still didn't work out. My partner simply refuses to change. 

On the other hand I always feel sad when thinking of breakup. I imagine we could really become perfect couple..

I think people will never change, after all..

There's this boyish girl from another faculty that is interested in me. She sort of hinted to me that she's interested in me. But the keyword being boyish, I am pretty afraid that I will face domestic violence every single time I meet her if I accept her. I don't want to end up calling the AWARE hotline for help. Any advice on this? 
-
 
There's this girl in my class that I find pretty interesting. I think she's an exchange student. Not too sure from where but she's gorgeous.

I would love to get to know her better and see if that goes anywhere but one problem. I'm a freaking girl. 

How do I approach this?
-
 
My best friend recently got attached to a girl. Everything seemed smooth and great, and I wish that they will last long. 

The thing is, everyone has insecurities, and the girl's closer friends seem to keep using her insecurities to instill bad blood in their relationship. 

How do you even get into a stable relationship when she's surrounded by psycho bitches 24/7? I don't even get it. You mean you have to date the girl AND her whole bunch of friends now? Things seemed much easier when we were all younger.

Thinking of organising a NUSWhispers gathering soon for those interested to make new friends. Please comment if you'd be interested?

Heh, very interesting reading about rich people with privilege. I am a rich person too, but it didn't use to be this way. My dad abandoned my family before I was born, and my mum and I pretty much scraped by. However some time ago I came into possession of a trust fund from my "dad", apparently out of guilt. After knowing what it is like to feel rich, my resentment at my more well-off friends only became magnified. 

It brings a smile to my face knowing they are still working to make ends meet, whereas I can pretty much live in comfort till the day I die (based on average lifespan of humans) without working at all. Now I just chuckle inwardly whenever I hear their humblebrags.

Freshie here...sometimes I feel really lonely in school, I know it's only been two weeks in but I can't help but feel like everything is just so different from what I used to know...i.e. in jc, when everyone would go to classes together, have lunch together. Now, it seems I go from place to place alone, eat alone, attend lectures alone...I made a few friends but because our schedules are all so different, we can hardly meet up normally. Is this normal, do people do all these things alone? I feel isolated, in a sense, and it's only two weeks in...
-
 
Why does it feel like guys are always so easily intimidated by me? I always sense a nervousness in them when interacting, and they tend to stutter or stumble over words. Some of them can't seem to have prolonged eye contact with me as well which is real strange. I notice random guys staring sometimes but none would dare to come up to me. They just keep on staring which makes me super self conscious and weirded out. I guess I am above average in terms of physical appearance.. But nowhere beautiful enough to warrant such behavior in my opinion. It's just really strange and their jumpiness makes me feel awkward even when I'm not to begin with. I wonder what could be the issue here.. Do they dislike me and actually not want to talk to me? Are they staring because I have something on my face? Just don't understand why they always like to make the atmosphere so weird, why can't they just chill? 

-kinda exasperated girl 
-
 
I really like this guy from one of my biz classes. He's really cute but I don't really dare to talk to him and we're not from the same group (we sit far apart during class so there's no chance to talk to him during class as well). I'm wondering if it'll seem creepy and weird if I just approach him like that and start talking to him, especially since we're not from the same AG. What should I do? 
-
 
I'm starting to like this guy (and the feeling's probably mutual), but the problem - if it is - is that he's slightly shorter than I am. Or maybe we're the same height. I have no idea, but bottom line is, he's definitely short for a guy while I'm relatively tall for a girl.

Now, I hate to sound superficial that his height does bother me somewhat, but I feel that even if I get over it myself, I know my family and friends won't. To be blunt, society does sometimes mock short people, often without malice and in fact often for laughs, but it happens and can be annoying or hurtful to the person himself. My family and friends are no different and sometimes do the same. It also doesn't help that I come from a family where everyone, including my relatives, are tall and lean. His height may be gradually mattering less to me now, but I hate that I will be so embarrassed for the day I have to introduce him to my family and friends. They will raise eyebrows, they will judge...but they will keep their mouths shut. But I just KNOW that if we were just a random couple on the streets, they will definitely snicker and joke about it. 

Any other girls in a similar situation? How did you deal with it, both within yourself and with the people around you? 

Or even guys, if you're short, how do you deal with dating a tall/taller girl? How are you affected by the people around both of you?
-
 
I've known this girl for more than a year but we've only started interacting on a more personal level recently and I think I'm falling for her. Assuming I haven't already been friendzoned, how do I drop hints that I like her and ask her out on a romantic date (instead of two friends hanging out)? Should I start with something like having meals together in school?
-
 
Met up recently with a friend who I've not met in awhile, and not only did he reveal that he was gay, but he had had a crush on me.

I'm straight, but I must admit it was quite flattering.

I cannot get this off my mind and the tears wont stop either. I recently found out that my boyfriend of one year had a bad habit of going for sexual services and massages. Found out from his laptop that he frequents this forum about local commercialised sex scenes. After confronting him,  he admitted that before me he went for full service before and even after getting together for a year he visited sexual massages that included hj. I dont know whether this is the norm for males but I cannot accept all these. 

No matter how many sorry he said cant remove the image of him satisfying his lust through such channels. Even when he promises and reassures me that he will never go for it again, I cannot forgive him and let alone forget. It hurts me so much.

Guys and gals, please rethink about your actions because it can cause so much hurt to the people you love next time. The past always haunts you.

I don't really know how to describe it but sometimes I just feel like uni here at NUS hasn't lived up to my expectations. I'm not saying there aren't good moments but other times it's just the same mundane routine and I feel so constrained by all the expectations we are fed. I feel like we're all just here with the overly pragmatic mindset of getting their degree and joining all these CCAs to buff up their CV and get a good job- how superficial is that. To be honest that's what I did too, but I hate the system that we've prescribed to (myself included), and the only reason I do it is to just help me get through the 4 years here. When we're too goal oriented often times we forget to enjoy the process and live in the moment. All those sayings you hear which tell you to enjoy life and live in the present are, sad to say, complete utter bullshit, because if that's what I do then I'll get bad grades and I'll probably be unemployed or whatever it is we are all so afraid of. It's just damn annoying to feel like I'm wasting 4 years of my life just to burn myself out for a damn degree.. Why do we all do this to ourselves?! Is it worth our mental and physical health? So much for university days being the best days of your life.

There was this cat that stalk me for at least 2 weeks. The strange thing is that it appears suddenly and follows me to my house during the night. Lately, it creeps me out since it is the ghost month period. A few days ago, I was studying till quite late and went to the kitchen to brush my teeth. It was past 2am. The first thing I saw was a pair of glowing eyes staring at me. It looks very creepy seriously but I just ignore it. Can anyone who understands cats tell me what is happening or am I just seeing things since it is still occuring. How can I stop it?

I have this pet peeve -- I absolutely hate having people walk right up to me when I'm eating just to ask "what are you eating?" and then stare at the food I'm eating as though analyzing what I'm really having for a few seconds before walking away.

Really? Do you REALLY need to know what I'm eating? I'm not sure if it's just me, but this action irks me so badly (don't know why though). If it was just a glance from far or wasn't made known though, of course I won't have issues with it.

Now this doesn't happen in NUS fortunately, but it happens so damn often at home. Maybe I just feel that meal time is really something private? I dunno.
-
 
You may have cut me off from your life, but I still can't help but worry about you everyday. 

Are you coping alright with school? Did you get good groupmates for your mods? Are you eating well? And most importantly, are you moving on?

I really do hope your days have been better ever since then, and that I'm worrying about nothing.

I think I am falling for an exchange student.  She is smart, witty and very fun to be with.  But I don't think it will work out as she is only here for a semester. Any suggestions on what to do?

I ended my relationship a year ago. It didn't end on a good note. Frankly speaking, I don't bear any hard feelings or hatred towards the other party. But, I just can't convince myself to wish him and his new girl all the best. I tried to tell myself to but as time goes by, I realize I don't feel sad seeing them appearing in photos or posts but I just can't feel happy for them. I hope I do, at least that means he's totally out of my mind. This kind of feeling sucks.

I'm a girl and I don't wear makeup at all. But whenever I go out with my girl friends they keep talking about makeup products, leaving me clueless lol. Anyone facing the same problem as me? :(

I had quite a few close friends last time. But things became different after they entered into relationships. I'm happy for them but as what happens in life, the friendship slowly faded away. Maybe I was wrong about it - they don't treat me as a close friend. But I'm someone who treasures friendship a lot because I know friendship lasts longer than a love relationship Am I weird? Btw, I have a boyfriend. 
Until now I am still feeling sad about the lost friendship. I am hesitant to make friends anymore because I feel that they won't be in my life forever and they don't know really know me as well as my old friends. (my past and etc). I wonder if anyone feels the same as well.
People come and go. I understand that people can't stay forever as they have their own priorities. Perhaps I'm just a possessive idiot.
I know some of you might say that I should talk things out. I guess we tried. But when things don't feel the same anymore, I guess it's time to let go.

To many, my life may seem perfect. I have a good CAP, a circle of friends and I've been told that I'm handsome by quite a few people. But... Why do I sometimes get irrational urges to do dangerous things and hurt myself? I have no reason to hate my life. But I think about ending it occasionally on nights like these and then I would wake up feeling relieved that I did't. Most days I wake up and get about my day like a normal person but I'll come back feeling drained and exhausted. I recently confided in a friend that sometimes I think living isn't worth it and he just laughed it off as a joke because he didn't believe me. But to be fair I wouldn't believe me either. Maybe I smile too much. I think I am going mad.

I have come to realise that I am an 'emotionally unavailable' person. But I really do not want to be one. How do I stop? 
-
 
I'm someone who is very insecure in being alone or not having many friends. I feel uneasy whenever I have to eat alone in school and hence I always message many people I know after confirming timetables to arrange lunch appointments. It's troublesome and I know many dont care about eating alone / won't judge when people eat alone, but inside of me I'll still feel sad. To each his own I guess.

I really can't take it when people keep saying that I am a nice guy. The truth is I watch porn and masturbate almost daily which no one knows about it. ( Though I am still a virgin and only believe in sex after marriage ). When I am being nice, I admit I have a motive. I am super nice to chio bu and my crush with the hope of going on a date with them (I am evergreen so to me this is justified). I am nice to people whom I need help or depend on ( Like those in my project group and my seniors who I get my lab reports from). The only exception is those who are genuinely nice to me and when I feel it, I will be genuinely nice to them but that is very rare.

Need some advice... I am currently going out with this girl (not dating, not together yet). I know its normal for couples to let their partners see their phones and wallet.. But as above, we are not dating/together yet but she still lets me do them... Is this really hinting something?
-
 
I think my i am losing control of my life mainly because i keep comparing myself to other batchmates. I often see them on social media living 'the life' being happening, having hall events, being around large group of friends, joinjng peagent. I don't know why but seeing these makes me feel like i am missing out on the 'university life'.

I have a qns, what defines a lost of virginity? 
I spoke to a friend recently about it and we couldn't come to an answer. She said that virginity is lost only when you're penetrated. But I feel that it's lost the moment oral sex is engaged.
-
 
I seem to have a penchant for attracting emotionally needy girls with deep seated issues. Unfortunately this is the exact type I'm unable to deal with. Perhaps I need to stop appearing dependable and pretend to be some needy, attention seeking boy to attract my type.
-
 
It really pisses me off when some of my gal friends like to bitch about how guys always ogle at them. They pretend they do not like it and find it rude, however as a girl myself, I can tell they really love it a lot from the way they laugh and smile while talking about it. If you don't want guys to look at you, why do you still dress so scantily and put on makeup? Sometimes I wish my clique are all guys. To me personally, most girls are very pretentious and hypocritical (always smiling in front of others but bitching behind their backs) while most guys seem very straightforward and honest (they bitch at the person directly.) Sorry, I am a sexist against my own gender :-P

To OP ,
What do you think of the opposite happening?
My Ex GF still wants to remain as a friend with me despite insisting that she doesn't love me anymore. Anyone has any take on this matter? She will still message me randomly to get updates on me.

I am mind-screwed.

Dear NUS Whisperers,

I need to rant and get some advice. I argued with my girlfriend yesterday over something silly. She told me that I've had an easy life. It wasn't the first time I heard it. She's said the same on several occasions to a point where I'm sick of it. I don't deny I've had an easy life. I come from a wealthy family. We fly on private jets on our holidays. She, on the other hand, comes from a poor family. They're on welfare and have never been out of Singapore (not even Malaysia). I'm very much aware of the privilege I've had in life. 

I've known her family background since day one of our relationship, but that didn't stop me from wanting to pursue her. I saw my whole life with her, and for the first time in my "colourful" dating history, it didn't scare me. Before, I would have ended relationships faster than I would commit. I really, really love her. I just don't know how to place myself in her situation. I just cannot imagine it.

Last night, I was driving her home... and the topic came up again. I told her out of frustration to "shut the fuck up" and called her naive and irrational. We spent the remainder of that car ride in silence... I WAed this morning to apologize. She's read it, but hasn't replied. I feel guilty for the words I said, but I can't help but feel like it's an attack each time she says something about my privilege... Maybe I was wrong, I don't know lah... fuck.

Girls, really just curious here, how do you feel when a guy accidentally looks at your cleavage? Because I was talking to my friend and she was wearing spaghetti strap, and my eyes could not help but stray to those amazing boobs of hers. It was really tough to maintain eye contact with her while resisting the urge to look down.

The thing is, she noticed my eyes going down and pulled her top upwards a few times to sort of like cover it, and I can't help but to feel awkward. My question is, do you girls mind if a guy occasionally looks, or would you feel awkward? Or are those cleavage meant for only a select few guys who can look without you trying to cover up? And the age old but potentially sexist question of if you mind me looking, why wear that in the first place? I know it's on the guy's onus to not stare, but it's really hard when you're so turned on by it.
-
 
I see lots of guys on campus who own girls. How do you do it? How do you get one of those things to be your "girlfriend "

I wish I could just buy those things. Like from an auction. I'd buy 7, a different one for each day of the week. 
-
 
To  OP, just because someone has had sex before, doesn't mean they value it any less than a virgin. 

Sincerely, someone who has been raped and emotionally blackmailed into sex.

In response to OP  regarding what it means to be cheating on your partner:
Pretty impressed you actually had a reply post to your first post, seems you're actually appreciative and really looking for advice. I feel that I would like to comment on this because of my own similar experiences.
When I was with my first girlfriend, (ok fine I was probably still young back then) I admit that even with her, I still looked to other girls to fulfil my self esteem, in forms of flirting or whatsoever. I enjoyed talking to numerous girls especially when I know they are interested in talking to me as well. However, it was different in my second relationship. I was no longer interested in 'flirting' with other girls, they no longer make me happier. I know that I do not want to be caught in a situation where I feel stuck; continue these flirting conversations but hiding them from my gf. The flirting conversations no longer serve any purpose at all, other than being a burden to my relationship. And I realised that it had to do with my determination to commit to the two girlfriends at the different points of time. So, maybe you should ask yourself whether you really want this relationship, to really commit to it, and if you really want your current girl? Because the fact that you are asking those questions simply show that you're not sure enough. I am not saying you cannot have female friends, but know your limits. And obviously you already know that your conversations with the girls are flirting, then why would you still do it?

In a fully committed relationship, you should know when and what to put a stop to. The moment you decide to commit in a relationship, other girls shouldn't even enter your mind easily. You also mentioned that it's the girl who flirts with you even though you try to ignore her at times. Do you honestly think that that is a good excuse at all? You mean there is no other way to stop her from flirting other than to flirt back since you already 'tried' to ignore her sometimes. Come on. It's like you had sex with another women and you say oh you didn't mean to but they girl keeps seducing you and you already tried pushing her away. Fact is you succumbed it in the end and that's what counts. If you know what the other girl's intention is, which includes flirting, you should fully know that you should not do it because you are in a relationship, you respect your relationship and your girlfriend, and you know your girlfriend would not like it. "My gf does not know about it" is NOT an excuse much less a reason. Likewise, if a guy wants to get close to your girl obviously on intention, and your girl actually flirts back, would you be alright with it? If you tell me yes, you are actually fine with your girl flirting with other guys then maybe your relationship is unique in a way that you have your own rules, and if so, you can ignore whatever I said.

Otherwise, if you actually still enjoy flirting with other girls, maybe you should reconsider your relationship. Save your girlfriend too, stop wasting her time and love.

My two-cents on the whole pre-martial sex debacle: your virginity does not define your morality in any way. It's okay if you've done it/choose to do it, it's okay if you choose not to.

However, as a virgin, I would much rather date, and marry a fellow virgin, who is also saving it for after marriage. Not that non-virgins are "damaged goods" and/or immoral (I'm sure we are way past this discussion already - not to mention virginity is a social construct, anyway), but because of the other reasons: diseases is one of them (but there's safe sex/condoms, so okay; fine), but also because I would much rather share something so special; so intimate; such an emotionally loaded act with somebody who will treasure his/her first time as well, instead of somebody who has already slept around/see it as... nothing much; as a casual thing. Also because we could explore our sexualities together as both inexperienced people, that kind of thing. (Even if it could include a lot of awkward fumbling, haha. But I think it would still be exciting all the same, doing it with somebody you love.)

Somebody raised a very good point on how relationships are not supposed to be like business transactions (ie. if I give you my virginity, I must have yours too; if I give you a $500 gift, you must give me a $500 gift too, that kind of thing), but as  might perhaps understand too, it's an... indescribable feeling. (For me, it's disappointment, maybe? Like somebody already has experience/a basis of comparison... Maybe this reeks of insecurity, but I would like to share my first with somebody who still has his/her first, too - there is so much significance attached to such an emotionally loaded act, and I hope I'd find somebody who feels the same about this, too.)

Whenever I am having a crush on a girl (I'm guy anw), I felt curious when she is or seems to be close to another guy, although I am not attached to her.

People around me keep saying things like: "You're not her bf, you don't have right to know about it. You're too nosy", "You merely know her for several weeks. Don't make a move too fast", or "It's not appropriate to ask a girl if she's attached" (many of them do not put their relationship status in FB either), and even "Silent is golden. A real gentleman talks less."

In fact, I am tired of this kind of comments. The reason is that I need to know where I stand as in if I have chance to be her SO. Or the chance is if I become close to her and develop feeling already, but turns out that she is attached, I surely fall into friendzone. Are there any better way to know without asking?

Eh not sure why got ppl so obsessed with virginity? If I can find gf I happy dao siao alrdy

In the light of these pre-marital sex debates, I just want to point out that it isn't just about the two extremes: those who keep their virginity till marriage and those who like to play around and have fun sex. 

I feel quite uncomfortable as I lie in between these two extremes. I had sex before marriage not because I didn't respect my own body and cherish my virginity, but because I thought I found someone that I would love for the rest of my live. However, it turned out that the relationship didn't end up as well as I thought it would. Everyone makes mistakes, right?

And as someone who is quite traditional and conservative, I had a hard time trying to face the fact that I didn't save my virginity for my marriage partner. Now that I have 'forgiven' myself, I just want to say: We shouldn't be too harsh/strict on ourselves as well as our future partners as some things might not turn out the way you want them to be. 
-
 
guys, what do you think of girls confessing? even if your feelings are platonic towards her, what would you think about her after she had confessed, assuming that y'all were not really close, just friends who occasionally talked via WA and saw each other at family gatherings. 
-
 
Hi I'm the OP for . Thank you to all who replied for the help. 
Well, I did tell him that I don't feel the same way at all when he confessed his feelings. And he proceeded on to say about how he hoped we would still be friends. I agreed because I didn't give it much thought at that time (I didn't think he would be getting on my nerves so bad, but I regret it so much now.) 
I have been ignoring him for a week now but it didn't seem to work as well. He would continue texting me like the fact that I didn't reply at all didn't mean anything. 
I am really getting very frustrated. 
-
 
Alright I need some help here guys. So there is this dude whom I have known for years, but we were the on and off kind of friends which meant that there were times we didn't speak to each other at all. Recently we started to talk again, and he confessed his feelings for me after a week. I started to find him annoying and would start getting angry at how he don't get my hints that I would never like him in my entire life. Can anyone suggest how I can get him off my back? Ignoring him didn't work apparently. (sadly) I wouldn't want to make things too ugly though.

I'm a virgin, any virgin ladies interested?

PS: Real virgins only. Will check on marriage.

Recently, someone I thought to be a good friend, betrayed my confidence... He screenshot our chat and sent it to another friend. 

This other friend then poked at me for more gossip, she wanted more information...

I felt a little hurt. How could you have done that to me? I thought everything I told you was private? 

Sigh, whatever. I learnt a lesson from this, keep all your cards to yourself, even from your s/o

Once, I gone to zouk without wearing my underwear on purpose. The thing was I was hitting off well with a certain team mate of mine that particular day and I got the most awkward pat on the butt when I whispered that I didn't had any underwear on. To be honest, I kind of liked it but too bad, he's attached and I feel bad. Such a cock tease I am.

I've always told myself to be a strong person. For my family, for my friends, for my past S/O's. I've always portrayed myself that way too, and it wasn't difficult at all, though I've had to put up a false front occasionally. It was always straightforward: how to emote. Be happy for a joyous occasion, be sad for a potentially depressing occasion, be devastated over an unfair situation, etc.

I've never had to deal with loss before. My grandparents passed on when I was too young to understand anything. So did most of my senior relatives. All my living relatives are below 60 and expected to live for years more. Of course, I had my fair share of attending funerals of my friends' parents/grandparents, but that's it.

Recently, my dad felt some discomfort in his chest and as advised, he decided to go for an X-ray. It was bad news. Chest X-ray showed a growth in his lung, confirmed by a follow-up CT scan. I'm afraid that my identity might be exposed if I reveal too much, but let's say that my dad lived a fairly average health sort of life. A bit of vice and a bit of fitness.

As I await further testing and results, I'm not sure what I should be feeling? It's best described as a mixture of hopefulness that everything will be alright plus anticipation of immense sadness if something more serious is diagnosed. The doctors have already advised that it should be C unless diagnosed otherwise, and told us to brace ourselves for the worst. 

This is a brand new experience for me and this whole emotional instability is really affecting me psychologically. Can anyone who has experience with close relatives encountering/overcoming/succumbing to C please share some ways you coped with it and advise me on the best that I can do? Apart from supporting my dad and making him happy in any way possible..

Lucky I got a gf before coming to NUS. If not I think all the cute cute and pretty NUS girls would have taken away 99% of my attention. Now this 99% is on books and notes. I can relate that it is really tough for single people to go through University life. But hey you know what, guys and gals, put down your pride and shyness and put on some courages and hairy balls for 20 seconds and walk up to the person you admire and say: "Hey you know what,  I have been noticing you since forever. I think we should spend the remaining 15 seconds to get to know each other better. What do you think? You got 10 seconds to respond. If you don't respond I'll take it as a yes. Your 10 seconds started 11 seconds ago while I was watching you from a distance." This is a lame example but seriously guys/gals it really doesn't matter what you say within that 20 seconds. If you try you have 50% chance. If you don't, you got zero. Better than doing MCQ quiz.

My bf has had sex with both his exes whereas i myself am a virgin. I do not foresee myself having sex with him until we are married. Sometimes i do wish he never did have sex prior to meeting me but I have come to the realisation that it is actually increasingly the norm that people are not saving their virginity for marriage. However, I come from a rather conservative family and thus he will have to wait for me or be single.

I do wish that he did save his virginity for marriage as well, although it isn't exactly an issue of fairness per se but rather just this indescribable feeling :-/

This whole virgin and sleeping around partner criteria and debate, its like prisoner dilemma and sex meshup in real life. Now we know why so many relationship lacks trust...

Hi, i am a freshie in NUS this year and i did not get to stay in hall.. i din't manage to make much friends either.. my jc/sec friends (girls) are all at diff university. I feel really lonely. To make things worse, i  am barely coping with my studies and it does not help that my house is 1hr-1.5hr away from school nd my wifi connection is always down. I feel that my confidence level is going down everyday and it has hit an all time low. There are many cca i want to try but feel so inedaqute to try. Is it normal to feel lost and lonely? Is it normal to feel this way? I have share my concerns with some of my close friends and they did try to help but i feel that me feeling this way constantly have cause them to drift away from me.. i really have no idea how to get out of this and be normal again. I miss the old me.. i think i need hall but i don't know where to get it. I tried hotlines but they do not seem to help i don't know what to do anymore.. i really need help

What's with all the posts about sex, virginity and masturbation.

Now I cannot studyyyyyyyy...because i'm all fired up (Still waiting for that Welcome Tea)
-
 
Girls (or guys) who think they are better than others because they are still virgins are kinda irritating. If it's your preference to wait til marriage it's okay. But you should not view those who didn't as morally beneath you, even worse label them as 'sluts' or whatever.
-
 
  Imagine this joke was on those "premarital sex is good" folks. You'll get all these self-righteous people riled up. But put the joke on those who choose to save it and it'll all fine. 

You want to poke fun at those people who place importance in virginity so you take the extreme end of the spectrum. Very good. Much likes. Another feather in your cap. Just like those guys who go around telling girls that virginity is not important just so that they can add another notch in their belt. Or those girls who feel insecure about their mistake so they want others to follow in their footsteps. What? You're not like that? Then why are you trying so hard to convince people of your point of view? Do you have a vested interest?

Yeah write me off as a bitter male virgin for all you want. Just sick and tired of all these girls who get played and in the end when they complain to me it's not "I shouldn't have given him my heart" its "I should never have slept with him". But don't worry, your opinion gets lots of fb likes, its okay.
-
 
It's always the same few of us commenting and liking NUSWhisper posts... Maybe we should all organise a meetup sometime? =D

All the talk about premarital sex got me in deep thoughts about it. TLDR; I DO NOT support it even though you might call me a hypocrite.

I was young and foolish and fell head over heels for a guy that wasn't even mine. He was my best friend, we hung out a lot and I haboured thoughts of getting together all the time. I'd do anything to make him happy even if it hurts that I received no reciprocation or inkling that he's felt the same way, all except sex.

Another friend suggested I should give in to his advances, to which I was (and still am) feverntly against it. But... "anything to make him happy"... right..? Wrong.
We nearly went all the way one night with protection... and we had a scare when that time of the month was delayed. 

We fought and argued so badly because neither one of us was mature enough to even think that such responsibility suddenly thrown upon us was possible. Our friendship was gone in that split second. How much of a coward we both were was demeaning and disgusting. It left us broken.

Sex can be pleasurable, yes. It may seem like the in thing to do because we are seen as more liberal. But from personal experience, I regret it so much. Legal age doesn't equate to maturity, but how one handles being thrown in the deep end of responsibility does.

Marriage does just that. It is a legal public declaration of love between 2 human beings that in sickness or in health, in the good and the bad they will support one another. It's about sacrifice in love. You're responsible for that other human being (and smaller humans in the future) who is probably just as awesome as you.

Yeah sure bgr kinda does that responsibility-thingyums and 'we are mature enough to decide' too, but the moment things grow bad, they break down so much faster without as many consequences, which us why divorces can be really terrible because it tears that very contract built in love for years and torn by 'unsolvable differences'.

It's your choice, I'm not telling you how to live your lives. I'm not judging anyone or else I'd be judged myself. I'm pleading, appealing to those who are keeping yourself for someone who is mature and responsible for you, who loves you (not just the sex). Hope you all find what you're looking for. (Sex or none at all)

I want to confess about my life. But the problem is that I really need help, but am not sure who I can ask for help. I don't know who's my friend or enemy anymore.

People who were once close to me have backstabbed me in ways I cannot imagine. All that remains of a friend I used to call close are two creatures (maybe three) that will never move except if someone moves them. The batchmates who I could talk to have all but become distant away.

You may never know I am crying, or smiling, even if my countenance proves otherwise. But I can cry and smile. It is just that the constant judging of people around me makes it impossible for me to trust people around me excessively. I will never know when my emotions will be seen as a sign of weakness for an opportunist to exploit.

Twice in a row in the same place I met supposedly close friends who eventually turned out to erase me from their lives mysteriously. The cynic in you will tell me to reflect. I did. But I asked why I can make many "non-close" friends, but making close friends that won't backstab is so difficult. Or do I have such poor judgement ability?

I am sorry if you think I am mentally screwed up. You will think I either cannot hold onto friends or have a personality that is so revolting. But I think I am still struggling to emerge from a few friendship and relationship-related traumas. So maybe you are right, I am mentally screwed up.

If you know the confessor, do not tag. Even if you do the confessor will never respond to you. But know that the confessor is human.

Hi I am OP of  and I want to thank you all for the comments. Here are some of my replies: 
JD: No we don't live in a different reality, I just believe that there are no stupid questions so I just asked it anonymously to seek answers. 
Blobfish: Totally agree with your masturbation!=sex comment. I still desire my gf for sex (amongst other things that I desire my gf for, stating this in case people accuse me of desiring my gf for sexual pleasures only) and yes I don't masturbate to reality. On an unrelated note, I wonder how you get such accurate insights... It is a bit scary haha
JHL: I am quite sure my heart is not going to swing to other girls that I am flirting with
NSR: I think your comment is very true was the best insight for me and I really need to think about it.
NM: Thanks, good to know that your friend has similar views
YTY: 1) my gf does not know about it 2) actually is the girl keep flirting with me even though I tries to ignore her sometimes.

I have an ex who can't stop contacting me, always trying to find new topic. I would really like to move on from this. Anyone knows how to make it stop?

I don't know what possessed me to post something like this on NUSWhispers but I shall just share my melodrama here.

I just moved into hall accommodation this year as a freshie and fell head over heels in love with a girl at first sight. Yeah, shallow and superficial but I'm 21 so please give me a break.

She is pretty; really pretty in the delicate sort of way, you know, the pale, fragile, doll-like sort. She really stood out during beach day when the glaring sun made her super fair skin glow like a freaking fairy (probably with lots of my self-imposed filters but damn, girl). I didn't even know her type was my type until I saw her. I realized I was always watching her, always noticing her. Like a stalker, yes, but I can't help it. I always watched her throughout camp, during IBG, when I happen to see her during dinner.

The closest encounter I had with her was when she sat somewhat close to my block during dinner and we randomly included her (it was right after orientation camp and everyone was still in overly-friendly mode) when everyone was saying their 'Traffic Light' color. Evergreen. She hasn't dated before and I couldn't believe it. There was certainly some happiness there -- that I could be her special 'first' if I ever grew some balls and talked to her -- but also, a lot of doubt.

I fear I'm not good enough for her. I'd three relationships before and slept around a bit. This girl, on the other hand, would frown in a slightly perplexed and confused manner at whatever sexual jokes we cracked or innuendos we made, whispering to the person next to her and asking for an explanation. She's super pure. If it was an act, it's a good one.

I wish she'd never change, though I know it's impossible. Who am I, anyway, to wish for it? 'Til now, I have yet to even talked to her.

Is it possible to fall so hard in love without ever talking to that person before?
She probably doesn't even know I exist. Even though I've been through three relationships, I don't think I have the faintest clue what love is.

losing a relationship u spent 3 and a half years building.. it makes everything u're doing now so meaningless. it makes everything so painful. it makes everything so empty. its incredibly lonely. this agony is indescribable even after 3 days. 
yet all i can do is force a smile in school while im dying inside. seeing other couples causes my heart to writ in pain.  my life revolved around her. everything i did was for her, or for a future with her. now, im just lost. 
so many things in the relationship i could have done better, and maybe that would have changed something. maybe dat would have kept her by my side. but i didnt. you'll only realise a better alternative after you look back at what you have done.  but it's far too late by then.
she was a unique gem. i'll never be able to find someone like her again. i want so badly to reset everything and try again. why did you have to go..
-
 
it is normal to go for lectures alone right...? i did not join any faculty camp nor am i in hall so i'm largely friendless most of the time. i keep telling myself that this is okay and it is normal university life but looking around i see everyone in their own groups attending lectures together, it just makes me feel even more lonely :(

To ,
I'm a girl who's also interested in girls. However, it's not something I'm open about because I have a bf. I know I am bi, but I have never admitted it to anyone. I wish there was a way whereby I can find a girl who's also interested in "trying out" with another girl. Physically or not. 
-
 
, Im facing quite the opposite problem. I have a bf, but I want more guy friends, because generally guys are pretty fun and cool to hang out with; less drama, less shopping, more Lan gaming/sports and other guy related things. Maybe we should exchange tips :)

Thank you for all your responses.I am the OP of . In what way could we have physical or sexual intimacy yet preserving one's virginity? 
-
 
Need some advice here.. Theres this guy i know whos messaging me good morning daily. Also asks for random meetups. Is he interested in me?
-
 
What is consider as cheating your on partner? So if I am in a steady relationship with my girlfriend and I really love her, I am not allowed to flirt with other girls over text? Is it wrong to flirt with girls over texting? I am not trying to get into other girls pants, I just enjoy conversations and flirting. Shit did the last statement made it worse? Argh so confused now. At least I don't masturbate while thinking of other girls. Wait actually I do... 
-
 
I'm the OP of . In reply to the comment, this is nothing about sexism. Why do you have to make everything about sexism. I mean it both ways, whether you are a girl or a guy. Obviously some people see sex and something more intimate and special that you want to share with someone really special. And if you kept your virginity for that someone special, how would you feel if that person has slept with so many guys or girls, especially if they were casual or fwbs? You want to have sex, and you can go ahead. I'm not saying everyone should be virgins till marriage. But some of us want to be and it would be nice if we found people who were similarly like that. If sex is just about breaking a hymen, then I sure hope I don't end up with a guy like you. And yes, I'm  a girl. 
-
 
I think I'm starting to develop crushes on girls. I'm starting to notice them more and how attractive and sweet looking they are. I think I'm falling for girls. 

How do I come to terms with that? I never thought in my life that I'll ever be gay.

There's this guy friend of mine who is pretty much everything I've been looking for in a long-term partner. The sad part is that he already likes someone else, so I can't even tell him how I feel. Sometimes I wonder if it's possible that he would realise his true feelings are for me and not her...but I know it's just a fantasy as he's not the type who wavers in his affections and he treats me just like a friend.

I know feelings can't be forced and everything...but unrequited love really, really sucks. :(

As a freshman, I was looking forward to finding new friends and meeting old ones from my JC. However, this past week has been nothing but a disappointment. All the guys ever talk about are sexual jokes and other immature things like making fun of the lecturer's accent. It's so hard to concentrate in a lecture when the people around me snicker at every word the lecturer says. 

I faced this issue back in JC too, so I had hoped that 2 years of national service would have made them more mature - but I guess I was wrong. Maybe this is due to the fact that I'm in engineering where majority are guys and tend to act silly with one another.

Anyways currently I have given up on making any new friends through lectures and spend my time alone throughout the whole day. I even sneak into lectures early and pray that none of them ever spot or sit near me. 

Anyone else facing the same issue I am? I do enjoy jokes here and there (especially clever ones) but I cannot seem to tolerate these people. Or am I just an anti-fun person?

I was in lecture today and I noticed a guy in front of me, searching up all the names of his courses' teaching assistants and personally messaging them on Facebook. Is this a thing? Should I do it? But for what?

I'm a freshie and although it's only four days into the semester the experience has not been positive for most parts. I’m always alone most of the time. I have no friends. I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t know how to use the reserved readings in the library. I don't even know where the canteen is. And I keep getting rejected for modules. I’m already paying so much for an education but yet I'm still being controlled as to what I can study. Because of this I have to go to a lecture tomorrow for a module that I chose as a last minute decision just to meet the minimum 18MCs requirement, which I still don't know if I'll get accepted. This would be my second time submitting a appeal. I'll probably be behind everyone else. And I would still have to reshuffle my tutorial slots.

Like as if I don’t have enough on my plate. All this uni drama will just probably make my anxiety worse. I’ve been crying myself to sleep lately. Not to mention that I relapsed again last month. There goes the new year resolution to be clean for a year. Only made it 7 months. 

And there’s this whole thing about sexuality and relationships and stuff. I’m not one to put labels but sometimes I honestly wonder if I’m just not straight or bi (I refuse to use the g word because it has been used as an insult so much that I feel uncomfortable using it). And this has been quite prominent over the course of these few months. I've been trying to figure out if I have legitimate feelings for this particular girl or is it just because I finally found someone who understands, connects and gets along with me so well. I can imagine being in a relationship with her. She is beautiful to me but unfortunately I'm not sexually attracted to her. I never confessed to her. I made the decision not to pursue it further because I feel it's not fair to her and to myself if I can't give all of me to the relationship. By the time I made the decision, I discovered that she found a boyfriend. I still enjoy hanging out with her but sometimes I can't help but think about what might have been. There's also the issue with my parents. They are quite religious and I have tried dropping hints. I'm pretty sure my mum knows what I'm referring to but we never discussed it in particular. I just need a solid indication from them that they'll accept me for who I am. All this time, I feel that they don't know the real me.

This leads me to the issue of being alone. I’d like to think that it’ll happen when the time is right but sometimes I can’t help wondering if I’m really that terrible of a person undeserving of love. Am I really not enough and that repulsive? I feel that it has reached a level where I feel desperate. I even started using those dating apps, which I never saw myself resorting to. But then, sometimes I feel it’s unfair to the other person if I ever get into a relationship, especially with all the personal drama I’m facing and my family problems. The relationship between my mum and dad have been quite rocky since the end of last year.

Idk man, i just needed to get this out of my chest. Sorry for the long post. You know you reached a new low in life when you’re watching adult videos and you’re crying. I have gone for counselling before while I was in ns but I feel that it doesn't help much. Life feels like one problem after another. I have finally came to terms with accepting myself for who I am, which I struggled with so much during my jc days. Now I have to deal with this. When will I ever catch a break and actually enjoy life? One where I actually look forward to the next day?

,  My ex is even worse. He has an abnormally high sex drive. In fact I can't classify him as an ex; I realised he was two-timing me and someone else. At first there was certainly lots of pleasure (we're not responsible for the condoms found on whispers), but as time went by I realised he was using me as an outlet for his sex drive. I regretted helping him in satisfying his sex drive, be it one-on-one and in parties.

Naturally, I broke up with him after a while. Thankfully I managed to assuage him by oralling him much more often (that guy refuses to wear condoms half the time).

I find it quite amusing, however, whenever he post pictures of him and his girlfriend on Facebook and many people will simply just LIKE, LIKE, LIKE the post.

(Admittedly he has a hot body, can sell himself well and maintains himself well, which is perhaps why I committed my folly.)

For the girlfriend of this guy, I hope you'll realise his insatiable desire for sex soon. Then again even on our chats he tells me how much he loves you, but I am very confused.

Is it possible for a guy to friendzone a girl?

If he keeps on referring to her as a close friend, is he trying to bring the friendship to the next level or did I just get friendzoned?
-
 
Sigh, so in a nutshell, this is what happened:

I have been seeing a white guy for the past 1 year. A few days ago, I found out that he has kissed other women since meeting me, and by his own admission, he would have slept with them too had he been more sex-oriented.

Before I go on, I just want to make one thing clear: we were never gf-bf. Because of our age difference and the different stages of life that we're in, we realized after a few months of being together that a proper relationship would never work out.

But... what bothers me is that he was with other women even before we realized that we would never work out as partners. So he was kissing other women and sleeping with me. He went on vacation where he kissed a couple of women (all strangers), and throughout the vacation he was texting me that he missed me etc.

I know men -- and some women too -- are brilliant at compartmentalizing, but how is it possible to be in an intimate relationship and have it mean nothing? I know this wasn't intentional: he had no intention of betraying me. He simply didn't think we were exclusive and that it was okay to "court" me (at that time we hadn't realized that a real relationship wouldn't work) and be with other women too.

This brings me to the following question: what the hell do non-exclusive relationships even mean?

With most Singaporeans (correct me if I'm wrong), if you're sleeping with the person in a non-casual manner, it's already assumed that you're exclusive. If you genuinely care about someone and you're telling them that you miss them etc., and you're actually behaving like you're in a relationship, do the words "be my gf/bf" actually matter?

It seems that with westerners, those words actually mean something. There is no such thing as simply assuming something.

Had I known he was with other women, I would have never ever continued any sort of relation with him.

This was a good, caring man. He wasn't a young, hormonal teenager who just wants to sleep with women. Yet he did this... and somehow he thinks he did nothing wrong.

Is this simply a difference in culture and values? Or am I just overreacting?
-
 
Sometimes, when I look around a notice almost everyone around me is getting attached besides me. I wonder to myself, am I really such a bad choice for others?
-
 
I've liked this guy for over a month now. Our messages to each other have been very casual, rarely flirting in nature. He asked me out for dinner about a week ago and it went pretty well. It was casual too just like he was in messages. I had a great time talking to him and I hope it was mutual. However nothing much has changed since that dinner and while I'm thinking of initiating the second meet-up, I'm scared that I'm misinterpreting that the interest goes both ways and that the dinner meet-up was purely platonic. 
-
 
I think the OP of  has a point. How would you feel if you kept your virginity for that special someone because you wanted it to be special but your partner has had sex with so many other people? I guess if it doesn't matter to you, chances are you have been sleeping around. But i would like to know what virgins feel about this.

Is sexual intimacy a must in relationship? My bf is no longer a virgin, and he said that sexual intimacy is a must before marriage so as to determine if another half will be the one you are marrying in the future as marriage is long term and he does not believe in divorce. How far is this true? Probably he wanted someone who is good in bed to be his wife? I am an inexperience person in relationship and advice is needed.

I was getting ready to go to bed but unknowingly, I landed on SOC FOP youtube channel and I started to watch the old videos and my my my, I was overwhelmed by all the different emotions I was feeling. It wasn't easy for me but I've gained and learned so so much.. I really wanna thank those who were there everytime without fail, and of course big kudos to everyone who participated in SOC FOP in one way or another! #socfamily #loveuguys

I am always good with boys, platonic ones. Relationship,.. Not that good. I'm year 4 and I have a guy best friend since year 1. We definitely friend zone each other since the start. But after recently going on exchange with him and living in the same apartment is making me doubt how well I can sustain this friendzoneship. Being able to live and match someone's lifestyle is just so amazing, yknow. People always tell me guys can never friendzone but I think this doesn't apply to him? Guys, please enlighten girls.

I recently broke up with my boyfriend since secondary school. It was a wonderful journey that ended peacefully. Despite the inevitable ending, he's left a huge gaping hole in my life. Years of companionship makes living alone extremely difficult. I'm blessed with caring friends who have been nothing but supportive and kind. As much as I appreciate their care and efforts to cheer me up, deep down I feel so so so dead. There are a million things on my to-do list, many hobbies to distract me, many people willing to spend time with me, many new potential romantic interests making their advances but nothing makes things better. The effects of escapism have subsided and all I have strength for is to stare at the ceiling, lying lifelessly on the floor.

I miss you. I miss us. I still love you, so deeply. I know I'll move on eventually and maybe find someone that's almost as compatible with me as you. I know sooner or later, I'll gather my strength to walk out of this desperation. But for now, allow me to indulge myself in this seemingly endless lethargy and sadness.

And the sixth, i finally admit, I have fucked up more than a little.

Thanks for reading.

To the OP of  you are not alone man. My ex has a worse addiction. He plays hand phone games all day long (etc brave frontiers). I'm fine with him playing on our date but slowly I began to feel as if my presence did not matter anymore. He plays while waiting for the food to come. He plays while waiting for the bus to come. As long as his both hands are free, he will play. Am I that boring to that extent? What's the point of dating when you just want to play? I tried my best to entertain you, to dress nicely for your date and you just give me this kind of attitude. But, anyway, rant over, my point is just tell him upfront that you felt ignored. If he changes, then that's good. Otherwise, just let him be a 'hi-and-bye' bro (in my case, I gave up on my relationship altogether).

I am a Chinese girl and I had a crush on this Indian guy at orientation. He had this air of confidence around him and he spoke very crisp English. I kept dropping hints that I liked him, but unfortunately he created a rule in our hall that we cannot date people from our hall group.

so im back in school now. its so much harder to force a smile when i meet people. here i am, still waiting for an answer, dying so badly inside but yet, i smile.
i cant concentrate in my lessons. i just hear noise around me, nothing really feels like it matters anymore..i just keep thinking abt her. thinking abt all my regrets..thinking abt how she would be spending her time with another guy frm her office now..
i feel so much like crying. but i have to hold it back in while in sch. so many times, tears just welled up in my eyes during lesson and i had to rush to de toilet before anyone sees it.

im not strong like people think i am. im just a weak human. weak to my emotions. i cant let go of her. but i know she's gone..

replies told me to talk to her. i wish i could too. i wish i could pour everything out on her and let her know how i feel. but she's been ignoring me, ignorning my messages, its like i dont even matter to her anymore.

I was 18 when I broke up with my long distance boyfriend of close to 2 years. I thought things between us would work out but sadly, it didn't. He cheated on me with another girl in his school and it left me heartbroken. Being upset and irrational, I started dating another guy friend that I had known for a few years after he confessed to me that he liked me. He too had just broken up with his girlfriend, and I suppose we both took each other as rebounds. 

On the second day, he came to fetch me from work and send me home. Things between us seemed fine, until the next day. He came to fetch me from work again, and when we were in the lift, he tried to touch me while we were kissing. I refused and pushed his hands away. But after a while he tried his luck again, but good thing I still had my senses about me and pushed him away again. After this time, I stepped away from him and rushed home by myself. Later that night, he texted me to break up with me. The incident was a traumatic experience that haunted me for a few months, before I finally managed to step out of it with the help of a close friend. From then on, I realised how stupid I had been to get into a rebound relationship without realising its potential to hurt me. 

Thankfully, I was glad that later in life I found someone who truly loved me for who I am. He was the close friend that helped me overcome the trauma. We have been dating for more than a year now and I am living in bliss. He made me recover my confidence in love and I am truly grateful that he came into my life.

To all out there, I hope that no matter what happens in your life, never lose hope.

to 

op of the broken relationship..

i can only say, both of you need to learn how to listen to each other, and not just hear. look at each other, not just glance. speak with each other, not just talk. connect with each other, not just meet.

i got too comfortable with my relationship. both of us stopped doing things we used to. that was the bane of my relationship.
please do not let that happen to yours too.

after getting in this relationship. i now understand that there is no such thing as a perfect partner. she was never my ideal body type, she did not have an ideal face. but yet, she is still the only want i want in my life. because we've been through so much together, we've always worked things out together. we were there for each other. its really the little things that we do for each other that really matters.

but i screwed my relationship up. and now i have no idea how to fix it anymore no matter how much i want to..so please. work things out with your partner. treasure each other. please do not let a third party ruin the things you two share..

if u need to end things. end it because both of you agree that there is nothing left between you two..please. do not end it because of someone else..

Is it possible to like someone without being physically attracted to the person? I met many great guys whom I like a lot and even considered to be in a relationship with them, but I'm just not physically attracted to them. And before comments come in to say I may be a les (because I'm sure there are some to think this way), no I'm not, because I kissed a girl and I didn't like it. It just seems as if I love people's personalities and characters but not so much of the physical features, and if I'm not physically attracted to them, then there can't be any intimacy in the relationship, right?.

I think people who spends a lot of time on Tinder are damn desperate la. Do you have a friend that uses Tinder like normal people use whatsapp? Wah seh my friend ah, he uses Tinder every day, every minute leh. Buay tahan. I mean I also use Tinder la but I don't use it everyday. In fact, probably like twice a week that kind? But my friend ah.. 
I mean I have no problem with him using Tinder but don't spend so much time on it to the extend that your friendships get compromised la. He already doesn't have that many friends, and I doubt he can call anyone a best friend (like a confidante). Although I feel that I am close to him, I feel that I am drifting away, kinda? I don't know how to tell him without offending him but he really spends A LOT of time on Tinder. Like I feel I don't have a space in his life anymore.. or maybe he only finds me when he needs something.
I just don't understand how someone is willing to invest their time and effort and energy on strangers (let's be real la hor, Tinder people are just strangers) instead of on his friends. Like if I ask him to hang out he will always say he's busy or something.. I don't know. I also think he only goes to his friends when he needs something. Other than that, he will go out with anyone who matches on Tinder. 
Sigh I'm actually kinda sad. So people reading this, don't forsake your friends because of Tinder. Friends will stand by you through thick and thin but Tinder mates will only stick when your dick is thick... oh.. I doubt he has a good tool anyway. whatever.

I feel so untalented. No musical background, not good at sports, doing badly for my academics. I wasted my time away during the holidays by slacking at home, with no one to go out with. When my friends ask for help about a previous module which I took, I will dash to flip through my notes and search online before giving them the answer and pretending that I remembered what I had learned. I feel even more stupid than pre A-level period, as I cannot even help my younger sibling without checking the internet. I am desperate to make new friends, yet I dare not talk to strangers in case they give me weird looks. I feel like everyone is staring at me when I eat lunch alone because my pathetic small circle of friends happen to have lessons. I spend my time hiding in the library, or walking long detours around campus so that time would hopefully pass faster. Why is my life like this? Why can't I take the first step to change it?

Hi Guys from NUS. Leave my GF alone.
Actually, it is kind of interesting to hear stories from her on all your advances ... the hilarious pick up lines and attempts to sit next to her during lecture to make small talks.
So perhaps ... I should actually say "keep it coming"!

Amused bf from another Uni

 sounds weird but i was in a very similar position as you a few years ago. What did i do? I went with the other boy instead. 

What i did was i really thought long and hard about my future with thenbf and really it was going nowhere. Also, i found out later on that the lack of contact wasn't because he was busy. He had time for other people and other girls but i was not a priority. Red flag right there so i broke it off (yes during his NS as well). 

Maybe give yourself some time to think things through and whether or not you want to keep the relationship. Your friends saying you deserve better may have a point, you know. Coz they may see something you're too blind to see at this moment. 

With that being said, if you do choose to break up with bf after thinking it through, dont immediately get with other guy k. He seems like a nice guy he shouldn't be your rebound. Ask him for some time. At the same time, you can test out his character too. 

All the best and take care! You may feel very stressed right now but in time, you will look back on this and find it pretty amusing. (:

Hi 

I'm feel the same as you, only difference is that I attended a couple of camps and I stay on campus residential hall. Although quantitative speaking I have plenty of friends from different groups to grab lunch, I actually feel comfortable when I'm alone.

Whenever I'm eating alone in comm hall I would be welcoming to anyone who joins in for meals. Deep inside, I would prefer them sitting elsewhere and give me some alone time.

So to OP, yes you are not alone regardless whether you go for orientations of staying on campus.

Anyone went from a CAP 3.4 at the end of year 1, to a 4-4.5 by the end of year 3? Really hope to pull my CAP up but dont know if it's possible.:(  Played too much in hall i'm regretting it.

PS: Long message + my GP grade is D. There's a tldr section below :x

To 

When I read your post, it hit me right in my heart. I am now lifeless and sad around my boyfriend of 2 years. 

Things have been well. Conflicts were minimal; I could even count it with a hand. However, we began to talk lesser and lesser as we were busy with our own lives. We always made excuses of "oh, I don't want to disturb you cos i thought you're busy", etc. etc. Initially, I loved how considerate he was as I was really having a hard time juggling between hall activities and school work. However, little did I know that it would meant that good morning and good night messages would cease. Little did I know that random pokes and messages of love would slowly appearing on my phone screen. I know that he is busy with his NS duties, and that reception sucks in red zone areas, but I missed him so much. I feel so unloved and neglected when days could go by when there's little to no messages were received. I know I should also take the initiative to talk to him daily, and I did try (and I felt like I was being a nuisance instead). I've talked to him about these and... no actions were taken. 

Our relationship hasn't even reached a peak yet and the fizzle is already gone. Holding of hands and hugs were initiated by me. And that's it. Our relationship is so... clean and pure. I feel like we are just confused close friends with no lines were crossed. I've talked to him about it and I always ask him to be physical with me but he doesn't want to. (cos he says he is shy. :( ) I got so frustrated that I decided to conduct a little test. I stopped holding his hand. I stopped hugging him. We have not done these... for maybe 7 months already? He didn't even say a thing. And I grew more frustrated and desperate.

Anyways, this story continues on where one of my close guy friend confessed to me and I'm feeling so lost right now. 
Firstly, I don't want to break up with shyboyfriend_01 to go with anotherboy_02. I feel like I'm committing a sin each time I talk to anotherboy_02, cos I feel happy with the latter. I feel like I'm cheating on shyboyfriend_01. anotherboy_02 said he'll wait for me to settle my relationship as he knew about the situation and that he has been looking for a girl like me cos we just click so well. (T.T so touched but I also dk if he is the one for me.)

Secondly, I want to be there for shyboyfriend_01 through his NS life and help him integrate into university life better. The idea of breaking up with me scares me as I seriously don't want him to be sad. I don't want to be the cause of him being sad. 

Lastly, I feel very irritated about this as friends who knew of the situation are all pushing for a break-up. They said he isn't the guy for me, our personalities clash, I deserve someone better. But, the heart wants want it wants... I liked him and he liked me. It's just that this relationship is dying and none of us are taking any actions. 

In conclusion, to , i'm just offering you my side of my story cos I feel like I'm acting like your current gf now. I know it might not offer much condolence, but do know that you're not suffering in this alone. I don't know what to do if I lose him, and I don't know what to do to keep him. Sometimes, I think you just need to take a break and think about what you really want in life. Talk to her about this. If she decided to make a change for you, then put in effort and allow your love to rekindle. If not, I guess you're just another lost soul like me. 

Cheers and jiayou mkay? 

tldr:
Right now, i'm lost as fk and idk what to do and I feel damn sian. my mental state is damn screwed cos of being in a r/s. 
shit die me. Idk if i shld just to go single and appreciate having all the time to myself.

and thanks to whoever is reading this and offering a constructive advice/feedback. Virtual cupcakes and delicious cookies to you.

Few years ago, ehen I was a freshie, I was unpopular since I was the stereotypical geeky kid, with only academic smarts as my only plus point. Everything else (looks, EQ, etc.), and I let a female friend leech off my work in NUS because I mistakenly thought she would grow to like me the more I helped her. In the end she got attached to some other guy and I at least had the sense to recognise that I was being used and break off contact with her.

Now, she's apparently been dumped and distraught and is trying to look for me for comfort and schoolwork help again. I bluntly told her I couldn't because my (current) girlfriend would be unhappy. Is it bad that I'm secretly feeling sadistically happy watching how things turned out (well for me and terrible for her) in the end for the both of us?
-
 
TLDR: girl flirted with me few months back and hinted that she's interested in me. Got me really shy and scare to talk to her(I like her too). I am fine with other girls. Then she started to stop all the teasing/flirting and I found it much easier to talk to her and I feel slightly more comfortable around her. Just spend a wonderful evening with her yesterday. Just feeling happy today. Always have been hating myself for being shy. But the more I think about it, the more I feel that shy guys are really cute haha. Maybe if I am a girl I will also be attracted to a cute shy guy. We are pretty adorable lol

my relationship is crumbling. and all i can do is sit here and wait pathetically until she gives an answer. But it already feels like she's gone. her heart is with someone else. 

i only did my best for her. but it wasnt enough. i only wanted to love her, shower her with care, concern and security. i wanted her to feel safe in my arms. i wanted a future together with her. she was everything to me. But now im losing her. and there is nothing i can do now but wait for my death sentence when she makes up her mind. but yet, i dun feel any hate or blame. im just feeling incredibly sad, nothing like ive ever felt before. i just wish i could have done more for her. i just wish i could have been a better person to prevent this from happening. 
but i didnt. while i had her, i only focus on what she wasnt doing for me, and i was blind to what she was already doing. i really wish i could turn back time and redeem myself. i dont want this to end. but i have no idea what to do anymore. her eyes were cold when she told me her feelings were with someone else. i cried frantically and begged her to stay. i didnt know what else to do. i feel so much regret now. regret that i was such a blind person. regret that i didnt do more when i could have. and regret that ive only realised this when its too late. 
ill be getting an answer from her in 6 days time. its only been less than 24 hours. but its the longest ive ever felt it drag. i just cant let go of her, of this relationship. im dying inside. i want to fix this, i want to love and be loved. 
its driving me insane. i do not know how i can carry on my life without her. people tell me i just need to move on, find someone else. but i dont know how to anymore. its been too long. too long since ive had any proper interaction with other girls. she was the only one i cared about and had my eyes for. but if she's gone, i realise that my life is empty. everything i did and had revolved around her.

if she's gone, then theres nothing for me to live for anymore. call me weak and stupid, but she was all i ever had, the only one that ever loved me truly.
if she's gone. i want to go too.

He is so cool, and i am not. He has a lot friends and face no problems making new friends, and i am just a geek and shy person who likes to stay in the room--although i have few friends too.
And this two things happen me and him. I can't deal with the differences, I feel like i am not good enough for him. Besides, i need to adjust with his lifestyle--partying,drunk,cool kids. I mean I love him, but isn't it too much for me? I am just a geek. But i can't let him go. But picturing that he could get anyone he wants is too depressing for me.
-
 
There's a girl in my course and it's quite obvious she likes me. She asked me out for movie once, and a few more times for meals. But I'm still not feeling it, and sometimes I think I'll say yes if she just put in more effort and pop the question. My friends think I'm being an asshole but I think they are just fucking sexist. What this illustrates, I think, is the perpetuation of paternalistic gendered ideas about love and gender interaction; and for you who may be reading this, I'm still waiting for the question. 
-
 
I want you to know that I liked you since the very first day we met in class. Your strange haircut captured my attention, your thought provoking questions developed my interest for you, and our shared activities and interests fueled my hope of becoming your girlfriend one day. Nonetheless, I knew it would hardly be possible; not because you were taken or you liked someone else, not because of the ethnic difference but because of the fact that I was an exchange student for a short period and eventually I had to leave Singapore. The distance has played its role, we hardly talk now but I am still trying hard to not to think of you… I do know it is over; it ended even before it started. But I want you to know that I will come back for a better start  :)

@  Are you working in finance/business? The same thing happened to me and a lot of my peers the last time. It seems to be pretty common in this line of work. The big shots keep hitting on the new girls, and the girls can't seem to resist the allure. I don't blame them though, now that I am sort of a big shot myself the new girls seem to be incredibly receptive to my advances. I think girls who join the finance/business sector will be of a certain stock (at least i treat them like this until proven otherwise). I personally restrict my interaction with them to flings.

A shoutout to that girl taking ST4231 & ST4233: its our final year and i still dont get the chance to talk to you. but nevermind, it still brightens up my day when i see your smile

Its really difficult being fat. I'm not exaggerating. I have been big and I went to lose weight and over a period, the weight loss stopped. I do not have much friends. I turn to food for solance but that became my poison. It doesnt help that I am an introvert as well. I am really fed up and tired of this.

Anyone here in a long distance relationship for longer than 2 years? All my friends are not and they don't understand the struggles I am going through. How do you always keep it fun and exciting and how do you celebrate anniversaries? I'm feeling sad now because I love the person so much but I can feel us slowly growing apart. This hurts like hell.

Just wondering, what is the common consensus on "personal space"? By that, I mean the physical distance another person can be from someone of the opposite gender before it's awkward. Recently there's been this female coursemate (I'm a guy) I'm on good terms with but not THAT close to who would lean over to read the notes/documents I'm reading on a device such that we would be shoulder to shoulder, and our faces around 10-15cm away (or less, I didn't dare to turn and look). It happened on many occasions and she does seem very comfortable with staring at the screens for quite a few minutes while maintaining physical contact. To better understand my situation, I tried to adjust her hair when it was caught by something she casually slung over her neck, and she didn't seem to flinch or react. Not sure if that was helpful in confirming anything though. I haven't been able to observe if she does all that with other guys as well so there isn't some form of comparison I can make. Being an evergreen raised in a rather traditional family, with a conservative mindset, all that felt unnatural to me. Maybe I'm just too socially unaware/awkward to evaluate the situation through my dense skull and sleep deprived brain.

I read  and it reminds me of my own situation. I'm a guy and I no longer feel sexually attracted to my gf. We have been in this relationship for 3 years. At first the sex was good, then it faded. I no longer want it anymore. When my gf initiates it, I reject at times, or I just go with it - but not enjoying it. Other than that, everything else is absolutely normal. To say that the difference between a platonic and a romantic relationship is sex is a massive oversimplification. This is a difficult topic for me to confess to friends, or to even discuss with her. I am troubled :(

I'm a Freshie who've never attended any orientation activities, a guy in a faculty where females form the majority.

So far, I've been having my meals alone, going to lectures alone,  spending the bulk of my time studying in the function room or watching a movie. 

I've never spent so much time alone, much less not speaking a word for days. Surprisingly, I did not feel lonely. I felt rejuvenated at the end of the week. 

I'd more time to organize my thoughts and rethink my purpose in life. I may sound like a loser saying this, but I'd realized that being alone doesn't mean you're lonely. We're never alone in being alone. And we can still be lonely even amongst friends. As much as there's a need for social acceptance, there's no purpose in gaining the world and losing yourself. 

Right now, I'll just have to add weights to balance the scale. Ash did not met Misty and Brock when he first started.

Does NUS have some app where u can meet fellow NUS people online. Something like Tinder.

 You could try dropping a hint like this.

Recently I concluded that some people will only befriend those of the opposite sex whom they are attracted to and would not mind being sexually intimate :/ 
I suspect some guys befriend because they have an ulterior motive of making the girl fall in love with him one day and if this does not work out the next best thing they can do is to be her friend. Just confused now as to whether the male-female friendships I see are even genuine and doubt my guy friends.
I feel like I'm overreacting if its such a normal thing but makes me worry and feel sad should I become attached in the future if my boyfriend is very close to his female friends because of possible past feelings and flirtations. 
However I suppose since I'm still evergreen and have been considering a relationship I need to find more male "friends". I can see that it is necessary to keep meeting many people who would be my options but deep down I wish I would just meet my first boyfriend soon and he would be the one so I would not have to flirt around, it makes me uncomfortable probably due to my quiet nature :'(

-
 
Do you have any advice on how I can find someone in NUS? i only know her name, nothing more. but i met her one day and before i had the chance to talk to her she had already gone. i tried going to common places like central lib and utown but i cant find her because there are so many people. also tried googling. nothing. please help?

I wish i could have someone to have kinky escapades with me all over school. It would be so damn fun. The thrilll of trying not to get caught (;

i get reeeeeaaaaaaaalllllllly really really really turned on when my boyfriend kisses me on my ear or just light nibbles on it. or neck. but my ear is really sensitive especially when he kisses my ear when he is hugging me from the back.

To 

I read your confession just yesterday, and I know how you feel, honestly I do. IWhen I joined NUS, I decided I had to join a club/group otherwise I wouldn't get the "full Uni experience", and jusst like you, I have really bad confidence issues and social anxiety. I love music, but I'm too afraid to sing in front of people, no matter who they are. I can't even sing in front of my family or friends once I'm handed a mic. 

When I attended my year's SLF, I remember thinking that I was never going to go back to what I did through sec school & JC, no matter how much I loved it. Instead, I told myself I'd try for a club that I had to sing in. Ever since young, my family's been telling me that I can't sing, as compared to my siblings who sing really well, but I decided heck it I'll try anyway. Nothing ventured, nothing gained right? At the very least, I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone and try something I really, really enjoyed but never had the guts to try. Isn't that what being in university's about? 

So I did. I auditioned for several groups, one of which was Resonance, the others I shan't disclose. Let me tell you, walking into the audition rooms, I was so afraid, I was shaking like a leaf. I started my song on the wrong note and tried my best not to forget the lyrics, and was so relieved just to finish singing. When they asked me to follow the short tunes they played on the piano, I was so afraid of hitting the high notes that I kept shaking my head and going "I can't do it", but all the panel did was smile and encourage me, telling me "no no it's good! Just try!" When I did hit the notes, they smiled and one guy told me "See! You can do it, it was good!" Everyone was so encouraging and it was honestly such a confidence booster just knowing that I voluntarily walked in, finished an audition, and while I certainly didn't nail it, me not breaking down and crying in the middle of the audition was a win in and of itself.

I got into one of those groups, and the people there are extremely encouraging. I know I'm not the best singer, so I work really hard to prove myself, and everyone wrong. I'm not a fast learner, and I'm not all too talented but I try my best, I have fun, and I've had zero regrets. I only want to improve myself, and hopefully day by day, I'll get better at singing, at being on stage, and I won't be so afraid, even if it's a slow process. 

Try new things you'd never thought you could do, and try the things you always wanted to but never could bring yourself to. Trust me when I say that if you try, you won't regret it. There's honestly nothing to lose, and no one is going to laugh at you. In the worst case scenario, you don't get it. So what? Audition for something else. Come back next year and audition again. There's really no issue. In the best case scenario, you try something new, you find something you enjoy, and you make great friends who will learn and grow alongside you. Friends you can smile at across the stage and feel reassured by. 

I guess, at the very least, I want you to know this: that someone somewhere on campus is rooting for you, if not for you to get into Resonance, then at least for you to find something you enjoy doing. Please go for the audition, do it for yourself. I wish you all the best.

I was with my PHD friend and till now he was still unable to find a work, so to me I think "Is education everything to me" when I was young till now I was rank on the few top in cohort. But realize I was still inexperience at working compared to those who started worked in their younger days like a diploma. I find myself totally a useless, only know study but cannot work. What can I do?

Throughout my entire school life I never thought that I would fall in love, because I always thought I was different from others. Since primary school I was the girl who was always teased. I was never a pretty, funny or smart person, and because of this I was always left out of the "cool" cliques. But I gradually became okay with that, I had friends that I could hang out with when I needed to and I gradually became okay with being alone and being excluded. When I wasnt in school or with friends, being alone became a time of peace and reflection instead of sadness and loneliness.
So I thought: "Its okay if I don't find anyone who likes me, because im okay with myself", and I became the kind of girl who listens instead of talks, who never becomes emotionally affected by anything to the point she's the one who can give sound advice and support to her friends who need it. A person who listens to your drama but never has her own.

But when I was in JC I met someone, and didnt realise I was starting to fall for him until we were nearing As. At the point in time my results were really bad, so I decided to focus on studies and not let my emotions get the better of me, and I waited for the feelings to pass. But they didnt, and sometimes I would cry myself to sleep because I was so afraid of falling in love and was at a loss of what to do.

After our exams we planned a meet up together with some friends, and after months of praying I decided to use this opportunity to confess. I was a quiet and shy person, so all that I could muster was a letter. And usually its the guy who confesses but I was just like "heck it, I want to say this to him too much to care"

But we had dinner that night, and before I passed him the letter he told us that he'd confessed to someone else. She was someone from our school and the many times I walked by the both of them when they were studying together, it never occurred to me that they were more than friends.

And the ache in my heart at that point in time was indescribable, because before I even gave him the letter I got my answer, rejection before I even confessed. All this time I was in love was so painful, but at least I could imagine about us being together, and think about not being alone anymore.

I've been trying to forget, but its so difficult to let go. Because he's really one in a million, and unlike anyone I'd ever met before. And also because it was the first time I fell hard for anyone.

I havent met him since that dinner we had, him being in NS and me in uni has put distance between us. After awhile I thought my feelings for him had waned, and I told myself to treat it like a passing crush. But he recently posted a photo of him and the girl he liked, together at OCS social night, and all the ache suddenly just came back all at once and I cried for the first time ever since I told myself that I would let go.

Im not really smart or witty or pretty like she is, neither am I super kind or driven like him. Im nowhere, and until I fell in love I was okay with that, just being me. Now, after everything, im not really sure anymore.
-
 
How do I react when my friends talk about how hot and cute a guy is, and if I would date a guy like that, when I do not find guys attractive at all. I'm a girl and I think I like girls but I don't think my friends would understand. 

I'm not really sure myself so I'm not coming out to anybody yet but I feel so trapped sometimes, like I need to act and put up a front in front of everybody. It takes a toll on my sometimes. 

Any advice?
-
 
I am an evergreen and I realized through many past posts on NUSWhispers that guys often 'pick up hints' before making a move. Will there be someone who is kind enough to tell me how to drop hints to show my interest because I am just too timid to confess my feelings! The struggle of an introvert....
-
 
So I finally crossed paths with my ex at my workplace after 3 years. Since we parted ways I've always wondered how I would react to her reappearance again. All I did, quite pathetically, was tapped on her shoulder and uttered a measly "hi". Even as I walked away, my heart was pounding frantically, as if back to the first time we met after my fateful confession.

She was my first love and every shade the dream girlfriend as a teenager I yearned to have. We were also our class' model couple, and received heaps of marriage invitations as if everyone expected us to pull it off eventually. We were also inseparable throughout secondary school and JC; she was there through the lowest points in my life, and so was I for hers. But as it turned out, we grew apart and ultimately went our separate ways.

As far as I know, she's relishing a life of familial bliss now, married and happily raising a son - a future we had once envisioned as a couple. To be honest, I'm just a tad little envious, but mostly happy that she realised her dream. As of me, it has been a rough journey since 3 years ago. The gaping hole that she left behind remains to be filled. There is this girl I met in CCA that caught my attention, but for reasons unbeknownst even to myself I haven't been able to summon enough courage to even strike up a conversation with her, much less start a new relationship. Once bitten, twice shy, perhaps?

To all budding, first-time couples out there: don't be afraid to devote your all in a relationship. Even if it doesn't work out in the end, you would have written a exhilarating chapter in your life - that of first love. There will be countless regrets, and I dare say, they are even inevitable. But the one thing not matched by subsequent relationships is the naive, innocent and pure romanticisation of love; a signpost you will look back later for guidance as you try to navigate romance in the harsh, real world.

To P, I'm thankful for everything. Really.

Why do people have fwbs? My partner has had one in the past and it's something I can't seem to get off my mind.

i cant even tell if my gf of 3 yrs loves me anymore.
her eyes seems dead when she looks at me now. she never liked being physical with me, and now its only getting worse. 

i dont know what im gg to do if i end up losing her..but i dont know what i should do to keep her either..
-
 
To ,  I'm a girl and I was working on my dating resume too, like you. I cooked and baked a lot, ran to keep fit, did well in school and stuff like music etc. But the thing is, once I got attached, I realise that although all these things matter, they're 'extras' or 'bonuses' because your other half shouldn't love you for your resume :) that will reduce to pressure on trying to be perfect too!
-
 
op of 

she just dropped it on me today. she confessed dat she has feelings for another guy in her office. she doesnt feel for me anymore..
its so sudden n dramatic, probably no one is gg to believe me. 
im at a loss now..what should i do from now on..
-
 
Today I've realized I made a huge mistake on something work-related. It's nothing unforgivable, but I still feel very incompetent and I know that from here on out, people will undermine and judge my ability, and I know I can never make up for it. It could be because I was taking on more than what I could, but that is no excuse for the mistake and the incompetency. Maybe I'm really just a pretty face with no substance and that makes me very sad, because I rather be a smart person with average looks, than be a pretty person with no real substance.
-
 
For as long as I can remember having friends, I can remember nobody being really excited or happy to meet me. It's the same regardless of whether it's a one-to-one meet up or group meet ups. Sometimes in the group meet ups I wonder why I'm even there, because I speak maybe only 1% of the time. My opinion is usually moot when it comes to meal or movie choices.

For groups of friends who haven't met in a long time, I'd be the one who proposes a date and venue and initiate the whole idea, but usually I'll be the one who gets spoken to the least and nobody seems to really care when I say something related to their current topic..

I'm single and friends are the only social life I have. But despite this, there's nobody that I talk to frequently and I think even if an accident or mishap happened to me, nobody would know, much less care..

I'm not very talkative or outgoing. 
I'm not good-looking or interesting. 
I'm just as average as average can get. I don't see anything changing in my years ahead, because I don't know how to and I don't think I can face the failure if I tried and nothing worked.
-
 
I'm evergreen and have been working on my 'boyfriend resume' for years. Learned to play musical instrument and served NS with pride. Met a girl and talked a bit but didn't mention my 'resume'. Didn't get the right signals so didn't ask her on a date. 

It's not that I'm not desperate. I guess the talking part and giving the impression of a sincere gentleman is more important than anything else. I tried to be interesting by telling jokes but I wonder... Would presenting my 'resume' change anything?

At least, I have genuinely liked doing all these :)
-
 
 There's two side of argument to this. Actually i do not think other girls dislike a girl just because she is pretty. If that's the case, how does it happen that pretty girls are usually the popular ones, with many friends (whether guys or girls)?

But then again it may still be possible other girls may still stay away from the pretty girl as they may feel a little uncomfortable when guys seems more interested in the pretty girl from the group instead of others, a bit like a competition kind of things. 

But then again i am not too sure if the 2nd theory holds true so readers, what do you all think? 
-
 
How long does it take for a person to determine if another party has dating potential? I have always thought that most relationships begin after 2 people become friends and get to know each other better...but it seems like friendships usually just stay platonic (aka friendzone) if nothing happens after a certain period of time. Is it true that as more time passes, it becomes unlikely that the friendship will evolve into a romantic relationship? 
-
 
Ok with regards to texts and whatsapp, I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this and that I over-think a lot, or do other people have experienced it or have this thought before with their friends. Have you ever texted somebody and try to not be the person to have the last say? Like it's a very sad thing to be the person that is not being replied to. Is this a 'thing' now? I am not that kind of person but I am starting to think that the friend that I am texting is exhibiting this 'thing'. It's like when I am done with the convo (which means there's nothing else to talk about) or when his text doesn't warrant a reply, this friend will just ask another random question, which I will answer, and he won't reply anymore. This happens on EVERY convo we had. Sometimes, he will chat on snapchat instead (which is super strange), and I am guessing that he uses it because messages/replies are not retained; helping him to not feel that he is not being replied to. This might be weird but I'm a psych major and I just want to know if this is actually a thing that people deliberately do. 
-
 
Girls do go for looks as much as guys do. You don't get to know a person without even a single date materialising.
-
 
So I was in a bus to work where I met this guy from school who followed me and asked whether we could be friends. We talked and walked a little and I told him I had a bf, therefore ending whatever hopes he had since i didnt want to play with his feelings. Sometimes when I quarrel with my bf inevitably i feel regret that i didnt get to give away my number to the bus guy and now I keep thinking about the what ifs that could have happened.  
-
 
Ever since year 1 I have been noticing this girl in my cohort. But I didn't have any luck in getting to know her in that year. Fast forward to last semester we somehow managed to become lab group mates. I was thrilled at the opportunity to know her better. But however being the 21 years old evergreen, nervous wreck that I am, I didn't have the courage to even ask her out for lunch. Day after day, week after week, I have been planning the perfect phrase in order to impress her to date her, but nothing ever came out of my mouth. This continued until the end of the semester. After which, we lost contact due to the fact that we met up for no reason apart from lab work.

During summer I have gone through some soul searching, in hope to become more confident so I could finally get a date with her. And thus I began to message her last week, and I basically asked her out like just now. And guess what she said? 

She has a boyfriend.

..I got killed so hard I died to my death

One of the worst feelings to ever experience, is to have someone walk out of your life like you don't matter anymore.
They leave you to pick up your shattered life alone, accompanied only by the memories of their broken promises. 
It is often said that time heals all wounds; heal me please.

As a Year 3 with a 2.9 CAP, I don't think it's possible for me to qualify for honors anymore and honestly, it never fails to make me feel so insignificant and small. I know my parents have high hopes for me and the idea of letting them down is.. Just devastating.
-
 
While there are many others here desperately wanting to experience a relationship, here i am, feeling jaded from all the relationships i've had, feeling jaded from the relationship i'm currently in. I feel nothing regards to love and romance stirs me like it used to anymore. When i see people gushing over sweet marriage proposals, i feel nothing. When i see people post happy photos of them with their significant other, i feel slightly cynical and empty. 

I have no idea when I started feeling this way. Maybe it was when my latest ex whom I loved so deeply, shattered my beliefs of love when he chose to walk away. Maybe it was when i noticed that my current bf has been giving up on the relationship. Maybe it was when I started to give up on myself, give up on the fact that I'm actually capable of loving someone right and in receiving love.
-
 
I never invite friends over because I don't want to reveal to them that my parents are divorced. I don't even know why I feel this way. It's definitely hindering me from developing relationships with girls because of my inherent distrust of marriage and my unconventional skeleton in the closet. To date, only 3 people outside of relatives know of my situation. I feel like I've been cheated of life.
-
 
Just want to find a place to share by thought

One of my friend once told me that some time we have to settle for some plain jane.

However, his theory is flawed.

1)Ugly doesn't mean they have a kind heart 
2)A relationship won't work out if you don't like the other party
3)A man care alot about a girl's look because man  are biologically hard wired to like fertile woman and a man can tell alot about a girl's fertility through her look.

This is my theory. Don't settle for just some plain jane. Target those very attractive one. This will make you appear uninterested in those less attractive one which in turn make you to appear less needy in front of them.

Girls don't like needy guy.

Basically, aim for the moon(those attractive one), even if you miss it, you will fall among the star(appearing less needy)

I'm the OP of a really old post  . For the too old din't read, I'm a freshie who liked a fake freshie from camp . I went out to lunch with her quite sometime ago and to be honestly I think she really is the one (: I really want to tell her how I feel but I just don't know how :/ Will she accept someone from a different socioeconomic background from her? What if she think she doesn't wants to date a "junior"? I'm just so scared that it won't work out :( What should I do
-
 
Hi readers, I am a  freshie. I need some advice. I have joined my faculty camp and OWeek during orientation and I'm really glad and thankful to have really nice and easy going people in my OG for both camps. Now that school as started, I find it a little hard to allocate my time so that I can spend time with both groups. And I feel bad for always going with one. I'm afraid that I will drift apart from the other if I spend too much time with one group. I really treasure these people a lot.
Did any seniors had a similar experience? Any advice?
-
 
The guy I like is currently overseas on exchange. We chat over Whatsapp everyday. A few days ago, he got really drunk and drunk dialled me. We just talked about random things. Since we're in different countries, he couldn't possibly be phoning me for a booty call, so, what are the reasons for drunk dialling someone? Guys, would you drunk dial a girl you do not like "that way"? 
-
 
Hi, I am the OP of , wow I didn't expect such nice comments, I always thought that guys will go after those pretty and socialable girls. I usually spend time alone outside lectures, and no one bothers to approach me or sit next to me to study. It's hard to for people to know more about each other when neither bothers to take the first step. So next time if you see a girl studying alone in the sci library, it might be me. I don't mind if you help me by initiating the conversation :)
-
 
I think that there are girls who do not really like me just because I'm pretty. I have seen girls' facial expressions change when they see me or I would catch them giving me dirty looks. I thought it could be because I did something bad but many people have told me that I'm a kind person before so I thought it is less likely to be the case.
I have never voiced this out to anyone before because I'm afraid that I will seem really conceited or delusional and I think some of my friends do not really think I'm pretty anyway. I fear becoming the next Samantha Brick if I ever tell anyone.
However it bothers me as I think that they look out for my flaws and use them as an excuse for disliking me when I actually think that its because they are jealous.
Wondering if this is more common than I think and if anybody else has felt the same way before.

To , I think you'd be interested to know that I take a long time to reply someone's message, and the longest time to reply my crush's messages. When I reply people, I will put in effort in crafting my response which requires time – some may think that this is ridiculous, but I feel that people would appreciate receiving something well thought out, than something that took no more than a second to vomit out. Of course, it does depend on the nature of the question or whatever the other person said, but nevertheless, I am not one who will shoot back a one word reply. 

Furthermore, I am rarely someone who enjoys constant communication through online texting – and by constant, I mean having to reply someone as soon as I receive their message, and them replying almost immediately (and the cycle continues). I find that extremely tiring. I don't want to live a life where it doesn't matter where I physically am, I'm always hooked on my phone replying people's messages. For example, I may be at the Botanic Gardens – I'd want to enjoy the actual nature than to have to engage in a conversation about how beautiful it is with people through texting, to the point where I'm actually there the whole time staring at my phone discussing about how beautiful the place is than actually basking in its beauty.

I feel that some people don't appreciate pauses – or rather, delays – in text conversations enough. Since when has quantity been more important than quality? I know many people will disagree with what I say, but it's okay. You have your own opinions and I have mine. But to say that I'm not interested in my crush purely because of the length of time I take to reply my crush's message is stupid, because that reasoning is too logical and narrow thinking. I understand how it came about though, but I still don't believe that my speed at replying you is a good way to gauge nor is an appropriate determining factor to use to conclude my interest in you, and I think I am a good example of it. 
-
 
Wonder if I'm the only one who feels tiring and even lonely to have friends, especially if you know you're the awkward one? Having to constantly keep up a happy and socially active front so that people won't label you as the "emo/weird" kid. 

It's fun when you're on the high, living the life of an extrovert. But it can get depressing and really, really draining when you burn out. You constantly adjust/ selectively choose what you want to say, just to avoid the awkward "what are you talking about" or "errr okayyy" face. You want friends beyond just talking about work and studies, but it's so tough when maintaining friendships/relationships just doesn't come naturally. 

Human relations is a really complicated and tough problem :(. Guess I better start recharging myself for the new semester.

 Holy shit I thought I was the only one. I spend insane amounts of time stalking my eye candies as well! And my grades are suffering because of that too. 

However I am a little bit guilty as I am currently in a relationship right now. Although I feel that we are quite connected on an emotional level, the physical connection isn't quite there.. Is it weird for me to prefer fantasizing over photos of guys than to have sex with my bf? Could use some advice too here.

Hey to the guys out there, does a female with rough hands turn u off? I have really dry and rough hands and i am really insecure about it :(

It has been about 3 years since I've broken up with my ex-girlfriend. Bout 1 year ago, I tried going after a girl but she was so materialistic that it turned both my heads off. 

Most probably it's just me but I find it really difficult to find a girlfriend in the working world. 

Treasure your time in NUS my fellow juniors. I'd love to know some of you guys or girls (I'm straight) if I could.

Sometimes, especially after an extreme high or low point, I do think about suicide and how useless a person I am. But currently I'm more scared of physical pain and hurting/ disappointing others than I am scared of life. But I fear one day I might be hit with something which makes me overcome that fear. #LateNightThoughts
-
 
to  I really agree with you. IMHO the thing holding back more discussions and more sharing of juicy stuff is the lack of anonymity for those trying to reply to posts. For example, a confessor may ask for some advice with sex or masturbation, but obviously very few people have the courage to reply to such posts, and many of these posts end up becoming very one-sided.

Well I get it, it is a place to confess after all, but it could have been much more, you know?
-
 
I wish everyone here asking for advice because their crush takes too long to reply, or gives one-word replies to their messages would read this article: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7936736

He/she just isn't all that interested in you. Move on.

Hi everyone,

Would you happen to know more private areas in school (NUH included) to shower and change apart from SRC/U-Town? Am thinking to cycle to and from school!

Hey guys, will you be ok with an introverted girl who will only spend time with you during school hours and maybe weekends? She will prefer going home alone so that she can have some 'alone' time, and don't expect her to respond enthusiastically if you ask her out. Planning for dates ahead is a must, as she does not like last-minute stuff that ruins her schedule. However, she has good points too. She will be super loyal to you and listen to your problems. She comforts you through her actions instead of words. She can help you with your studies too. Would you want a gf like that?

I was contemplating on joining NUS Resonance but I'm just afraid of being judged during auditions. I guess that's what low self-confidence does to a person. 

PS, is NUS Resonance and CAC Voices the only CCAs that deals with music? I like playing the guitar and singing occasionally, even though I must admit, I'm not that good.

In the early days of 2014, I met you at Mink. We started dating and I gradually fell for you. You were different. You stood out from the crowd. You were beautiful and smart. Guys wanted to be with you, girls wanted to be you. 

We would have worked out but for my inherent insecurities. I was an ordinary boy and you were the popular girl, the one that won the hearts of many pageant guys alike. Despite your evident effort, I couldn't believe that you were serious. I'm sorry that I did not give us a shot because of my fear. My fear of you realizing how out of my league you are. 

Now that you have graduated (and attached), I hope that you'll live a good life and marry well. I love you, I always had. Take care

To what extend can you trust a "stirred" rumor? I have no idea. Since I have entered uni, there have been several cases of guys being stirred and teased together with me by their own friends but yet somehow there is no outcome. As in reality I am a really shy and introverted person, and I do not dare to face these teasing heads on and unconsciously shrugg it off as a joke. There are cases where I did pluck up my courage and tried to initiate outings with him but still it's a standstill. I'm not sure if it's cause there really is nothing there or somehow there is this impression of me being proactive in asking due to me being usually loud and seemingly extroverted in school settings due to my committee position. It's not that I am desperate to find a guy but I want to find out if I am doing anything wrong. 

I certainly don't want to chase a guy off if I really end up liking him.

I once had a fwb. We would have sex before and after class. Twice a day! Then one day, we decided to grab supper after sex, then going for dinners, movie dates and even spending the night together... without having sex. We fell in love with each other and he became my boyfriend. Even though things did not work out in the end, we are still good friends :)

So it's been a week of a new semester. And it's been quiet. 
No more lunches after lecture, no more eye rolling or cringing at terrible jokes. No more conversations about frivolous topics.

Don't get me wrong, I am not adverse to silence, in fact I like the quiet. I always have; even in the midst of laughter I sometimes wish for things to be quiet. I appreciated the company, but I also enjoyed the breaks in between when we didn't have to meet one another. 

Our group dynamics have evolved over the years since we were friends in junior college, and it is no longer what it was. Our expectations have changed, our priorities have shifted. That's good, it means we are growing. But it also meant that I also did not have to hold on to this group as closely as I once did. And so, since the end of the first year, I have told myself to simply let things be, and slowly let it go. But in the mean time while we are still in close proximity, I'll play along and enjoy my breaks of quiet on the side. "I will get more quiet soon" I told myself.

And hence, I thought my entry into the 3rd year would be a good chance to enjoy more quiet. After all, we are all taking different modules, different specialisations, some of us aren't even in the same country at this point. And when I thought it would be nice to have a change of pace, I instead found myself rather lonely at the end of the first week.

I don't wish to say I bring it upon myself since I was never very committed to the group relationship we all had, but I will admit that I have been a little bit complacent in terms of my social life. Perhaps "taking things for granted" would be a better way to put it. 

So here I am, liking my newfound space, but still finding it achingly empty. The quiet is nice for me, until I remember that in the quiet I can hear myself think. And the thoughts aren't always nice.

There should be an app for NUS Whispers. It actually quite therapeutic and informative to scroll through it when I'm bored, just like 9Gag. 

Or is it just me?  #random

To: 

Sorry for bringing up the whole nice guy/bad boy debate again, but I just had to say this. There are plenty of girls who go for nice guys. At least 80% of my single female friends look for good traits in a guy. And from personal experience, one particular guy caught my eye because he was a perfect gentleman. Not gonna elaborate further on the details so I dont make myself obvious, but I cannot emphasise this any more, MANY girls look for nice guys. 

P.S I'm starting to doubt your definition of a nice guy. If your idea of a nice guy is the kind of guy who stays in a corner and never talks, never makes any effort to socialise, then that might be the reason. That, or you had a bad experience that threw all the girls in the world into your stereotype of 'mean bitches'. There are plenty of popular, good looking guys that classify as 'nice guys' too. Not saying that girls go for looks (honestly I think guys value looks more than girls in their partner), but I just wanted to address that.
-
 
This post is directing to the commentors of OP's post and also any kind souls out there willing to enlighten me. I'm rather curious (ok fine this has been a burning question of mine for years) how girls are deemed as boring by the guys while they text? I have experienced guys giving extremely short replies despite me sending a longer message and it was also an awful experience to receive such replies from my past crushes too. Not too sure if I'm indeed a boring girl...but i did tried to change for the better alright. It is just the topics discussed being downright boring or he just not interested in the girl? Do the majority of guys out there feel that only great looking ladies are worth their time to chat with? I'm not pinpointing anyone nor do I bear any grudges against pretty girls here ok. I have friends who are great at chatting up with their uni guy friends online despite having average looks and I do not consider myself to be bad looking anyway, so it must be something which keeps the conversation more forthcoming from the guy side right? 
-
 
So, on relationships. I used to know this guy whom I sort of like. Until he started acting weird. It was like he had changed all of a sudden! Then I realised he must be up to no good. So I asked him. And he said everything he was doing was for me and that it was for a "good cause" (?). I'm quoting him directly. Only today I finally understood why he did what he did. And I'm very thankful that he was part of my maturing process, though we didn't share many pleasant moments...nevertheless, it's all the past. I hope you move on and thanks for everything!  Merci! 
-
 
Life is so strange. I see people around who are well-known for lying and cheating, yet people are still good friends with them, or are at least civil to them.

Contrast with another guy who has a slight EQ problem. He's irritating from time to time, socially awkward etc. Man you should see the people pile on the hate on him. 

Seems like malice is tolerated a lot more than awkwardness. 
-
 
No matter how angry or sad i am, you are always there for me.

Even if i remain silent, you will not complain at all.

We laugh together and go through hardships together.

When i rant, you always listen to me and give me advice.

You give me your unwavering support in everything i do.

I am really fortunate and grateful to be loved so much by you.

If your bf/gf gives you this feeling, you know that he/she is the one for you. Treasure your love.

Basically there are four types of girls:
1) Fuck no- the fat, short and ugly looking ones 
2) Not really- the plain Jane who doesn't really maintain her shape but better looking relative to the ugly girl, but below average nonetheless
3) Yes- the average to a little above average looking ones 
4) Fuck Yes- the gorgeous/cute/sexy/fit ones 

On the other hand, there are also four kinds of guys:
1) Fuck no- the socially awkward, fat and ugly looking ones 
2) Not really- the average looking but college wallflower kind 
3) Yes- the fashionable, tall, sociable, above average looking ones 
4) Fuck Yes- Rich, good looking, smart, charismatic kind

Personally, I think I'm between a 2 and a 3. Most of us singletons are probably in this region in the dating world. Therefore, do things to improve yourself. Read more, go to the gym more often, and be kind and bitch less.

Otherwise, your dream girl/ guy will just and will always be a dream

I'm 21 this year. I've been with my boyfriend since JC1. I was 19 when I got pregnant. I chose to go for an abortion. I never told him about the baby or the abortion. I knew he would have wanted me to keep it. He was that kind of guy who would have done the right thing and taken responsibility. I wanted the baby too, but it was bad timing. He was in NS, due to start school in NUS, and I was already in NUS at the time. I made the decision to abort even though every fiber of my being told me not to. I paid a taxi driver $80 for his time and to make sure that I got home safe after the procedure.

Every year, on the 14th of August, today, I feel guilt and sadness. The kind that feels overwhelming that I find it hard to get through my day. Today,  two years ago, was the day I got my abortion. I never knew my baby's gender, but I chose Sam for the name itself was ambiguous. I miss you so much, Sam, I'm so, so sorry. Not here, but loved and remembered all the same for the rest of my life.

 people joke may joke about this, but there might actually be some truth to this. I've used tinder for somewhile now and many girls I've spoken to around the 23ish to 26ish years old say the same thing. Just graduated, holding their first job, hard to meet guys either due to the lack of guys in their workplace or they are trying to avoid workplace relationships. When asked if they dated in uni they either say it wasn't serious/didn't work out or they were focusing on studies. Personal friends have also shared similar concerns. 

Of course it depends on what industry you are in. There's also a skew in my example since well, it's tinder. I personally think this applies to guys too. Basically working life gives you less time and energy to date. 

But if I were to give advice to either gender, it wouldn't be to cling on to whoever you know university. Some people (like me) use tinder to meet new people. But if that's not your thing, try taking up some sort of hobby with a large community that you can continue doing when you get older as well. Cycling for example? You see large groups of working adults cycling around Singapore now and then. Community choirs are another, and some really don't require you to have much experience. These activities would let you meet many other people outside your workplace. 
Furthermore, people with a hobby/interest are generally more interesting and attractive too. 
Worst come to worst, if you don't meet anyone, you at least have a hobby and some friends for work-life balance.

While i was on holiday i got approched by a girl in a language i was not familiar with. We chatted and she eventually asked me out. The noob evergreen me panicked and said no.

 I'm still regretting it.

How do you know when you've truly gotten over someone? I'd had feelings for her for so long, even after I decided to let it go (the feeling wasn't mutual), I don't know if I'm still doing these things out of habit or if my heart still yearns for her. My eyes still notice her among the crowd, anything she says or just the mention of her name will get my attention immediately, and I still can't help but be disappointed when our friends are meeting and she can't be there. I know things can't work out with her and I wish I could just move on with life instead of being stuck in this phase for so long. There have been girls who asked me out but I declined because it just doesn't seem fair to date them while another girl is on my mind. 
-
 
Today I went out with my crush who's studying in NUS whom I knew from secondary school. And my I am really surprised and heartened at how we've somehow both changed so much and matched up on the same wavelength now after not seeing each other for more than a year or so. Knowing that you are single and receptive to dating, and that we have similar ideas about romance, careers and life in general, I really wonder if it's come full circle for me and my crush. 

However, knowing that I am going overseas again to resume uni in a month's time and not knowing when the next time I come back will be, I wonder if I should take the risk and probe further to gauge your responsiveness to me. Seeing how we managed to stretch a 2-hour coffee session to a 5-hour coffee and dinner session in the end, the chemistry I'm feeling between us is something that seems unreal and I'm really hoping it's not just felt on my side only. 

I guess like they say, you might meet the right person with the right circumstances, but if time refuses to cooperate... *frowns*  
-
 
I liked her a lot, but she politely rejected me and decided to go out with the other guy. I don't like him, but that's just going by my gut feeling. He might be a nicer guy than me. I don't know him personally. He might be an awesome person. It's her choice anyway. Out of my control. I tried and failed. (HAHA) (Hahaha) (haha....)

That night she rang me up and sounded devastated in the phone. We met somewhere near my house and she cried and cried in my arms. She weep and told me how he betrayed her trust, lied to her, cheat with a stranger for a few months.

"I should have stayed with you from the start."

Can anyone tell me why did I had an sudden urge to punch her in the face when she said that?

I had an FWB around 6 years ago. We totally clicked, and we were year 1s. But at that time, I was still mourning over someone else. Admittedly, I fooled around with him because doing so without a proper girl/boyfriend status was just, well, fooling around. Then he dropped the big 'I LOVE YOU' in the middle of it, and it wasn't just once. I was honestly not sure what he was playing at, so I just brushed it aside, not sure whether he was imagining me to be someone else or he just wanted to get in my pants (we have never hit home-run). Fast forward a few months afterwards (while we were still playing around), he asked me out on a date. I didn't take it seriously because I mean, who does that in the middle of a heated moment? He could have said it to hit home-run so I wasn't confident of anything. But at that time, I have already caught feelings. I felt like I could love him even though it wasn't the time for me to say the word 'LOVE'.

Anyway, to cut things short, I'm still in love with my FWB but we don't talk anymore (seems like the normal protocol considering the situation). I'm still trying to get over him but I think to most people, I seem stupid. But things like 'feelings' and 'love' are hard to explain sometimes. I'm getting married next year, and even though I love my current boyfriend very much and am 100% committed, there is still some regret and sadness due to my FWB. I just hope that these feelings resurfaced because it's 3am and that they are not frequently fleeting. I'm not sure myself. I'll admit it, girls are difficult to understand, because I don't even understand myself.

Sorry for the long post.

My birthday is coming. I really want to throw a BBQ party but I don't know who to invite. Throughout the years, people have come and go in my life but none have stayed long enough for me to consider my friends. There's this group of people I met in university that helped me get through the course but we've grown further apart since graduation. Anyone wants to be my fake friend for a day?
-
 
I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not in any serious financial difficulty, my girlfriend and I love each other very much, I'm in a CCA that I passionately enjoy, and I'm well on track to get first class honours. By all means I should be pretty happy with my lot in life. 

But all I can think of everyday is constantly remembering all the failures and bad things that happened to me in the past. It's eating away at me inside, and the more I try to forget the stronger the memories come. It's making life unbearable, and the worst part is that now I've started to have nightmares about them almost every other night, so I can't get refuge in sleep either.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired of feeling like this and I hate myself for feeling like this when I have every reason not to.

Its hard to keep up emotionally with a gf who doesnt show any sign of love.
she doesnt initiate hugs or kisses, she doesnt ever tell me she misses me, she practically doesnt show much interest in me. Yet when i talk to her about it, she says she loves me. But her actions just dont match up.

im getting tired. i just wanted a partner to love and be loved. but the latter doesnt seem to be happening.

An Ode to the Nice Guys
This rant was written for the Wharton Undergraduate Journal
This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style.

This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once they’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you.

This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldn’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree you’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didn’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we’re just friends!” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because you’re nice like that.

The nice guys don’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys don’t seem to get laid as often as they should. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can’t. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he’s too nice to date” or “he would be a good boyfriend but he’s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much from me, I couldn’t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all: “no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (I’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn’t last forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single.

So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You know who you are, and I know you’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming.

After reading this, Maybe its time for that nice guys to change themselves into the jerks all girls love and adore...

Today, I got a call up interview at Recruit Express. Initially I was overjoy that I got a part time job but do u know what it turns out?
My agent wants to meet me up today but he was on leave today so he randomly throw a colleague to attend me. So, I find it weird and I just fill up my particulars as told. From the moment I walk in, I sense a bad atmosphere.
Like this looks OK not the worst yet.
After that, I just submit my form and they ask lots of personal weird questions giving a sinister smile while not related to work.
After that I call back my original agent and then he end his line for me instead a few times and never reply to my msg. I was really disappointed that this recruitment agency treat our careers like a game. I have work for big companies before and I am currently holding on to a diploma. To be treated like a fool is an insult to me. I am sharing this experience in hopes that other job seekers do not fall prey to this scam.
-
 
I disagree that guys peak around at age 28-35. If we start looking for a girlfriend by then, sad thing is it is near impossible to find one by then as most girls will have been attached/married. So the best thing is start looking for one right now. No regrets really.

To single girls out there:
If you have a close guy friend whom you consider to be a great guy, please consider making him your boyfriend! 

I was an undergrad and I am seriously regretting how I let so many great guys friends go by.. Now that I've graduated it's so much more difficult to find a bf out there in the workplace.

As of late I've begun to develop feelings for a friend of mine; it's gotten really bad and I literally can't stop thinking about him. It is also very hard to resist the urge to reach out and hug him whenever I see him. I find this most distressing and naturally, this is a very embarrassing situation for me as he is a good friend and I don't want to stir any shit up as I am quite positive he does not feel the same way. How do I maintain my cool and continue to look at things objectively and remain friends while not killing myself in the process? It is incredibly hard to focus sometimes so I try to keep myself as occupied as possible to avoid my mind straying toward such hazardous thoughts. The whole things is very laughable and pathetic. Lately I've not been communicating with him as much (not really ignoring him but restricting calls/texts to only when necessary) because I'm afraid I would give myself away or say something stupid...I somehow hope that this lack of communication will make me like him less and eventually quell my thirsty hormones...I hope he doesn't think I'm weird or angry at him...I just want to remain friends goddammit. ><

This is the most emasculating experience ever. I was standing beside my gf when she complained to her girl friends about my erectile dysfunction condition and saying how pathetic I am. I hope you undergo mastectomy soon female dog.

Coming from a JC which is pretty well known for having students who come from rich families and having these students as friends for the past many years, i have decided that in uni, i would try to steer clear of rich kids simply due to the fact that i come from an average background and i could not afford to live the life of a rich kid. (eg eating restaurant food, travelling often, clubbing etc. ) I thought i might have found the perfect clique when i met my current group of friends during our faculty camp last year. But i couldn't be any more wrong. It turns out that most of my friends in that clique came from affluent families, having many branded bags and cars. And when they are "feeling poor" they would head to cafes instead. On a few occasions, one or two of them would treat me,knowing that I am not like them. While i really do appreciate the goodwill, i just feel that I am not part of them but I'm too weak to leave the group. Besides, they are a rather nice bunch of people and there isnt any other particular reason to leave. i've tried suggesting budgeted places to hang out instead but majority always wins so I almost never got my way. School just started but they are already planning a holiday to USA in December. Sigh...

to be honest, i am really scared to get into a relationship now amidst the cheating confessions. seems like hardly anybody's really honest these days, and most people are sleeping/has slept around with everybody else.

Walked around student life fair just now and was overwhelmed! I wished there were clearer signs for everything, I almost missed on 2 entire sections at the back. 

Many things were familiar, not very different from jc. However, I was very surprised that there were so many religious groups on campus and it seems so open here in NUS!

Pardon my ignorance & pun, but before coming to nus, I read this page religiously and I thought people were very closed off about such issues. So I was very surprised to see that there is even an interfaith group that encourages such discussions and as I went to snoop around the booths people were generally welcoming even though it was quite obvious that I didn't share their religion. 

Happy that I braved the crowds to discover this side of NUS. 

-
 
So is NUS Computing trying to send a message that triads behaviours are okay and that the people from the students' club are mature enough to judge any form of relationship?

Let's not talk about Singapore politics or NUS politics. Just NUS Computing itself. 

So if a girl rejects a guy from NUS Computing Club, she deserves all the rumours, strangers digging up dirts on her and all forms of third-party judgement?

Its weird how my ex groupmates still wants to group with me this sem although i am a weak member. My grades are in C range(that's a secret of cos). I do my work and reply messages often but i do not manage to contribute as much as the rest. I feel surprised and also guilty about being a burden :(
-
 
to the year 1s, mostly, and some year 2s and year 3s, please attend the student life fair with an open mind. the club, sport, or society that you choose will impact you and your uni life more than you know. it sets the pace for your academics, life style and social circle. i challenge you to step out of your comfort zone, join something that you never thought you could accomplish, something you think you might not excel in, or something you think you are excellent in and can share some experience with some newbies.

with no intention to promote my cca, i want to tell you that joining this certain challenging sport with demanding training commitment and physical demands, i actually made the best friends along the way, accomplished more that i ever thought i could, traveled overseas with the best of comarades, and flew the nus flag with pride. it was beyond what i ever thought i could accomplish back when i was super unhealthy and reluctant to move a muscle.

perhaps give a few ccas 2 weeks of your time. just 2 weeks might change 4 years of uni, and the rest of your life.
-
 
Once upon a time a guy from computing likes a girl. She didn't get to say no because he never asked. But he told all of his friends. And they told their friends. And they told their friends. But she only just found out today.

If you had just asked I would have said no. But you never asked so it's a never.

Obviously.
-
 
Though there's no 'end' to the conversation with the guy (I kinda like) that I'm texting, he'd take a long time to reply (around one to three replies on average per day from him). 

Sometimes I reply when his Whatsapp status is online, but it'd still take a few hours or until next day before I get a response. (You may say maybe he wasn't in an appropriate situation to reply - ok)

I know for a fact that he's quite active on Whatsapp at night. But most of the time, even when I send him my reply in the afternoon I still wouldn't receive a reply until the next day.

I KNOW PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT HE MIGHT BE BUSY. OK. I UNDERSTAND. BUT... I can't help but feel like there's a possibility that he doesn't want to talk to me. His tone doesn't 'sound' that way, but his reply frequency vs online presence on Whatsapp does. 

OPINIONS PLEASE. 
-
 
I had, and might still have, a crush on this girl from computing. She isn't the pretty or hot kind but the cutesy small girl kind, at least to me, especially when she smiles. I knew her from some event where she was part of the computing club contingent. 

Too bad, it has been a year or two since I last talked to her. Honestly, I forgot about this little crush until her photos resurfaced on Facebook (she isn't an active Facebook user). If I wasn't attached, I would've pursued her, preferably with the objects that her name sounds like.

Oh well, what to do? Life moves on, but such little infatuations help to make life interesting.
-
 
Hey you!
What's the point of you replying me if you are just going to type one word or at most one sentence? I know the stuff I talk about is boring but it definitely does not deserve such short answers! You might as well just ignore me completely at least I know for sure that you aren't interested. 
You and your short answers ironically gives me hope and makes me feel like I need to try harder to get your attention. 
-frustrated and hoping for longer replies-

I am a guy who judge how pretty a girl is only when she have no make-up (no foundation nothing) at all. So whenever other guys commented how pretty a girl is, the moment i see the girl have make-up on, i immediately replied "i will not agree until i see her without her make-up". 

Any guys out there judge how good looking a girl is based purely on her natural looks only?
-
 
Do girls like guys who are serious? I try to talk to girls but often find them turned off after finding out i cant joke around

 Given that you are the shy/quiet type, people usually notice the hidden gem in the corner only if you are relatively good /decent looking. #facts#of#life

Just curious, those of you who commented things like "feel free to PM me" etc, will y'all really not feel weird about random people PM-ing you suddenly? How would you feel if someone just randomly msged you? Have y'all received any PMs from the OPs? 

And to those OPs who PM-ed them (if any), how did you put away your fear of getting judged or your insecurities to start a convo with a random person?

Op of  again.

Thinking about if things between us would develop further?Honestly, I'm afraid one day I'll tell you the reason of us not able to take our relationship to the next level it's because of my faith.

I cheated on my best friend with her boyfriend because I was willing to sacrifice the friendship for the relationship. He is now married to someone he cheated on me with. I am left to face my clueless friend daily. I never thought I would say this, but if I could turn back time, I wouldn't have done it.

If you are a girl, now would be a good time to find a good guy and cling on to him.  This is because girl's biological clock means that they are at their peak at between 18 to 25. After 30, it can be much harder to find a optimal mate as you would have passed your peak a long time ago. However for guys, their peak are at around 28-35 hence if you are a guy and you are willing to wait it out, then it is best advised to wait it out to find an even better mate rather than rush to get an inferior mate.

I seriously don't understand women at all !!! Since you said that you had no feelings for me and threaten to break all contacts with me if I continue to have feelings for you. Why the hell do you still hug me when I'm trying so hard to forget you. When I hug you back, why did you push me away? Why do you call me "dear" ? Why do you always call me in the middle of the night and start crying for no damn reason? Why did you use my photo as your laptop screen saver? Why you get jealous when I talk to other girls and started messing up my belongings?

Yesterday night, you told me that you have decided to choose me. 
Today, you asked me, "who do you think you are, to me?".  

Quit playing games with my heart, I should have known from the start that you are a nightmare dress like a day dream.

I noticed that one of my clique members is quite exploitative and perhaps manipulative of others... The type of questions he asks, "eh who is the richest amongst all of you guys ah?" And he happens to be really buddy-buddy with that one person and the next two people in that list... In addition, I find him to be is a very emotionally manipulative person. He'll tell you his personal problems and make you feel really close to him but in reality he does that with everyone else. He just wants you to tell him what your personal problems are and he'll exploit them. He won't ever tell you what's going on straight-up but somehow, he'll used veiled language to scold you and he'll take very long to reply your messages to indicate his disapproval. 

Despite being new to our clique, he's the one holding the most influence - being somewhat loud and outgoing. I don't dare discuss this with another person lest he comes back to bite me - he is very popular in school and knows a lot of gossip. I feel very uneasy whenever I'm in his presence and I want to leave my clique but I'm not sure how to as I'm quite a shy person and I don't want to rouse any attention amongst the group itself. Any advice as to dealing with this sort of person?

Maybe its because I'm lonely, but I have constructed a fantasy life around one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen. I imagine going out on dates, chatting about movies, long insightful conversations by the beach. I fantasize about making her laugh and smile. She doesn't know me. I have not even seen her in person before. All I have to fuel my fantasies is her profile pic. She's wearing a graduation cap, but it used to be cat ears. Cuteness overload!!!!

how long does it take to get over someone?
its been awhile and i still find myself longing for my ex.
all my friends said he isnt worth it - he showed interest in another girl while we were together,  which caused the demise of our years-long relationship and went overseas with another girl a few weeks after the breakup.
things didnt work out for him and he was more devastated over his fling than the years that we were together. 
sometimes i really miss the times when we were together. i know i should move on, but it's not that easy at all.

I knew this girl for 3 semesters and I hinted that I would like to take the friendship further. She instinctively said that she would be friend zoning me.

I asked her why she did so, and her reply was that it wasn't my personality that was the issue. But rather our backgrounds. She, a person who grew up in a HDB, average background while I was the polar opposite. I never stayed in a HDB, and lived relatively comfortably. I remember helping her in school in any way. Giving her lifts from NUS back home when it was convenient. She asked why did I bother to be so helpful to most people. Because if she were in my shoes, she would have just "mind my own business and do my own stuff"

She admitted that she feels inferior when interacting with me at times, and she didn't like the idea of opening up to me emotionally although she did in the end. All this took place while we were overseas. She was on exchange and I happened to be there on a holiday ( talk about coincidence )

I spent my 5 weeks there hanging out with her everyday, touring and shopping together.  On the last night, I asked if we would still be friends. And she replied that she will think about it ( I wish I knew why she said that ). Ever since both of us got back to Singapore, it has been silent. I just feel...frustrated not knowing where I have gone wrong. I really enjoyed her companionship as a friend. But to be shut out like that now...where do I go from here ?

Reading the entries on relationships of couples with different faiths, coincidentally it's Christianity, I started to doubt myself again. How you felt while reading those confessions?

It is such a coincidence that August 9 is also the date where I broke of with my significant other. Both of us have become more independent ever since .

When I saw my crush holding her boyfriend's hand, I was wondering how is it that some man is able to make the girl like him so much that she is willing to hold his hand when my crush isn't even willing to add me on Facebook.

I wonder is there simply some magic spell that make someone fall in love with you.

Why is it that I am an evergreen at the age of 20+ when many of my friends are attached.

We are in the same clique and we are classmates. I dont like him. That what i've been telling myself. Or rather trying to force myself to believe. Its first week of school and i get terribly upset whenever i see him? Why? Because its so clear that hes not interested. That is really what affects me a lot. I cant believe i actually felt a tinge of jealousy which i refuse to admit that it was. I try not to look at him in the eye because i can feel my heart skip a beat. I try to avoid him, avoid thinking of him but he just keeps popping up. I am so tired. I dont want to continue this anymore. Yet whenever i am on the verge of giving up completely, he always have the magic to make me feel wanted. He always teases me with other guys and makes me feel that there is a potential romance going on. Is he just confusing me, or am i confusing myself?

I have a friend who addresses me as her best friend but in reality, we don't pour our hearts to each other. It's weird, and awkward.

to  Hi, I felt a need to reply you. Anxiety is a common issue. The fact that Singapore is a competitive society doesn't help at all. In fact, it may be one of the reasons why most people have anxieties. Some dont even know that they have it. From what I've read, it seems like your anxieties were a result of childhood expectations, and fear. If i am not wrong, you fear failing. You are insecure. You seek security through these numbers and alphabets. It may be a result of parental pressure, or it may be a result of peer pressure. This, only you will know. Overtime, such expectations, fears, become a way of life. It becomes a habit, and it snowballed into the anxieties you face today. 

Most people with untreated anxieties may eventually go on to develop depression. There are many ways that you can help yourself out of it. Some of the suggestions that I am putting forth, may seem ordinary to you, but they have therapeutic effect on the mind. 

1) keep a timetable. Remind yourself how much time you have. Do not look at how much you have to do, but look at how much time you have to do it with proper planning. this way, it will put things into perspective and remind yourself that you still have time to prepare for you exam. 

2) breathe. Take long deep breaths when you find yourself having difficulty breathing or increase in heart rate. take long deep breaths with your nose, and exhale out with your mouth. practice this constantly, it is a great stress reliever. 

3) when you find yourself fearing, paralyzed, than stop. Get yourself away from where you are. go to another room or smth. Find smth that you can touch, and smth that you can smell. Look far out, or focus on something that brings peace to you. Maybe something blue? 

4) talk to a trusted friend. In order for your own treatment to be effective, it'll be good to have a friend to help you through the deepest moments. Anxiety attacks are like deep valleys, its dark and there is no way out. It will be beneficial to have someone that you can find comfort in, to talk to you, and to comfort you. Their presence will help get you back on track faster. It can be your GF/BF or parents. find someone that you can wholeheartedly open up too. 

5) Accept imperfection. No one is perfect. no matter how much we prepare for an exam, we can never be 100% prepared. The greatest lesson is not learnt from the marks you gained but the marks you lost. Remind yourself, that life is a journey of learning. Ultimately, the greatest teacher, is failure. Constantly remind yourself that you are in the university to learn, and to be better. 

6) Seek professional help. I place this last for a reason. Many people fear getting professional help. It can be for various reasons, some will fear being judged, some feel uncomfortable with a stranger knowing the deepest part of you (link to insecurities). Professionals are trained to help you, they are your best source of advice and help. Find a therapist/psychologist that you are comfortable with. if you cant get yourself to find professional help, you can confide in your closest companion. However, do ensure that your companion does adequate reading to know some techniques of helping you. You do not have to go through it alone. 

Love yourself. It is not all dark and gloomy. you are still young, you have a long way ahead.   

Im sorry for the long post. But this is the only way I can offer my 2 cents to you. I hope this is of help to you, and to any other that is reading this. 

Thank you.

I went to a sleepover with my church friends. We drank alcohol and I got a bit tipsy. Last thing I remember was joking around with one of the people in my cell (had a slight crush on him) and next thing I know we ended up sleeping together in his room.

Now my entire cell knows we did stuff together and things are a little awkward. The thing that makes it the most horrible is that my boyfriend is in the cell too, and could not attend because he was overseas at the time. He's coming back to the cell group meetings really soon and I feel extremely guilty. Now even the cell group is starting to fall apart. I hate myself so much I cry myself to sleep every night.

Hello. I am a freshie. There is something wrong with me. There always was. Every school I go to, I worry about exams from day 1. In jc I was worried about getting retained. J2 it was A levels. Pretty much the same story in secondary school. Its not normal worry like 'oh shit exams are coming'. Its crippling and debilitating. I would put off social events, CCA's or anything else non academic just to go home and study, even if exams are months away. Of course I got good grades, but I was never truly happy. My entire self worth is founded on a set of letters and numbers. So much so that I even planned ways to kill myself if I didnt attain a particular letter. 

It's gonna be day 3 of uni soon and looks like nothing has changed. I thought I did. I told myself I wouldnt be like this in university. I wanted to be around people, do things other than study, build up my non existent CV. But I am already paralysed. I cant even bring myself to go out and socialize. All I think about doing is studying. I can literally feel the anxiety in my heart (that heavy feeling in your chest you sometimes get). I hate being me. Is anyone else like me? What should I do? I really need help. 

I'm sorry if this post sounded idiotic, I just needed to tell someone.

Saw my crush holding her boyfriend's hand

I wish I can disfigure her. If I can't have her, no one else can.

Even if her boyfriend don't ditch her despite her disfigured look, I will still feel better because I can at least say I don't like her anymore. She is so ugly.

To the previous OP who feel that they don't fit in anywhere in school, I feel you. You are not alone.
It's only the second day of school as a freshmen but I am losing faith.
Prior to school, I joined a number of camps. Well, you know, for the same reasons: wanting to meet more people/have friends to sit around with in lessons. Well that is the ideal outcome but it didn't quite work out for me.

Freshmen orientation camp, course camp, orientation week. I stay on campus too. Yes I made lots of friends. Well not technically friends, rather acquaintances because nothing beyond small talks or a smile/greeting. I don't belong to any cliques either. I only have one friend whom I stick to for all lectures. We are close but as she is a social butterfly, I feel like I needed to have friends on my own too. I don't have other close friends in my course or faculty as of now because I felt like I tried so hard to fit in during camp and half the time I was faded into the bg.

I don't know if things will get better but it is really hard to put up a facade everyday.

LOL Just because Lui Tuck Yew decided to quit and you feel sad. Your feeling of sadness influenced you to put him in a better light as you evaluated what he had done for the past years. That's dumb. People come and go. They are finished with their work here - they leave. Staying doesn't make it better. It is nothing surprising or even worth mentioning at all!

And are you even sure of his real intention of leaving? He could be leaving for a thousand of reasons and you don't even know about it, yet you're feeling sad for him.

Can I ask you not to be in the HR of any computer? Because I foresee your company will run out of tissue paper soon.

I'm in my final year. I know it's just one last push to graduation but I really can't bring myself to care anymore. So what if I graduate with a first? I have no future anyways. Sometimes, I think of killing myself. I feel like it's the only way things will ever look up.

The game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say.

The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I'm beat
And to another give my seat
For that's the only painless feat.

The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger...watch it grin, but...

A wise man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied 'oh why ask me?'

 Your post reminded me of my ex as well. She is a Christian . She dated and got attached to another guy after we broke up.

Whatever reasons given by a girl during break up may not necessary be true. 

My ex is currently in her third relationship. She broke up with her first because she felt unhappy nagging him to attend church and it was a long distance relationship. She wanted a Christian boyfriend. I was her second boyfriend, and i was not a christian then. So you see, whatever reasons given by the girl are merely excuses.

We sort of liked one another at that point of time. Before I chased her, I asked her about her long distance relationship. She lied to me that her relationship ended months ago. Recently, i found out that she only broke up with her first boyfriend, months after we begin our relationship. So yes, she was two timing. If i have known that, i would not have chased her.

My ex isn't a simple woman. She is that sort of woman who is never contended. She will do anything to get a scholarship and an award. After graduating from NUS High, she applied for many scholarships. Of course many companies offered her and wanted her to accept the scholarship ASAP. Her method was to accept all scholarships first. After bagging and accepting all the scholarships that she can possibly get, she will choose the best offer and reject the rest. Rejecting a scholarship after acceptance is not simple because you need to pay a penalty. To avoid paying the penalty, she will scrutinize the terms of the scholarship, and make the company withdraw/ terminate the scholarship on their own terms.

So she probably treated me like another scholarship bond. She made me end the relationship on my own terms too. At that point, she knew that i was not comfortable with her mum because i find her overbearing at times. Her mum will only accept me if i do certain things for her. I couldnt really understand because i am someone who can accept another person for who he or she is. Anyway, she told me that her mum was giving her a hard time, and that i did not pray about the relationship, and the relationship ended. And immediately after the relationship ended, she is with this third guy. Yes, and finally she is dating a christian.

After much reflection, I felt that such a girl is not worth it. Many girls like to give reasons like "we are no longer thinking on the same level", "we  have too many difference and personality different too". These arent valid reasons. We are different we are one. A relationship can only be successful if both of you are willing to work on your differences, its about compromise, giving and taking.

As for my ex and your ex, it is unlikely that their present relationship will work out. Why? Because they are unwilling to work on the differences and be on the same level as their partner. At some point in the relationship or marriage, u will realize that u and your partner are very different. (And often these are just an excuse for a change of feeling) 

Anyway, my ex gf's past relationships never lasted more than a year. And this should be a red flag for all guys. Never be too serious about a girl who dates so casually and changes so quickly. She is from computing and treats the search for a partner like an algorithm. I hope you can learn from my experience.

The fact that you refused to hug me outside the LT today in front of your other friends hurt me a lot. I hope you read this post so that you know that I noticed, and I'm angry.
And before there are any troll posts saying that I was smelly or stinky, let me clarify- I wasn't.
I guess being a different nationality, a different race, does matter.

Ok before I begin, pls don't flame me for being sourgrape or anything.. Just saying how I really feel... I feel that the selection criteria for IFG is pretty unfair, esp for gender dominated faculties  i.e engineering where there are like tons of guys. So the spots for sports like tennis are rather competitive. And yet they allow IVP players and people who have played for previous years to participate. I mean shldnt they allow new breed of players to play every year? I feel I'm a better than usual player but then those IVP people and past IFG players will just get "auto-selected". Where's the spirit of fairness and having new blood to play? I hope NUS actually does smth to the team captains and team managers to allow more people to participate, rather than an "elite few" PEACE OUT GUYS :)

I thought I could adapt well but I feel so lonely. I can't click with my friends. Every time I go for outings I feel like shit. TBH I don't really see the point of going for those outings anymore because it really does not help me. Especially for dinner outing, i just feel so awkward. I once hid in the toilet for 30minutes because I have nothing to say and everybody is having their small chats. I feel so safe inside the cubicle watching the minutes go by, hoping I can go home soon. 

The few closer friends whom I feel at ease and can talk crap with are gone. These closer friends that I have are also pretty sociable and have lots of friends and it kind of hurts me thinking that I probably won't mean as much to them as they mean to me. I miss y'all so much. I wish I have a dog so I will feel less lonely. At least I can talk to it. Even tho im a hugely introverted and shy person, this feeling of having no friend here is killing me. 

stay strong:((((....all these fleeting emotions are not here to stay...something good will come along. hopefully..fighting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've been with my gf for about a year now and I really do love her with all my heart. But recently I find myself often wondering if I am able to find a better/more attractive gf. My gf isn't exactly what people would describe as pretty and I guess she is a little plump too. What makes me really frustrated sometimes is I when I see a pretty girl on the train I always try and picture what it will be like to go out with a pretty girl like that even though I know how selfish I am by thinking about that. It really does not help either when I see pretty girls attached to guys whom I feel are less attractive than I am and it really makes me wonder if I could have found a prettier gf. I know I may sound very judgmental and superficial but it's a thought I find harder and harder to shut down. As for my gf I love her for her personality and our goals in life are almost perfectly aligned, which is also the reason why I don't foresee myself breaking up with her in the future. It just gets so scary knowing that she is most likely the person I am going to spend the rest of my life with but yet I am having these thoughts now. Does that mean these feelings are going to get stronger and stronger as time passes? Help me out here guys...

Final year and still can't find a girlfriend. Anyone else still part of the lonely hearts club?

I was so close to breaking up with my girlfriend because of my project mate which I had feelings for. It was a roller coaster ride for me because I was really confused - lost in love. 

Lucky, I finally made up my mind and stopped all activities with you because you didn't stay for me all the way. You have had been a great influenced to me even though you knew that I wasn't a "good guy". You are my dream girl.

I really hope that you can find a nice guy out there.

Sorry I can't be the one for you. I loved you so much but it was not enough to make me choose you. I really did love you. I really did.

How I wish that we still can be friends. But it will never be possible because I can never have platonic friends.
-
 
My girlfriend broke up with me. I really love her a lot. However, our lifestyles cannot match each other because she is a staunch Christian while I am a Taoist due to my family background. We met since poly as we're from the same CCA, we got along well and became an item. We have meaningful time with each other. We never fail to meet up daily.

Yet, about a year ago, I felt we were drifting apart when she joined a church via a schoolmate and she became a Christian and became very active in her church activities. Soon, I only met her once a week, or maybe once in two weeks. I tried calling her and messaging her on the other days, however these conversations were short and it felt like she was always rushing to do something. When I asked her to go out with me, often she said she can't as she had this and that activity. She does church related activities for at least 4 times a week.  I felt hurt as she seem to prioritize those activities more than spending time with me. 

As I wanted to save our relationship, I told her I will like to join her in her church activities. She gladly agreed. Aside from the weekly Sabbath, the activities involved around joining and organizing various cell group meetings with praying, singing and preaching. Although I am not religious myself, I was really happy to be part of those activities because I at least get to do something together with her. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to appreciate it at all. She seemed annoyed that I joined the activities because of her, and I am not sincerely interested to be part of her church group.

I can hardly find any time alone with her anymore, every time when we even manage to go out together, she'll bring a couple of cell group members with her. It's very damn frustrating! It's a date between you and me, not a cell group meeting or something. Call me selfish, but bringing along those so-called "brothers" and "sisters" of yours is just... unnecessary.

I finally mustered the courage to call her to discuss about my unhappiness. She tried to avoid the conversation, but I firmly told her I cannot pretend to be happy and I cannot live like that. I asked her if our relationship will be better if I become a fervent Christian myself, so we can have the same beliefs, but she said there's no point and she does not want me to force myself to change because of her. So that's it. She suggested we break up. I insisted that I didn't want to, because I love her, but she explained it'll be better for both of us since we are no longer thinking on the same level. That night, I cried like a pussy—shame on me — she gave me the impression that she belittles me by saying I am from a different level.

And after that, we stopped contacting each other. During the NDP, she updated her Facebook with the status of being in a relationship with a guy who I recognized as her cell group mate. It's one of her so-called "brothers". Maybe it's because they're on the "same level". LOL. Nonetheless, I gave her my well-wishes. And she replied, "Thanks." I hope all is well from here onward.

Has anyone here ever dated/married someone of a different religion? Is it possible to live in harmony despite different habits and different lifestyles?

In light of some entries about being a pathetic loner, if you don't wish to remain that way, there's a few things you can do to be more sociable. 

Err.. I can't say I'm a pro, I used to be a stay-home person and, at that time, I honestly ain't a tiny bit keen on expanding my social circle just because I'm so comfortable in my little bubbles of friends. It is until someday these little bubbles aren't that stable anymore when I decided to observe how sociable people interact and try to learn something while I was in army 2 years ago, yeah?(:

Making friends is a skill, though your personality being an introvert or being a naturally shy person, may make it harder to attain this skill as compared to others. Which is the case for me. But you'll get better with more practice, by not shunning people and think that they'll think badly of you. 

There's this 'shit tests' everyone will do on each other when they engage in a social interaction. These tests form impressions of the person we are interacting with. Failing these tests = they don't want to be friend with chiu. If you pass, then there'll be progress. The trick is not to be easily offended and instead, try to turn everything into a joke, and do a comeback even if the person is being rude (being rude is also a form of shit test). Comeback as in in the form of a joke. A counter. This takes practice though. For guys, I've seen many rude start offs but eventually they treat me with respect a friend ought to deserve. I guess I pass their shit test lah. It's like a test on your mental capability to deal with their jokes. This is from a guy's perspective lah, so it may or may not be applicable to a girl.

If they don't like how you interact with them, then nvm lah, there's always other people you can interact with right. Making mistakes is also part of learning what. By keep on experimenting your style with others, you'll eventually find someone or a group of friends that appreciate your humour.

Some people say they no humour, then watch running man, friends, or Ryan Sylvia lah keke. if you watch long enough, you'll learn a thing or 2. And then of course people naturally don't like pessimism one what, HTHT peeps comes when you have a better understanding of these friends/acquaintances you made, then eventually you 'uprank' them to your bruhs or sis. But you gotta treat them like bruhs and sis first (minus the HTHT part if they never initiate), then people will feel like you're a bruh or sis. You feel me? Is this confusing?
Oh ya, gotta be truthful also lah. I read up on body language and laymen psychology. Some people natural in social skills, but if you need the extra help, why not.

Social skills is like a show to finding real friends, imo. People ask you go out, just go only. Then people will want to ask you out again right, since you so anything. Don't be so troublesome like where to go also can decide 6 hours, it only makes people frustrated and don't wanna organize again.

I know some people would say something like 'just be yourself and you'll eventually find someone you can click with'. But imo, being yourself is not an excuse to not going for social events and try to make friends, that is unless, you want to be left alone lah. 

I know this entry is not gonna change your paradigm instantly, but I wish to like put some hope in you guys. You guys like spiraling down from what I read haha. Pick yourself up man, you guys aren't rejects, you just haven't learn the skills yet. Stepping out of your comfort zone and learning this skill is worth it:D. But once again, if you think you enjoy being alone then is fine lah, not forcing you yo, just an opinion. Ciaos(:

P.S. Korkors please have mercy on my entry): don't lambaste my singlish too much keke.
P.S.S you can do mayor Briggs personality test if you haven't done so to know what type of personality you are. ESFJ here(:

Hey , I really feel you and experiencing what you are going through too.

Sometimes when I look at photos from Instagram, I envy those group photos with smiling faces in it and hashtag like 10yearsfriendship, 3a1 etc.(regardless whether it is superficial or not). I tell myself that fate actually brought these like-minded people together and they are now close friend of each other. But deep down, I hope for this to happen on me. In the past, similar to what you have mentioned, I would think about who my close friends are, who I can talk to/depend on etc. Nowadays, I rarely think about it. Maybe it is due to me accepting the reality, or I am just ignoring it and let it fade away. Having said that, the feeling of envy will forever stay in me. 

And hi-five to you, Fuck all these insecurities. Being introvert, I find it hard to maintain friendship and until now I have no friends who can really understand the mess up feeling I have.

I still feel extremely lonely despite being part of various cliques (if you count being part of regular gatherings and involved in whatsapp group convos a clique), being in bash and many other activities. I see all these couples and groups of friends who have known each other for a really long time and have so much to talk about with one another and I wonder... why haven't I been able to stay in touch with my old friends and cliques for as long as they have? Why am I never able to find a significant other despite people telling me that I'm talented and good looking? Why do I feel so lonely despite being perceived by others as popular? This growing depression has been eating me up for the longest time ever since all the orientation camps and RAG and school began... It's killing me softly inside

Its true. If you are shy and quiet in engineering faculty and do not partake in other activities, chances of girls within the faculty noticing you is close to zero. It appears that guys like us are more noticeable to girls from other faculties cos we hate to hang out and socialise, which is very different from the guys in the supposingly more "outgoing" faculties. 

It feels weird and good at the same time that girls are texting and asking me why am I "absent" from group outing or why am I always alone. The shroud of mysteriousness must be driving them crazy lol. I am just a simple guy. I would rather be alone feeling alone than to be with a group of people feeling alone. 
So engineering guys don't be afraid and there is no need to feel desperate. One day someone will notice the hidden gem that is sitting at the corner of the room!

This happened last semester so I hope to know what are my chances this semester.

I like a girl and I think she like me back (although she said she hate me). Every time I text her, she will not reply but my friend told me she is totally into me. He told me she is just shy and she does that to attract my attention. Although she block me from Facebook, I still find her stalking my Facebook profile from time to time when I walk pass her in school. Face to face, she will tell me to move on and find another girl but I know that is not what she meant. There is this one day when she went to the washroom without her wallet and I made use of this opportunity to get her address from her IC. 

Knowing she has CCA on Tuesday night and that she loves chocolate, I would always made an extra trip to her house before she returns and put a kitkat bar there with my name written on the cover. I would then hide behind the stairs and wait for her home. I am not sure whether she appreciate what I am doing but she would always eat the chocolate outside or bring it into the house. I did that consecutively for one to two months and secretly took pictures of her eating the chocolate using my phone. I printed all of them out and wrote what I felt about her onto the photographs and handed it to her some time later. This might sound weird but I also pass her a small fancy jar filled with my tears when I cried thinking of her, hoping she would understand how I truly felt. In the end, she scolded me for stalking her and being crazy but I do not understand. If she does not like me why would she even eat my kitkat?

I felt betrayed that she is actually a gold-digger. If she really don't like me why must she eat all the kitkat I have bought for her? She could have paid for her own kitkat. Another friend of mine told me she scolded me just to confuse me. She wants to play hard to get. Through some CSI, I managed to get the same four modules with her so I am going to have a lot of time with her this semester. I hope she appreciate what I am doing for her. 

Forever and Beyond. 

Anything for you XL. I love you so much.

Do girls get turn off with guys who are balding? It has become a major self-esteem issue.

People are asking if girls like bad guys more than nice guys... And im here wondering if guys like bad girls more than good girls...? Lets disregard the aesthetic appeal for this question lol.

To . Hi there, I just want to tell you that you're not alone. I have been part of big groups and hall groups and I really hate it sometimes. There are too many hi-bye friends and soon you'll realize, they don't matter at all. To be honest, if you're in a whatsapp chat with a group of friends, sometimes they will only respond to the popular kid. The kid who is more kaopei, more funny or what so ever. I too get rejected sometimes but try to find someone in the group you're close to. If you're close to someone in that group, when you suggest something, at least he or she has got your back! It helps! And if they all really reject you, you can go out with him or her! I personally prefer going on 1-1 dates with my bestfriend to chill and talk about life. Instead of going out with 10-20 people talking about nonsense (when really nobody gives a shit what you're talking about, half the time it is about making fun of the joker of the group). 

And yes, learn to love yourself. We all yearn for some form of connection with people but don't rush it. Perhaps you have not met your true friend yet. In the mean time, enjoy a book by yourself or just hang out at a quiet cafe. It can be really nice. Or you can travel! Discover just how beautiful the world is. Few years down the road, you'll realize that your hi-bye friends don't matter.

Who was the male dancer from Chronos at Rag&Flag? Hes so good!
-
 
 
Hey there, I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling like this. I went to the Rag performance alone too. I even knew people in the Rag group, and even helped out somewhat. On Rag day itself I went down specifically to cheer them on, but when I messaged them I got ignored. Wonderful right? 
A bit of background, I am currently a year 5 student, evergreen.  Most of the friends in my batch have graduated, so now I am surrounded by freshies I know nothing about, due to internship - thus missing rag and fop, and the juniors I used to be close with are now all moving on to become "clique leads" themselves. So while the situation may not be exactly the same, I know where you are. Painfully, painfully so. 
I decided I didn't want to feel like that though.
I decided I would enjoy myself as much as I could, or each moment would have been a waste of time. It may sound cliche, but no one can make you feel anything but yourself. In the case of Rag day, I indulged in some Kebab, and found various groups of friends who went and hung with them each a little. I danced like I didn't care when Christina Grimmie got on stage. In daily life, when planning outings, I name the people I want answers from in the group chat. If people ditch me I go out anyway and enjoy a movie on my own. It's tiring, and really draining at times, I know, but it takes effort to get the things you want. 
Like you wrote, I too feel like there's some part of me that's flawed, that I should be receiving the kind of treatment everywhere I go. But I have faith that as we keep taking those long looks at ourselves, and strive to make better of ourselves, that one day we'll have a breakthrough. 
Chin up and fight on!

I've been working at my new workplace for a few months and have developed feelings for my colleague. The fact that I think about him all the time is starting to get worrying. On the one hand, I want to know what he thinks of me and have been dropping subtle hints that I like him. But on the other hand, I have heard horror stories of office crushes/ romance. My friends have also warned me against them. Should I continue to drop hints and hope that it will work out or should I just give up and forget him entirely? 
-
 
I'm approaching 21, and I'm evergreen. I have close friends, but I can't really remember the last time we went out. I've lost some close friends. A few got retained in JC/dropped out, a few drifted apart when we were busy with Army, and a few chose to focus on friends made during Orientation camps. 

I'm trying to seek alternatives. Trying to hold closer those that are still in contact. Going for a Run, do some readings, and spend more time with my family. This allowed me to do some introspection.

I'd let the one-sided relationship in Sec 3 affect me too much. I'm shunning any close relationships. On top of that, my parents were not really outwardly expressive with their feelings. We never spoke of my struggles in studies, birds and the bees, nor my suicide attempt during NS.

I've always wondered, am I so bad I relationships because I suffer from alexitymia. I'm unable to describe negative feelings i feel beyond physical synthoms of  'a heavy heart'. I've long accepted emotional isolation as part of my construct.  Maybe disappointment and non-reciprocation had led to me not willing to take up responsibilities in relationships. 

I just hope I can function well enough to remain afloat.

Sometimes I feel like my bf doesn't understand why his ex affects me so much. Sometimes I feel that doing it with him was a mistake. Sometimes I can ignore everything and move on with life, sometimes I can't. Help ):

TL;DR: I'm a pathetic loner. 

Hey , i totally understand how you feel, because i think that is what im going through as well. We are kinda similar, but also kinda different. I also feel super lonely at times, so i just end up staying at home or hiding at one corner so that ppl dont judge me as a "loner with no friends". 

There are many places or things that i wanna go/do, but then i realise that i dont even know who to ask out. Even if i do, I'll just get rejected. Me and my clique are drifting further and further apart, which really saddens me. They are probably the closest group of friends that i have, but might no longer be anymore. Who else can i fall back on? Family? Nope. My family members are all working, they dont have time for me. And also because of the big age gap between me and the rest of them, there seems to be nothing to talk about. 

Since i was a kid, i already felt like i lacked family love because none of them had time for me. Well, i can't completely blame them because they need to work to earn the money for my education, im thankful for that. But also because they are always working and have no time for me, I've always felt super envious of others whom i see having a happy family. When i have troubles, i dont tell my family, because they won't understand anything. So i try to turn to my friends instead. When my clique were still close, I was still okay. But as years go by and we slowly drift apart with some getting attached, some at different unis/courses, it was then i realise that I dont have anyone else. 

When I joined the orientation camp as a freshie, i didnt get to befriend as many ppl as i expected to. In fact, i doubt anyone in my OG still keeps in contact. Im starting year 3 now, and i dont even have anyone that i can really call a "friend", maybe more of "acquaintances". I only hang out with one other friend, but if she's absent, I'll be alone again. This sem, we are no longer taking the exact same mods, so I'm really quite worried that I'll have to loner during certain lessons. 

Im glad to see some ppl commenting to feel free to pm them, etc, but its not as easy to take that step to reveal my identity, which is why I'm ranting anonymously. CCAs take up a lot of time, and I'm already struggling with my acads. Im aware of the nusmeetme thing, but similarly, i really dont want any of my friends/acquaintances to know I'm there because I'll just be labeled as a "despo". Fuck all these insecurities.

At this stage, im about to just give up on making new friends in uni and just get out of this school asap. Uni has taken such a toll on me, i dont know how much longer i can tahan. 

Every night before i sleep, i think about this: No friends/family to depend on/talk to, I'm so pathetic. When will i ever find someone that can understand me and go through the ups and downs with me? 

To the people who have someone like that with you, be grateful and cherish them. Not everyone is as lucky as you are.

Is it just me,or is radio silence just the accepted way of getting out of a dating situation you don't like nowadays? 

In the past 2 years I've met 3 girls. We'd go out for a few months, hit it off quite well, texting each other everyday, stay up late talking, and one of them we nearly went all the way (but stopped ourselves out of mutual agreement).  Then all of a sudden... Radio silence. Like they're busy, cancelled plans, don't reply to texts, etc. Like, really? 

Personally, I think it's immature and it's a lame way of taking the easy way out. It shows that the person doesn't respect the feelings of the other and I have never done it, nor do I intend to. If you don't think it will work, just tell me and I honestly will respect you for it.

Is my thinking old-fashioned?

This is a real problem I'm having. I'm kind of big down there  (length and width) and I find it difficult to have sex sometimes. Only 2 weeks ago I had a great night with this girl but I could not enter her more than half a cm because I was too big/ she was too tight. We ended up doing everything but sex after trying for 15 minutes. Any advice on how to make the fit easier? 
-
 
 Dear OP, don't want to sound too harsh but you said you have met 3 girls, and you have encountered this problem every single time, then I think maybe you should reflect on the things you have said and done, maybe you have unexpectedly offended them in one way or another, or have somehow portrayed yourself as a stalker or someone who is desperate. Girls tend to be a bit sensitive sometimes (sorry about that). And when you are talking about meeting up, if you didn't make it clear they are dates, then girls may just consider that as hangout with friends. Late night texts also don't mean anything, it can be that they are just trying to be polite and keep the conversation going. And later on, they might find you a bit bugging, so decided to ignore all your messages. The conversation between you and the girls are also important, if it's always about the same things, and given that they are not interested in you (as a friend or more than friend), it would bore them.
And if you have made your intentions clear to them, then it's quite probable that they don't want to lead you on in any way. And honestly, sometimes I think it's better to not reply to the texts and cancel the plans than giving any false hope.

Reading the comments to  makes me feel more uncomfortable than the post itself. 

Not everyone has the luck to find someone willing to convert for you. Find the person first and leave religion to the last. How easy to oversimplify the matter. I'm sorry I tried that and my heart was left in pieces. Religion is still a big part of life for many people and not talking about it doesn't not help.

It sucks that as young adults in this religiously diverse campus we don't have a space for us to speak face to face frankly about religion with people who are not the same as you. Tired of listening to friends who tell me it doesn't matter or to pray on it. :(

I really cannot stand girls who Instagram/snapchat a photo that focuses largely on their cleavage while their caption is an unrelated topic like "happy SG50" etc. just to garner likes. I don't care if this post gets hate or people commenting that maybe I have small boobs or are jealous of these people or just unfollow them comments, it just really really irks me.
-
 
So sad that I only get to spend a day with you and Im really glad I came out of my comfort zone to try to know you better. Normally I would never ever spend time alone with people I do not know well and it surprises me that we got along pretty well. F*** social anxiety…always making me balance the risks vs rewards for going out with friends. 
-
 
To  : I'm going through the same thing with my boyfriend. He thinks he's not good for me and my future will be affected. I want to tell you what I told him. You are the best for him. Don't worry about the future! Worrying about the future does no good. All that matters is that the both of you go through everything and never give up on each other. It honestly does not make sense that you think someone else out there is better for him. Who else could be better for him than you? Who puts his happiness before your own? That is true love. I'm going through loads right now and it's not easy! Im saying this because I'm sure you don't want him to go through so much pain. Dont give up on something so amazing that you have right now  fearing something that might or might not happen in the future. 
-
 
Don't want me as your boyfriend then at least we can be friend.

Don't want to be friend with me then at least don't delete me from your Facebook.

Don't want to add me on Facebook then at least allow me to follow your instagram. 

Don't allow me to follow your instagram then at least don't ignore me.

Want to ignore me  then at least don't bad mouth me to other girls.

That why I envy people who were friend zoned by their crush. I am 4 levels below them.

Why should I be seen as some creepy guy by every girls  just because of you?

As a freshie I feel this whole 'traffic light' thing is ridiculous... why don't we just say single/taken/complicated like normal people do?

Where are all these "Nice Guys"? Why has none tried to woo me :( #SadGirl

Argh seeing pictures of my crush hanging out so much with new friends he made in camp make me feel like crap... I know I should just confess and get over him but im just too shy :(

I want to be somebody's first love; their first relationship. I wonder at this point, if it's still possible that there are evergreen, virgin guys who have never had relationships, and have never gotten physical with girls before, who believe in sex after marriage. I just want to be THAT important to somebody, and to mean so much and be so significant to somebody for once.

Is it normal to hold a grudge against someone who led you on? Its been haunting me even though its been more than half a year.. seems like I'll never forget the hurt and humiliation.

I am evergreen (and I really am) and have decided that my island home, Singapore will be my girlfriend from now onwards. I am grateful for her and will always protect her till my very last breath. If anyone criticise me, I wont feel offended but if anyone ever make fun of her, I will come after the person and I will. I feel so comfortable and happy with her around me that I will never ever leave her by my side. (Though I may still go for short holidays and SEP but I will miss her badly and will always have her in my mind). I am proud of her progress over the years and she is definitely proud of my achievements. I still have to thanks her for giving me the many chances to succeed. If anyone were to ask me for my traffic light colour from now onwards, I will definitely tell them I am attached to Singapore and don’t ever think of having me leaving her or taking her away from me. If I were to really ever have a girlfriend, I wish she can understand that I will love Singapore more. Last but not least, I will like to wish all Singaporeans a happy national day. I hope to see Singapore (my home and my girlfriend) continue to prosper and progress in the years ahead. Happy 50th birthday Singapore! You have make us all proud to be called Singaporeans and we are thankful of you giving us equal chances to succeed individually.

I hated the fact that my dad seems to impose on me what is the ideal body for a girl eg not muscular. He said nasty things about me being muscular. Truth is I am turning more muscular and bulkier due to regular gym training but I am not concerned at all since I am intending to stay single anyway. My dad don't seems too happy with me training that hard and I suspect it's because he is afraid that no guys would want to chase me if I am muscular. If he wish that I will eventually get married, that's his problem. Why try to impose on me that I should not make myself more muscular? Why hope that guys will chase me and I will eventually settle down when I said countless of times I wish to stay single?

I am tired of being the second option all the time. I am never anyone's priority. It makes me feel so lonely. I am not in a relationship and I get the feeling that my friends don't consider me important too.

I shifted to campus accommodation recently and it feels so bad to do everything alone all the time. I meet and chat with my cluster neighbours when we meet in the kitchen and corridors but that is all the interaction we have. 

I have classmates staying in the same hostel and I asked them to call me when they go out or have dinner together. They said 'yes of course' while texting but never called me. As I scrolled through my Instagram feed and opened Snapchat, I saw photos of the group hanging out together, clubbing, going for outings, going to the beach, and tears welled up in my eyes. It is not just their clique that went out. They called friends from outside their clique, but apparently I did not deserve to be called. Sometimes I wonder whether I should uninstall these social media accounts but it sounds like an escapist solution.

I belong to a clique too but it is not so strong. My best friends like to go out with their boyfriends and those who are single, prefer spending time with their other friends. I doubt they even consider me as their best friend. Usually, no one wants to join if I suggest going out, participating in competitions, etc. What's worse than hearing 'no' as a reply is not even getting a reply at all, as if I am not even worth a few minutes of their time.

Recently, I watched the RAG performance alone. No one joined me when I asked. The circumstances were such that it wasn't my friend's fault but I was not in a mood to analyse and reason. I felt sad as I saw others holding hands with their romantic partners or sitting and enjoying the show with a group of friends. I tried to enjoy alone, but I couldn't stop crying. Thankfully, it was dark and  I went to the top where there was an empty row of seats and cried as much as I wanted. I had taken a ticket for my friend earlier in the morning and I tore it into pieces.

I sat over there wondering what was wrong with me. Why am I rejected all the time? It must be me because I receive the same kind of behaviour from different sets of friends, so it is not their fault. I like spending time alone once in a while, but too much of it becomes painful. I really can't take it sometimes.

Sometimes when my friends decline going out with me, they tell me to go out with my family. I nod and end the conversation right there. Truth is, due to health reasons, my parents avoid going to crowded places. They can't stand for too long in the MRT, can't walk continuously for a long time, can't stand in long queues, need to eat at regular timings and need a lot of rest. Anyway, they don't like to go out. Being the only child, I have no one else in my family I can go out with. I don't want to give these explanations so I just say 'yes' when people suggest I go out with my family. 

My parents feel sorry for me and say that I am young and should not be confined to the four walls of the house. They encourage me to go out with my friends. I can't bring myself to tell them that my friends don't love me as much as you do. I am an option for them, not a priority. I get rejected and declined for most of the things I say.

So during this jubilee weekend, when everyone is out with their family and friends, I am sitting at home, writing code and fixing bugs for the project I did for my internship,
-
 
I am a bad boy. Any girls interested?
-
 
A guy who used to be possibly the best friend of my entire life just unfriended me on Facebook today because things turned sour between us over the years. I feel so ridiculously hurt when I saw the "add friend" button next to his name. Should I confront him about it? We were mostly back to normal terms and our last conversation a few months back was also normal. 
-
 
To  - I used to be the same way, and in some ways, I still am. My problem was that I had too few friends, friends who hated going out, friends who were in relationships, friends who were busy with CCAs, friends who lived I'm another part of campus, or friends I didn't like at all. I used to get quite lonely sometimes, even breaking down and crying occasionally. Whenever I wanted to do something fun, like go out wherever, my friends would decline, and I want confident enough to go alone.

So what has changed?

Well, me.

You have to realize that you cant control what your friends do. You can control what you do, what you say, how you behave. Most of all, you have to learn to love yourself and enjoy your own company. I'm not going to give suggestions like join a club lor, or be more open etc etc. I'm going to tell you what worked for me.

Whenever I felt lonely, I called up my parents or grandparents. Remember, they're probably much lonelier than you and would be overjoyed if you call and talk to them. It feels nice to know that you're loved and needed by someone.

After you've spoken to them, go out for a walk or a run. Best time for introspection.

Next- if you live on campus, go and chill out at the 24 hour lounges/common rooms/Starbucks. You'll be surrounded by people and that decreases loneliness.

I've been part of such groups before, and I hated the experience. If you don't know a lot of people, you're not part of the inside jokes, you feel left out, whatever. At the end of the day, when they Instagram a group photo and tag you, you'll just have an unpleasant recollection of the meetup ( while others think you probably had an awesome time)

I swear, do not trust social media.

Don't worry, you'll be fine.

I am evergreen, never gone on any dates and always feel upset and envy when seeing couple holding hands. Sometimes, I asked myself if there is anything wrong with me since I am fast approaching 30 and still evergreen ( is it my looks, am I too boring or is it I am too shy to approach girls since I always got rejected by my crush ) I always wonder how happy life will be if I can have a girlfriend whom I can go out with to have a meal, visit attractions and check out the latest cafe and chat the entire day. I think at the very best that can only happen in my dream. Thinking of having a girlfriend in my lifetime seems to be as good as thinking of a visit to our nearest star.
-
 
I think you should ask him directly as well. If he hasn't been getting the hints, what are the chances he will get them if you drop more hints? If he has gotten the hints, don't you want a definite answer and an explanation if it's more complicated than just he's not interested in you?

It's hard to make a deduction that he's interested in you solely on the fact that he talks to you more than he does so to other girls. He may just be concerned about you as a friend and is nice to everyone in general. Or he might just find you to be a good friend to talk to or both.

Pluck up your courage and save yourself the agonies, time and potential future regrets. This goes for everyone and any other aspect of their lives.

I don't get it. I was once a nice guy and always been there if anyone needs me / being kind to everyone WITHOUT expecting anything in return and girls treat me like doormat. Now that I pretend to be a douche, girls start flocking to me. What sorcery is this??? It will be nice if someone likes me for who I am. OFC, I don't mind trampling all over you if you want me to.

This is shy guy week. Ladies, how do you manage to break those barrier down and get them to become your BF?

I developed a serious crush on my female colleague at work. For a few months, I was literally dreaming every other night about her. I was so smitten with her that I started to do things such as filling up her bottle for her before she arrived at her desk every morning etc. 

I was thinking of ways and means to get closer to her. One day, I was tasked organise a company dinner I asked her for help with the intent of trying to get closer to her. Initially, she didn't decline and was kind enough to help in what I asked. However, as the commitments grew, she started to become uncooperative and extremely annoyed with me. She didn't even want to turn up for the dinner on the day itself even though she told the bosses she was helping me. 

I was so angry with her that I told her the bosses were asking for the namelist of those who would not be attending (which was true). But I did it in a manner that must have made her felt threatened. In any case, she did turn up and did her job during the dinner. But thereafter, she left first, leaving me to pack up everything behind.

The day after, and over the past six months, I gave her the cold shoulder because I was really mad with her.

But as time passed, I know I was the one at fault. I got her to help because I was too selfish to care about her feelings. I asked her to help because I wanted to get close to her. How stupid of me! It was also childish of me to give her the cold shoulder when it was all my fault from the beginning.

I want to apologise to her but I don't know how to do it. I want to say sorry not because I want her forgiveness. I don't deserve it anyway.

I want to do so because she deserves my fullest apologies for the crap she had to go through.

I often wear romper when i go out with my friends. My friends always say i am well dressed. Do guys get intimidated by well dressed ladies?

I cry as I type this, but I need to rant.

You'll probably skip over this post, but I'm just going to write it anyway.

When we were just friends, our friendship was perfect. We had so much fun exploring Singapore together, despite having lived here our whole lives. It was different exploring with you. Everything felt so light, airy and positive, doing simple things together. Food adventures, day trips to Malaysia, dessert, visits to the library, exercising together. Our deep conversations. It was all so simple but yet you were so different from other guys. I was intrigued. Happy. I knew that it was impossible for us to be together because my family would never approve, but I was so content with simply having you as a beautiful soul in my life. We spent so much time together. Naturally, we fell in love. 

You make me feel...safe. You make me feel like I can carry on living this difficult life, like I can face up to the problems of this world that try to knock me down every single day. You're always a Whatsapp text away, you're with me in my darkest moments.

Despite all the safety and quality time that you try your best to give me, I feel like we cannot communicate because of our different upbringings. When I tell you about my quirks, I feel like you listen for that moment, remember it for that day, but let it go after that conversation. In terms of emotional intimacy, I need us to go deeper. I need you to WANT to go deeper. I get enough superficial conversations from my acquaintances, but you're so content with simplicity.

Even though I so desperately want to, I don't know if we can spend the rest of our lives together. You could do so much better in this life with someone else who can support you, who's more emotionally stable. Sometimes, I feel like you're so tired of supporting me and of satisfying my need for constant conversation. I'm so sorry for demanding more than you have to give. I'll try my best to stop. I'll find that somewhere else.

I'm imperfect and troublesome. Every now and then, I'm filled with self-loathing. In these moments, I wonder how I can fully love someone if I can't even love myself.

No matter what happens, know that I love you very deeply. You are my first love, my deepest love, my best friend. For you fighting so hard to make this work - thank you a thousand times. If I ever leave, it's because I genuinely want the best for you and your family. I think you deserve a girl who can make you happy most of the time. Life is too short and I don't want you to spend yours settling for second best.

I love you so much my dear. I always will, no matter what happens to us.

Hey does anyone know what happened to the Bare Nusessities page? It was quite interesting and nice. I noticed it started getting less and less active and then stopped posting for a really long time now. I kind of miss it.

I got rejected back in jc. But for some reason my feelings for her wont go away, and I thought maybe NS would help me get over her. But no. I think about her all the time during NS. There was a time that I wanted to switch over to NTU just so that I will have a 0% chance of meeting her in school, but it felt like I shouldn't let her dictate which university I should go to. Or maybe it was just that NTU is really far away. After not staying in touch/meeting up for years I suddenly texted her and asked her how she was doing. We then chatted for a while, and it felt like we have been meeting up/texting regularly, there was no awkward moment. It felt like I stood a chance, but somehow I just did not want to try going after her again even though the way she texts me makes me feel like she has feelings for me too. Currently I do not think I still have feelings for her, but I still find myself wanting to know what's going on in her life and how she's doing. We still text each other occasionally and our conversations can go on and on and I really enjoy texting her. So NUSWhisperers, what do you think? Is it possible that I still have feelings for her?

Recently i've been talking to a guy more than he would talk to other girls... It seems to me that he's interested and im actually also interested. However, just about 2 months back, he was sort of amber with one girl but i dont know how it actually proceeded :/ should i still continue giving hints that im interested in him even though im unsure of his traffic light status and that girl?

What would you do if your crush/friend invites you for his wedding? I have been close to a guy for a year now but I never expressed my feelings for him because we were always friends. But, he recently met someone (I won't say how lest he reads this post) and now he's asking me to their wedding. I have agreed but I wonder how will I feel during the wedding. As of now I'm already distraught and sinking into depression.

Hi! I have a story to tell, its not very interesting but it might be worth a read for everyone facing relationship problems. I don’t claim to be right or wrong, nor do I know if what happened was an accurate reflection of the average NUS student’s experience, but this is just what happened to me. 

Firstly it might help to describe myself, I am a tall, above average looking, average intelligence, average fitness, average talents (NUS IVP team and play the guitar alittle), relatively forgettable upon sight but memorable upon first conversation kind of guy. 

Brought up in a traditional and conservative family, I was never the type to party, or wreck havoc or spend too much time with the “popular crowd”, put simply, I was a good boy. I dated a girl up till the point I started Uni, when things changed. Dating before uni was simple, not that it was easy, but simple meaning straight forward, I like you, you like me, lets go on an adventure, just the two of us! But dating in uni becomes more complicated, it got me both emotionally confused but also curious. Like most of us here, I never knew what kind of girl I wanted, and probably never will, I mean we know whos hot and who we’re attracted to, we even list criteria which we look for in a person but almost always end up with someone with totally opposite traits. My peers in engineering always complained about being in the friendzone but I never believed them, I always equaled friendzone to rejection, it had the same process and the same result. 

I was attached to someone when I entered uni. We had a sweet pleasant relationship, both our parents liked us, we wrote notes and made scrapbooks, and travelled together and all. She was a good girl but changed as the camps started, partying and drinking and what not, we still had a regular dating life(meet up regularly, safe sex, sincere conversation), but slowly she started seeing another guy she met at a club, whom which most would label as your typical “douchebag”, she told me she was drifting and felt attracted to someone else, I tried my best but I respected her decision to pursue her own happiness and let her go. 

We remained friends even though we only broke up after she started dating him, but she was often heartbroken and always placed on an emotional rollercoaster while she was with him. He would treat her badly and rudely for weeks at a time, only to make up for it with a big yet shallow gesture like an expensive gift, or throwing a birthday party. By then ive moved on from her but was still concerned as a friend, she often complained to me and our mutual friends about him but I kept my distance and offered rapport as a friend. Soon I found out he was also sleeping with/dating other girls(I was not surprised),  but I decided that it was not my business to tell her. Eventually she found out and was so heart broken and drowned herself in parties/alcohol and new friends, and easily found another “douche” which was there for her at that time. That was the last we spoke, not because of anything but because she had changed so much that I could not hold a conversation with her anymore.

I was not dating anyone else during that time, I mean I went on dates and all but nothing developed, I would have an initial spark with most girls but things would fade away after afew dates. I don’t think I was a boring person, nor a turn off, my friends say im quite humorous, sociable and have many common hobbies. When asked, most of my dates would give usual reasons like, im really busy with school work, oh my cca pracs are increasing, the honest ones would say they are not interested anymore or started seeing someone else, but the most peculiar reasons were stuff like, you are too good for me,  you are too nice. Initially I accepted anything they said and told myself it was just lack of compatibility, but I couldn’t help but question their(and my ex gf’s) choice of boyfriends, I cant say im better than these guys, but if I were a girl, I wouldn’t date someone who treats me as these “douches” treat them. I think im a pleasant, honest, decent and relatively attractive guy, but I found it difficult to see how those choices seemed more attractive. So I decided to conduct a social experiment.

In year 3, I decided to be a “douchebag”, it sound ridiculous, but it actually was much easier than it sounds. I joined the camp parties in summer before sem1, drank with new friends and interacted with people outside my circle of engineering peers. I never really enjoyed it beyond the alcohol high and occasional fun music in clubs, but I did it more out of curiosity and boredom, despite it being an expensive lifestyle(each party costs guys about 30+ per entry, another 30 for drinks, and another 30 to pay for girls drinks and taxi because they will forget to bring their wallets with almost 100% certainty, I don’t blame the girls id do it too if im a girl cus there will always be a guy who would pay for u, ironically with money allowance probably from parents). 

It was incredible, I could easily hit things off with girls even before we’ve gotten to know each other well enough, I lived on campus so the hookups were convenient. Because of the constant blasts of attention and having my mind being occupied with hangovers and scrambling to keep up with engineering school work anytime im awake, I often responded late and poorly and sometimes even rudely to my dates, and other girls im texting at the same time. But to my surprise, they always text back! I didn’t officially get together with anyone of them, but we dated like a regular couple each time, (meetups, safe sex, but not as much conversation), I guess I didn’t really get to know them and they didn’t really know me, because the turnover rate was so high (change partner every few months or weeks even), it seemed too tiring to invest too much into a person. I really liked each girl I dated but never got the chance to really fall in love, but I mean, it was better than nothing in year 1 and 2, at least I was trying, maybe the next one would be the one right? 

Towards the end of year 3 I was running out of money, my cap fell almost 1 class, and ive forgotten about my old friends. I reduced and eventually stopped partying and did more healthy activities and joined ccas in school. My cap improved and towards the end of sem 2 I met someone in tutorial class and we started dating. I went back to my old self, a good boy, I was patient, kind, a good listener and did things any decent person would do. She was an honest and direct person, really easy to talk to so I told her about my past, she told me that she was starting to lose interest in me,  I asked why and she gave me an answer that kind of blew my mind, she said I was too easy. She said guys like me, will always be there for her, if they are sad and they ask, I would listen and be there, she could get me anytime she wanted, she didn’t need to put much effort to do so. Yes it was nice and pleasant, but she said girls like her, and even guys, want and desire things they cannot get. When I was not myself (as a douche to be put simply), I was hard to get, I was hot and cold to the people around me, I replied late to texts and sometimes did not show up, I was difficult to get and therefore, seen as more desirable. But when she met this other hot, charming guy who's interest in her vary like a sin wave, she craved for his attention.

It made me realise the case was the same for guys, guys are always blind to the nice girls around them who more likely than not will never reveal themselves to their crushes, and secretly feel sad that these guys only go for the hot, pretty, party girls whom are “douchegirls” simply because its something they cannot obtain. But everyone forgets the simple fact that, what is hard to obtain may not be necessarily good for you, or would make you happy. 

Now, im entering my final year, im still as confused as anyone else as to how relationships work and how the world works for the matter. I don’t think anyone really knows, everyone speaks from their own experience and stubbornly think they are right, but im glad I did what I did, it was an interesting adventure. Im looking forward to the next adventure id embark on.

I really hate the new IVLE. Why fix something that wasn't broken?
-
 
I don't get the whole nice guy/bad boy debate. 

I've been with both. I realised the douche was just too tiring and had too much drama to be with (and i had better things to do with my life). The nice guy was always there for me and was always so encouraging with whatever i do so i accepted him and it's been a great 3 years. 

Idk why girls say nice guy too easy so dont wanna be with them. Easy is good what got more time for your work? And parents also happy to see a nice guy? You all like drama with bf and conflict with parents meh?

Im new to NUS... Im an international student here, and honestly I'm more than worried about the other student's attitude towards me being both muslim and international... Ive experienced first hand how nice and welcoming people here are, but my main concern is whether or not people will actually want to be friends with me... truth be told, I know that to many people when they see someone with a head scarf on, they'd automatically assume that this person is not approachable or too conservative, or even not fun to hang out with... maybe even intimidating... all I'm I'm trying to is that i would like for everyone to understand that we, as girls who wear headscarfs and are international, are not who you think us to be... we are just like anyone else around you... we like to have fun, want to make friends, want to hangout and go out with others of our peers, and so on so forth. It is already hard for me when I, myself, feel like an outsider and like i don't fit in here without anyone else making it official, so it would be really nice if the students here would keep an open mind about it... and keep in mind that if you see someone who seems like they are antisocial or trying to keep to herself (That person could be me), it highly possible that she does not know how to approach people first... so maybe it'd be a good idea to approach her first... (Again, that could be me... just saying)... And then last but not least, there is the fact that most students here come with their own group of friends and know many of the students without having to go through the process of meeting new people in order to make friends, and it worries me that no one would approach me even more so since they'd most probably have their own group of friends already... I really don't mean to complain or gain pity from anyone, I'm saying this because I'm worried... what do you think...

Hi , I think putting in effort to look good in itself is a very attractive trait, but not to the point of being super vain. I like girls who bother to dress up a bit :), and I think it doesn't make them any less (or more) approachable.
-
 
If I could turn back the clock, go back 2 years ago, I would have hugged you tightly, and never let you go. I shoved you away, thinking that no, it is not fair for me to treat you as a rebound, thinking that the other guy would be able to bring you happiness. I threw attitude problems, angry at the fact that no, I am not worthy enough for you. Now, you're happily attached to another guy, and I am out of your life entirely. I have changed for the better, but you are no longer there. It has been a lonely journey, and I am at my final year. Seeing how you are happy right now, I would want to remain alone.

I hope to get this off my chest, and hope that even if you see this, I really wish you well.

I have a confession/rant to make. 

I am actually very insecure about my self-worth in relations to having a relationship or finding love in my life. And I hate it when people throw the line "oh don't worry you're just 22, and what's more you're a guy, and guys only get better with age and then girls will be throwing themselves at you!" 

I come from a stable and semi-privileged background, however my emotional upbringing and mental stability has never been one of my stronger points in life. Ten straight years of suffering from bullying episodes in the local education system had thoroughly wrecked any emotional self-worth and self-love I can feel for myself, and as I grew older in my teenage years hormonal changes kicked in. All this meant that much of my search for self-validation and affirmation of self-worth to people in general, and females in specific ended up being skewed in the direction of proving my manhood through sexual contact and intimacy. 

Recently I've done some self-reflection and I have come to the discomforting conclusion that my current mental model of gauging someone's compatibility of a relationship or romance with me has become almost irretrievably skewed towards the terms of "how compatible are they with me in bed?" Not to say I'm a serial womaniser, but I recognised that perhaps I've grown too good at concealing my own inner wounds and shortfalls in emotional and mental stability by emphasising on physical sexual prowess through any means available. I tell myself that because I'm always putting the girl's needs before mine I'm the good guy, when in reality I'm just using their satisfaction and pleasure at my ministrations to fuel my own desires for approval and acceptance from a female, as if it was only because of what I could do with my little finger that would endear a woman to me and not because of who and what I am as a whole. 

I don't like feeling like damaged goods, but that is the unfortunate reality I recognise in myself as well. Having gone through a traumatic LDR breakup last October I'm still struggling to put my life back together, and I've grown very cold, callous and skeptical of emotional attachments and commitments to people in general. I tell myself that no, I've got my armor back on, and I will no longer be hurt by wanting romance and love like what any human would want. I wouldn't just use and dump someone either just to get my rocks off, but I wouldn't dare take any openings for a relationship seriously any longer and would sooner end it on my own accord than take the risk and fall again into genuinely feeling love for someone. 

But inside me I know I've not changed. The more I see people around me being able to enjoy the friendships and romances they can form in their lives because they haven't had their self-esteem wrecked to such an extent the more bitter I feel for myself. The more I hear about people from my cohort who are getting hitched and married within the next two years I wonder to myself just exactly what the hell have I done to deserve such rotten luck when it comes to humans and relationships of any kind. I know my addiction to sexual gratification of others and of myself is chewing me up inside, and yet it is but the most familiar show of intimacy and "love" I know and am able to hold my own and prove my worth to the opposite sex. And above all else, I fear missing out on life and love, that I'll be the one left on the shelf and when the day comes that finally someone finds me or I find them, they'd just be settling for less and pitying me instead of actually loving me. I don't buy into societal logic about how age works in a man's favour, because relationships only turn more and more materialistic/calculated as one grows older. Can he provide a stable life for me? Can he earn enough to support our family? Is his social status prestigious enough? Why do people find it necessary to equate age to maturity, success, and increased eligibility for bachelors in life? And what does it do to a male ego to know that some young thing is fawning for his attention because of the money in his bank account, the job he works at, the car he might be driving, or simply because they think age is the perfect illusion of maturity and therefore stability? 

I want to love again. And I want my own happy ending. People tell me not to chase fate, and just let time take it's course. Then who decides that some people get their Happy Ever Afters first, while others take fall after fall through no fault of their own and end up so bruised and hurt they're almost good for nothing else?

On the outside, I'm brash, outspoken, with my heart on my sleeve, and yet loyal almost to a fault. Who's to see how damaged and tearful I am inside emotionally? That nothing matters more to me in life than having a woman to hold your hand and give you a welcoming hug at the end of every day, to remind you that you're never alone in the world to enjoy your successes and suffer your failures?  

To that woman of my life that is still shrouded in the future, I'm sorry for the mess I am when you might find me once the time arrives. I'm sorry for believing too hard in making my own fate. I'm sorry for having thrown myself physically and emotionally too hard into hopes of winning over all those other women who would never have been able to stay in my life. I'm sorry that beyond the acts of physical intimacy in the bedroom I have next to no means of establishing trust and commitment to you, because the intellectual me is too on guard to open myself up willingly to trusting without touching. And I hope you forgive me, because no matter how messed up I am inside, I'll still want to love you and be with you till the end of our times.

I am afraid to fall in love as I get jealous easily. Whenever I see my crush with another guy in a pictures  on Facebook or just walking around with another guy, I automatically give up on her. I can't bring myself to go after anyone because of this despite various hints from more than a few girls. Am I the only one like this or is there something wrong with me?
-
 
So my GF have been saying I am cold to her recently. She does not really like me being too involved with computer games. TI5, first world problem.

How do you know that girls are checking you out and you are not having delusions? More than 5 seconds stare?

that feeling when you type something in a group chat with 50 people, and no one replies........but when someone else starts some stirring then everyone is online and talking.....sian
-
 
Why do guys suddenly ignore your texts even though you have been chatting comfortably for a while. Is there a reason for not replying you and not even reading your messages but still continue to reply others?
And also they suddenly MIA for a period of time before contacting you again. What is this? Playing the hard-to-get game?
-
 
I am afraid of making friends and revealing too much about myself. When I talk, I usually talk about studies, or my family, or just laugh along with the others. This is all due to my fear of embarassing myself in front of others. I remember all the silly mistakes I made in the past, and even if my friends just comment lightly or make a joke, their words are still stuck in my memory. I am sure that they have forgotten everything by now, but those embarassing incidents(regardless of how small), still haunt me.

Thus, I find it really hard to make friends whom I can talk a bit more freely to. Even last sem, I only made new friends because of an old classmate I bumped into, and I managed to enter her clique. This sem, I have a number of modules without them. I hope that someone can approach me when I sit alone during lecture, so that I need not be the one to take the first step.

And to those who are mistaking me for trying to find a partner, sorry, I am just looking for a friend.

Whenever I see a NUSWhispers post, I will always open and see who have commented. Upon some research a.k.a stalking, i realized that there are 5 groups of people.

1. the posters: these people are very good storytellers, and while many of them may appear to be weird, i strongly believe they are as normal as anyone of us.

2. the silent viewers: they are just you and me.

3. the commentators who tag friends: they just wanna see the world burn.

4. the frequent commentators (>3 comments): these people try hard to be funny.

5. the essay commentators: weirdos. or maybe they are just caring.

I have a problem with smart guys. If I know that a guy is really smart, I would gradually get attracted to him and this happens most of the time regardless of the look (I used to like one who I thought was ugly :( ) or probably personality (one of the guy I liked turns me off many times as he speaks, but somehow I cannot stop thinking about him and how smart he is :( ). I don't even know what is wrong with me :(

Has anyone else received Facebook messages from random people around our age, claiming to want to introduce you to their so-called "business"? They would give vague replies to your questions about the "business", avoiding key information such as the business name itself. They would eventually ask to meet up to be able to "explain it better" or something. Different people worded their messages a bit differently but the main content remained similar. It seems highly suspicious and I initially thought it was probably some MLM thing, but one of them had explicitly mentioned it was not an MLM (probably lying?).

So... anyone able to shed some light onto this? What is all this *really* about? Anybody got to the point of actually meeting them up yet? Any inputs appreciated!

I have 2 personalities. 

In summary one is very relaxed and optimistic and innocent. My language of thought here is chinese. When I think in chinese, its almost really gullible like a 16 year old kid. I had friends who pull seemingly simple pranks on me and I fall for it. 

The other is very paranoid and always scheming and planning. Like planning the day ahead, planning how to allocate time. I doubt people all the time. I always scheme to get ahead of people, though I am still in reasonable control and I stop myself from actually doing it. My language of thought here is english. 

In uni, I always make it a point to speak Chinese when I can. Speaking english primes me to think evil. But still when I hit the workplace, where English is a must, I fear for myself (and my colleagues)....

How? Do I need help? I personally think the whole field of abnormal psych is really a bunch of bollocks. I've read lots of literature on this field to research myself but I realised that diagnosis itself is very judgment based. On the other hand I know that abnormal people have a substantial risk of sliding wayyyy down and risk having total breakdowns that changes the whole person.
Plus it is not really affecting my life too much. At least on the surface I am a scholarship holder, doing well in school, completed internships at prestigious firms etc. Personally I think I am still not hitting my best because at this point I've neglected eating healthily and also staying up till 1am often which is bad for health. Maybe I am just trying to convince myself I am still capable of living normally. Even my gf says i'm just someone who has a lot of negative experiences where it comes to english speaking environments whereas most of the people whom I met and speak chinese with end up to be a closer friend. I hope she is not reading this...

I gave you everything.
And yet you left me nothing.

I waited for months to have you.
I have tried my very best to chase you.
But you still slipped through my fingers.

All those sleepless nights thinking about you,
I don't even think they matter anymore.

Oh, why do you have to be so hard to get?
Why do you have to be so hot?

With 200 others chasing after you,
Don't you see you only need one who will treat you seriously?

Please, my love.
How I long to embrace you in my arms.

I'm crazy about you

I will cherish you.
I will love you.

Forever and ever.

I will wait for you.
As long as it gets.

SSA1201: Singapore Society module
I may not have you this semester. 
But I will try again for the next.

It doesn't matter how long and hard it takes to bid for you.
I will give all my bidding points just to have you.

Wait for me.
We will be together.

One day

I regret signing up for Project Orbital over the summer break. It sounded really good from the promos and all, but in the end, it sapped up too much of my time. I missed the opportunity to go vacation with my friend because I had to rush to meet the deadline and I missed a couple of good work opportunities too. Couldnt quit either, because I had to be responsible to my partner. Haiz

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. I tried to appear strong in front of my family and friends but deep down, I really want someone to come up and give me a hug and say "it's gonna be alright."

In my click there is only one Singaporean guy. Lets call him Q. He's okay to be with, a little childish and oversensitive but we all get along.

From time to time he always talked about his army life, going into the field and physical training. It was interesting because as foreigners we don't experience this things. Q would always get very motivated when army topics come up. Once a projectmate had to return to the army in the holidays and felt moody. Q got into an argument with him and it got very bad eg insulting the other person as a sissy and not man enough.

The issue is, recently I got to know another person and turns out that the Q is a common friend. It also turns out that they met in the army, and Q only handles paperwork in the army! Q has always been very nice to me, and I can't imagine our click without him. But I can't believe that he lied to us for so long, and so often! I haven't told the rest but now I can't help but feel a little disgusted when he talks about his army life. Can't see him in the same light as well ugh. Just wanted to rant.

Does NUSWhispers allow for confessions about internal politicking? Sorry, really must ask. I really want to say something but am afraid I come across as either seeking pity or just being an ass.

I signed up for Qrientation@NUS .I have been reading the reminder email every night, fighting an internal battle with myself to decide if I should or should not go.

On the surface, i'm probably a normal straight guy seen in any normal social context. Always looking out for any hot girl in the group, dreaming of pick up lines etc. But deep inside me, if I were to choose between having a female or trans partner, I'd take a person who is trans anytime.

If had sexual relations with both sides, but I can never seem to grasp why I find the the thrill of having sex with a trans was a lot more satisfying as compared to girls. I understand everyone (male, female) has needs, but mine...is well a permanent fixation over transgenders. 

I understand the orientation is for the LGBT community within NUS, but I worry how I would be around those who are like me. There is a first time for everything, but the first step outside is always the hardest. And I am hesitating very badly...............

And well, I am worried once my parents find out about my sexual preferences. Is it normal to like both females and transgenders simultaneously ? Each time I have sex with a trans, I feel somewhat dirty. But that thrill...is a mini spark within the abyss of my soul which leads me wanting for more. Don't get me wrong, sex with females are equally enjoyable for me (not sure about her...didn't dare to ask). But it's always the forbidden fruit that seems the sweetest.

WHERE DID MY POST GOOOOOO?

So I met this girl during SOW. She's nice, friendly and really cute. We spent some time tgt as a group, but I barely talked to her. Now I just keep thinking about her and wonder if I should text her. I'm evergreen and seldom talk to girls. I have to admit I don't really believe in platonic r/s between guys and gals (extremely rare). Should I be honest about that or just casually try to be friends first?

When you fall in love with somebody whom you definitely shouldn't fall in love with, what should you do? Stay single forever? Because I just can't work against my morals to accept someone else when I know I can't put my heart into it.
-
 
I like this guy. He also used to say that he had feelings for me. However, recently he is all distant. Although i know there is no more hope, i cant help but text him when i was drunk, and i said some pretty hateful stuff. I tried to apologise the following day multiple times, but he only replied once very late with a nvm, tc. Is there anyway to get him less pissed with me about the stuff i said? Tbh i didnt even rmb texting him til i checked my phone the next day

Every night I lie in bed unable to sleep because I cannot stop thinking about you. About how you are everything I ever wanted in my other half. And yet, you are probably snuggling beside yours. I think about you everyday, whenever I let my mind wander. But I know I would never cross your mind. 

Perhaps with school starting again I would get caught up in the whirlwind of lectures, projects and meetings. And maybe, there would a day where you no longer float into my thoughts. 

I hate putting myself in situations of unrequited love. But it seems, it's the only love that I can give.  Some advice on why I always fall for unattainable people? (And when they become attainable they are no longer attractive to me?) 
-
 
Hi what do people think of when someone says they met their bf/gf/significant other in a club? Like meeting on the dance floor as a basis of meeting each other then continuing on from there. Is there is sort of a stigma attached like not being able to last long and stuff like that.

Two years ago when I found out my GF cheated on me with my brother, I tried killing myself by taking a lot of aspirin, bleach, and alcohol.

When I woke up I felt panicked and scared. You could say I was no longer insane at that point and so that survival instinct had taken over. It definitely wasn't guilt that I was feeling, but simply a "Shit, I don't want to die!" sense.

I was scared to fall back asleep as I was afraid I wouldn't wake back up. Physically I was very very weak. I couldn't move for a while and didn't have the energy to call for help. I also felt extremely nauseated. (I had vomited while I was out.) I was pretty determined to get up and when I was able to gather the energy to do so, I finally got up and practically stumbled out of my room towards the kitchen.

Only my dad was home that night. The look on his face is something I still remember and at the time that's when I felt deep guilt and even regret. I hadn't thought about my dad when I was in the process of taking everything. I hadn't thought about how much I would hurt him if I died. I felt so bad.

My dad is the only one who knew about it at the time. Everyone else, even my friends, didn't learn about my attempt until very long after the fact. My mother didn't believe me when I told her years later. My ex-GF is now my sister in-law.

How do you know what's love? I have been together with my girlfriend for 7 going 8 months now and we are getting into the comfortable phase of the relationship already, bordering on boring even, as we may be starting to take each other for granted... When our relationship started, we didn't even have a honeymoon phase because we were so busy. She is a fantastic girl and almost everything that I wanted. But somehow, the relationship lacks something... Something like passion maybe? I think I love this girl; I can see myself happy with her for the rest of my life, but as of yet I could also see myself moving on. I am not sure exactly how to define love and as we are both about to begin on a new phase of life (we both just graduated), I want to clarify this in case we both get hurt... Can anyone advise me if this is normal and how exactly do we know if we are in love, or if the other party loves us?

I'm actually relieved and glad you stopped contacting me, for whatever reason. I was initially genuinely interested in knowing you better but when it seemed that you only got high out of seemingly being the object of someone's infatuation (overconfidence?)...and the careless way you treat people...it got really annoying really quickly. Hopefully you will lose your condescending/know it all tone with people who are different & aren't as lucky as you are, because that was a major turn off.

I am the OP of . I would like to ask one more questions, if indeed the guy wish to get into the girl's pants, why is my friend being targeted instead of other ladies in the workplace? From what i know my friend is the typical shy, hardworking person who is very focused on her work...I would also admit she is above average in terms of look but do not have a hot body..

Based on the following factors what do you think is the possible reason certain girls got targeted but not others?

A) Shy and quiet
B) Good look

Please add in other factors if any.

Is this normal?
After a year dating with my GF, I am always the one initiating the dates. I know that she is quite introvert in nature, but I am just feel strange. She can normally ask her friend (girl or guy) for going out, but she never ask me even once. It is not helpful also because we live quite a far (she lives on tampines).

To add the oil, I am also the one being active on our conversation. If I didnt initiate call/chat, then we won't talk on that day. I have tried to not contact her for a week, and really, we didn't talk in a week at all.

Do all shy girl behave like this to her BF?? I feel like missing something in this r/s and also feel unwanted...you know, it is tiring to become the only active person in relationship..

It's been so many months since I've realised that I've been led on by this girl.. I really do not understand why she had to do so.. worse part is that I can't get rid of her from my life as we have have so many mutual friends.. everytime i think of how i got played and led on it reminds of how stupid and humiliated I felt.. 

What can I do feel better? Is it even possible to not bear a grudge against her? I really want to leave this tragedic episode of my life behind and move on with a carefree life but i can't seem to do so.. :(

 If you join for specific reason, girls will find it turn off. This is going against the natural flow of things. Learn to act in wu wei.

What Is Wu Wei?

"Wu wei refers to the cultivation of a state of being in which our actions are quite effortlessly in alignment with the ebb and flow of the elemental cycles of the natural world.

It is a kind of “going with the flow” that is characterized by great ease and awake-ness, in which - without even trying - we’re able to respond perfectly to whatever situations arise."

You always hear of girls leaving guys during their NS days but I was one of the cases where my then bf dumped me because it was too much effort on his part to maintain a relationship while still in NS (he was in BMT then). Recently I found out that he's dating someone else, a girl who was attached but he "koped" from another guy. I don't understand why guys would do that?? I mean if she can leave her boyfriend for you what makes you think she wouldn't do the same to you if given a chance in the future?? 

I keep telling myself that I'm better off without him but even though he wasn't my first relationship, he was my first love. 

Sorry just needed to rant.

Is it weird for a guy like me to feel uncomfortable sleeping with other people and shaking hands with other people ? I do sleep with other people if there is no choice or shake hands with other people out of respect ( I don't initiate handshake ) just that I am very uncomfortable with these.

School is starting soon and it's feeling pretty dreadful now because I have to do my final thesis. Worse still, I have to see him again. It's really gonna be awkward and how I wish I have never met him before. He used to be nice and all to me but after a while, as he got to know more friends, he started to ignore and even make fun of me to make my life miserable. He even spread rumours to make people think I'm a lazy person and who does not do work and put effort in school. That has left bad impressions of me on my profs and friends. I started to walk away and yet whenever we meet, he acted like he has done nothing is wrong. He acted like as if I'm the one who is wrong and distancing myself from him for no reason. I don't understand, how can he not see that what he has done really hurt me? I don't understand. 

The thing is I have to still see him for school. We will definitely see each other around. What should I do? Should I act normal like as if nothing has happened? Part of me tells me that I should just act normal like as if nothing has happened before, but another part of me and some of my friends tell me that I should just give him a cold shoulder and ignore him for what he has done to me. I don't know what to do.

what are the chances of finding love/your life partner in the confines of/within nus?

I am indian guy, non tamil, fair, hav stubble, medium height, well built and I really like Singaporean chinese girls a lot. I find them very cute, beautiful and charming. I also love their Singlish accent and their voice is so melodious. On top of it, I am also a foreigner. My accent is no where close to their accent. I have a neutral accent and not really aware of many singlish slang terms. 

When I talk to them, I feel sometimes they get turned off when I don't understand their slang words(Lor, sia).  What do Singaporean girls think of guys like me? Do I stand a chance atleast to hangout with them , let alone have a girlfriend?

Sometimes i do not understand the rationale behind some NUS prof randomly grouping us in certain modules. I know that they are trying to prepare us for the working life where we can't choose whom we wanted to with work with. But hey, we are already adults. We should be given the freedom to decide whether we wanted to be randomly grouped or be with our friends. If we insist on being with our friends, let us be and let us face the consequences ourselves in the future. Why impose on us what they think is for our own good? 

Just wanted to rant this out as this had been happening countless of times in modules i had taken...

I'm what people call passive aggressive. But then, sometimes I really can't help it. I'm sarcastic by nature, but it comes off as passive aggressive without me even realizing. And besides, where do you draw the line between passive-aggressiveness and sarcasm? I've read articles saying that passive aggressive people are like that because they are insecure and lack confidence, but I know myself and I'm not under that category. Urgh, the struggle when I seem to be a mean bitch to people but I don't mean it. How do I stop being passive aggressive?

To  i have a friend who faced very similar problem at her workplace. Just wondering is it common for guys to behave this way, whether they are engaged already or not? Or only guys with the playboy attitude as mentioned by OP behave in such a manner (kept looking, talking to and following my friend around if given the chance)? What do you guys think is a possible reason my friend got targeted when she NEVER first initiated conversation with the guy?

Hi  I am currently in a LDR and here are my thoughts on maintaining a LDR. 
Things that will help maintain your LDR
1) Skype because we spend more time on video calls/normal calls than texting. (I love to hear her voice and she love to see my funny facial expressions)
2) Similar timezones, but she work shifts and I work office hours but it is much easier as compared to being 12 hours apart in timezone. 
3) Meeting each other, she was here last month and I went to meet her in May and I am going again next month so average we get to meet each other once every 2 months. Physical intimacy is still very important in LDR (she agrees with me on this too :D) 

Reddit has plenty of good information www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2ckhr5/august_4th_august_9th_what_advice_would_you_give/

Hope to learn from other LDR couples experiences as well!

This friend of mine is one of those geeky awkward guys. 
We hang out quite often, and he always laments about how girls don't like him and whatnot. It's frankly quite tiresome to hear him complain all the time, since its obvious why girls don't like him. He tries to impress them by drawing them into arguments (he calls them debates) and showing his cleverness and wit (mostly just a lot of harsh words and attitude). 

Well I recently noticed this friend post repeatedly about sucking up to their lot in life. The irony. I guess its difficult to practise you preach huh?

In response to comments on , it was mentioned that "if we want the ugly guy to stop trying, you should tell him straight. If not don't blame him for being persistent". This is a rather tricky situation given that in some circumstances, we cannot outrightly tell the ugly guy off as we cannot afford to offend certain people. For instance, my friend in the workplace did not like a not good looking guy who is being too persistent. However she cannot tell him off straight as she is going to be working there for the long term and offending someone there may mean awkwardness from then on. Also that person is a senior whom she might need to seek help from as that person is her co-mentor. Please advice on what should be done here. Yes i admit that friend is superficial but she really want this persistence to stop so how can she go about telling the guy straight that he will not have a chance at all?

I wanna start a LDR. How do I maintain one?

With reference to , the image that was posted was relatively true based on these thoughts.

From my observations, the physically undesirable guy, whether in terms of looks or stature, tend to be rather persistent once a girl catches his eye. My gut feel is that these guys felt that it's either they go all out to get a girl or they stand no chance at all, thus they tend to be more willing to let go of their ego and do whatever it takes to get the girl of his dream. However what he fails to realise is that in the first place, the girl already never had any feelings for him, but given that he is still very persistent, all the more the girl dislike him, thus giving rise to the impression that girls think the ugly guy is a stalker, disgusting etc. The good looking guy on the other hand, usually wait for a slight sign that the girl is interested in him before he make any move to ensure that he is unlikely to get rejected. In other words the good looking guy do not have to let go of his ego too much and still have a higher chance of getting the girl. Girls in the first place may already had caught sight of the handsome guy and have a rather good impression of the guy simply based on his looks, thus when the handsome guy start chasing the girl, the girl all the more felt happy and will think the guy is charming, gentlemanly etc.

Girls am i right to say that this is probably what you all are thinking too?

i turn 25 this year and im still a virgin male. I dont really know what is wrong with me; in the past ive had some girls hinting to me that they want to do it with me but ive always said no even when alcohol had screwed my mind so bad. Now i regret it as i am still single, and no girl seems to have an interest in me one bit. i wish someone can advise me on what i should be doing and id be really thankful for your genuine advise :)

In the first few week of my work, there is this guy who is rather small built and average looking (but compared to other guys in my department, he is the worst looking). From what i know, he was engaged to his girlfriend. In the first few weeks of my work, he chat to me a bit. However, as the weeks passed, his chat could extend for more than an hour! My work involves doing experiments and as we know, experiments have waiting times that could be long. During those waiting times, i usually work on an assignment given to me by my supervisor but each time he is inside the office with me, i ended up talking to him instead doing my work. The funny thing was whenever other staff are around, he will not talk to me but soon after they left to do their work, he started talking to me again. His topics are never sexual but I talked to him not because i like talking to him but it is only out of politeness. Since i am intending to return to the same workplace in the future, i do not wish to offend anyone there. Only recently, someone in the neighbouring office left and i took the person's desk because i do not wish to stay in the same office as the guy and end up talking and not doing my work. Even though i am in the other office, i can only minimise my talking time. He still came into my new office and talk to other people there, before turning his attention to me again. When i am doing experiments in lab A, he came out, talk to other people a bit and talked to me even when i am conducting experiments. I initially thought he came out as he had experiements to do but no! He ended up talking to me for a long time. I am starting to feel really annoyed as i wish to focus on my experiments. Finally, when i finished my given tasks for the week, i get to follow my supervisor to lab B to watch him conduct interesting experiments. I am aware that the guy's project do not require any equipments from lab B but he brought his stuff and came here anyway. This time i am suspicious that he came simply because i am now in lab B. Over lunch in the pantry, if given the chance, he would sit at the table i was at and try to talk to me again, even though he could easily have joined other staff there. Each time he sees me chatting to my supervisor about random stuff, he would cut in and put in his opinion so i think he is listening to our conversation all the time. And one more thing i caught him many times looking at me and i do not like the way he look at me...it doesn't seem like the normal looking and was rather fixated which makes me uneasy...

Basically what he did makes me dislike him more and more. I do not understand why he behaved in this manner even though he is engaged. The harsh truth is that because he is not good looking, i know for sure i can never end up liking him whatever he does. Personality wise, i do not think he is good either since he can be easily pek chek when doing his own work. Just wondering what do you guys think about this guy? Why does he behave like that towards me even though he is engaged? Is he being a playboy?

I'm not a very extroverted person so I don't think my boyfriend worries about anything, but he on the other hand is so friendly and sociable. For example, I don't stay in hall and didn't attend any camps when I first entered NUS, but he'll be attending and has attended so many, and will be staying in hall as well when he enters NUS this year.

I know I should trust him and I always felt like I did, but there's that little doubt in me, especially now he's surrounded by so many new girls constantly. Argh I hate hate feeling this way. Advice please. :(

Some relationship facts that everyone should know.

Each and every person is constantly in a state of assessing whether the people she meets can make good relationship partners or not even if she appeared as if she doesn't care about relationships.

This mean that you don't have to confess to someone to initiate the relationship. She will constantly access whether you can make a good partner or not.

Also, try to see thing from the ladies' point of view. If some random guy just confess to you, will you like him? No right? You need to know more about him and see his good traits first before you can tell whether you like him or not.

Contrast to what that confessor say, you have to avoid making your intention clear until you are quite sure that the chance or rejection is very low.

Met this girl at a module I took. She was tall, tanned and not bad looking (but not superbly good looking either). Strangely, I thought she was hot. We were never introduced, but I got to know her name through other friends/acquaintances. Her facebook profile is public and there were times I frequently looked for updates on her facebook. (I am not her facebook friend.) We had a bit of eye contact during the semester, but there was no heart fluttering. A few months ago, she went overseas to study. I had this weird sinking feeling in my chest, as though I was extremely depressed that I would not see her again. I could not explain why. These days, although the pain is gone, I will occasionally think about how she is doing. I am a girl. While I do not have sexual fantasies of her, I often fantasize on how we could be good sisters. (How strange! As her facebook suggests that we are total opposites.) Is it strange for me to be so obsessed with a stranger?

I am a 24yo nerdy virgin and on my way to becoming a wizard, and utterly shy where it comes to boy-girl. I've made it a point to save it only for the one I am in love with, though pre-marital is okay for me though. Yes I know I'm weird. 

Just weeks ago within a span of 4 days, 2 separate female friends, one a long-time i've known since forever and another I've known for only a year, hinted to me that they have needs, one even happened at her place with her exhibiting all the body language. Being a person with excellent self-control where it comes to my facial reactions, I acted blur and just told them to go clubbing and they are bound to score a guy home since clubbing is for NSAs. (gonna offend many social clubbers for this but hey, ask a girl to go out to the dance-floor alone and guys will just swarm around her, if that isn't guys trying for NSA then I don't know what to say)

Looking back, I realize i'm weird. If I were to be a normal guy, I might have at the very least, be turned on. But I actually felt a bit shy in both instances. My guy friends are so so normal, especially those who live in hall that have much more experience. They just RAWR and go all the way. But it seems I don't even have 2 heads at all. My brain rules total dominance, and my second head is like a total blur-cock.

Several concerns:
1. I'm worried that the day where my libido peaks, will my brain rule over my dick? I'm not a believer of "do anything don't get caught".

2. If I have a gf in the future and yet I am still in contact with these friends who actually made advances on me, uhm is this wrong? I honestly think they can be good friends. 

3. At the age of 24, I remain relatively unfazed/cold within these situations. Am I really really that abnormal? 

And the crazy thing is I am single and don't even have a girlfriend yet! Why am I thinking so much....

Recently I got dumped. The reason was because she finally couldn't suppress her feelings for a guy she has liked since JC. All my friends thought that reason was ridiculous and obviously she had some other reasons to dump me after many years of relationship. 

At first I was devastated. I couldn't let go. I wanted her back so desperately. 

This happened a few weeks ago. I masked my feelings during my internship. It was miserable, I faked smiles, cracked lame jokes and chatted often with my work friends to put that off. 

But now he internship is over, and I'm going back to school. At school, I have no friends. No true friends, all of them are mere acquaintances. Sometimes I wonder, is it because of my looks that I don't have a close and true friend whom I can open up to.

Le friend: I bought new shorts, blue and red color
Le me: Red? I I think it'll be a little too standout for you eh (given the context here that my friend is a shy guy who wants to blend in with the crowd all the time while Im the crazy girl who wants to stand out)
Le friend: *passive agressive mode on*
Le me: er.... what did I do?
Le friend: Can't you just agree with me
Le me: ....

Dude, firstly I'm just offering an advice right there and had no intention to rebut your comment or question your life decision. Secondly, what do you mean can I just agree with you. We are friends because we all are unique in our own ways and we bring our very best to the friendship to help each other grow. If I can't even keep my originality, my own opinion and voice my thoughts out then I wonder why you even need me here, just go clone yourself. Thirdly, you said "it's just a small thing, just pretend to agree with me also can." Exactly, if it's such as small thing why do you have to take my comment with such strong reaction. Just take it lightly, if you like it then okay, if not leave it outside your ears and move on. 

I'm trying to understand and save this friendship. But it's hard because I can't deal with passive agression. Its not evrn the first time I'm requested to "just agree with me". I'm guessing my friend is facing some insecurities problem. What can I do?

I know this may seem like a very stupid question, and I don't know whether any girls will answer this (guys are of course welcome too but not sure if you can explain).

What does it mean when people say a guy is good in bed? I've only ever been with one guy, so I have no basis for comparison, but I don't really understand how one guy can be better than another. Isn't it just...to put it crudely, going in? Why should it be different unless it's purely based on size.

I know it's stupid to base this off tv shows, but like Joey in Friends and Barney in HIMYM, people claim that they are really good in bed, so why? Is it because of foreplay? But if not, can anyone enlighten me why one guy (or even a girl actually) can be better than another at sex?
-
 
I always have been a kind guy who does not know how to say no ( or rather not assertive). Or maybe unconsciously I am deeply insecure about myself and have always wanted people to like me. I have always found it difficult to make friends because I am shy and introverted. I have good friends who understand my nature and slowly encourage me to come out of my shells and I thank them deeply for it. I am grateful for the efforts they put in but until not too long ago, I meet some friends who kept on hurting me (maybe they didn't know) and kept pushing the boundaries. There is no way I can break away from them because of certain circumstances. 

But all the hurtful feelings that they caused me aren't all that bad because I started giving less f**ks about what they think and starting saying no to their requests. It felt f**king awesome that I do not care about their feelings and whether they like it or not. Just a rant

I have a girlfriend, but I'm a girl. I have dated her for a year and it has become serious for me so I thought it was time to introduce her to my parents. 

My parents met her and acted like everything was fine but after I came back from sending her home, they sat me down and told me they were disappointed that I brought her instead of a guy. 

I explained saying that I have always knew that I liked girls but didn't have the courage to tell them. I thought that they love me enough to accept who I am but I guess not. They told me to never see my girlfriend again. It's been a few weeks and their decision has not changed. 

I'm in love with my girlfriend so how on Earth am I suppose to just not talk to her? I love her and I wanna be with her but I also don't want my parents to be disappointed in me. 

I told my girlfriend about the situation and she said it will be hard not to talk or see each other but she'll understand if I decided to break it off.

She's the love of my life and I'm in such a dilemma. What should I do?

Humans tend to seek short-term gratification over long-term gains. This is why not only girls get together bad boys, but also guys getting together with bad girls. I was no exception.

I once had a short liaison with this girl who has a bf. It was hot, thrilling and torrid. She liked the idea of me being her secret lover. I liked the idea of being in utmost physical intimacy with another person's girl. We especially liked the idea of her sucking me off and then she going to meet her bf soon after that. She would also make a point to kiss him when meeting up with him.

The thrill was good, but alas she was not someone I could foresee being together for the long term. After many emotional upheavals, I called it quits. Right now, I am attached with another girl. Less passionate, less thrilling and less torrid, but all the better for my mental and emotional sanity.

Last month, a girl who was my classmate in secondary school suddenly contacted me via Facebook and said she wanted to meet up with me. We've been Facebook friends for a few years, however never did she once interacted with me until now. This is very understandable as we are just acquainted and not very close. So I felt really odd when she invited me to meet up with her out of the blue. She told me she's trying to catch up with some old friends. Okay, she's quite pretty and hot so I agreed to meet up with her. I mean which guy doesn't want to go out with an attractive girl right?  Just Kidding! I do enjoy meeting up with people for their company. 

So we met up and went to eat at McDonald's. We started rhapsodizing about some of the things our class did back then. However sooner than I expected, the reason for her inviting me out became apparent; she began pitching the benefits of some health supplements and wanted me to join some multi-level marketing program. I told her I may not be interested in doing so and she kept persisting and explaining it'll give me better health and a large passive income blah blah blah... Although I love having both health and wealth, but I really couldn't commit my money, time and effort because I've got other priorities to deal with at that moment. I could sense her energy level fell from 200% to 20% after we ended this conversation while moving back to talk about our secondary school class. 

So after that meet-up session, she would mostly give a one word reply such as "Good" or "K" whenever I send her messages to ask how she is doing. The smiley emoticons she once used are gone!!!! D:

Why do acquaintances only contact you when they have a favor to ask for? Is it really that hard to meet a friend just for the sake of establishing a closer bond or perhaps for the mere fun of it? Besides, this is not the first time some acquaintance called me just to ask for a favor and then disappear until he needs another favor again. Why Why Why WHY???? Are friendships really just based on how much the person can benefit you??

That's why I like my dog best.  That little bugger hangs out with me even though I've got nothing much more to offer him other than a simple friendship :D

If a guy can accept a girl for who she is, after seeing her worst side, knowing how she is, why doesnt the girl accept him? I had this junior, one fine day she texted me about a chem question and we talked from then on with her mostly initiating the topics. Eventually we became close and she told me about many of her problems. I felt like i became her pillar of strength. I slowly fell for her, wanting to take care of her, accepting her various flaws and listening to her. When i confessed to her, she told me she liked me as a friend, and stopped talking to me. I accepted her flaws, i want to take care of her. But why? I spent hours on the phone with her listening to her problems through A levels, offering to be there for her. Since then i have become very repulsive to relationships. Kinda given up on them. I dont think ill ever find someone. It feels horrible.

Dear , I get what you mean. I am a guy, happily with my girlfriend and sometimes face the same exact problem with you. Many people think that you don't love your other half as much when you get bored, but in my own opinion I think it's just this society construct that dictates us to be together with one person all the time. 

Humans fall into a continuum (if my Psych textbooks can be trusted) and for everyone who is dead happy to stick with a same thing for a very long time (be it gf, bf, a car, a house, a job), there are those who craves changes every once in a while. A break from the routine. That's what makes us humans, you know. People with different personalities.

But of course, societal norms tend to favour a certain personality from time to time, which in our case, favours a monogamy relationship. One partner at any one time. There's also society with polygamy and polyamory norms (look that up), but they're mostly considered deviants in our society today and they're the other side of the extreme.

My only question is, if you want change once in a while, would you allow your bf to do the same? If you can work out something (like an agreement where both of you can have little "sexacapes" while remaining faithful to each other) why not? I know of couples who do this or other fetishes (like threesomes) so the key is always communication and knowing what both partners want. Better to be honest than to end up cheating after you get married, right?

I'm a guy and I want girl friends. Like, not girlfriends, but friends that are girls, you know? I want girls that I can ask for help, like advice for when I actually do want a girlfriend. Could a girl really accept a guy as a close platonic friend, though? Especially since I'm the kind of person who prefers to go out with just one or a few friends at a time.

I'm a new student entering this year, and I've gone through many orientation camps. SCAMP, SOW, and so on. I'm not the sort of person who  likes these kind of events, but I thought it would be good to force myself out of my comfort zone. 

I'm not sure about the results.

Honestly, I didn't enjoy any of them a lot. I couldn't really connect with any of the people in camp. While everyone else was busy talking to each other and enjoying the games I was just trying not to give up on the camp. Ironically, it made me felt horribly lonely despite being surrounded with so many people.

Is there something wrong with me? Why can't I enjoy these?  I've had to keep putting on a facade through each camp so I don't bring down the mood by letting people know what an awful time I was having. It cuts even deeper when everyone tells me that these orientation events are where people make the friends that last them through their school years, and if everything goes how I want I'm going to be here for over four years. I don't even have any wish to keep contacting my OG; it's not their fault, I just don't feel like I bonded with them in any way. Am I doomed to not make any new friends in NUS? Am I the only one who feels this way? I was really looking forward to finally going back to school to make new friends, but now I can only see a bleak future in front. 

Am I doomed to be friendless for the next few years? Please, I want to hear some thoughts.

I've been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years, and every now and then I get this bored feeling. I do love him, I think he's the best guy I know, but I kind of miss those days of just being able to flirt and make out with guys without much consequences.

We have talked about getting married in about 1 or 2 years' time, and honestly, the thought of being with just one person forever scares the crap out of me. I know so many girls who seem to be dying to settle down and get married, and don't get me wrong, I am really happy with my boyfriend, but at the same time I wish we could be on a break once in a while to get all this out of my system. Is this normal?? Or am I really just the odd terrible person?

 I'm a girl and I really want to have close guy friends too, you know. No romantic feeling, just someone to be there when you're sad, and to give advice about what the opposite sex is thinking, you know? I know next sentence is going to put a lot of people off. But I will say it anyway, see how many are fine with that - I'm attached. So what. I always find it easier to get along with guys anyway. And nope I emphasize again - no romantic feeling at all.

To the OP of , I totally get how you feel. I'm like you as well. I've only gone for one camp so far and I felt the exact same way. I will be going for another soon and I hope it'll turn out better. I was told by a lot of my JC friends as well that camps were the only way you could make friends that would get you through the four years. In fact, when I recently attended a student welcome session, I was all alone. Everyone already seemed to be in their own cliques and this was even before school had started proper. It doesnt look good for me either. 

I have the same fears as you. Am I going to be alone for the next four years and possibly the rest of my life? It seems after 2 years in NS I just lost the ability to connect with other human beings. 
Most people appear to be excited for uni while I am genuinely terrified. I'm sorry I dont think I gave you any advice but I hope you can take comfort from the fact that there are others who feel the same way.

I've just graduated this year. Few months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend while she was still doing her SEP. Reasons? Think of whatever reason that comes to your mind when a guy loves a girl more than the girl does to him (when she just thought of trying it out), eg. "I'm not ready for a relationship" "You're not the one" "I don't deserve a guy like you" and etc.

Honestly, there was nothing wrong with her doing so, except for the parts where she took me for granted and put in very little effort throughout the whole relationship. Until the day we last talked, she was still being very mean to me. But don't get me wrong, she can be a really good friend with everyone else but me as she is really really fun (the best part that attracted me I guess?)

The problem is that, it takes me really long to move on. Travelling does help but minimal. Even though I'm no longer feeling angry about her for whatever she has done to me, I'm still thinking about her from time to time especially when I'm back to Singapore (Damn there are so many things that remind me about her). My friends are probably bored of listening to this. I'm also sicked of reading articles about breakup, I can probably be a professor (in theories) but it's really hard to apply it when it comes to myself. I know it's not hard find someone more mature and ready, someone who won't lose feeling easily, (yes this is not the first time we breakup) but idk why it's just so hard to move on. Now I'm just hoping that entering the working world will help, perhaps I just need something to keep myself busy...

Advice please?

 Well I guess he's kinda a writer trying to survive. Don't really think he's a top author (although I read some of his stories and enjoyed some of the topics discussed), hence probably leads to what you see in his fb page (I'm not even sure if it is managed by him personally)

He does reply people though, I wrote an email about his book that I felt was good and he gave me a average length reply.

When attached friends mindlessly point out faults in (single) friends, and say things like "No wonder you're single" "That's why you're not attached!", I wonder how they'd twist their words to their advantage when they become single again...dear love birds, can't yall just shut your self-righteous trap and enjoy the relationship while it lasts?!

Does anyone feel embarrass whenever your stomach growls? I am not sure why but my stomach seems to growl quite often and I will feel extremely embarrassed during such situations. Like for example, during exams in LTs, it'll be really quiet and my stomach can growl non stop which really affects my concentration pretty badly cause I can't help but feel super embarrassed. From my side view, I could see people stealing glances at me and sniggering. It growls even after I eat as well, like a full meal. Sometimes, during tutorials, it can just growl randomly like that. This is the reason why I avoid quiet places like The Study or CLB, though sometimes I really want to go there and revise as its quite conducive. Sigh. I guess I have to live with this problem for the rest of my life.

I have a uncontrollable preference for women who are older by 1 or 2 years than me. Whenever I hang out with younger women, I can't help but to feel that despite their age deep down inside they are still a small little girl? Is that alright? :/

Hey girls out there, just wanna ask how would you react if your BF revealed to you that he tried out with guys before knowing out but that he has since stopped? (and will remain faithful to you) Will you accept it and move on?

This summer has been really crazy for me. (i'm a guy btw)
Right until exams, have I been this normal, evergreen, student doing normal activities etc, with orientation camps to participate in as a senior, internships to do.

But then there is this deep emptiness inside me, it's like even if I have some many people around me, they will never understand me enough. I just feel so drained and I need some avenue to release.

And there you know it, I just did something crazy and stupid.
I went to hookup with guys online for "funXXX", did everything you could do, use those apps out of curiosity. It was fun, but at the same time, there was this sense of guilt inside me. The people close to me found out and they helped me to quit doing this immediately.

I really thankful I didn't contract anything, but I'm already blemished inside, and I will have this deep dark secret that I will carry to my grave. I just wanna live a normal life, find a wife, get married and raise a family. Yeah, and hopefully, God will give me the strength to resist such temptations.

I have this fear that my boyfriend will cheat on me... Even though he's been nothing but sweet to me. But stories from friends whose exes so blatantly cheated on them despite their relationship going so strong then makes me so scared :(

My clique has two girls and two guys. ( I am one of the guy ) Recently, I planned a day outing. However, my guy friend can't make it since he is still overseas. This means I will be going out with two girls. Just wondering will it look weird for a guy to go out with 2 girls ? Will it be awkward?

 The thing is that you guys are paid with scholarships. Many locals are unhappy about the overhelp given. I am okay if you guys pay the full fees without any tuition grants.

Feeling quite sick of people asking "why are you so quiet?" or telling me "you are so quiet" like there's something wrong with me. Why is quiet perceived as such a bad thing?

From the previous posts, seems like girls also fall on a bell curve. Nice, "nice" or good guys, it's time to start making your offerings to the bell curve god.

In the midst of all of these, I just need to get something off my mind. Not sure if this might result in unwanted comments but ... I hope getting this off my chest would be good. I think I have gone into this with my eyes rose-tinted. I thought it might be something that would be awesome, something that I could remember with laughter and excitement once everything is over... I am not feeling that. Before, maybe. But not now. I don't think I am a good leader. I don't think I am managing people well--people whose interactions with me are solely and mainly by screen. I can't believe I am saying this but I just can't wait for this to end. Sorry for the disappointment

On a happier note, Happy Birthday Sg! #SG50 Gonna check out the events happening during the weekends

The nice guys bad guys debate sound like self-pitying to me actually. Why is it the guy that gets together with the girl is always bad and then the guy who did not get the girl is always nice? Of course the guy who won the girl over is going to look bad to you because he's your competitor, and due to confirmation bias, you're definitely going to look out for flaws and magnify them, and well, everyone is generally blind to his/her own flaws, so you can only see yourself as the good/nice guy. 

I'm a guy btw, and what I believe is happening is that girls generally want to get swept off their feet by the guy wooing her. Hence the bad guys stereotype (clubber, tons of friends, smoke, drink, etc) tend to have a lot more life experience and know a lot of tricks/techniques to do so will have the advantage in this regard, whereas the stereotypical nice guys tend to take it slowly, hoping for the girl to notice him, then try to be attentive to all her needs, etc. It is good, but not enough. And I notice a similarity about the nice guys, which is that they act like they already are the girl's boyfriend when they are not. Think about it, if the girl already has a friend treating her with care and concern and be attentive to her every need without any obligation on her part, so why would she want to get together with that friend? In simpler terms, would you want to pay money for something that you are already getting for free? The answer is obvious.

PS: The above is something I've learnt from repetitively being the nice guy.
TLDR: Girls want to fall in love, not slowly prodded into love.

If Y is everything u wanted but X is the one u are attracted to, what should you do? 

Y is nice, near one's ideal but i know he will never make a move because of X's presence.

X is hot and cold. Some days he would be really nice other days he would be really cold. 

Everyone has been saying me n X will get together but he has never made a move to bring our friendship to the next level n based on how well I know him, i guess he will not make a move. At least not during our studying years............ ]:

On days like this i can feel the loneliness creeping on me n i wish X would make a move or let go so Y can do something but i guess i can never phantom a guy's heart ]:

What should I do? ]:

All the 'nice guy' posts are very interesting! I'm a girl who is slightly older than most of the people who will be posting here, with i dare say more life/dating experience. I dated my share of bad boys and nice guys and I'm now with a bad boy who became nice :), so we compared notes and had an interesting chat about this. 

Actually, the stereotype has truths on both sides.  is sometimes correct when he says that girls say one thing but do another. Girls logically DO want a guy who will treat us nice, loyal, and responsible. however, girls being more emotional can be easily swayed by the charming guy who makes our heart flutter. This is especially so when you're younger and easily influenced (sorry younger girls, speaking from my own experience!) and maybe relationships are abit more fun and games and you don't really know what you want. Not the girls fault! it's just a natural part of life and people's thinking change and mature. I have seen several times, where my girlfriends genuinely are interested to give the nice guy a chance, but then get distracted by a charming, suave 'bad boy.' Girls who do not learn to control this aspect of their emotions will remain girls. Those who do are women :)

This is not to say the nice guys are off the hook! nice guys can really sometimes overdo it, like  says. It is a different story when you are chasing and you are together. Girls like their man to be confident and know his self-worth, and to an extent, street smart. She is not the center of the world, and you are not together, so don't act like she is! (It is a different story when you are together :D) . I admit this is abit of a fine line and you got to learn when to be assertive and confident in moving the relationship (like in 's case) forward but really, if the girl likes you she will be forgiving one :)
Meanwhile, invest in yourself, do interesting things that you are passionate about (not gaming, please. I don't mind guys who game but everything in moderation), get life experience! my bf put it this way: You're asking the girl along on a car ride, you gotta make sure the journey is going to be interesting and that you won't crash the car. 'Nice' guys won't crash the car, so work on making the car ride interesting. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE A BAD GUY TO BE STREETSMART AND HAVE SOME CHARM/SOCIAL SKILL. if she didn't want to come on the ride, her loss. move on.
I have a few guy friends who were your stereotypical 'nice guys'. but they used their singlehood well, and they have very interesting lives and life experience, let me tell you they are very attractive and have their pick of the ladies. 

I don't want to pretend to be an expert or have all the answers but these are just my observations. Don't worry also. University is just one part of dating life, not the be-all-end-all. alot of people's thinking and perception will change after uni and you are grown-up abit and then it's a whole new ball game.

Nice guy bad guy? I say f*** em. At the end of the day, the most genuine and charming individual would get the girl.

If you don't get the girl, lick your wounds and evolve. No one likes a self-loathing, self-proclaimed nice guy.
work out, travel and meet more people. Eventually you're gonna meet someone, if you don't, at least you spent your time doing things you love.

To jump into the bandwagon about nice guys, (I'm a girl) I've learned the hard way that on top of being a nice guy, he has to know clearly what he wants.

I've dated a guy who appear to be nice to everyone but doesn't know what he wants (only to found out after we started dating) and it's terribly hurting to go through the countless open-withdrawl cycles because he couldn't decide if he wants a relationship with me or not.

Throughout the course of the school year, I met a guy from my faculty and we became really close friends, something which I'm very thankful for. Lately, I've begun to like him a lot more than just as a friend and he knows.

However, he is also very sexually charged/experienced and he talks a lot about his previous escapades with other girls, and while all this talk turns me on, I've never even so much as gone to second base with another guy before. Because of this I feel very, very insecure— both in my ‘inexperience’ and in my sex appeal.

Should I be worried? I really like the guy for more than just what he can do under the sheets; I think he's smart, has a lot of experience, and is really wise… I'm afraid that because I'm not exactly the best looking and ‘liberal’, sparks will fly but nothing significant will happen. It doesn't help that I would like to wait until marriage…
-
 
so what about a nice single guy in the same batch as me who always reply to all my text msgs asap but never initiate any texts? (I'm a girl) He told me he don't mind a relationship, but many times when I tried to flirt at him directly, he has no reaction to it (maybe just "haha" it off). I even tried asking him out but he always turned me down. But he never turn any cold towards me after that. We can hang out in school just two of us and there is always something to talk about. Is this the type of nice guy who is trying to slowly prod me into love? I'm getting impatient. lol

In light of the badguy niceguy saga, i would like to share my personal experience why this is not true. Im your typically bad boy (drink,club,smoke) pretty much done it all. But im still an evergreen virgin with no luck with girls. Recently i have been trying to chase this girl from my course. Everyday i will wait at the busstop for her class to end and take the bus to her home with her. Sometimes i even send her up to her doorstep. However she does not seem to appreciate this and calls me things like "stalker" and "im calling the police". I really dont understand and explain to her that im a bad boy with you girls like. I Drink alot, in fact 2 full glasses of milk per day to keep my bones strong as my mum says. I also Smoke my proffessors as my assignments are all copied from online or my friends heehee. I love to Club all the time at the Ang mo kio community club and even used to be the head of Chess club. But she doesnt like bad boys like me and says i have a mental condition. So now u people know, girls do not always like bad boys, true story. Any advice for me?
-
 
It's not that I want to be a heartbreaker. It's just that everytime I treat a guy friend like a buddy (I'll say things like dude and bro), idk why they will start to like-like me. I thought I drew a damn obvious line already. And no, I don't see it like an ego-booster. I just don't like that we drift apart due to awkwardness. I just need people to stop having romantic notions about me, and I really don't care to have a boyfriend.
-
 
A question to all the girls out there.

If a guy confesses his love for you and you turn him down. Do you expect to have the guy keep clinging on to you? What if you find out months after he confesses that he still likes you but he also has a friend he likes.. Will you go psychotic and say "You are a liar and you have never loved me at all. If you did love me you would have not like "that girl"."

Please tell me I'm not a crazy guy.

I don't know, I think in my experience girls do sometimes don't really like the nice guy. 

By all accounts,  I'm rather eligible. I have a good job with a balanced life. I'm sporty and not bad looking. Thing is I like adventure, so I travel alot, do lots of new things. I am very comfortable going out/travelling by myself and doing new stuff alone.I don't club/smoke/drink. I have a good mix of friends, I have dated and am no stranger to meeting girls. In some circles I would even be thought off as the 'bad boy ' because of how people view my rather carefree lifestyle. Never had ons.

Thing is, the people who know me well (including girls) say I'm too nice to girls- I.e. I do things for normal friends other guys won't do, like taking detours fetching them home, and asking how they are if I hear something bad happened to them and other examples. To me this is sometimes abit strange because I honestly think this is quite 'normal'. I don't believe in playing around and I believe that if you're in a relationship you should be serious about it.

My experiences in dating has so far been that girls sometimes don't want you to care so much about what they feel or think; I'll give some examples 

Case 1) 
I dated girl A,  who is was introduced to me by girl B (A and B are good friends) It didn't work out, unfortunately, but things were abit awkward between A and I. B and I got very close over some time, but I didn't want to pursue anything with her because things with A were still unresolved. In the end she chose another guy. 

Case 2) 

Girl C and I met and we had very good chemistry, we started going out over 6 months. Unfortunately at that time she had alot going on with her life- family issues, just broke up, going overseas to study (me too) - and I told her we should slow it down abit and just be good friends for now, and see where things stood in a  few months. She agreed, but next thing I know 2 months later she got together with someone who would be in most circles be considered a 'bad boy' 

Case 3) 
A cousin introduced me to girl D at a wedding, we hit it off and started texting quite abit. We went out quite a few times in the first month of meeting. 
When talking I made it clear that I don't play around and I know what I want. About 2 months down the road I decided to move things along and start being more serious in asking her out and getting to know her, but strangely she started to become cold and withdraw. I was a little disappointed,  but well, move on. 6 months down the road I found out she got tgt with a guy who, let's just say has anger mgt issues and can be violent toward people.

So, really, my opinion is that in my experience girls say one thing but quite often do the other. Am I completely blameless?  No I don't think so, but I think I tried my best. Are all girls like that? I also don't think so, but I think quite a few are.

To ,

I'm sorry to break your bubble, but I think the term "nice guys" is just used as an excuse to justify us guys sitting around, staying silent all day and not making any moves towards the girl. I used to think the same too, branding all assertive guys (read: jocks) as "bad guys", but the truth is an entirely different matter. I've seen enough assertive guys to know that assertiveness does not equate douchebaggery and introversion/shyness does not equate niceness, whatever that means.

There are jocks who treat their girlfriends as if they're the queen of the world (I personally know of an athlete, the typical "bad guy" who smokes, drinks and clubs but has been with his girlfriend for six years and planning to get married soon) and there are shy guys who are nothing but egotistical maniacs ("nice guys" who prefers to game everyday even after getting attached).

So stop moping around and patting yourself on the back thinking that you're losing out because you're a nice guy.

P/S: Of course there's this issue of shy guys losing out because societal norms dictate that the guy chase after the girl, which I think is where this whole nice guy bad guy debate stemmed from. Hopefully with more feminism we can see girls and guys chase each other equally. Wouldn't the world be a better place like that?

Talking about nice guy (typical stereotypes of shy/quiet vs alpha), I came across a interesting perspective of two different types of alphas. 

ALPHA APPROACH NUMBER 1: 

Typically people think of the alpha male as the built, popular guy that is always the center of attention whenever there is a gathering of people. When a guy disrespects him he is quick to get in his face - the challenger usually backs down quickly, intimidated by his dominant mannerisms. This guy will be classified as an alpha male by most peoples definition. 

But, let me give you another, slightly different, picture of what could be an alpha male - you decide if you agree... 

ALPHA APPROACH NUMBER 2: 

He's rarely the center of attention. He's not particularly good-looking or muscular. But, the funny thing is... when he has something to say people listen. People listen because they respect him. They respect him because he radiates strength and positivism. The strength is a result of being so secure and confident with who he is. He's genuine, real, and authentic. People can't help but notice and admire that. He has clear boundaries. Guys don't mess with him because he doesn't mess with them. Women notice that guys don't mess with him, they notice that when he talks, though it's not often, people listen to what he has to say. Women admire this quiet power and are drawn to it. No, he's not the type draw crowds with his extroverted antics, and he's not going to go around challenging all the other guys in "the pack," he's not that type... and he's perfectly fine with that. He's not out for other peoples acceptance, he doesn't need other people's approval because he is confident with himself. 

So I would think we should really focus on our strengths depending on the type of personalities we have. Thoughts?
-
 
The fact is, nice guys finish last unless they are really lucky. Anyone who says otherwise isn't a 'nice guy'. Girls only want to date and have sex with bad guys. I know a girl who took so long to decide to go on one date because she said I was too nice to her but meanwhile she had 4 one night stands with guys who eventually treated her badly. Moral of the story. Don't be nice. Girls will only want you when they have had all the fun in the world with other guys and are ready to settle down.

 NIce guy: why do all girls only like bad boys?
Nice girl: why do guys only pay attention to popular, well dressed, pretty girls

If you widen your view to consider less popular girls that may not be the most physically attractive or of socially desirable body weight, I'm sure you'll find many who actually appreciate nice guys.
-
 
Do girls who appreciate 'nice guys' even exist?

Perhaps the nice guy is not assertive enough, but he possesses so many traits - sensitive to one's feeling, polite, graciousness, kindness - that would make for a good partner.

Alas, we are told by our seniors and mentors that the world is cruel  (just like how we are graded on a curve in NUS); you have to fight for what you want (yes, barbaric behaviour is easily forgiven in today's society) or you risk losing everything. 

Yes, the bad boy adds spontaneity and spice to your life! But can you count on him to stay faithful to you? Can you count on him to provide emotional support at your darkest moments? 

Is it impossible to find girls who can transcend the evolutionary predisposition to chose a bad boy?? Seems like they are few and far between...

I have a boyfriend. My mum thinks that my boyfriend is distant from my family. He sends me home often and says a few sentences but seldom stay for dinner. I agree to ask him come my house for dinner more often. My mum is unimpressed and wants him to auto come or come "genuinely". From what i see ,my busy boyfriend doesn't show much interest in coming my house but he is polite and chats with my family. I talked to him before but its just an okay reply. What should i do? Try to make them close to each other? How? Any advice?

Hypothetical question for the (single) NUSWhispers community:
You are told there is a someone willing to go on a date with you. The only things you know about them is that they are 
1) of the gender you are attracted to
2) between 18-65 years of age 
3) of normal behavior and countenance (to all outwardly appearances)
You don't know their background, exact age, race, occupation, personality, likes/dislikes or basically anything about them. 
All you know is that this person was briefly told about you and has expressed an interest in meeting you. They are willing to meet you anywhere you prefer and at any time. 
But it is however, a proper date and you ought to respect the conventions; stay for an appropriately long time and try to make a decent attempt at getting to know this person (you aren't allowed to bolt at the sight of them). 
Would you go?

I went for a Christian event recently and met lots of new friends there. I like this activity. However, I am not a Christian and the reason I went there in the first place is for free food :P The friend I met there asked me to join the event next time but I feel a bit guilty. So the problem is: should I go for the event next time?

To , I also have a lot of problems opening up to people. I've gotten by by putting on a mask and acting out a personality I thought would be likeable, keeping people at a comfortable distance. But the truth is I hate myself and I'm scared to let anyone know the "real" me because they'll hate me the same way I do too.

Which part of a woman is the best to touch? 

I think it's her heart. (:

Why is it so difficult for me to open up to people? I’ve always been happier listening to other peoples' problems than telling them about my own. I wish to think that my close friends are more than willing to listen to my feelings but the thought of putting the burden on them makes me think twice. Even my parents always encourage me to share my feelings because I always don’t reveal what I think, even when I am feeling hurtful and lonely inside. I am on the verge of tearing writing this and I don’t know why. It does not help when I am away from home. I tried to make friends with others but it just seems that I am the only who cannot fit in.  I wish I was a little more sociable, a little more happier and a little more accepting of myself.

I have once loved a girl from biz school. Flew overseas for one year exchange, had plenty of relationships, and came back. But my first is still the best, and I still loved her.

Wow. I thought I was the only one. I feel very repulsed by her after I cum. For awhile at least. Usually I pretend I am sleepy and wanna nap but she keeps trying to talk to me or tickle me etc. Which makes me feel even more repulsed.

S, it's been longer than 3 months, yet I still can't get over you. I hope your internship experience has been good. Although it still hurts to think of those memories, I just can't bring myself to hate or blame you. But good news... it's hurting a little lesser now. It's a complicated feeling, I hope to see you again in school and yet I don't. And ah, congratulations for getting onto the Dean's List... I am really very happy for you. And glad that all those long hours and sleepless nights have paid off. Keep it up. :)

I really want to go to the Halloween Horror Night at USS and have been bugging my boyfriend to go with me. However he is too scared of such things to accompany me there. He also does not allow me to go with my group of friends because there will be guys in that group and he is insecure, thinking that I would cling onto their arms and what in (???) I don't understand men honestly. Maybe it'll be better if I went alone LOL.

I am a straight guy, still virgin and never had gf, actually quite frustrated with many avoidance and rejection. Then lately I realized that I am aroused when seeing myself nude. And I realized that when masturbating, I often not imagine girls but only imagine seeing myself doing it. Then I began questioning myself if I am straight.

I'm straight, and have been with my girlfriend for three years this Friday. My confession is that I secretly enjoy the attention of gay men. I've gone to gay bars and clubs on invitation from my best friend (who is gay and has had feelings for me before during poly) and have thoroughly enjoyed being hit on and getting free drinks from men who wants my D. And yes, my girlfriend knows of this, I tell her everything that goes on. Lolol I think I'm an incorrigible flirt...

Recently I started dating a senior, as we like each other and thought why not, we don't have much to lose by trying this out. But a couple of months in I am beginning to feel that we rushed into it too quickly. He is a really nice  guy who treats me well, but it is tough for me to talk to him and confide in him because we never got very close before we started dating. The worst part is, I feel that maybe the feelings I had for him may have been more of a crush than love. I am not too sure if he loves me either. I have been thinking about how to broach this topic but I am unsure of how to do so.

i don't understand you... you drop all these hints and then you disappear and reappear.. i can't read you and i'm so frustrated... i hate how i always whatsapp you even if you don't reply >:( the worse part is that i'm not even interested in you... i just want you as my companion.

How should I react if my girlfriend suddenly scold me, then say she needs her me-time, then REALLY go away and refused to talk to me? i haven't even had the chance to clarify!

The context is that she thinks I am disrespecting her position in the committee when I told her she does not need to bring a laptop(which I felt was unnecessary and heavy) to write down the minutes. Paper and pens can liao what.

Am I wrong to feel that she values her me-time more than our relationship? How can just leave things hanging like this, I haven't even explain myself~

When I tell people that I like girls [I'm a girl], they never fail to ask me if I have ever had a crush on my close friends who are girls. 

Dude. You guys like the opposite sex right? Do you develop a crush on everybody you meet? 

Ignorant fools.

I live with the guilt that I could have done something for my friend that night when he killed himself.

I was partying with my friends that evening and had ignored his call. I needed time to myself and away from his depression that was so exhausting to deal with.

I wish I hadn't ignored his call.

I haven't been able to visit his grave without feeling guilt.

Have you ever looked at the news and wished that somebody else who died suddenly in an accident should have been you? That person who died doing something he or she was passionate about but you, you had nothing to dream for. 
Seems like the devil always likes to play his little tricks everytime. A fortunate reminder of the people around me is the reason i still haven't done something foolish by now. 
From my junior college times, negativity has plagued me since till now. It is always pulling back my shoulders preventing me out of my comfort zone. It has been with me long enough that I am numb to it. 
Then again, I should be grateful that I didn't turn suicidal. Being best buddies with negativity has it's positive sides i guess. 
I guess whatever you feel, whatever happens to you today doesn't matter tomorrow, a week or a year from now. The world still goes on. Don't be silly and don't listen to the negative voices in your mind.

@ OP 

Well, if you have to ask then I'd tell you bluntly. After reading your post, I pictured you as the fat dude from Southpark, episode:"Make love not Warcraft"
well I guess you may be a nice person deep, deep down but for anyone to want to date you is a long shot.

BUT. 

Two options here. 
1: Attempt to woo your BFF. I mean, if it's mutual then I guess anyone who (willingly) adopts an otaku hentai gaming warrior as her best friend HAS to be the slightest way attracted you. 

2) Graduate with first class honours, make lots of money and date a Victoria's Secret model (the snapchat dude is dating Miranda Kerr) then proceed to indulge in truckloads of tentacle porn and beat off the the weirdest incest hentai because you're rich and honestly your trophy wife would not care much as long as she gets a handbag every week.

I would tell you I'm joking but the real world kinda (in some sense) works this way.

I told him in no uncertain terms that I liked him. Everyone heard, and everyone knew, since we were all staying together. All I got was a straight face in return.

Now I'm having a hard time moving past that straight face and moving on.

I really wonder what do girls think of nerds? Are there actually girls who like to talk and hang out with nerds/geeks? I don't mean the typical stereotype skinny smelly socially-inadequate neckbeards that are associated with the word nerd, but about the normal guy who is very interested in gaming/anime/technical stuff in general (things that girls are not usually interested in).

I'm asking this because I'm really curious. I consider myself a gaming nerd because I spend a lot of time playing video games. I'm playing at a quite hardcore and competitive level so whenever I'm not playing, I would spend my time on gaming forums/reddit and write guides and participate in theorycrafting myself. Basically I eat, sleep and game. I really have very little knowledge about general entertainment stuff, like what's the latest Taylor Swift song or what movie is hot right now, simply because I don't care so much to read about those stuff. Because of that, I have very few female friends because I would not have a common topic to talk to them to keep them interested. This may sound stupid to you but sometimes I wonder if I would ever find a gf that will accept my hobby. (I don't think it's an addiction because I still do fairly well in school and I am working a part time job, so gaming is not my utmost priority, just a hobby). And I don't think I am socially awkward because I had a gf before in JC (but that was kinda silly high school relationship), and currently I have a girl BFF as well, so it's not the case that I can't talk to girls. I'm just wondering should I try to be a guy that knows lots of stuff to be able to make friends with more girls? Frankly I don't like to do that but I may end up being single.

I'm OP . It's been some time, I have been trying to move on with some success. Today, one of those "episodic" sad-ness hit me again. 

I have been waiting to talk to you again, wanting to be friends again. Ytd, got to meet up with group of friends, and at night I called her for few mins, just to told her that I'm v.sincere about being friends again, and "best friend" as we agreed when we broke up. I don't know how things will work out, but just being friends for now is good enough. After the call ended, my heart was racing. It's shouldn't happen any more. Felt like I'm in love with you all over again. But in reality, you have moved on. And I have seen how he has replaced me.

Holding back my tears, cannot let mum see my eyes red again. Ytd just told her that everything's perfectly fine already. But.. Memories are swarming me. You were my 'wife', i lost you..

Love is so powerful. It let me overlook all that how you made me felt. Let me put down my pride totally, exposed my weak pathetic self to you. 

Love for my friends gave me strength to appear before you two, and still... act like normal.

Love reminds me... if you are happier but not because of me, then the best way is to let you go.

I want to cry... But today it's the internship big day. I mustn't go there with eyes red. My intern friends will be worried for me again. 

Cupcake song that you once sang for me is playing in my head again. I'll just control, tolerate.. Tearing shld be fine, I shall let myself tear on the way to work.

I really want to cry. It's past time that I should move on, I want to be friends again. I mustn't cry any more, for all my loved ones and beloved friends. Thank you all for being with me. I really want to cry. I need strength to move on. For u all, i shan't cry. I shan't make you all worried. I shan't make you all awkward. 

One more thing. 他心机很重.

 I think someone should bring a dating app that is meant for SoC alumni and students. That will solve the problem of spending too much time coding and no time to find gf/bf. :D

Seriously, you can really enjoy orientation camps if your mindset is not just to find a boyfriend/girlfriend. And if you do and it does not work out you are just gonna have a sucky summer all the way. 3 months, dont waste it on dating someone.

People who comment (a lot) on NUSWhispers give terrible advice. Like really terrible advice. To all the confessors seeking advice on life, relationships, family problems, money problems, whatever - trust me on this. Don't listen to them. Go make friends in real life. These are the people who hold the best life advice for you (i.e. people who actually have a life).

To my dearest girlfriend

Ever since I met you through Angels' and Mortals

I have fallen in love with you

Fate was kind to me

That with my hardest efforts

I finally won over your heart

But after getting you

I didn't appreciate

The luck I had, 

I didn't cherish you well enough.

Many things have happened between us

And we have gone through

Many months of non-stop quarrellings

Because I didn't treasure you well enough

Last week, we stopped talking.

I knew I'm going to lose you

I vowed to change 

I am sorry

And thanks for forgiving me

I won't disappoint you

Again.

Every now and then I think of getting a girlfriend, and I've met some nice girls, but I never felt the desire to woo any of them. Sometimes my brain's just like 'nah man too much investment too little return'. I look at posts about relationship problems and think how great it is to just have feelings for someone (used to in JC, but nothing these few years). Just a reminder to those having relationship woes
That said, I do enjoy being alone, just finding my current state interesting. Meh, maybe I'm delusional.
-
 
I generally enjoy helping people, be it running errands, picking up something along the way, or helping to source for random stuff, I get this huge sense of satisfaction after helping. But I feel awkward when people thank me. I have no idea how to react, be it my face, body language, or the words to say. Usually it'd just be a straight up "Yeah don't mention it", or "Aiya nevermind lah, it was along the way anyway". But in my mind I'd be thinking, "Um what do I do with my face? Do I smile? Do I give the "Aiya no big deal la" face?"

And then the worst things for me to react to are birthdays. Gifts or surprises, both. I have no frigging idea how to physically emote, regardless of whether I feel surprised, happy, sad, astonished, etc. I think most of my friends get pretty disappointed to my reaction tbh lol.

Well, this is a topic I've never spoken to anyone about. So, any input is appreciated :)

I used to be a geek/nerd in secondary school. An ugly duckling. Could never seem to talk to any girl without also having her avoid me because she thinks I was 'coming onto her'.

Sometimes things got so bad that even though I avoided 'coming onto girls' (pun not intended), somehow girls could sense and even still avoid me. All it took was for one girl to avoid me for the rest of the girls to avoid me too - nobody wanted to be seen as friends with the ugly duckling.

So in JC I swore to 'figure girls out'. Friend of mine gave me a copy of David D Angelo's ebook double your dating. It was all the rage, after all who doesn't wanna be popular with the girls? So I ate, slept and shat DYD until I became hot. and attractive. (yeah. almost literally like barney stinson really).

But I kinda wish I'm still the unattractive old me. Then someone would like me for who I am, not because I'm hot and know how to put the moves on.

And I wish girls in my secondary school days treated me better.

sex isn't evil ppl. casual sex with strangers not withstanding, i dont think sex between long time couples is bad. you know, it has been shown that sexually compatible couples are able to get over problems in all other aspects of life better. in other words, couples who have good sex tend to stay together. before getting married, it is best that couples know everything about one another, so how about knowing with you're sexually compatible?

Just when I think I've found an eligible girl, great personality, face and figure not bad, I realise she's attached. This applies to every single girl I've met in NUS. Seriously, where them single bitches at?
-
 
I was involved in a love triangle episode. The girl liked me, I liked the girl and my best friend liked her as well. After fighting with my best friend, I decided to withdraw, because he's rich, i'm poor and (most importantly) he's of the same religion as her. Futhermore, I kept the secret that he liked her as he enjoyed hanging out with her, while I was banished to be alone for months. He said he 'die die' wanted her but she didn't accept him due to various reasons. 

Shortly after, he got attached to this random girl. He's now living his life with money, car and girlfriend. 

Me? I no longer keep in contact with any of them. When I try to talk to the girl, she brushes me off. However, she claims that she still wants to be friends. 

What kind of friend do you expect me to be if I am supposed to be two-arms length away? I cannot even strike a simple conversation with you because you think I'm 'trying to get you back'. No I am not, because it hurts just to even think about you.

I'm literally on the verge of giving up salvaging any friendship that is even left. I know you read NUSWhispers, and you probably know who I am. 

Right now, I am stating: I am not trying anything funny, I just want everything to be as normal as it can possibly be. Stop reading too much into anything I do. 
-
 
Whenever my friends and I meet to catch up, they will always say something like: "So you got anything to share lately? Share leh. Huh? Not attached yet? You sure or not? You this kind of person, many people like one leh" Okay buddies, please just lay off, it's getting very annoying, especially when you all say this 80% of the time when we meet up. I will get into a relationship when I get into a relationship, OK?

Do anyone have friends who are also like this, or have the same problem? How do you deal with this? Honestly I'm getting tired of the same old question and the same old rolling-my-eyes regime.

One month into university. During camp, I feel that the pressure to drink or go clubbing in uni is so damn high? I remember an OG mate asking if anyone don't drink and I naively raised my hand only to be judged by all of them. I look like a innocent girl next door so I thought it wasn't too surprising? Even the other girls in my group who looked as "guai" as me didn't raised their hands and when I asked, they say do drink. There were a few times during camp when they wanted to play drinking games but eventually didn't much, to my relief.And after supper, they were always talking about wanting to meet up one day for dinner and drinks.  I am not sure if its only my faculty but I feel like our lifestyles are just too different. I don't intend to drink, I mean beers are fine but they go for hard liquor mixed nor club(parents don't allow anyway) but just all these peer pressure is overwhelming.

My boyfriend and I love reading week. Its the time we get to study together in school and then have makeout sessions as breaks at secluded areas in school. Once, we even fell asleep in each others arms for quite a while after a very busy day of 'studying'.

I have been together with my girlfriend for close to a year. We maintained our relationship on a platonic level but it is only until recently that we started becoming sexually intimate. I am aware that I have a shorter than average penis length. There was a time when we were deeply in the zone and she took off my pants and felt me under. I wasn't thinking much at that point as I was deeply aroused. Just as she removed my boxers, I could feel her sense of disappointment at my size. She did not explicitly mention it but I could tell.  After that incident, I have been extremely self conscious about my body around her and would avoid intimacy because I am afraid I can't satisfy her. She is my first girlfriend and I really love her. What should I do?

It has been years since we broke up yet you're always on the back of my mind. i've always wanted to get back in touch, but maybe history should be history.

I've been seeing a guy for about 4 months. Recently, he confessed that sometimes, he wishes he could screw other girls. I got really insecure after that and started mirroring his sentiments. (I had a few fwb prior) We got into an argument and he said that he was 'slightly ashamed' of me cause I wasn't stick thin. (I'm average sized) He said a bunch of other hurtful things and I decided to end things off. However, the next day he wanted me back saying I'm everything he's looking for despite my physical flaw. 

He was the one that made me feel what being loved felt like. He accepted my past and previous bad relationships.

So my question now is whether I should take him back.
-
 
For me, I always thought looks are not important. What's more important are character, values, way of thinking, and whether we are on same wavelength.

I thought I was idealistic. I mean, looks still play a part right? No matter how many times we say that inner beauty is more important. So I also doubted myself and wondered would I really be able to like someone regardless of looks.

Then I fell in love with this guy from my course. He is far from good-looking. Not saying this in a critical way, but just stating a fact (not say I very pretty also anyway). He is nowhere near what people would think to be handsome. Not very tall, hair is thinning quite badly despite being quite young still, not very fit or anything, face also not what people would say is handsome. I showed my friends his picture and they all like "huhhhhh are you sure", then I scolded them. 

I really grew to like him after getting to know him as a friend. I like the way he talks, the way he thinks, and we have common interest and opinions about life. We could sustain a long conversation and not get bored, during some classes that we are in. He is also very intelligent, but very humble. He is doing a lot of things in his life to help the underprivileged, and I sense he's not doing it to build up CV or look good, because I saw how he sacrificed a lot to do stuff that he won't be recognised for. And the people he work with consider him to be a real friend and brother. 

So, although I never saw myself as those girls bold enough to make the first move, I thought, heck it, I really like him and I'm not going to let this chance go. So I tried to find ways to contact him personally to have more one-on-one interaction, especially since he is going overseas and I can't see him in class anymore.

Cut the long story short, he... is not interested in me. 

I'm evergreen, never really liked any guy before. This only time when I like a guy, I really like him so much that he is attractive to me just as he is. 

But not fated lah, what can I do. Sigh.

With reference to Confession 

Forgive but do not forget. There is no such thing as "forgiving and forgetting". If he goes back to his old ways after your mum's bday. Respond. Shout at him, tell him he has been hurting you and your siblings for so long. Show your pain. Tell him your pain. If he continues it longer, I'm sorry. I was once in your shoes. Now I'm estranged from my father. I regret not having a comfortable and warm childhood or father to follow after. But life's like that, I have to grow up. 

If he doesn't want to be the father he needs to be, fine. I will grow up without a father and be the man he will never be. I will be a man who loves, honors his wife. I will be a man, who younger delinquents can look up to. I will be a man, the downtrodden can follow after.

I am someone who has lots of flaws and the people around me ( from secondary school until uni ) seems to be picking on my flaws and will say something like " no wonder you are still single" and some will even make fun of my looks.

Advise needed.

How do I get a girlfriend?Do I start by being friend with them? The problem is whenever I tried to ask a girl for her number, she will assumed that I wanted a more than friendship even if I said that I only want to be friend.

Back in secondary school, I had a crush on a girl. She rejected me but I told myself I will stay single and wait for her in the next 10 years.

I like this girl and we've been going out for about 2-3 months. The thing is, I found out a week ago that she doesn't believe in premarital sex. Sex is impt to me in a r/s.  Should I end this even though I like her very much?

3 years ago, I met this group of wonderful friends while working in a 2 days event job. Its probably one of the most wonderful days in my life working there. I enjoy the time when I have meals with them and also the time spent chatting about our life. Shortly, when the job comes to an end, I was quite sad. However, we still make the effort to meet up and go for outings a few times a year and till now we are still meeting up occasionally when we are not busy with our life. Anyway, just wanna share that from my experience, it is still possible to form long lasting friendship even from a very short temp job.

Oh yea TI5 is starting!!

 I guess he was embarrassed. I lost a close female friend not too long ago and I didn't expect her to pop up in the faculty I was in (we are in different faculties). It was too late on hindsight to 'turn back' and run so I 'glazed my eyes' and walked (I think she saw me too and turned away).

As you mention that you feel that he has treated you poorly, you wouldn't have a problem to say 'hi' to him (and I might say I'm impressed, I probably would have ignored/ranted about it). Maybe he does feel to some extent that he treated you poorly? So he felt awkward to see you. It's not an unexpected reaction I feel. It's your call to decide if you want to ask him about it, cause it seems to me that you don't mind being friends with him

I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday. We were together for three years, but things over the last few months have been bitter for the both of us.

When I came home last night, I looked all distraught. My mum was watching TV in the living room. I greeted her like I always do and then went in straight to my room. Moments later, she came in my room while I was already lying in bed still in the day's clothes. She sat by my bed and asked me what was wrong. I didn't know what or how to say it.

"It's that friend of yours is it? The Chinese boy I've seen you brought home?"

"No. I'm tired. Can you leave me by myself?"

"It's ok. Mak not judging you ok? He's not just a friend right?"

Hearing that put all the worries of coming out to rest. I had hidden a huge part of my life to her. I was afraid she would reject me. We are, after all, a Muslim family. The track record in my family would suggest that I would be disowned. That was the case for my distant cousin in Malaysia who was thrown out of his home when his family found out that he was transgender MTF.

"I'm not my sister," she said, "You need to give me more credit. I won't throw you out. You're my son, I love you."

I guess... I've one less thing to worry about now.

Dear  OP:

tl;dr: Different people express various degrees of physical affection, even towards platonic friends, and assumptions are bad.

I wonder what your classification of "pretty touchy" is, but it doesn't seem like touchy=dating is a logical conclusion.

I've known quite a few physically affectionate girls since sec school (straight guy here), and it was platonic for us most of the time. From sleeve tugging, arm grabbing, hugging, tickling, hair ruffling, to sharing a sofa or a bed in hall or at their houses during Reading Week to force myself to study, there weren't expectations of dating or romantic attraction. I did date one girl from JC, but neither of us assumed we were romantically interested in each other solely because of the repeated ticklings.

Of course, for every physically affectionate friend I've had, there are many more who are not, and that's totally cool. People express affection in many different ways. But it seems to me this guy is one of the more physically affectionate ones, and it might be better (as it usually is) to actually find out how he feels. Assumptions can be very dangerous, and it's also pretty unfair to claim this guy is untrustworthy when all you seem to be saying is that you "consider" you both to be dating, and then faulting him for being too friendly to others.

In NUS, you will make very good friends; friendships you will cherish for many years after graduation. But none of them will compare to the friends you made before entering university.

I coincidentally met my ex-boyfriend at a mrt station. He was wearing office wear and was exiting from the MRT and I was wearing a sports attire waiting to enter the MRT. I was shocked to see him but I thought maybe it would be polite to say hi. But his first reaction was to run in a fashion as though I would chase after him. I was like, seriously, and entered the mrt without second thoughts.

But his reaction still haunts me a little given the fact he was the one who treats me poorly in our relationship. Alright, I should forget about that "big girl" and focus in continuing my holiday schedules.

I'm faced with a dilemma here.
How would you guys tackle a situation where a person whom you see almost on daily basis has a terribly strong body odour? 
The problem is that this person has a nice, friendly character and gets along relatively well with everyone else. But being the one that is closest (in terms of proximity, not relationship) to the person I am suffering everyday due to the stench. 
I understand BO is a terribly sensitive topic to bring up to anyone... but my god I'm afraid that one day I'll suffocate to death. How can some people be irresponsible sigh, do they feel no shame in inflicting this torture to those around them?
Please advise.

when doing my job hunting, i ask my seniors and friends to find out about the work culture in the companies and the sectors to gain experience in, my parents would constantly tell me not to believe my friends or seniors as they fear that they just want to backstab me. i believe that in the working world, its hard to make friends but in the schooling world, i am still a strong believer that my friends can be trusted. Sometime i feel really tired defending my friends while my parents are sceptical that my friends are been genuinely helpful. Because of their point of view on friends, the unwillingness to trust, my parents have few friends. But i can understand that as my parents have encountered being betrayed by their own friends.

To 

I have a boyfriend but I find myself attracted to other femme girls as well. I've been feeling this way for a very long time, and it's just so difficult when you don't know what you want exactly. I love my boyfriend for who he is, but I'm always hoping I'll meet a girl who'll be interested in me. However, it's not easy to find femmes who are interested in only femmes, as most of them gives off a "straight" vibe, thus making it even more difficult to approach them. Sigh.

He cheated on me, then  dumped me for another girl who also cheated on her bf to come to him. I still love him so much because we had been together for many years but to him those years dont mean a thing. I cried for one whole week.

Why are girls so choosy about guys. need looks la, need good hair la, etc.. can't you just accept the guy for who he is?

Sometimes I wonder why I can't just fess up and be completely open to my closest friends. Like I have friends with whom I can have in depth debates about everything and anything in general, but when some topics hit close to home and I feel like I want to just tell them about personal things I've thought or felt I end up backing out in the end. 
I know I probably can't be the only one but I do hate it when I say things like "I knew a friend who..." or "I know of..." when inside all I want to say is that that was me

I want sex. Simple and plainly. With as many girls as I can. I get turned on easily. Every time I see sexily dressed girls, my mind will automatically fantasize how it is like to have sex with them. I am not sure whether I am abnormal or not, but this would not be a problem if I am single. But I am not.

I also have a girlfriend and we've been together for two years. She's the best girl that I have ever met. Caring, patient and kind. A superb wife material. There's only one problem: She's a devout Christian. She attends VCF regularly — I've tagged along for a few sessions before — and whenever they discuss sex, she's in full agreement with them saying that sex is a sin and should be left until marriage. 

We have never discussed the topic of sex yet (I suppose is a taboo) and I am afraid that if the topic does come out, I either have to lie or tell the truth and risk a breakup, which I really don't want to. On one hand, there's this irritable need of mine (tbh I don't know how I would react if temptation does crop up) and on the other I don't want to lose this relationship (because I could never find another girl like her). I even thought of going to prostitutes before but that would constitute cheating. What should I do?

To the pretty, super intelligent, cheerful girl from CEG, I am so attracted to your personality and looks and have a huge crush on you but dare not ask you out because I have no idea whether you are single, attached or have someone in mind, and we're not so close so it's weird to ask you about your love life :'(

I don't have the habit of celebrating my birthday. Every time people wish me happy birthday, it feels weird somehow. When my friends tried to organise a party for me, I even made excuses not to come. I wish that I can accept these acts of goodwill from people sometimes.

"When's your birthday?"

"30th Feb"

Works everytime.

Coming to NUSWhispers and reading all the posts about girls crushing on popular guys, girls making out with guys and girls complaining about guys when I only have my right hand as my faithful companion. andstillavirgin #sociallyawkwardproblems

Whenever my bf has an erection, he will treat me very nice. He will buy alot things for me. He also gave many promises. However once I gave him his "pleasure", he will go court other girls. I expressed my anger but he shrugged it aside. He say those girls are better than me and ask me to reflect on myself.  Is he a jerk?

It has been a long time since i felt this way after breaking up with my ex. It's like every time  he look at me when i talk, he's looking through my soul. Even though i just met him, it felt as though we have known each other for years. He usually give off a vibe whereby it seems as though he prefer to keep people at arm's length but i can tell that behind that tough facade lies a very soft side to him. I am greatly attracted and can't stop thinking about him, about his eyes

I too feel like I will be spending the rest of my life alone. I am straight but I have tons of weird fetishes which actually prevent me from approaching girls because I feel any relationship I get into will end when she finds out. I am also asexual, which means I have no inclination whatsoever to have sexual intercourse with a woman. I know this sounds contradictory to what I said earlier but that's how it is. What should I do? This really upsets me.

I met my girlfriend when I was in my year 1, and we're in a stable and sweet relationship. However, it's difficult for me to tell her that I need sex. Yes, yes, all that talk about abstinence and waiting till marriage... But it's driving me crazy sometimes. Yet I don't want her to be upset (she grew up in a religious and conservative family), and I don't want our relationship to be affected just because of my lust. And I feel guilty from time to time that I can't control my desires. Anyone has a solution???

I met this girl a while ago and was attracted to her quite immediately. The thing is, our interactions are quite limited after that, with nothing beyond normal whatsapp conversations. I have thought of asking her out before, but I would like to have some opinions first. If a guy whom you have minimal interaction out of social media wants to take you out, would you think it is awkward? (For e.g. because he's liking you cos of your looks etc.)

I just really need to get this off my chest and I need some advices. A close relative of mine passed away a few months ago and I didn't get to say goodbye. He watched me grow up and I was really close to him. For some reasons, my parents kept it from me so I can concentrate on my studies. It's been a while but I can't seem to forgive myself.... It really hurts knowing I have this regret forever. 

I'm feeling very lost.

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m running out of time
Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like your begging for my help
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was telling
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me

Hey Whisperers. 

I am curious on your opinions regarding LGBTQ. 

I am part of that community and I really wanna pursue a relationship but I'm unsure if that person swings that way. Is there any L's out there? Hahaha.

To , I (Singaporean) have dated a Chinese boy before and there are really cultural differences. I think the boyfriend is just thinking of how to break it to his parents. While I have nothing against their relationship, I have to say that it's not easy to have a relationship with someone who grew up in a different culture, and not easy to come out to the parents too. To be honest, the guy shouldn't sing praises about her either, but let the parents judge her based on her own fortes, or actions. And don't ask the guy to devalue himself?! Why should he do that? Don't make it seem like the girl is manipulating him. Let things go naturally.

And please don't confess to her when she's already in a relationship, you'll put her in a very very difficult position. I do regret my cross-cultural relationship but seriously, if they're happy together, don't ruin it. The parents will come to their senses, just give them time. And it's probably not easy for the boyfriend to handle both relationship and family, please understand that.

I know my ideas are good. At least I think so. But somehow I always don't speak up about them during brainstorming session. For instance, for our camp opening, I wanted to suggest dancing to some kpop dance, those easy ones. But I kept quiet cos inside, I'm telling myself that this idea wouldn't work. 

Also for cheers, I wanted to suggest an easy but fun song that we could dance to. But I kept quiet again cos somehow I knew the og won't listen. 

It is always the feeling of somehow, ppl won't like my idea. I don't consider myself as clever, but I know I can be more with my ideas.

Hey guys,
I'm an undergrad (guy) in NUS and I really like this platform as anyone can share almost anything and find support and encouragement here. (Though sometimes, some comments are really rude and just populist to get likes)
Well, I haven't really had the time to be very involved in school events outside of my faculty and after a couple of years, I would really like to get to know more people. Haven't really been in the dating game recently too after a couple of bad experiences and it would be great to meet some new people, especially girls, who might be interested in something more than friends. I don't mind making friends too though. And for those who might be saying I should ask my female friends out or take the initiative in real life and join CCAs, etc, guess what? I am not being lazy nor taking the easy way out. Right now, this seems a good and safe avenue and I would really prefer to meet NUS (or other uni) girls. And i'm not going to be asking all my friends out because I'm just not interested in them that way and those that I may be interested in are attached. I was in a CCA before but don't really have time for it now. So if anyone is up for a chat to see if we click, drop me a message on kik. my id is 'nusguy'. I don't bite :)

I am a freshie that is going to matriculate this year. I have been to a few camps but i feel really out of place and lonely (yes even during the camp itself). Often, i find myself being very quiet and uncomfortable around my camp mates (which is not myself) i don't know why this is happening. Before this, i am really excited about school but know i am really stress and afraid of what is to come.

My mother is extremely homophobic. I don't remember why but the talk suddenly turned to lesbian women in the car with her just now. she said " girl ah, you must be careful of those tomboy, they like girl one, later they fall in love with you you die ah.” I just kept quiet while she continued. “all the gay people will get aids” It was too much for me, i protested “ what nonsense, it doesn’t happen like that!” She just kept quiet. The whole ride home i just kept quiet. She finds people of the lgbt community disgusting and wrong. The problem is I am in love with girls. And i have no idea what to do. The thought of never having a life that my parents will be proud of saddens me. They will never understand the pain i feel everyday living a lie.

Recently started talking to my ex again for about 2 months. We went out for a few times since then.

I wanna woo her back but  i am not sure how she feels. Sometimes she is very happy but sometimes a little cold. However, she tries to get my attention at times.

What should I do?

I need some advice over here.

Basically I have been going out on and off with this guy I met and chatting on whatsapp. He confessed that he has feelings for me and wish to take it further. I didnt agree as I felt that I want to know more about him before I enter into a relationship (which is not wrong).

What puzzles me is that whenever he is unhappy because of something I said or do, he will post subtle hints on facebook instead of telling me directly. His reply will always be "..." But he will post things like "is this the 2nd or 3rd time I received such reply, and what you said really hurt me" and stuffs along the line. I hope I am not over thinking things (I didn't probe further) but such posts always appear a few hrs after I said something and he replied "..."

The last week we went out for a meal, it was super awkward as there was minimal conversations and he volunteered to walk me home. I needed to grab something at the bookshop and he followed me there. Throughout the journey, I was just walking alone and browsing my own stuffs at the bookshop so I told him that I can just make my own way home. A few hours later, he posted "what happened was really upsetting"

I mean.. If he keep his thoughts to himself all the time, there is no way I can understand him better right? And we always end off either with a concersation I said and he doesn't like or he will say hi just before bedtime only to say good night. I am really confused and tired from all these guessing games. I guess I wasn't also being direct enough when I couldnt take it and I replied him one night "is this all you can say?" To me, if it always happens, it is kinda irritating and I would just rather be direct. Advice please. Im confused

I don't get labels - Lesbian, Gay, Trans, etc.

Why must you squeeze yourself into a frame? Like, some people who think they are lesbian might fall for a guy and a gay guy might fall for a girl. You may never know. It definitely happens.

Just be yourself. Don't conform to a label. You are you.

I met this guy Z during a senior's precamp in NUS. He's tall and good looking and he knows it himself. Anyway he was hitting on me throughout the entire camp and we were texting everyday after the camp. During the actual camp itself, we were pretty touchy and would sleep beside each other in our seperate sleeping bags. I would consider us to be 'dating' and there definitely was something going on, as confirmed by my other house mates.

However, during the camp itself, he jumped from house to house, hitting on selected female freshies the same way he hit on me. When some of the other senior guys asked him about what he was doing, he insisted that he was just being friendly and that we were not dating. He seemed genuinely clueless about it and even tagged me in an Instagram post at the end of the camp.

Anyway, afew weeks ago he crashed our mutual friend's og at a club and was seen to be behaving intimately with a girl freshie. After that, he went for a NUS ambassador programme where he met another girl (a y2 senior) and started hitting on her. We stopped talking ever since then. He is currently overseas taking multiple photos with two girls that he just met there.

I just needed to get this off my chest and you may think that I am exaggerating but I wish I was. I don't understand how such guys can exist and I chose not to believe the multiple things that people have said about you and deciding to trust you instead but I guess I was deeply mistaken. It's so awkward for me to join in our senior's group outings because Z would be there and I'm not ready to face you just yet. I don't understand how you can see this behaviour as okay when it obviously is not. But now at least I see you for the person you are. This is why you have no close friends Z.

Hi vice president of eusoff!! I just think that you're pretty cute and seem like a really nice guy, so see you soon in hall? (No pressure)

And........ Anybody have any idea. what type of girls he like ah? Is he dating anyone now? TIA:-)

Nowadays, my friend is repeatedly talking about the things that his father did in the past that helped us. What is he up to? I find it irritating that he keep on bringing the past out.

I often hear people say, "how can you be so sure you're a lesbian when you have not tried kissing or being with a guy?". Well, I can ask you the same thing, can't I? How can you be so sure you're straight when you have not tried kissing girls? 

Sure, I've not kissed anyone of any gender and I've not been in a relationship with anyone of any gender. But there's a feeling in that gut that you have to follow sometimes and that feeling is strong.

In light of 

I don't understand why people cheat. Is it so hard to remain faithful? If you answered yes, then maybe monogamy isn't for you. If that is the case, then talk to your partner about an open relationship then. Don't fucking lie. What kind of person builds a relationship on a lie? You've no idea how damaging it is for the person being cheated on. 

I had a girlfriend who cheated on me. We were coupled for two years. I saw it in her chat logs - raunchy conversations that include texts like 'hey is your boyfriend with you now?', 'place empty. wanna fuck?', 'had a great time... xx'. I know I shouldn't have looked, but she was acting strangely and I wanted to know why. I gave her many chances to own up but she didn't. Maybe I was partly to blame for this. I wasn't spending enough time with her because I was busy with NS. But fuck, that's no excuse for cheating. I'm glad I dumped that bitch... But I've never been able to trust another girl since then. It sucks that I'm always so bloody cautious now. I still see her around in school, and to this day, I still do not wish her well.

To the OP of that confession, I'd tell you to grow a pair but that's physically impossible. Just own up and grow the fuck up.

I am really cynical about relationships. Whenever I feel like I like someone I ask myself - Do I really like her (in my case) for who she is, or do I just like who I think she is? Would I love her, 10 years down the road, when all the romance and novelty has worn off? 

I then start to imagine myself in situations of conflict with her. Would I still love her and want to stay with her when she is being totally unreasonable, grumpy, jealous, etc? How about when she insults and humiliates me? How about when she doesn't want to listen to whatever you say, and will not relent until you give in? How about when she does something outright disgusting?

Sounds extreme, sounds like I'm too paranoid or exaggerating. Surely this doesn't happen to everyone right? Surely there is a way to work things out right? But that's what's happening with some couples around me, and even among my relatives. My own parents divorced, and for many years, me and my brothers really suffered emotionally. Got me thinking. The things is, no couple would expect that things will turn ugly. All couples get together thinking that they'll be different, that they'll be able to work things out because they love each other. Most, if not all, divorces started out with hopeful, loving couples making a lifelong oath to love each other. 

None of us know what will happen in future. Your partner may have an affair. Maybe bear a grudge against you for one big mistake you made (forgiveness is easier said than done). Over time, things get ugly. There will definitely be something that you will feel disgusted with about your partner over time. Snide remarks, looks of disgust, those 'tsk' noises she makes when you do something she doesn't like, sarcasm. All these kill marriages, and kill you slowly.

Good for those who can last through that and find a reason to keep loving your partner. The harder thing that is out of your control is whether your partner will do that for you as well.

First off, I'm a girl. Hello!

I've always talked about guys with my family and friends but it's different for me now. I've fallen deeply in love with this girl I met and I'm lucky because she's now my girlfriend. 

I always knew I was somehow different because I wasn't really physically attracted to guys. Yes they're cute but that's all to me.

How do I tell my family or friends that I now have a girlfriend when they are expecting a boyfriend? Like, I don't wanna keep our relationship in the dark because I'm really falling for her and I'm so freaking proud to be her girlfriend that I wanna show her off to the world. I would hate for her to think that I'm ashamed to be her girlfriend :(

Any advice please? No hate.

I am a sexually active female and I enjoy the thrill from getting a new partner. But recently I'm just not very interested in sex anymore. Doesn't feel good to lose your libido. And this has gone on for a while so it is not a hormonal or monthly thing.

To 

A great bodybuilder once said that Jay Cutler is his best friend, he motivated him and pave his way to his success. A best friend is somebody you can talk to when you are feeling low and need somebody to motivate you. For some, their best friends are the people they hurt the most. Not because they want to, but due to the mask they wear that hides their true identity.

Sometimes, I feel the same as you. I have only a butler as my best friend. My only sidekick has died because of me. That is why I have no best friends anymore. 

Sometimes when I feel low, I always remember someone who always have a smile on his face. I wonder sometimes if he is my best friend.

I'm constantly torn between being myself (a shy and reserved person) and being someone more accepted by society (i.e. more vocal and outgoing). Sometimes I put in conscious effort to be more sociable and vocal and I notice that people respond positively to it. I do feel good about it too. But on other days I end up feeling really tired and empty being someone I'm not. Anyone feels the same way? 

-
 
Oh MH...it's true that I don't really know you well now, but we used to know each other so well. And the reason why I don't want to message you is because I'm the one who always initiate it and you always end it off without replying the messages. At least have the decency to offer other time we can talk / meet up rather than leaving it like that.

To ,
 here. I was really confused when he kissed me on that day. I kept wondering how could he be so bold to even kiss me when i barely knew him. (p.s the guy is of the same religion as you are) Thanks for voicing out your situation. Initially, he lied to me about a small matter regarding some FB post which i already found it to be quite suspicious but i ignored it as i thought it was nothing. He talked to me about his past and his exes which i am still doubting. He also kept apologizing for those mistakes he made (e.g kissing me when i didn't want to, fingering me the other time at his home) and i was weak to accept his apologies. But what he did at the office last week was really the last straw. I don't think i have the heart to report him to the authorities so i will just delete him from my life instead. I just hope he will stop his bulls**t and get a life.

As a guy, I am always the one who would take the initiative to ask the girl I like out, and wear my heart on my sleeve. I think this the norm in our society. Some of  you might say times has changed but I think girls making a move first is still an exception rather than the norm. You may argue or correct me if I'm wrong. I was just wondering, if guys is always the one to make the move on the girl he falls for, are most girls just destined to accept or go for guys who makes a move for them? What if the guy a girls falls for never does not feel the same way. Would most girls just resort to subtlety hint and accept someone who chases them eventually in hope that she will develop feelings for him?

I presumed that the reason my previous post was rejected is because I state the person name so I decided to write another one but keeping the person anonymous. 

To the girl who like to comment on NUSwhispers  and usually get alot of likes:

It is nice to see you commenting here as most of your comment are constructive comments.

However, I want to ask you something 

Why did you prevent others from sending you a friend request?

-
 
Summer is a very lonely time for me because I don't have friends who are more than acquaintances I can have a hibye conversation with in Uni. What do I do to get proper friendships? Will people think I'm weird if I initiate an outing?
-
 
Today, i was asked this question: "Who are your closest friends and what are the commonalities between you and them?"

As everyone started writing down the names of their friends and the commonalities, i felt so pathetic. I didnt even know who i could consider as my close friends, not to even mention the commonalities. 

Ever since uni started, my group of friends just started to drift apart despite being in the same school. We still meet up as a group occasionally, but its very obvious that we are just not as close as we used to be. I know how this is very normal because everyone finds new friends in uni. But me, i guess i can only blame myself for not socializing much in my first year and not joining camps after. 

I get so envious of people who made so many new friends and their uni life just seems so much more fun than mine. I thought i could try and make more friends without joining any activities, but no, everyone was in cliques/groups, it just didnt seem right for me to butt in suddenly. 

"Friendships" affect me a lot especially because I'm not close to my family. But nowadays, i realize that i dont even know who to approach when i just wanna rant about life. Not gonna lie, i feel really lonely. I've tried making friends online (didnt tell anyone about this in case i get judged for being desperate), but to no avail so i gave up. 

Everyone has at least one person to turn to when they feel down, but i dont. Sometimes i just feel like I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life.

I had experiences dating a guy living in a condo, before dating a guy living in a HDB flat. This might or might not say much about their family condition, just some musings over the differences in their treatments to me.

The condo guy took me out for lavish dinners at fancy places; the HDB guy took me to hawker centres. The condo guy remembered our anniversary and made a big fuss out of it; the HDB guy treated our anniversary like any other day with a simple 'Happy Anniversary' greeting. Advices from the condo guy included quotes from classic novels, poems, and bible verses I've never heard of, displaying his intellectual ability; advices from the HDB guy...well, he just listened and soothed me, sometimes shushing my sniffles, displaying his patience dealing with a girl with tears and mucus all over his shirt. The condo guy spent on me without blinking an eye, making me felt appreciated; the HDB guy always apologized for not having enough savings for the month to spend on me, making me realized relationships are more than just gifts and presents. The condo guy never call when we were apart, giving me the freedom I liked; the HDB guy was worried-stricken once I forgot to reply his WA messages (when we were apart), giving me the attention I craved for. 

Both had changed my life in different ways, so to the both of you, cheers to the adventures beyond, and wishing you all the best in your search for love :)

I have been seeing confession about cheating and I want to give my opinion on it.

I feel that interacting with other boys doesn't mean that you are cheating on your current boyfriend.

If the girl doesn't want to break up with the boy because she still have feeling for him, why should the boy do so?

The boy may say he doesn't trust her girlfriend anymore because she didn't mention anything about chatting with other male but did he give her a chance to talk to him? If he did, he will understand that his girlfriend still have feeling for him despite chatting with other male and if that is the case, why breakup?

'Just be yourself.'- said the attractive one with a personality everyone likes...
'It's not all about money, trust me...' - said the rich one with no financial issues...
'You will find the right one for you, just wait.' - said the married one with the right one in their bed every night...
'You have to trust some people every now and then...' - said the one who has never been stabbed in the back...
'You are important to the ones you love...' - said the one without a broken heart...

"I'm going to disregard all the good advice my friends are giving me because I envy them for one reason or another" said the bitter, immature, self victimizing asshole.

Recently ened my "play sessions" with some of my playmates and swore to stay loyal from now on to my bf. Weird thing is I don't feel guilty at all. I don't plan to do it again but I also don't plan to let him know anything. I love him, but he just left me really lonely at times. And the more I want to talk about it, the loneliness, the more pissed off he would get. No other ways to rant or feel wanted so I resorted to that - I have both the body and the face so I can get any guy I want. Well one good thing I've learnt is that most guys are terrible. Make me treasure my bf more.

To 

I was reading your post together with a friend. While she, and i think many others who have commented, thought that it would be absolutely stupid of you to even ask such a question of whether to still give him a chance or not (and I like many others, if not everyone, think you should not), i understand why to you it isnt so clear cut and obvious. 

I was from poly and since year one of poly ive been hanging with a group of friends, including this particularly guy. 

Over the years in poly, the guy and i grew closer, closer than we were to the rest of the group and by the end of poly, we were basically together. 

I've been a rather religious person, he knows that, and from even before we got together, i thought that he was too. Hence, i was comfortable getting close to him in the first place because I assumed he woul not make any funny moves on me. 

You know what they say about assuming. 

It started with harmless physical contacts like holding hands, and hugging. I wasnt exactly comfortable at this point as I said, i was rather religious and strict about physical contact with the opposite sex (i should probably add that in my religion, physical contact with the opp sex is a strict No-no. You can probably figure out which religion im in now).  But i didnt express it nor told him. I figured and assumed, again, that he wouldnt cross the line with me. 

One day, in a service elevator, he kissed me on the lips. I was shocked, trying to register what was going on, hence i didnt immediately push him away. By the time i did realise what was happening, we have reached our floor, my floor actually, so i went off. I was late for a meeting hence i could only text him of my anger and disappointment while he walked away.

He said sorry and i was weak and i forgave him. I didnt exactly push him away immediately. If i hadnt wanted it to happen, i would have - i reasoned. I blamed myself.

Some time after that, at a very open and public but rather empty spot, he kissed me again. And for the life of me i do not know why i didnt stop him. Perhaps i was enjoying it myself. That would truly have been nobodys fault. But then he started feeling me up (i was wearing a dress). I really had no idea what he was doing. Because the thought of him fingering me had never crossed my mind AT ALL. In fact, i had no idea people did that (i was still rather young and sheltered). By the time he was fingering me i was confused. I didnt stop him. I didnt really know what was going on, and there was a part of me that felt, well, good. 

 When it was over and i 'came to my senses' i cried. In front of him. Like nobodys business. I thought i had just lost my virginity (does that count as losing ones virginity?). 

He tried to get me to stop crying. Kept telling me its okay. Its okay. We're just kids. We dont know better. Its okay. 

Thinking back about it, i think he was more concerned about me crying in public. There were still some people around. 

Youd think after that episode he wouldnt do it again. And if he did, i would have stopped it.

But he did do it again and i never stopped him. Maybe because in the moment i gave in and simply enjoyed it. But when its over and i tell him to stop and he would say sorry, i always end up blaming myself more than i blame him. Which is probably why i never stopped him while it was happening. I blamed myself. 

I left him a few times. But we have a close group of mutual poly friends we always hang with till now. There were times when we didnt speak to each other for weeks, all of those times because i told him i had enough. But  i always end up falling for his sorries and his promises that he is trying his best to be a better, more religious person. And he is. And so am i. I guess we have too much of a history that i cant seem to let him go. 

But , it seems to me that you dont have any reasons to give him anynmore chances or to not cut ties.  You no longer work there at the mall and im guessing you dont have any mutual friends who are close. Please dont be dumb. Delete that a$*h0*! from your life.

Recently, I met this guy while working part time.    He asked for my number and he kissed me on that day itself. He asked me to be his gf but I did not say a straight yes as I barely knew him yet. We went out a few times for dinner and we would meet sometimes for supper as we stayed close to each other. So just last week he asked me to meet him for dinner on friday as he was working and I agreed. We ate nearby so that he wouldn't have to rush back to his workplace. After eating, he asked if I was in a hurry to go home and I said no so I hanged around his workplace which was in a shopping mall to wait for him to end work. (p.s he is working full time at the mall while I used to work there part time) He brought me to the office to sit and we chatted for a while before he left to do some work. He came back a while later and he tried to force himself onto me. I don't know what came into him. I pushed him away but he was physically much stronger than I am. There was no one in the office and he knew that I didn't like to be touched and that I didn't want to have sex but yet he started kissing me, unbuttoned my shorts and even fingered me. This wasn't the first time it happened. There was another time at his home where he fingered me. Now he says he's very sorry and he wants me to give him another chance but I don't know if I should. I gave him two chances and this is second time he is like this. I want to know if he really likes me why the hell would he break my trust and after the first time he touched me he even promised he wouldn't do it again. Need some advise guys thanks :(

Probability is not just a mathematical calculation. It's a way of reasoning. Sometimes it helped people with delusional thoughts like want to find a partner that earns 9k per month when the woman is in 40s.

To . I think there's a difference between sexual and romantic attraction. You might enjoy heterosexual sex but romantically homosexual. I'm strictly straight but occasionally sleep with girls too. Nothing to worry about.

I'm a 27 year old Lesbian, and I've always thought I'm just a lesbian. I figured it out when I was about 13, and since then I've never really been attracted to boys at all. I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really.
I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive.
I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing. Her personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen.
She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through. I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears.
The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened.
I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. There was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that.
We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better.
I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. He was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said "what are you doing" "are you sure, you want this." I told him "please, this is what I want", and then he went with it too.
I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, and that's where the two of us had sex. I wasn't drunk, I wasn't intoxicated on anything, I was fully aware, but I have no idea what came over me. I don't know why I reached out and had sex with this man, my friend, when my whole life I've only been sexually attracted to women.
When we woke up in the morning in bed together, we were both a mess. I feel so fucked up, I don't even know what came over me. I'm not even sexually attracted to him, I don't even find him that attractive or good looking.
I really hate to say this, I'm not sure how to say it, but... from a physical point of view it was incredible. My body felt incredible during the sex, he must certainly have known his way around a woman, because I've never felt that way with a woman before. I still don't know how my mind let my body orgasm repeatedly with him. I've orgasmed with my past female partner many times, even multiple orgasms, but this one felt... much better somehow, more powerful.
I don't know what to say about myself. I actually initiated and had sex with a man. But I'm a lesbian. I have no sexual attraction to men at all, I feel nothing sexually towards men. I have no desire to have a relationship with a man, and I still don't. I still know I'm exclusively attracted only to women.
Then how did this happen? Why did I do this? Am I really a lesbian or am I bisexual? Is it normal to feel this way?

Anybody know how easy is it for NUS students to get a PhD in the US after graduation, maybe in Ive colleges? Also, how does it feel like to be doing a PhD?

I have been attracted to guys ever since I could remember but then, in the past 4 years, I've been attracted more and more to women instead. I don't really know how to come to terms with that. Like it's scary to know that I might be viewed differently because of my sexuality. Even my mum said, "please don't be a butch." It really sucks.

To op  Thank you for your encouragement! You are very kind and understanding. Im still on this break with my ex. Sometimes i think we might get back but sometimes i think perhaps its not time yet. Even though it gets a little lonely especially at night or when I fall sick, i think its still best that I'm single now. I have more time with my friends (and no longer have to bother about what my ex bf thinks about them) and start to be thankful for my family. In fact, i am currently holding a full time job that is rather challenging and made many new friends from my workplace. You won't be able to guess I wrote my last confession if you see me in real life :p but yeah, you have given really good advice and I will totally try out some of your methods to grow as a person. Thanks again!

Nus chopsticks was supposed to be for singles to mingle and get to know each other. Why is it open to attached people now? We need a separate group for this now. Isn't it easier where singles know the rest are single and so don't make a wrong move or waste time?

A few months ago, my boss told me to worry about my lunch being taken away by foreigners. Then a few weeks back, he asked me what do I think of the future. I said I am anxious about the future. Then he said he is worried that I have such thoughts.

Can I trust such a boss?

I have been going out with these 2 girls and talking to them daily... I finally confessed to one of them.. However, how do I tell the other one without hurting her? =/.. true advice please..

OP of  , I can understand how you feel. From my point of view, what you want is a lover-cum-best friend in one person, somewhat like your soulmate. It isn't wrong to want this, everyone has their own preferences, but does you exbf know that this is what you expect from him? You should have talked to him about it and broken up if only if he disagrees with your idea. Chances are he never felt attracted to his female friend at all and considered you as a best friend too.

Many people have more than one best friend, all of them equally close. You can't choose who is dearer, it's like comparing whether you love your mom or dad more. Sometimes, I feel jealous when I see insta pics of my best friend hanging out with another of best friend of his, but then I control my feelings by telling myself that I also have other best friends from JC. When I hang out with them, I don't include this best friend from uni. 

Insecurity is repulsive. The more insecure you are, the less time he will want to spend with you. Find a hobby that you like, learn a new skill, read a book, watch TV shows to keep your mind occupied. Don't text/call him every hour of the day and seek affirmation that he loves you. I have best friends whom I don't talk to for weeks. When we chat again, we are as close as before. In case you are wondering that he will lose his feelings if you don't talk for a period of time, this is unlikely to happen. If it does, he was not the right person for you anyway.
 
From what you described, you seem to have low self-esteem. Not to worry! You are right that you should love yourself. The fact that you have identified this shows that you are one step ahead already. :) Stop seeking validation for the little things in your life. Give up the wish for wanting others to tell you how nice you are or how much they love you. When you get busy with other things and someone calls you to share their stories with you, it will be a pleasant surprise not a need or want.

Moreover, you must learn to trust. Snooping around your bf's phone is bad. How would you feel if he did it to you? There are different kinds of love and it's not true that you are attracted to everyone you love. If he says his friendships are platonic, take his word for it and trust him. I have a best friend of the opposite gender I am very close to. People think we are in a relationship because we love each other's company so much but both of us know and we have agreed to be friends only. If my friend's gf becomes jealous and insecure of our friendship and tries to pull us away, I would feel very sad.

I lost something very dear to me. And the chances of getting it back looks dissapointing but I'm not losing hope. Sharing this so I can get some positive wishes. Thank you :'(

Here is a suggestion and not a confession. Wouldn't it be nice to have a day when all NUSWhispers commenters shall gather for dinner with the admin. I am sure there will be many interesting common topics.

Maybe the admin can start an events page to gather interest and available dates.

Since we are talking about freshie camps. As a freshie, I never understood what good pageants are for. And even as part of an ocomm, I still didn't understand what significance it holds. 
-
 
I felt that freshie camps empasized too much on girl-guy interaction. Initially i was always puzzled by why we have those "funny funny" games that have girl-guy body contact instead of going to nice places for picnic, or going theme parks to play (those innocent kinds of activities). As i progressed through university, all the more i felt like freshie camps is like a speed dating event. I have this feeling that whenever people join freshie camp, their main motive may not necessarily be simply to get new friends, but to hopefully find their life partners there. 

Why did the camps seems to pressure people into having more girl-guy interaction? I think this kind of thing comes naturally, more like a if its yours, then its yours no matter what. No need to force. I even heard the camp organisers get more funds if they promote these kinds of activities, though i don't know how true this is.

I don't see the point on "pressuring" girl-guy to have closer interaction since i supposed the main purpose of the camps is to get friends from your batch so you have someone to discuss your school work with.

Is it really true that girls and guys alike enjoy closer interaction with each other (holding hands, close body contact etc) no matter how shy they may look on the surface? If so what makes them have this "desire"?

“don’t ever come back again”

You thought I was deliberately hurting you when I said this? You think?

It’s my self defense mechanism you moron. 

So much for being an empath. 

“저.. 많이 많이 보고십은대.”  Remember the short-lived fantasy we had? Remember I wanted to show you I could also be like how I was on the phone with you when I’m physically with you? That Monday should have been the deal sealer and I was fucking pissed it didn’t transpire as planned. Still am.

“보고 싶어.” I’m really wary of getting my hopes up but you raised it sky high and I fell crashing while you looked on not caring. As an empath, have you ever thought about how I felt? Whether there is a possibility that besides you, others can get really hurt too? That you would take your own advice and stand in the shoes of others and “look at things from their point of view” (your own words), and get a sense of how much hurt you dealt me? 

Ask yourself if there is any guy out there who would not be jealous if their love interest laid on the bed with another dude, even if there was no physical contact. Isn’t it 당연하지? 

Have you heard of the logical fallacy of sunk costs? R will never be sustainable and you’ll tire of the lack of chemistry and lack of intellectual resonance all over again. No amount of firefighting and salvaging is going to make you feel like you’re burning red, because behind those pretenses, you already experienced far better. More specifically, has he even made you doubt yourself in eight years as much as I did, commensurately, in a month?

Unfortunately none of this will be to your liking now; you’d only appreciate it after a fucktonne of time and a fucktonne of me pining in suffocating, rasping agony amidst PTSD relapses. You only see things according to your circumstances at present, a commitment you made in “vow and financially”, and fucking lose the bigger picture in an atlas of infinite possibilities and what could be better because you already met me.   

I’ll take my depressive state over my heart being shattered into smithereens. I’ll take having to endure months and years of OCD torture time. For the first time, I actually wish I never swiped right.

I am an evergreen guy and I wonder how do I know if I really truly love someone. I admit I am desperate but I am really looking for potential partner whom I can spend my life with. I have got attracted to some girls before but unsure if I truly love them and thus never get into a relationship with them.
-
 
Shy guys here, shy guys there~ Shy guys everywhere~ You remind me of Super Mario.
-
 
To add on to post , if the purpose of freshie camps is to help shy/awkward people interact more with the opposite gender, i think the purpose is defeated because the really shy/awkward people are likely to avoid the camps. For instance, in my case, i would have at least joined a camp because i only genuine interest to make new friends, but never because i wish to get a life partner from there. If only camps have the innocent kinds of activities like picnic at nice places or going theme parks to play, as written by OP of this post, i would definitely join camps. The fact that there seems to be "aggressive" pushing for more girl guy interaction totally turns me off from camps. 

Just wondering am i the only one who wish that those "dirty" games be totally abolised from freshie camps or am i just the minority?

P.s i am an evergreen girl who never desired any interaction with the opposite gender so i don't know if i am the only girl who felt this way, therefore i got turned off by the thoughts of "dirty" games in camps.

To the OP Girl , I can understand you. It could mean that your brother is not happy with his life. Since you mentioned you do not have a father, I assume your mother is taking care of the house and I am also assuming you are not very strong financially and are going through some tough times.

1. For these reasons, may be your brother is not happy about the life is getting. It may not look very attractive as he may have wished and seeing his friends having all the happiness and luxury is making him more sad, angry and frustrated. ( Other parents are giving money/good life and since he is not getting that, he does not believe in mother/sister relationship).
His idea of a mother-sister relationship is, giving a good life, good food and luxuries. If he is unable to get it, he believes these relationships are false and hence those words( even though i don't knw the meaning of them)

2. Another thing is , may be your brother knows that someday he may have to take care of the family and help your mother/sister in daily work like the OP guy 5308. You must understand that not every boy is like OP 5308.
He may be the kind off guy who expected his family to give me a nice decent life without him sweating it out. He may also be afraid he may have to work like this and study at the same time to support which he is not willing to.

3. He is also very immature , childish and if you treat him as one, he will remain the same. And he is  not in a position to understand the difficulties of life and it will take more time than the normal guy for him to become mature and understand the tough situation of your family.

My Suggestion is the following.

1. Try to understand him and tell him to treat others with 'respect' no matter what and especially the family.
2. Make him understand that you all love him and trying best to give him a decent life and make him happy and there are certain things 'beyond your control'.
3. Most important, he may be having a feeling that you guys( you and mother) do not love him as much as they should have. SO make sure you 'shower your love' to him in a way you don't loose your own importance. 
4.  INVOLVE. This is the most important thing. Involve him in family discussions. Ask him some open ended questions. If you ask him, how was your day, how was school, he may not answer it properly.

Ask him for his opinion. Ask him for his advice. ( Not when he is angry or upset and if he is like that all the time, then find a time when he his normal)  and ask casually , about his advice. It should not appear you are asking explicitly and it should appear natural. 
Start with asking some issues and opinions and ask what do you think? or Can you help me with this as I am confused?

I hope this advice helps you.

I need an outlet to write this. J, I'm sorry I've not answered your messages. I can't just be your 'bestfriend' anymore. You know well how I feel about you. I know you're hurting from the relationship and need someone to talk to. But I can't be that person anymore. I can't be there to pick you up again for the fifth time only to see you go back into his arms. 

You're not the only one hurt here. I am too.

I deserve to find my happiness.
-
 
Nothing like starting your day by finding out your crush just got attached. Guess I only have myself to blame for not making a move sooner. Oh well.

I still need to hang in there for all of today before I can get a few drinks though. This is gonna be tough.

I dun know when it started. I had a pretty normal childhood when I was younger. My family ( mum, dad and older sis)  would go out together for dinner and holidays. But thing started to change and I can't exactly remember when. I guess most of my childhood are erased from my memory. 

The last family holiday we had was when I was 10. I'm in my early 20s now. The fights got more frequent and scary. To escape from the terror and noise, I would hide in the room. Every time I heard a long thud, I could only imagine if it was a object thrown across the floor during the fight or if someone had been battered. It scare me to find out but it scare me even more to imagine the worst. 

The fight continue through most of my primary school life till secondary school. Maybe because of my home environment and other couple of things the absence of my father. ( I was closer to my dad) I started to cry for no reason in upper primary. I would cry whenever I did not know how to solve a math problem or just suddenly. At first my classmates were shocked that I was crying. But I because it happen every day they got used to it. I lost friend because they were afraid of me crying 

My grades dropped i was refer to counsellors because I was showing disturbing behavior. 

 I manage to get into a secondary near my house but since my dad was absent a lot from home and I was really close to him there was a hole in my heart and because of that I started getting close to older guys. Looking for the 'brotherly' / 'fatherly' figure that I'm yearning for. 

I'm not sure if it is a psychological thing or not but it is an innate nature for the opposite sex to be attracted to each other so girls will get attract to their dad and boys to their mum.

I engage in a lot of reckless behavior, Created havoc in a government area. My parents were called up. My dad told me to stop behaving the way I was but I didn't know what he meant. I didn't know what I did wrong or not. I didn't know why I did what I did. It may seem absurd to some but I had not idea what was wrong from right. I just did what I felt like doing. 
 and self harm just to make myself feel better because their were times when I felt that I wasn't worth it. I almost got retain in secondary 3 and barely make it to N and O levels. 

I met a very good teacher in upper sec and I started looking for him for help. I join all his lessons which piss of his students. I got insulted for joining his class since I was not his student. that teacher was the 'fatherly' figure that I had been looking for. Not only did he teach well, but he encourage me a lot through my sec school life which makes me look for him. I did quite well in the subject he taught me but I did badly in my other subjects. Home was not a condusive place to study in and I would stay in school for as long as I could just so I did t need to go home. 

I grew more mature and with Christian friends and the right support I manage to make it to poly 

My parents got divorce few years back. and even though it is a good thing somehow I can't help but to admire others with a complete family or how some other family would bring their children out for meals. eventhough I'm living with my dad. It feels like im all alone. Throughout my life since secondary school I had been facing very bad panic attacks when facing crowd and started becoming self conscious and due to some past experience I have an aversion to male friends. I still look up to them but I'm afraid that I would give them the wrong impression.

Having felt the effects of divorce first hand, Im not sure if I'm truly able to have a relationship that will last. Why do people get married only to end up getting a divorce. Recently a few of my couples at my church got married and being  at the age when a couple of your friends are getting married/ having a relationship make you want to be in a relationship too.

 But I'm not just looking for a boyfriend nor a husband but a father to my kid. Someone who is willing to be involve in my kids life. 

Love is not just about yourselves but it is putting others before yourself. 

With all the things that I had face. I want to work with kids. Just like how my teachers and counsellors helped me. But im afraid that I will be reminded of my previous rebellious self and that scares me a lot. 

Cause even though things are slightly better im still struggling a lot with anxiety and school work. I'm close to getting kick out of school since I always have to go for appointments and  I have been doing very badly in school but because of the previous experience in sec 3 I'm afraid of looking for lecturers and feel that im wasting their time somehow. I have been mistaken for being aloof because I dun smile and I have that resting bitch face and there are times when I find it hard to do so. 

To any FASS students out there. Is there any requirements to working with kids other than having a degree in a related field?

Riddleman is back:

One night, I was visiting a friend of mine. I hadn't seen him in a long time. We had the following conversation:

Friend: I like having you here.

Me: Yeah, it's been good to see you again.

Friend: Will you stay the night? You can sleep in the spare bedroom.

Me: OK. Why not? It'll be easier than walking home.

Friend: Kill some time here then. I like having company. It's so lonely here on my own.

Me: Yeah. Living alone can be tough.

Friend: You look exhausted. You should probably go straight to bed and get some rest.

Me: I guess I am feeling tired.

Friend: In the morning, I'll have a lot of things to take care of. Sweet dreams.

Me: OK. See you in the morning.

Friend: Your bed is already made. It's the first bedroom on the right. Just go to sleep.

Me: Goodnight.

Friend: Sleep tight.

Is anything wrong?

 Actually, why would, and why should we be romantic partners? 

There's this common misunderstanding that guys hang around ladies with a motive, especially if that guy is especially friendly to that particular lady. At least, that comes from a course I am in, and a whole lot of my friends. Many of my friends do not approve of my friendship with another lady either, simply because she's attached.

The thing is, a friendship is something that transcends gender and romantic interest. Yet, it is something that's so simple, it's often negatively over-complicated.

I don't look at my friend as a lady of interest. I just see her as... Ok lor, she woman. She my friend, simple as that. 

What's so special about her is that she's a friend - not the type that comes by with the purpose of networking, work, utility, status or anything. This is what I am looking for in a friend. Coming from a person who's quite bat-shit crazy and wtf, you can tell why she's an important friend to me. 

I understand both of us enough that I am not the one for her, and she's not the one for me either.

There are also principles a person should stick to as a friend, and as a man, one of which being considering for her happiness, and I intend to uphold and respect that, which is why I wouldn't see her as a romantic interest.

 dont worry. Im a 23 year old girl who thinks the same way. I feel super weird seeing ugly people in relationships and actually having families. 

I mean, growing up i was told that you have to be pretty or be unloved. Thats why i cared so much about my looks. How come this doesnt seem to apply to others?

This is a story about my ex bf and I. 

We were both from NUS but I entered 2 years before him. We met outside of school and got together a few months before he became a freshie. 

At that time, I was doing very poorly and failed a few modules. I was v lost, depressed and suffered from low self-esteem - i was a far cry from the happy me when I was in JC. I became extremely insecure when he started joining freshie camps and started to have female friends. It was a nightmare because the relationship was not as how I had imagined it to be. I tried dissuading him from participating in sch activities and even started to check his phone whenever he wasn't around. Almost everyday I would be worried that he would leave me for someone else. Even though he always claimed that his friendships with his girl pals were platonic, my intuition told me that there was a fleeting period he was infatuted with one of his girl friends. It was very painful for me. Despite being very broken and unhappy, I continued defending him in my mind whenever these negative thoughts came to my mind. I continued in the r/s because I thought I would be worst off without him. Actually I know that he loved me from how he encouraged me and stuck with me during my lowest point in life but somehow, I think that he didn't love me as much I wanted him to love me. Simply because, I couldn't love myself. So I  can't blame him right? Plus love is selfish. Even though I was less problematic into the 3rd yr of our r/s, I still harboured bitterness towards him. 

Recently, he graduated and I was super happy for him. However, the same night I decided to break up with him because he captioned his photo with his girl- friend as "bestie". It sounds very silly but I decided I needed a break and get my shit together. A part of me also thinks that I deserve better. Someone who will not only be my lover but also my best friend?? How would you feel if you always had to guess whether your bf shared his probs with his female best friend instead of you?? 

But I'll also like to thank you, exbf, for always encouraging me to be better. I know you won't deny I was a good and faithful gf to you, but I am so tired of being in your shadow. I think its very obvious this is written by me. Btw, you will never be able to understand how broken i was the past few yrs. I am still working on myself and trying to forgive and forget and also learning to believe that i have my own strengths without relying on affirmation from you. 

To all the single or attached people out there, its true that you have to love yourself first before plunging into any r/s. I learnt it the hard way :(

It was one of those late nights - the kind when waves of sadness just engulf me like a relentless tsunami. The park was dead silent. I picked up a knife and brought it against the translucency of my wrists. Cool metal met my wrist and I dug deep, tracing the length of the vein. Not thin horizontal lines that brush the surface, but a split that caused blood to gush out. I felt my consciousness slowly slipping away and I was certain that the pain would end soon. 

I roused to find myself surrounded by sanitised white walls with a nagging ache in my bandaged forearm. We both knew what happened, but the doctor still asked out of formality. 

"A freak accident," I said, "I fell and tried to regain balance on an exercise bar, but struck upon something sharp on my inner arm instead." 
"Well. You're lucky to be stitched up in time." 

We both knew that was never the outcome I intended for. 

Fast forward to the present - it's been three years. I still don't know what I'm suffering from; I'm afraid to seek help because I don't want the pity of others. I go about my normal daily activities - school, lectures, tutorials, hall activities, sports - behaving like any other person, but I shut my door only to cry myself to sleep every night. The smallest thing is enough to trigger a breakdown, but I force myself to hold it together until I'm alone. 

A counsellor that I once spoke to told me to surround myself with family and friends that could make me happy. I tried, but it always seemed that if I derive my happiness from interactions with a certain person, it would prove that I am incapable of achieving happiness by myself and that it's solely dependent on another being. In terms of relationships, it's hard to love someone who is so unstable, which is why I never blamed any of them when they chose to leave. However, it seems like there is this one guy who has yet to give up. His sincerity is terribly endearing, and the effort he has placed into developing a better relationship between us goes beyond measure. 

He once said this. 
"You're like a cloud of sadness, but because you're always engulfed in all of those negative emotions, it is so easy to make you happy."
I turned to look at him, confused by what he said.
"Yes, I mean it. The smallest thing is enough to turn your entire day around. Other girls ask for the world, you ask for a pebble." 

This phrase has echoed in my mind ever since. I never thought of it that way, but it made me feel a little better about myself. Perhaps all this sadness made it possible for me to derive happiness from small and simple things. But to you, I'm sorry. You deserve much better than a girl who has a mental disorder that seems almost beyond repair. You're going to keep trying, and I'm only going to keep shutting you out, which only makes this unfair to you. I hope you find your happiness in the everlasting smile of another beautiful girl, and I will continue on my way until the darkness finally overwhelms - when these thoughts are put to rest, lost forever - just like how I have lost myself to them.

Hello! I just wanted to share something funny that happened today. I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now and last night, I brought him back home to meet my parents for the first time. Things went well. My parents like him. We talked over dinner for an hour before my family and I resumed our normal habits. What normal habits, you might ask? Well, I come from a family who reads a lot. Every wall in our 3-room flat is shelved with books. Some books you might find under our beds, others under sofas. It's a habit we've had since I was young. Our family bonded over books. It's almost like nerdvana for a family of introverted academicians. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has never read a book outside of his reading list.

Boyfriend: "Eh, your family like you ah. All book nerds one! Abnormal leh?!"
Me: "Erm... in this household, you are the abnormal one."
BF: "Fuck sia, that's true. I go read the children's storybook. My level one. Hahaha"

#winliaoloh I'm making sure our future kids read more than their father.

My grandfather was diagnosed with cancer early this year and I spent a lot of time helping to take care of him. He passed on during the last weeks of school. My boyfriend never understood. Till today he refers to my grandfather as a burden and uses that against me saying that I neglected the relationship because I was taking care of him. I've tried explaining so many times in so many different ways and I'm just tired. What should I do?

With regards to confession , i would like to say that i totally understand you. one of my parents is a compulsive gambler and family life has been nothing short of hell since young. i always wonder why i am so unlucky, compared to my peers, to be born into such a problematic family and have such a disappointing parent who lost our house and all our money and caused us to be in such an unfortunate state, one that i am too ashamed to tell anyone outside of the family, even my closest friends.  because of my family background, i am afraid to date and have a proper boyfriend because i don't know if he will look down at me and/or find me unappealing. i feel that my parent has scarred me for life and i don't know if i can ever face society. i also don't know if i will ever find a guy who is willing to look past my family background and accept me for who i am. 

Guys, will you all consider a girl who has a gambler for a parent? :(

To   

Just because you have a friend of the opposite sex doesn't mean you necessary get attracted to each other. There might be a honeymoon period where you start to feel 'attracted' to the opposite person but eventually there comes to a point where the feeling is gone and you rather just be friends because he/she is not somebody within your expectations.
Eventually, if you become too close to the opposite sex, sometimes it becomes annoying when he/she becomes pesky and ask you where you go out and who you socialize with... you know what I mean :) 
It's better to just be friends with some people you know.

Is it normal that on the 4th day of work, your co-workers, most of them still don't know your name?

1st day of work I was the only part timer hence I had to do a lot of things on my own. The full timers were very busy, so I just do what I was told. I survived.
2nd day of work I thought I would grow to like the job because I found 2 girls (out of the 4) who were very nice to me and they would talk/fool around with me. It was a Friday, and we were super busy. Yet I quite like it. But sadly, the 2 friends I acquainted with, that day was their last day of work.
3rd day of work I thought I could try and talk to this girl who asked me to replace her once. But it ended up in a way that she talked to this guy first because she found him familiar and they both started talking and somehow I couldn't include myself into their convo. They were nice tho. Just...
4th day, same thing. There were only two part timers, me and this girl, so I thought maybe I could stick to her and talk to her etc. But the moment she entered the kitchen, she already started chatting with the full timers etc. I tried to be around them, hoping that they would ask me questions like "Oh where are you studying? How old are you" etc. Just any question, and then include me in their convo. But no. They just kept talking about this drama that they got hooked on and yeah.. It was kind of a day where time passed so slowly I wish I could die.

Initially I wanted this current job to be a long term thing. Cos it's actually quite flexible: 2-3 days a week, 330-930pm. As long as when school starts and it doesn't clash with my timetable, I can work part time while studying. But the circumstances now....unless they improve...Idk how to find strength to face each working day.

Dear op of 

Thanks for sharing your story! I had an almost identical story as yours with my ex-bf, but its a gender-reversed kind of thing.

He did poorly during his JC and retook it and managed to get into his dream major in uni. However we started uni the same time and he was really insecure with me joining freshie camps and at midnight during camps he will flood my whatsapp about his worries and cry himself to sleep. I didn't understand because I don't do that to him when he went for his camp. And to make things worse I am in a major with high male to female ratio and I do make a lot of platonic guy friendships which he feels really insecure about. Most of the super bestie guy friends I had are attached but I guess I could finally understand from your point of view that he might had think otherwise. He had multiple depression and I would always encourage him. He often tells me that he felt love from me but still one of the most hurting thing to him I realized is probably about the sharing part.

Your ex-bf definitely deserve someone better. But you also need to let it go. Hmm.. about sharing things with other guy friends part. Maybe I could share my side of story to enlighten you maybe?

My ex-bf was a busy guy that had to balance work with studies. He teach home tution 6 days a week to buy his own food, pay for his home utility bills and to buy things he needed or wanted. He came from a broken family and even though his dad paid for his tution fees, his dad does not give him a cent of pocket money since he reach the age limit to work and his first phone was earned from his own salary. Though he often pour his heart out to me, I didnt want to share my woes because I didnt want to burden his already stressed life. I just needed someone to rant and a bf is not the best choice since it will cause him unnecessary worries over his gf, unless its about really really serious matters about us. And I look at my beloved then-bf photo everyday before sleep and when I'm free or feel like life is tough, and first thing I wake up I will think about him and I secretly wish he would think about me too. Some small little things may not be obvious and clear to you, which he would never know I actually love him so deeply, but its the small things that count. A person in a secure relationship has no space for another guy/girl. Hope you find your happiness.

Years ago my brother called my mother 神经病 in the midst of an argument. Today, he used knn and said that using "I'm your mother" is a stupid relationship. He ever scolded me a bitch and many hurtful words which I'm choosing to forget. Why does a son, a brother say that to his mother and his sister. Yes, we don't have a father but i do not think that it is normal for him to be like that to his family. I do not know how to react to him. How do I get to let him know that he is wrong??? Up till now, he is still insistent that he is not wrong at all. Help.

I'm 20 yrs old but I'm very attached to my parents. As in, they are my most meaningful social interactions. I would blow off my friends to stay at home with ma and dad. I'm always glad to see them, joke around with them and though I may sometimes question them, I never go against them. 
Though I am proud of the relationship I have with them (it takes time and effort like any other relationship in life), it makes me wonder, will I ever leave home and strike out on my own. 
I'm pretty shy and don't have too many friends, let alone a partner. Getting my own life together and settling down seems very far fetched at the moment. 
I am still, for all intents and purposes, a child. 
Is this a normal phenomenon in Asia, or is this altogether not normal? 
Thanks for reading:)

Hope you guys can give me some advice. I've gone out on 2 dates with this girl whom i like. The dates went well, the conversation flows and i think we do get along well. However, my bugbear is that we hardly communicate through whatsapp in between dates. Ive brought this up in conversations with her and she has said she prefers real life interactions. Moreover, she does this thing where she cuts herself off social media and messaging anyone for a few days per week at a stretch. There are also times where i receive the blue tick treatment (she says she does this to people often).

 I dont mean to sound clingy, but how does one chase the un-chasable? After all, it takes 2 hands to clap. Having to initiate conversations most of the time seems over eager, not to mention unnatural. As it is, it is weird not being able to communicate frequently. 

Other than this, she also kind of "forgot" our second date. We had arranged to meet on a certain day for a movie. On the day itself, i bought movie tickets, but she did not reply till close to the timing. Naturally, we had to reschedule our date. 

I have kind of confessed that i do like her and i try to treat her like my lady love- i buy stuff that she wants (nothing expensive) almost immediately the next day, just because i want to, i drive her home etc. She has however hinted that she takes a long time to start liking someone, but at the same time, she acknowledges our "outings" to be dates and that there may well be something there, if not we won't even be talking. 

I really don't know what i should do because the pining and longing does hurt at times (yes, you could call it an infatuation). The disparity in connection and communication we have face to face as compared to in between dates is really strange. She does not seem the type to play mind games, and i dont think that is her intent. I don't want to play any games and intentionally reply late etc. 

i really don't know if she is hinting for me to move on or if i should try longer. Is this a test? I asked her what i should do and she compared herself to an elusive creature (which i shall not name, but feel free to guess), who only surfaces now and then, so i should wait. 

Then again, she has agreed to go out on a third date, so i am soooo confused! I know i have no right to feel upset over the rather "cold" treatment, since we hardly know each other anyway, but i can't help feeling the way i do. 

Sorry for the long post, just thought i'd be detailed and also i needed to get this off my chest

 I just miss her.

 I can empathise with you, however my story is a bit different. I made it into OCS, but OOC-ed after the service term (only lasted 3 months in OCS basically). Most people OOC because of injury. "What a waste of your talent! A bright future cut short by an unfortunate injury", you'd say to these people. Me, however, I had no talent, as was quickly apparent. I OOC-ed because I failed the assessments. And I guess this has been haunting me for some time. Imagine all the people who were proud of you for being selected for OCS - your parents and family, your (then-) girlfriend, your friends... Imagine all the people who had faith that you'd make a good officer - your BMT PC and sergeants, your bunk mates and platoon mates... Now I was nothing but a massive disappointment. The service term training qualified me to eventually be promoted to 3SG, yet, it felt empty because I never earned it the same way my spec peers did by going through SCS. Therefore in the hierarchy of officer-spec-man, I couldn't really fit in anywhere. 
At least as a Man, there are shared 'chiongsua' 'man-mode' experiences. There are less responsibilities and worries. You don't have to constantly prove yourself. I suppose I wouldn't mind having your army experience over mine.
Well there's no happy ending here. Don't have many friends now, been single all throughout uni, never took up any leadership positions, don't even have good grades. Whereas many of my peers who were "only" men are doing very well for themselves now. So army is army, you are only ever a Man again during reservist. But outside of that you can be so much more! :)

I am a hardcore anime otaku. My obsession with Japanese anime started when I was in secondary school during a post exam activity when our form teacher showed us some episodes of "FullMetal Alchemist" in class. I became in love with it and began watching other anime and started collecting numerous manga series, and learning Japanese so I can watch, read and listen without any subtitles or translation XD

Therefore I am always looking out for guys with "anime-like-Prince Charming" qualities; kind, handsome, tall, brave, loyal, polite and a little ditzy. I cannot settle for anything less than that unfortunately. My group of ladies, most of them are attached, often joke at me, "你那么美, 为什么没有男朋友?" So I told them I haven't found the right one yet, although I know the type I like are from fiction, and may not exist.

Has anyone got crushes on fictional characters before? And does it affect how you choose your boyfriend/girlfriend? Or am I simply being too unrealistic? (:

My gor gor (elder brother) asked my mom whether I only had 2 shirts in my wardrobe because I always seem to only wear that 2 shirts. The thing is, I really like that 2 shirts and since I am in an engineering internship, no one really cares. And I actually have 5 favourite shirts and I repeat them weekly :D

PS: omg gor, if you like this then I will know you probably read what I wrote in other people's comments...

Mum, I know this letter will not reach you though I wish it would. I hope I did you proud when I walked up that stage to receive my degree. You're all that I thought about the whole time. It's been only a year since you died, but the pain still feels raw. When I think of all the firsts of everything that the future has for me, I hurt, terribly. At times, I cannot breathe and it feels impossible to live in a world where you don't. But I know you would have wanted me to live a life of honest pursuit and so I shall honour you and the extraordinary life you've had in everything that I do.

But my goodness will the grief ever go away?

I've been with my boyfriend for quite a while now, but lately it seems like we have fully gotten out of the honeymoon phase, and it feels like reality is kicking in. Things like monetary issues is a tough nut to crack... Sometimes it feels like he's holding on too tight to his money and he isn't willing to spend on me. I do pay for things, but it seems like he does not feel like I'm doing enough. Then again, he's the one with a job, so.

Guys, shed a light.

Ever since I got attached my best guy friend completely avoids and ignores me. My other guy friends isn't at all like him.  He would still reply his best guy friend(our common friend) while completely ignores mine when we asked the same question. His best guy friend don't know why he acts like that too. Its been a few months and he was never like that before. Why does a guy has to act like that? Childish?

We had been good buddies for the past 3 years and he never confessed or asked me out alone. It was always a group thing. And I helped him with homework and he teaches me sports. Should I just let the friendship thing behind?

What i'm about to share is my darkest secrets that i hope i'll bring it to my death.

A brief background of myself. My dad passed away when i was 5 years old. My mum single-handedly raises me and my two sisters. She could only take up low pay and long hours job as she's uneducated. Since 12 years old, i started taking up all sort of part time jobs. Supporting my family and focusing on my studies have always been my priorities. 

Fast forward to last semester (my final year). I'm expected to graduate with a second class (upper) honour. Being sick and tired of working part time for all these years. I've come up with, what i initially thought was, a brilliant plan to earn more money. I decided to gamble at casino with my little savings. To my surprise, i'm rather good at it especially playing tai sai. Believe or not i managed to earn about $60k in just 13 visits. My biggest winning of the day was $15k. Nevertheless there are times when i lost money but i'd leave when i lose $2k. At the very last visit i cash in $10k hoping to win at least two fold. But i lost it all. So i applied for casino self-exclusion to prevent myself from becoming addicted. My mum is still unaware that i had stopped working part time because she's always busy working.

Since i came from a low income family, dating has never crossed my mind i.e i have never been in a relationship for the past 25 years. I really wanted to feel how a girlfriend experience is like. But I'm totally clueless how to approach a girl. I hated the fact that i'm forever single. To make it worse, i don't have any best friends or cliques for that matter. I feel like I'm such a loser in life. Why do i have to sacrifice so much for my family?!? What do i get in return??? 

As a desperate attempt, i decided to hire a social escort. I got myself a mid-tier girl which costs $1.8k for a full day session excluding other expenses like eating and shopping. I was extremely nervous on my first 'date'. I won't elaborate on the details. But i felt that it's the best day of my life. I had so much fun when accompanied by her. I actually arranged for another meet up a week later. This time round she asked if i want to spend the night with her. I agreed without a slight hesitation even though i need to pay additional $1k. After that night, our relationship has just moved up to another level. We exchanged our numbers and she's agreed to go on date without going through her agency. She told me i don't have to pay her so much in our future dates. We have been meeting up for about 5 months. I think i've deeply fallen in love with her. I also felt that she's genuine feelings for me. She's hinted me on several occasions that she'll quit her job just for my sake. I got so emotionally attached to the extent that i've lost interest in my studies. In the end, i dropped to second class (lower) honour upon graduation and i've yet to find a full-time job as of I'm writing this confession.

My current dilemmas are:
1) should i let my mum knows that i've been supporting the family from the money that i won from casino or continue to lie to her that it's from my part-time job??

2) should i continue to maintain my relationship with her or try to end this relationship just in case that she actually just want my money??(which i don't have much to begin with)

Any kind souls out there please share with me your opinions. I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks for taking your time off to read my confession.

Please help.

There is a common stereotype on girls that we will ask deadly questions like "Do I look fat in this dress" or "Dear, do you think I've gained weight?" Usually if a guy answer anything the girl will get upset. Its opposite for my case.

I'm a girl and my boyfriend frequently ask me questions like "I think I have grown fat, dont you think?" or "Did you notice anything change on me?" or "Do I look good today?" or "I ate a lot recently, would you mind a fattie as your lover?" and it always pressure me to answer because one step wrong and he will threaten to break up with me. (I'm the girl with pants in this relationship, I know.) How should I go about answer swiftly to a guy lover without activating his sensitive reactions? I really want to make things work.
-
 
So I met this girl from NUS Fass and after talking for a week on whatsapp we met for a date that went very well. And we had plans to meet again soon for movies, etc. But then the next day she says she is busy and blocks me with no reason at all. Any girls would like to shed some light on why she's so heartless and inconsiderate?  With zero explanation . And the date did go well. For both of us. Why are some people so unaccountable?
-
 
I wonder how opposite gender platonic friendships work. If your best friend is of the opposite gender why don't you both become romantic partners?
-
 
 I had the exact same situation and feelings as , except that instead of continuing on with SCS, I was immediately sent to be a 'Man' as a medic. I felt inferior and that I was a failure, letting my loved ones down since I was probably so bad at leadership that I couldn't even make the cut to be trained as a sergeant (I failed ALL leadership assessments lolol). 

I guess you can say I was "onz" as I am naturally inclined to listen and follow "orders" from superiors. Yet beyond the ranks and formalities (unavoidable since well, army), as long as you were sincere, friendly and willing to open up, there's a certain level of friendliness that people would show towards you as a person. Especially if you didn't hold a high rank. Being a 'man', I personally felt it was easier for me to connect with others.

Even towards sergeants and officers, I was on friendly bro terms with many of them; talking about random stuff here and there before we got down to doing serious work stuff. At times I even used the term "Sir" to poke fun of them, considering how it felt like we were on the same level even with that wide gap in rank.

That aside, army stuff is only relevant when you're in the army. I wasn't a commander back then and I no longer regret it. I thoroughly enjoyed my remaining year in my unit even as a 'Man', interacting with whoever I could and talking cock to kill time. Talking to commanders made me realise we aren't all that different. You see some of them as introverts, shy, wayang, arrogant etc; nobody is perfect. 

I myself feel I'm a leader in my own way within my social circles. I made used of whatever social skills I picked up in army (I was extremely awkward/quiet so I decided to force myself to open up) to make friends in uni. If you want avenues to practise leadership skills, you can join hall/CCAs and run as an exco member. Sure it'll take a while, everybody makes mistakes. But seriously, don't let your army experience hold you back. There's a reason everybody can't wait for the day to shout "ORD LOH" and move on to the next chapter of life.

tl;dr You don't need arrows or a chocolate bar to prove your own worth. Just be a leader in your own way, learn from your mistakes and move on with life. It's more fun that way :).

Day 1: I looked at her smile and immediately was attracted to you. I made small talked with you and got your number. Knowing that I would see you again in future was a happy feeling. You was older by about 5 years, but that wouldn't matter to me.

Month 3: I was happy to spend more time together with you, just as friends. We went together on HSBC treetop walk just me and you. 

Close to 1 year: You made a cake for my birthday! I remember this till today, every time there would be a birthday event and there would be a cake, it would remind me of you.

December that year: You broke your ankle and I had a part to blame for it. That was when I realized you were already married. That moment my heart sank. That I was foolish to believe a girl of your nature and quality would not already have been taken. I start to question myself would I be able to accept another half who have been previously married. I still took you out for walks and spend time during this recover process, perhaps due to mix of infatuation and guilt. I was glad your recovery was a smooth one.

That one fine day we took a overseas trip together we were in group conversation and you asked if I will be able to accept a divorcee, I said something that I could never have taken back. Our relationship went downhill from that day onwards. I had nailed my own coffin right then.

3 years have passed... I am still thinking back about you. Maybe I will eventually move on or maybe I won't.

Hard truth confessions. 

I am a guy and I more than often(more like always)  show interest in only pretty girls for potential partners/gf. 

First impression matters. Then the visual pairing of both of you in the picture comes next. 

Please don't say guys are superficial. We are not asking for Victoria Secret model. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder(ironic when I say this huh). You just have to be pleasant looking and easy on the eye. Healthy looking and approachable. 

Ultimately it's really being easy on the eye. Different guys like different cai. But generally we all have similar taste. 

Oh yes. Fit girls are absolutely the thing now. 
Start running and get to the gym. 

PS. Of course you don't have to wait for someone so superficial and cares only about your personality because looks go away eh. You just have to keep waiting then.... How long? Idk. 

Cheers.

I notice many people posting about how that they are introverts and hence not interesting in camps, find it hard making new friends, or feeling depressed and lonely. Don't use the term introvert as an excuse for your social ineptitude and laziness of stepping out of your comfort zone. If you are depressed or have difficulties talking to people, you should see a psychologist. Being introverted does not entail being mentally ill. Introverts are termed as such as they restore  energy being alone but as normal humans they enjoy social interactions as long as they are able to recharge by having some alone time after that. Please stop using the term introverted as an excuse for everything and give introverts a bad name.

Just for discussion purpose: will guys be afraid to date girls who are ambitious and have bigger dreams than they do?

As an autistic person who’s found his success in academia, human relationships along with all the aspects of intimacy puzzles me.  I recognise facial expressions, I know what happiness, sadness, anger and all the basic emotions look like on people’s faces, but I cannot understand them. It’s confusing for me. 

I know love. My parents and my closest friends love me. I can feel it. But I don’t know how to reciprocate those feelings. Some day, I hope I will. I just hope they will be patient enough to wait for me.

To 

We all know looks will fade with age, but looks will also be passed down to future generations. Perhaps its natural instincts, but I wouldn't want my children to look ugly.

As for personality, you seem contented with not staying healthy. You sound like a selfish person, not worried about how your lifestyle choices may affect the lives of your loved ones in the future. Think about all the worry and hospital bills you will give them when you grow older.

If you know you don't have the looks, at the very least make an effort to stay healthy. Then you can start talking about personality.

With reference to  that I wrote a few days ago...
In a final bid to create an opportunity to interact, I messaged him about some work-related stuff that was related to our  discussion during the camp. I decided to use a work-related topic so I wouldn't seem too creepy or something. He replied, after a few days, with another close-ended answer that's quite impersonal and cold. 
Maybe I should have just been more direct and asked him how he was doing. But I'm also wondering that if he were really interested in me, he would have responded in a friendlier manner. He seems to be pretty active on Facebook based on what I see on my news feed, but always takes a few days to reply to my messages.  
So... I guess I have to give up and move on. Kind of sad because I really thought we had a chance at being at least friends, if not something more, and that would probably be a lot of fun..or maybe not, but it doesn't matter now.
I'm just going to get comfortable with my evergreen life again, after this short-lived episode of wanting to be attached. Which is okay I guess, because I think we can lead meaningful lives and make a difference to the people around us regardless of whether we are single or married. And to me it's important to be happy with and to make the most out of your current situation, until some change or someone comes along. Thanks for reading and I hope we all can find a way to make our lives meaningful whether we are attached or not. Cheers!

To ,

I'm sorry I'm not a pretty face. I'm sorry I'm not fit. I'm sorry I'm not easy to the eye. I'm sorry I'm bigger than you. I'm sorry I'm overweight. 

Just remember that one day, those physical things will just sag away. I shall take my chances and wait for somebody who will like my personality. I will wait for somebody who will love me just the way I am.
-
 
What would you think of a potential partner if he/she isn't evergreen anymore? Just curious. Is somebody's past a big deal, and would it factor into future relationships?
-
 
been a silent reader since the lgbt to foc camps posts.
saw  post. Hi, I assume you are a lady.

"Just remember that one day, those physical things will just sag away. I shall take my chances and wait for somebody who will like my personality. I will wait for somebody who will love me just the way I am."

Take it from someone who have learned the hard way.

"love me just the way i am", dont be naive. 
This aint a fairytale girl, aint no cinderella happy ending. You make the changes or you die trying.

To , I may not agree with you on picking your partners based on looks. However I do concur that first impressions and "easy on the eye" holds a certain amount of truth to it.

Thanks for reading folks.
Imma go back to my popcorn seat.

After seeing more and more posts on introverts and bring socially awkward I decided to post this. 

Yes I am an introvert, but definitely not socially awkward. There's a huge difference between the 2. If you're not able to step out to the public and make new friends please don't justify yourself by claiming you're an introvert. Not being open and keeping thoughts to yourself has absolutely nothing with your ability to blend in and make new friends with crowds. 

Peace out

Mom, I am not gay because I spend more time with guys than with girls. I am not gay because I enjoy watching Vin Diesal movies. I am not gay because I know every line of Flashdance. I am not gay because I own a fur coat. I am not gay because I write poetry. I am not gay because I can sing better than you ever could. I am not gay because your husband left you. I am not gay because I enjoy Gossip Girl. I am not gay because I don't adhere to your strict sense of moral righteousness. I'm gay because I love cocks.

I am in a relationship now, and both of us are advocates of full honesty towards each other. 
Issue is, he's telling me things about how I can't expect guys to be tied down to one woman because they may get bored of things in the bedroom and it is acceptable for them to satisfy their needs outside, as long as they come back to their partners at the end of the day. And doing this will make guys realize that the one they really love is back at home, and that what they are doing outside is purely physical. 
Honestly, I can't accept this way of thinking. To me this is infidelity no matter how he tries to justify. 
What you guys here think? Am I naive to think that there is a guy out there who will be fully committed to me without having such unacceptable (IMO) thoughts?
-
 
Has anyone ever agree to exchange number with random stranger that strike up a friendly conversation with you? (Because that person claim to not have facebook, kakaotalk, line etc.) And if the stranger ask to meet up after a few friendly conversations over text messages with him, should you agree to meet up with him?  Thank you for the advice and reply in advance! 
-
 
Why does everyone keep saying that if someone is already attached , he/she has no right to keep their options open anymore, or if someone is interested but that person is already attached they shud give up? Shouldn't love be fair and square and something we can fight for as long as it's not legally signed on papers that they're married yet. Is it wrong to fight for someone who's alrdy attached if u really love them? Who can say that it is right or wrong? And some may say" if he/she can leave their partners for you, they will do the same to you in future". Just what makes u so sure they would? Dont they still have a choice to choose others if they have a change of heart? 
-
 
To  to answer your question: i think it really is a matter of principle and about character of the parties. It is also really about how you'd like to start out your new relationship. If two people are meant to be together, they will. And if you truly love someone, wouldnt you want them to be happy? I will share my own experience.

I was attached a few years before and my friend, x, really liked me. However, he supported me in staying in the relationship because he thought it made me happy. It was only after he found out that i was unhappy that he let me know his feelings for me but i did not leave immediately (even tho i had some feelings for him too) out of commitment and respect to my current partner. He understood too and left it at that.  It was only after a mutual breakup and some time of healing later that i got together with x.

Advantages? Less baggage and i knew i wanted to be with him for who he is and not just because someone else made me unhappy. Im glad he respected my space and didnt try to crowd me or fight for me when i was attached.

After all, who wants to start a relationship on the foundation of having forcefully wrecked another?

So recently I have been on a diet and active exercise in a bid to shed some weight off my plus size frame. Someone noticed and told me to press on so that I can change my physical outlook to get a boyfriend. & I must say I felt insulted and rather bitter about this. I may be overweight but I am mindful enough to keep myself pleasant looking and presentable still.

Honestly, if I were to change myself for someone, it will be for myself/ my loved ones. Or that someone better be hella important to me. Not that eyecandy who is but a stranger or for that reason hey I just want a guy. 

Guys, are looks that defining in a relationship?  Perhaps first impression do matter a lot these days. (That someone went on to saying how it matters in the workplace as well )

As I have been evergreen for so long, when it comes to relationship, I admit that I am very noob. I planned to go on my very first date with this girl which I have feelings for. Can anyone suggest what should I do on the first date other than meals and movies and also what to avoid and what I should do cause I do not want to feel awkward and ruin everything. I know some thirteen years old can answer this question with ease but will appreciate honest answers.

I am quite interested in this guy who is attached. I would always make it seem like I friendzoned him but actually I just want him to feel comfortable with me as a friend. But things are getting disappointing when he also friendzoned me (?!?!) I am curious if it is possible for a guy to friendzone a girl... or do they friendzone girls because they are being friendzoned first? Do I also should give up in still thinking that I hv a chance with him..

Today I'm just reading a book while listening to music from Youtube at a random chill-out spot in town. Only meeting a friend later, plenty of time to myself.

This is the awesome thing about singlehood. You get freedom, time and energy conserved. And much less trouble too. It might get boring sometimes, but it's peaceful. Having more people around may very well descend into complicated situations.

Oh well, this is just a point of view.

Congrats to all fellow graduates by the way!

The funny thing about hope is that life has an awful habit of crushing it. And yet, we continue to cling to hope in our moments of despair. Such an irrational and quintessentially human trait.

I created a blog recently to document memorable moments between my bf and I recently, and I told my bf about it. I feel disappointed when he asked me what I meant by memorable and he couldn't understand it. Can't help feeling hurt and terribly one sided..

I wonder if it is possible to escape a mental/psychological disorder. I feel like I've been struggling for so long, yet there has been absolutely no progress; in fact I am slowly being eaten alive by my own thoughts. My physical and mental health is deteriorating at an intimidating pace. Nights are the worst, that 8 hours when everyone is asleep while I'm up torturing myself in various unbelievable ways. Nights are supposed to be the best for introverts like me, although I still think they carry their own positive aspect in which is because I'm the most honest and the most 'real'. Many times at night, I evaluate the unfairness in life, think about my own lack of freedom and question the meaning of my existence, and in a worse state of mind, I think about suicide. Lately, I just feel like giving up. I am so tired of trying yet to no avail. I don't think I will ever recover. I am scared of looking at myself for more days to come, and even more afraid of experiencing my impact on others. 

Positivity has always been my goal, but now I can't stop myself from questioning: Is there an escape out of this dark world? Will I ever find this exit?

I'm not a freshman anymore.

In light of the recent LGBT related posts, I'm deciding to give this a shot.

I used to think i'm a straight guy until NS, when I beginning to feel attracted to certain type of guys. I brushed it off initially. As I ended my National Service stint, I worked for a Ad Agency and attended numerous house parties. I realised that I usually ended up hitting off with those who were Transgender as compared to those who were of the opposite gender. In terms of physical attractions, and being emotionally connected to them.

I'm rather confused. I understand that there's an upcoming orientation for LGBT freshman, I was wondering if it would be helpful for me if I joined this event to find out more or at least..try to pin point my sexual preference

Am I .........normal ? Because I prefer having a sexual relationship with a transgender than a female

I have been evergreen all this while and really do not know what is it like to love someone. Recently, I found myself being able to have endless conversation with this girl in my workplace. I did not get her number as I only thought of it as a platonic friendship and was having doubts that if I get into a relationship with her, will it last since I do not want to hurt her feelings. Now, both of us have left our workplace and occasionally, I will think of her and regretted not having her contact numbers.  Hopefully, fate will allow me to meet her again.

Just wondering, how many guys out there would actually be interested in women who are more or as ambitious than you, more educated than you, and probably earn more than you? To add on, these women may actually be totally awkward in relationships since they probably studied away their entire lives.

@OP of 
I feel you man. Not sure if you are in the similar situation as me, but basically I have lots of acquaintances but am not close to any of them. And from time to time, I also experience that emptiness as well.

As for why you are in such a situation, there are a few possible reasons:
1) Being socially awkward; this is a very big issue
2) Not trusting others enough to open up to them (though of course you shouldn't reveal every single thing about yourself)
3) Having a face that looks unfriendly/intimidating/etc
4) Having very different interests, principles, etc from others
These are just some reasons I could think off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more.

What can you do? Perhaps a change of mindset is in order. As hard as this sounds, you are going to have to stop being so dependent on relationships with others, i.e. become emotionally independent. You try your best, and if nothing works out, you move on. You can at least stay as acquaintances. Never harm others, and do your best to help them when required, but don't expect people to reciprocate your efforts because you need to realize that they are not obliged to do so. Do this, and you will generally be well-liked/respected by others, though they may just be acquaintances. You will also be hopefully spared from the torment of wondering why your investments are never returned with close friends. However, by chance, if you do make some really close friends along the way, make sure to treasure them! And remember that you still have your family as one of your pillars of support.

The next thing to do is to focus your energy on improving yourself in areas of your life that you have direct control over (such as your academics, physical fitness, etc). This ties in with what I said above: the more you improve yourself as a person, the more independent you are able to become, and irregardless of whether you have close friends or not, you will generally be able to stand on your own two feet and live on proudly. As for how, I won't elaborate since it's quite self-explanatory. You know, study harder, read more books to improve your knowledge, go work out, etc etc.

All the best mate, things may not turn out the way you want them to in life but I hope that you find the courage to strive on nevertheless.

I have a really big appetite, in fact my appetite can be comparable to guys. But that is due to my high metabolism. Question to guys, is it a turn off if the girl has a big appetite?

I'm not someone who's easy to live with. I've never had a relationship that lasted beyond 6 months. I find it really hard to get together with anyone I pursue, and I've only had four girlfriends, and our relationships lasted for 6mth, 7mth, 2mth and 1mth respectively.

Maybe, I'm better off alone. And right now I probably am - the last one pushed me really hard on settling down and kids. I freaked out about all that and I broke up.

But at the same time I really really want to get married, and mainly that's cuz it's the only viable excuse for me to get out of my house. My mom is completely insufferable. There's no way I can move out without also ruining the relationship with my family. the four years I lived in uni, that was a brief and welcome respite, but now i'm back home......
-
 
I don't think my current boyfriend is the one for me but i got into a relationship with him anyway for the hope that it may change. It's been 2 months now but i still feel that  he isn't the 'right person' or my soulmate. However i know he thinks that i am his 'right person' and he treats me very nicely and i do like him and i don't want to hurt him. I'm just afraid i'm wasting my time and blowing off the chances of meeting the right person for me.

Sometimes seeing ppl spending 10 plus dollars for a meal or starbucks makes me lament abt how different our lives are. They spend without even blinking their eyes. 

While many ppl like myself worry abt how much to spend for our next meal so as not to burst our budget. Don't be mistaken, just need to pay off my loan. But still even if without loan, I still need to worry abt expenses cos I'm not as lucky as them.

 I feel you. A guy asked for my number and have never initiated a conversation. I don't even get what he's thinking about. Guys, shed some light please!

Although I am an introvert and would prefer to be alone most of the time, I still feel sad when I see everyone else are having fun as a clique and are not invited for a gathering:(

It would really help if you guys at least ask us. That would make us feel much better even most of the time we don't go. We are not arrogant and definitely wanted to feel included too. #rantofanintrovert #toughlife

To 
Its the opposite for my case =.= anyway i guess same applies to guys. My bf dislike my male friends especially if I go out with them even though we don't have any body contact nor neither of us flirts with each other. He is constantly worried that I will... meet someone more rich, more handsome, more smart than him and dump him. I don't know where he got the impression I'm someone like that but I think he is describing himself for he say he might leave me if he finds someone better. Dk joking or not also.

Btw his standards of handsome can be different from mine. So maybe you are not uglier than his gf. Once he happened to see me going out with a guy B (guy B has a gf himself, NOT me). His first reaction was he thought he was my brother. After I corrected him he commented he was pretty good looking. I was surprised + laugh and told my bf I will let guy B knows my bf complimented him.

For me, I actually encourage my bf to talk to girls. When he keep telling me he didnt talk to any girls because of his past experience with a controlling ex. The only catch is that he has to tell me if he fall in love with another girl. Then he should gracefully break up with me. I cannot stand two-timers. And its okay to fall in love with someone else. But please don't compare her with me. It's like I'm an item and not a special living girl that you have once loved. Ya haha. Hope that day will never happen.

Where are your opinion of finding the one?

I read several comments about creating the one > finding the one.

Are you saying that you should randomly find someone who wanted to commit with you, you two become get in a relationship and build up the relationship over time even if you didn't feel any infatuation for him/her initially?

Are you saying that finding the one isn't important? 

My theory is different. I feel that a relationship won't start without passion. I feel that we have to find "the one" and be in a relationship with him/her. He/She doesn't have to be perfect for you but he/she must be good enough that you will have feeling for him/her.

After that, work toward building intimacy.

 Take note that I do agree that creating the one > finding the one. However, I feel that finding the one is the important first step.

What do you all think?

Did my first ever flag day with nus flag last year with my hall and it was such a bad experience... So many nus students flagging in the entire sg and even having 2 diff faculties flagging in the same area as us and the public were so annoyed by us. Swore that it would be my first and last time doing flag last year but sigh forced to do flag again this year as part of hall FOP -.-

I do not have much male friends ( not to mention female friends ) and even with my friends I hardly talk. Just wondering is it possible for introvert guys to get into a relationship. 
-
 
Someone broke my heart sometime back. I really loved her.

But when she left I knew, there's only one thing left to do, and that's to let her go, and deal with the pain.

And unfortunately, one of the ways I found to deal with the pain was to visit prostitutes. Then I levelled up. I found myself a FB.

Recently I've tried to go dating again. After all, I eventually wanna settle down. And I just ended two relationships in quick succession. Then I realise..... maybe it's impossible for me to love. I think i'm broken.
-
 
I post on social media quite a lot. So much, it's actually... Noise. I lose friends on social media more often than not, because of my emotional outbursts, noise-making, etc.. I actually do monitor  the number of friends I have on social media. 

I'm one of those people, whom others come by with the opinion of "hey,there's something wrong with this guy, he's weird, he's irrelevant to me, I don't think I will keep him around any more, I don't think I would want to even be any where near him." I am very aware of it, much, much more than you actually think. 

How so? I actually do review what I post, and think about it,censor it, the next day. 

Now, why would I do that? I can't say this out loud, and most people who have seen me around might have already figured out (or not) by now, that I am very, very lonely. Having problems talking to others, face-to-face, is not helping either. Perhaps, posting noisily on fb was an outlet to generate some faux presence of company to let me think that I am not alone.

Though thank goodness, I do have a single good friend who is patient enough to withstand and see through my behaviour. I don't intend to lose her.

You know what? Forget social media. I think there's a life outside the net that I should be living. 

At least, I hope the sun will be welcoming as it was, many times when I stepped out of the net. 

Well, that's a lot of "I"s, but someday, it will not be about "I" or "me" anymore. I only need a listening ear,so thanks for listening.

I met this guy at a 3-day CCA camp in the last week of my exchange. Our first conversation happened during dinner one day. He came over to the group I was sitting with, and introduced himself to me. We had a good long chat about our common interest. I really enjoyed that conversation and I think we hit it off quite well. We weren't talking to each other exclusively though. We sort of alternated between our conversation between us and joining in the group conversation. At that time, I didn't have any interest in him yet, just saw him as an acquaintance.

The next time we talked was when I was talking to some other people during break and he joined in. We had a very intellectually provoking and interesting chat again. This happened again the next day during break. Throughout our interactions he made several comments about how interesting our conversations were, how he enjoyed them, and how we should have those conversations again. What struck me was how he remembered and referenced each occasion of our conversation (first at dinner, then during break at a particular spot in the room), when he commented on how he enjoyed our conversations. He also made several nice comments about me throughout the camp.

The last night, I approached him to start a conversation during a social event, and it went well again. Again, we ended up chatting in a group, but it was all very fun. We were playing a game, and once, when I won, he excitedly placed his hands on my shoulders lightly to congratulate me (not in an offensive way). It was then that I felt something for him. 

Before I ended my exchange, one of the people in his clique, who was also my friend, contacted me to meet up. Then he messaged me and asked me to meet up too.

We eventually met up, with his clique, over lunch. I didn't get a chance to speak much to him unfortunately. I noticed he was a bit jittery when we first met, and a bit unlike his usual self. I wanted to ask him if he was alright, but after a while he was fine. So the gathering ended, and we spoke a bit, but not like how we talked to each other during the retreat. I was quite disappointed because I was hoping to get to know him better personally.

After that I SMS-ed him to thank him for organizing the meet up, just general thanks and take care and stuff. He replied pretty general stuff as well, and it was a close-ended message, like there was no "space" for us to continue the conversation.

Maybe it's too impulsive for me to say that I really like him, because I haven't really got to know him well. Even if I think I like him, it's probably a shallow infatuation kind of thing because of our pleasant interactions during the camp. But he is definitely someone I would want to explore being friends with at least, even if we don't progress. At this point, it seems like he is quite uncontactable and not responsive. 

I know he is currently busy with something, but I'm beginning to feel that this was all one-sided to begin with. Maybe I've been imagining this all along, interpreting everything to be positive hints. I've been thinking about him and I'm quite interested in getting to know him. I just don't know what is on his mind right now, or if disappointment awaits me.

Is it possible that a photogenic person may not be good looking in real life while a good looking person may not be photogenic?

I'm an incoming freshie, and I feel guilty for say that I'm only going for one FOC because I'm too lazy to go down in person to pay for the other ones. But largely because the introvert me will probably be miserable throughout.

Girls, is there any reason why you will dislike your boyfriend's female friend? I am not as smart or pretty as her, so I am wondering. Neither do I flirt with him. 
-
 
I told a girl(that told me she is busy and isn't looking for a r/s) that i am interested in her but would like to know her more before jumping in further. She didn't reply me anymore too. Why do girls generally ignore a person when they know that the person is interested in them and they have no interest?
-
 
To 

Yes its possible. In fact I have a really close friendship with a guy. Paisei I didn't want to post with my real account because I want to keep it private and not exposed to everyone to read. I am a girl and there is this guy friend whom I have seen through 2 relationships start till end and now he is going for his 3rd relationship. If you think I may like him, not really, he's really not my type. And he doesn't likes me too. I'm probably the only girl he had deep conversations other than his girlfriend(s). And both relationship the girls knew me and they will even force him to say hi to me if we ever encounter.

We can go have dinner and watch a movie alone without any touching. I even take rides in his parents car with his parents. But I'm not tomboy. I have long hair and there are people who compliments that I'm pretty. 

Before every relationship he will update me about the girl and how he feels. When there was problem in the relationship I'm one of the first to know. Then at the breakup he would actually look for me to chat for hours. On the first girl breakup I actually witness him punching a wall and shouting. It is actually bad because it makes his exes think I asked him to break up when in fact i keep emphasizing for them to talk. He is really a bad person in relationship for he cheats on his ex-gf on her best friend and then he broke up with her to date with her best friend (aka 2nd gf i seen him with). Now he wants to pursue his first love that never actually started before. And I have to emphasize again, we NEVER had any body contact or saying mushy stuffs etc.

Well what do you think?
-
 
Recently one of my male friends have been sending me unwanted messages, in one he even directly says that he masturbates to pics of me :(

This is making me feel really uncomfortable, and I would guess this counts as sexual harrassment? But at the same time I don't wish to ruin his future by filing a police report. Not that I'm a saintly person or anything, but I don't wish to destroy someone like this. 

Its really heartbreaking that guy friends can turn out to be such complete pervs. But what should I do now...?
-
 
Anyone out there actually believes in platonic relationship between the opposite gender? Like the fact that opposite gender can frequently message each other but still stay as friends? Here's the situation: I have been keeping in contact with a guy for approx half a year now and we met for a once or twice. We weren't awkward with each other when we meet etc. As for messaging, I wouldn't say that the replies that I receive are that fast (probably takes a few hours sometimes for him to reply) but yeah, we kept the conversation going. The conversation is mainly about some general stuff and a bit of our daily lives and that's it. Can I actually conclude that it's just a platonic relationship? 
-
 
I have three more weeks left with you.
Even though I know we've suffered quite a bit for the past few weeks, I wish you'd know that every single moment spent with you has been pure bliss.
I have no idea if you feel the same so I'd rather that the legacy of our time together be left as the beginnings of a great friendship than risk what we have.
Yet somehow I wish you'd know of how certain I am that I will never find something like we have in anyone else.
When I'm around you, I feel no fear and I just feel so happy. 
I never knew anyone could make me feel this way.

P.S.: Commenters, you can ask me to grow a pair but anatomically it's not possible for me :/
-
 
I've never been good at handling relationships. No matter how much effort i put into developing my friendships or relationship, everyone eventually walks out on me. 

It feels so lonely and hollow to be me. All i've ever wanted was to be the best buddy/bf to those close to me. But, I've always just been treated as a puppet - doing only things that others expect of me, saying only things that others want to hear. Failure to do so makes me a defective puppet, easily thrown away and replaced with another.

I really do not understand what im doing wrong. I've been tolerating the fact that most of my efforts i invest is not returned in the slightest - so long as i know that i still have friends around me. But despite all the giving without receiving, it doesnt seem to be enough for anyone. They all still fade away eventually. 

I've got nothing to my name. im not rich, im not smart, im not good looking and i dont have a ripped body to show. All i have is my honesty, and my loyalty. but i guess such things are no longer valued in this day and age..
-
 
To the person who posted  - just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. Reading your confession was like looking into a mirror (I'm an introverted gay freshie as well). And while I've been paralysed from time to time by horrible fears like being left on the shelf, I'm coming to realise that there're more people out there like us, or who'll accept us, than we think. Cheers to (hopefully) finding them!

I wish I had the courage to end my life.

I’m sick of being told by my sister that my being gay is wrong and that I will never find happiness if I chose to stay on this path.

I’m sick of being told, time and again, that I cannot let my little niece know that I’m gay because she fears I might influence her.

I’m sick of the constant rejection from other gay men who demand equality, and then look at me and write me off when they realise the colour of my skin is not the same as theirs. 

I’m so… so… sick of this. Maybe my sister is right.

I will never find happiness as a gay man. 

Maybe… just maybe… I’m better dead. I cannot.. do this anymore.

I don’t have any more fight left in me.

Theres this guy from BME that i've been noticing for awhile. He is always with girls. I think he is a year 3 student. Does anyone know if he has a girlfriend? Do you think he will ever notice me?

So I've been with this guy for years and I'd like to believe we went through thick and thin together. But recently, he dumped me and his reason was that he's feelings are not there anymore. He also said that he feels bad for treating me terribly and not giving me attention and he wants to stop feeling that way. It hurt me terribly because we always work through any doubts or difficulties we had together and I didn't expect him to end it with me. I am in a state of shock and disbelief.
-
 

I know how you feel. I have absolutely no interest in any of the things you listed out in your post either (I don't know any of the popular English or Chinese Pop songs or either; the only songs I listen to are Anisongs), and none of my friends in NUS share the same interests as me. However, do not restrict the topic of discussion with your peers to just interests alone!  When are your friends are in their own world talking about things that seem alien to you, just listen quietly, or you can even introduce to them what your interests are.
PS. I tried introducing my friends to some Anime, Manga or games like Kancolle, but it didn't work out very well =( But that doesn't stop me from interacting and getting along with them!

To OP of ,
I totally understand how you feel about your older brother. Mine's exactly the same, except now he's 4 years out of NS and cannot hold a proper job/education. Everytime we ask what he wants to do, pursue another education (he kinda flunked poly) or get a full-time job (he's jumps between adhoc jobs, he hates every single one of them and quits so easily), every response is a shrug and an "IDK", which annoys my family to no end.

What many are terming the mid-twenties as the prime of someone's life is the bane of his existence and all he does is play computer games with little or no communication to the outside world. He refuses help for anything, and worse still he buys things with whatever little savings he has to feed his addictions.

We were all at our wits ends, but we try our best to reintergrate him back into reality by forcing him to pick up life skills such as driving in hopes that one day if he realizes that he really needs to support himself, he has a driving job to fall back on.

dearest OP, you're not alone. We can only support our brothers as much as we can the only ways we know how. A supportive community of friends and family would really help, so perhaps you can try to engage him in whatever ways we can.

I received a whatsapp msg from my mum over the weekends. Bad news. My grandmother has passed away. I gave my mother a call, asked what happened and if she was okay. She said i didn't have to come back for her funeral (i'm on exchange). After hanging up the call, i had dinner, eating and talking with friends in the restaurant, like nothing happened.

And it is during times like these, late at night, when i reflect on the past few days, that makes me feel bad.
Not because of the passing of my grandmother.
But because i didn't feel anything about it. The reaction i had was just like a ''oh okay''.
And even the concern i expressed for my mother was not genuine concern, but just actions expected of one.

I've always known that i'm a cold person, but not till this extent. Not batting an eyelid when someone close passes away. 
I seem to know less and less about myself as the years go by and that scares me.
-
 
I am an incoming freshie. Introverted but selectively talkative to a person if we click I guess. But I always worry for being unable to find friends and being left on the shelf. Well, I did give the orientation camps a try. But like some of the other posts here, I also found it so hard to fit in. Very energy sapping I would say. And I guess its worse with something inside me that forms a barrier between me and the people.

Fact is, I am gay. I very much wish to be accepted and be open about it, but I guess many are still uncomfortable with such stuff. I just wish that somehow I will be able to find nice friends in school who are willing to accept me for who I am, though I am not sure how. 

Please don't flame me for this, I really yearn and wish to be able to find love in campus. I guess like many people, there will come a time when such instincts will hit you. But well, I guess the chances for love for people like me are slim, eh? ><

I am a girl and I think I have a masturbation problem. I "self-please" almost everyday. I didn't think much of it until recently, and stared to worry if it affects my well-being. Is it weird for a girl to masturbate? If not, how frequent is considered "normal"?

Just wanted to add my two cents worth to 's post. Couldn't agree more that there exists a lot more room for improvement in terms of how we perceive and subsequently, choose to interact with people of different racial backgrounds than we are from. I'm disappointed with how some of my friends' have chosen to respond to (friendly and polite) requests they received from joining NUS Chopsticks to hang out and make friends with the requester. Once they discovered that the requester was of a different race as them. Even going as far as to post the request in the group chat and saying 'I might entertain him longer' if the requester was of the same race. The guy was already upfront saying he was cool even if it didn't work out. What is wrong with just making friends? Why even bother joining Chopsticks then? 

This is none of my business, but I do feel sorry for the poor requester. 

Ending on a random muse, children from inter-racial marriages do tend to be better-looking though. Pity that this friend was too far off from considering that option ;)

I have always thought that after i get into NUS, my self-confidence would boost up a bit in my family, but it doesn't really help with my lower-than-average cap. I grew up listening to the praises my parents have for my elder sibling, and then my younger sibling as they are more academically inclined. Being a middle child, i always felt inferior. I have always try good enough to follow the footstep of my elder sibling, going to jc and then to university without really knowing what i want. Of course, most of the time i would feel that im living in a blissful family, getting along well with my sibling most of the time (we will get into some serious quarrel sometimes) but it is this small little things they did unintentionally that have an effect on me deep inside. Sometimes i will tell my parent how i feel with the little actions they did like boasting about my siblings achievement in front of me, but i just ended up looking petty.

Rant: My birthday lies during the second half of the year and my clique (more than 5 people) have the habit of getting present for each of us. I do not mind contributing for each but the disappointment is there when the effort they put in goes down as the months pass by and I did not receive any for the past 2 years even though they kept talking about it.  It does not help when I do not come from a well to do family. Sigh.

Have you ever met people who are so passionate in what they are doing, that it dominates everything about their life, their social media, even their dressing? No, I'm not saying that they are weird, in fact, I respect and envy them. 

I have met a few people in my major who have displayed so much passion,  and I am trying to do the same but I don't see it dominating my whole life. Let's just say that I do find interest and passion in so many other things in life, but all of them are not THAT big enough to dominate my lifestyle - which leads to my next point of not knowing what I am going to do with my future.

I sort of have an idea of where I could be heading, and I have been putting in more effort to gain more knowledge and experience, but I feel guilty at the same time whenever I compare myself with those REALLY PASSIONATE ones. I wish I could be more like them, but there are so many things in my life that I find it fulfilling and meaningful that I can't devote myself to just one interest. 

What should I do now :(

My elder brother is unemployed for 2 years after finishing NS, he just watches tv all day. He has no friends or social life, his phone is always off. He dont care about his hygience and appearance. e.g, he dont brush his teeth in the morning, not trimming his fingernails etc. He keeps repeating the same stuff when i asked why is he not finding a job. his reply: "i am scared that u or mum will look at me when i return home". Basically, he cant hold a proper conversation or maintain eye contact. i highly suspect that he suffers from some psychological disorder, but i cant convince my parents to send him for a checkup. it is hard to find a cheap psychologist. P.S i am from a low income family. Anyone has any reccomendations for psychologist?

Just saw . I'm a little disappointed in the NUS community. A bit ironic since I am myself remaining anonymous but when OP had the courage to reveal themselves I think the response was a bit unfriendly. You guys are entertaining confession about cheating, crushes and useless stuffs and worse of all the guy with the poo fetish. Disgusting, man! But you got problem with someone who got a acadamic concern. Ok wrong place, but what more great important thing are you all doing with your time? NUSMods can go reply to helpfully state the rules, but cannot answer the OP. And everyone as though they are sheep went and like that comment. Singaporeans really love their rules, even in facebook. 
Nobody seems amazed that for the first time really a confesser went and revealed their identity. Only happy to state the rules. 
Oh well at least this confession remind me to go start planning my mods.

my gf has been following this page, and have seen so many breakups in NUSwhispers, including cheating, lost of interests etc..
but correct me if i'm wrong. this kinda brings out many of the sad stories, whereas many of the happy stories are just kept happily to themselves. 

so yupp, to my GF, please don't be depressed or freaked out by these stories. I love you, and let me know if you ever feel insecure. i will love you even more to let you feel my heart. <3

To the guy with the shit fetish in ,totally understand you: I've a foot fetish and it stemmed from my fantasy that the some girls are so pretty and perfect that they can't  have feet that smell. And it turns me on knowing that they ultimately do... The things I would do to fulfil my fantasies...   And I know it disgusts most but how do we rein in something that seems almost primal...

Which comes first?
1) Sort out life then get married
OR
2) Get married and life gets sorted out?

To  

Just want to let you know that you are not alone. My parents are also overprotective of me (more so than my peers'). At 21, I still have a curfew, am not allowed to go for sleepovers or on overseas trips alone/with friends. I've talked to them but it just ended in lots of shouting, weeks of 'cold war', the 'I'll disown you' threat and basically it went nowhere. I used to really hate my parents for the missed opportunities and experiences I could have had. I was jealous of my friends' parents who trusted them and let them do what they wanted. I was even jealous of broken families because the parents are rarely there and children could do whatever they want (I know, I was young, stupid and ungrateful). 

As I grew older, I understood where my parents are coming from. Not to say that I do not resent them for the restrictions and control they placed upon me. After all, unless you're financially independent, your parents still have a lot of leverage (money!!). But it's a lot of give and take, I guess. Others with less controlling parents will not understand why people like us don't just break all their restrictions and yolo - after all, parents will likely never disown us despite their threats. But every parent and every family is different. Some parents need more time to 'let go' of their children. I guess I am more harmony-loving and figured that I cannot tolerate days of quarreling with my parents. I took the more gradual approach and struck compromises to slowly help my parents come to terms that they have to let me go some day. My parents have always been there for me in their own ways, gave me all they had and raised me in comfort all these 21 years. I think they deserve that much, and that is all I can do to help them and help myself. 

Even if the process is slow, be patient with your parents. Start small. Explain to your parents that you're young and you still need a social life, but reach some kind of compromise with them. Show them that you understand their point of view, and placate their worries. Try to take your chances and push some boundaries (but not too often, or you'll lose their trust). If you have friends who guilt-trip/look down on you because of your situation with your parents, let me tell you, you don't need them. I am very lucky to have friends who are super understanding of my situation - they always made sure I got home before my curfew and they never ever make me feel guilty for not being able to go on trips with them. Surround yourself with supportive friends and treasure the time with your parents. 

All the best!

To the person with the poop fetish... All I can say is, there will be a girl who will accept you.. I myself have a pee fetish and am happily attached... We even indulge in it sometimes too. so yeah. calm down.

I'm a girl with high sex drive, so much that sometimes my fwb cannot handle it... Like he runs out of energy to continue. And it's not like he's weak since he's been forever exercising. But I feel really embarrassed by this. I fear that all my friends would judge me so badly if they find out this side of me, since most of my friends are pretty decent and innocent. :( Any girls out here facing the same thing?

It gets tiring keeping a happy facade when behind all the smiles and laughter is a broken family. A family without a father, a family with a mother who is barely around, a family who doesnt seem to care for each other. Arguments and quarrel seems to be a common affair in my family and i always dread family outings because almost none of them ends up well. Its hard to love a family which i cannot find peace in. Only when i am away from home can i find moments of peace and happiness. I have often thought of sharing my problems with my friends but yet again i dont want them to know what is happening in my family. Sometimes i just want to run, run away from home.

Anybody have a cure for NUSWhispers addiction?

On the face of it, you might see me as a cheerful, easy going, and probably an intelligent lad. Beneath the facade, I feel that no matter how hard I try, I just can't convince myself. I don't have a high CAP, nor am I rich. In fact, I am looking at a huge amount of loan after I graduate, and so does my parents. That don't matter, I don't mind living at a bare minimum for years. What scared me is that with my low scores, I can't find a single employer. I do have a sense of direction in my life that I want to achieve but at this point, nothing seems certain.

I have a fair share of s***ty moments in my life, mostly from abusive peers and teachers back in high school, that it sometimes gave me a depressive episode. I don't want to trouble no one, my family included. They have never knew of this issue before, which is reasonable. Because I have never told them about this. Our family's facing financial issues and also they're a firm believer of 'you-can-stop-depression-by-not-being-depressed' method. They're all in a lot of stress already and my condition won't really help them at all.

I often wondered about ending myself, but there's not much ways I can do to seriously kill myself. If this were America I might have ended myself long ago thanks to the second amendment. I have always accepted my mortality, but I just don't want to leave any loose ends, should the attempt fail.

I deeply apologise if my content lacks coherence (I do feel it goes all over the place) as I am typing this in a kind of a... well, not so good condition, and I purposefully omitted a lot of details so as to preserve anonymity.

A lot of breakup stories here recently which I found interesting to read. Really kowtow the admins of this page for sifting through the immense number of posts man. I can't even keep up reading all yet you guys are able to look through everything. Keep up the good job and sorry to add yet another post for you to read.

Before I entered NUS, I only had one bf, not because guys weren't interested but because I always felt awkward after a few dates and would pull away. This carried on in the first 1.5 years of uni as I dated a few guys, until I met my ex through a mutual friend in a club. He was the one who chased me, and for the first time, I felt like, okay maybe this is a guy I can see myself being with. But once our 3 month relationship began, he would say things like "What if I go to NTU and find somebody better?" (he is my age and I was Y2) or "I don't think I want to wait for you when you go for SEP". Eventually I broke up with him because I knew it was for the best, but being weak, I regretted it immediately and asked him if we could at least try again until I go for SEP and we see how (I know, I'm so lame). He said no, and even until today, it still hurts to think about that period in my life.

After SEP I came back, and met another guy through another mutual friend. He seemed nice, and we seemed to have a lot in common, and there was much more chemistry compared to my ex. On one of our dates, we started making out in his car at Kent Ridge park, and I was happy that maybe I finally found a guy who is really into me. Fortunately or unfortunately, I started thinking about how my ex hurt me, and I stopped and asked him if he saw us progressing into a relationship. I was honestly quite shocked when he said no and that we were just fooling around. He didn't really want to talk to me after that night. Again, I regretted asking for a serious relationship, and hinted if we could just hang out and be make-out buddies, but he wasn't interested as he was going on SEP. After this second heartbreak (and a slew of dating other guys who just didn't want to commit), I was quite disappointed with the whole dating scene, and I felt like I would never be able to find a guy who would ever want me and love me, and maybe I didn't deserve it since it seemed so impossible. Up to that age, I'd never even had a serious relationship before, and I just felt like I was too lame to be anyone's girlfriend.

Fast forward to today, shortly after I graduated, I met my current bf, who really makes me feel like I'm so loved, and I'm so grateful for him. It makes me wonder why I ever bothered asking those 2 guys to take me back and trying to compromise my standards.

TL;DR: if you break up with someone, it's probably for the best. you never know if something better will come along for you, so don't give up hope!

My parents continue to have strict curfew on me even though I am a 21 year old guy. As such, I really have to beg them to let me go for my orientation camp and even though I eventually went for my camp, they don't allow me to stay overnight or they will disown me. They always told me to focus on my studies in uni and not to get involved in any relationships. It really makes me worry that I will be single even when I graduate.

Is it possible to make someone feel really loved without ever being in a relationship? Its still a commitment but not one binded to a single person. 

(Yes its a friendship but definitely more - friends with nonphysical benefits?)

I am the guy with the girls' shit fetish in . Firstly, thank you all, I expected to be condemned yet again, but instead I found understanding. Especially Nuo Ning, Hillary, and Darryl, really thank you for the effort to undrstand. 

I guess I will elaborate further so everyone will understand a little more and won't be so quick to judge. Since young I already was adverse to all kinds of dirty things. Mud, sand, feet, farts, dirt etc., even I was disgusted by my own shit. Since I was always scolded that being dirty was unbecoming, I grew to become an absolute clean freak.

I think as I grew up I totally switched to the other side. All till one day during sec sch class chalet, one of my female classmates pranked me by farting on my face while I was half-asleep. I pretended to still be asleep as they laughed, but I couldn't resist getting turned on. The smell was so disgusting, as if something died in her bowels. For a girl to be that dirty, I thought it all to be so wrong, yet so right! Especially since during those years, most guys probably have the illusion that girls fart rainbows and don't poop.

Fast forward to this year's ocip when I found my female friend's poop half-flushed. I thought of simply ignoring it, but when I saw the speck of undigested red chilli skin from the veggies we ate 2 days before, and imagined how a small girl can produce something so nasty from her butt, I lost it. In effect I had cheated on my gf with two other girl...s' shit. Its really as wtf as it sounds :(

From a clean freak, I seem to have changed 180 and become totally fine with being dirty and all, but perhaps too much. They always say when you love someone, you wouldn't mind their dirty side. Like when my ex vomitted on me when she was sick, I was totally cool. 

So thanks all for trying to understand a little, I really appreciate it. For a rather well-liked guy to be hiding this from all his friends, it seems a little wrong. But I really do hope to find an awesome girl who doesnt mind, or is even into, this weird fetish of mine. To my ex, I'm really sorry I grossed you out and caused you hurt, but please move on and find a better guy.

I am a guy who only has eyes for married or attached women.  Single women are too easy prey.  It gives me pleasure to sleep with my friend's wife or girlfriend.  Even better if I can break them up while getting the girl to like me, and then later I break up with the girl so I can go for another girl who already has a boyfriend/husband.

 Hi there,

I think it is really great that you managed to continue with your current boyfriend despite the effort you may feel at times. 

A personal thing I feel is that it is often easy to have "that kind" of attraction for some else; it may be because you seek something unexpected (since it's three years, you probably are accustomed to doing the same things with your boyfriend). But one thing though: they don't last long. 

I feel that what's most important is a friendship: with your boyfriend. Not just the romantic side of it, but on a soulmate/friend level where you confide/rant about daily things to each other. Often in the romantic side, there's a need to present one's best side to each other. What you may been feeling is the liking of the other guy's best side, but perhaps on a friendship level you may find yourself incompatible. The key thing is the soulmate, romantic attraction, while nice and fun, should come after that. 

My take is of course, dont be too quick to fall into that. After all, you've gone through 3 years with your current boyfriend. I'm pretty sure on a friendship level, you are close with him. And that's really important. It may seem a little dry and unexciting compared to the other guy, but hang on there. Relationships aren't perfect, it's perhaps a usual down that you face. 

As to what to feel, you can suggest asking your boyfriend to do something different? Maybe that may include a holiday to somewhere different, perhaps do something like hiking? But apart from that, I think you will have this feeling for some time to come. A possible way (but it can be negative) would be to pick out the points you dont like about that guy, and it may reduce the initial attraction to him.

This used to happen to me. I used to ask this girl for her number and the next thing she told me was she is already attached.

I've been with my bf for almost 3 years now... And recently like in this six months especially every time I think we're okay after a fight and we make up, it's all right; something happens that makes me doubt it. I actually don't know whether he truly loves me anymore or he's just used to saying those three words after these couple years. I've always wanted to ask him - do you wish you were dating someone else, someone less complex, someone even younger and more relaxed? People in a relationship: how do you evaluate whether to go on after 2.5-3 years? Do you fight often? I'm 22 and I don't wanna waste my time on someone who might actually prefer a younger wilder thing.

Shout out to all the people on Tinder.

My last Tinder match was on 18th June. It has been 18 days without a match. Since Tinder now has a cap on number of swipes per day (I think it's around 24 "right" swipes), i have been rejected by approximately 432 women. Of course this assumes that my profile is viewed by 24 different unique ladies per day.

So my question is, what has been your longest Tinder dry spell?

-
 
So basically, I have been dating my boyfriend for three years. After a year, I lost the "spark" but went on because I cared for him. It's the typical love-but-not-in-love situation. 

Along the way I have been attracted to others but have been able to rationalize it away or else it subsequently faded. 

Recently I met someone at my short-term work place whom I could very naturally hold a conversation with. I was only shifted with him a handful of times. Initially I was very infatuated with him but subsequently it was not as strong. However, as I leave my workplace this week, I still feel substantial infatuation for him and an "urge" to like him. I am finding difficulty rationalizing out of this. I also think about this problem when I am with my boyfriend, and that makes me feel very sad. :(

I have a most abnormal fetish, and the short story is I told my now ex-gf about it. It did not turn out well. From young I was always anal-retentive, and this has carried on even till today.

From Freudian analysis, people stuck at this stage derive pleasure from the anus. For me, this included poop, and I got obsessed with girls' waste products. This OCIP, which I went with my ex, I chanced upon 2 of the girls leaving the toilet unflushed on separate occasions. To keep this unobscene, let's just say I did some nasty things to their unflushed shit.

I got really guilty and confessed to my ex-gf. She called me a freak and a perv, deleted/blocked me everywhere, and dropped all contact. The thing is, I feel really bad and have always been trying to change this inhuman fetish, but it is really so difficult...I tried cutting myself each time I thought of this fetish, but it doesn't work. To be sexually abnornal which almost no girl will accept, I sometimes think I'm better off dead.

I am a sad medical student who recently broke up with my girlfriend of 1 year.
I have never felt this way before and although I was the one who initiated the break up due to a whole array of reasons, I still miss her.
She told me that we are not able to get back together anytime soon...

Prior to this, my studies were adversely affected because I was unable to handle the emotional impact she has on me. I failed and I felt that the world came crushing down on me.

I have no financial problem, no issue with life (in Family + material sense)... now that I lost what matters to me both emotionally and academically... I think i'm totally defeated.

I am slowly picking myself up again to move on but...

What should I do?
Should I still cling on thinking about our expired love? :(

I have snatched away my best bro's girlfriend. I know this friendship is over and he will see me as an enemy from now on wards. But love is selfish, who can give the girl happiness deserves to be with her.

I have always try to get in touch with everyone in my orientation groups and part time jobs but after a few months of going out and chatting with them, everyone seems to be drifting apart. I have also lost touch with my secondary school, jc and army friends but I still continue to meet new friends in my workplace and my project work. Is it true that friends come and go throughout our life?

The more time I spend alone the more my OCD intensifies.
It's like when you're by yourself alot and have nothing much to occupy your time/mind with you start to nitpick on different habits or traits. For me my biggest archilles heel is when things are not symmetrical, it drives me crazy! 
Even simple things like when I'm carrying my backpack I always want to ensure that both shoulder straps are adjusted to the exact same length because the thought of it looking slanted (even just slightly) from the back irks me to no end. 
My OCD will kill me one day for sure.

I really need some advises on how to get a girlfriend.

Last time I thought of becoming friend with the girls first. After I know them better, then I confess that I like them.

The problem is that girls always think that you want more than just friendship.

Whenever I tried to ask for their number, they will think I wanted more than friendship. 

Even if I am merely chatting with them, They will also assume that I want more than friendship.

For example, if I think that they are wearing a  nnice shirt, I will tell them about it as I am merely telling them how I honestly feel. Once again, they will think that I like them.

What should I do then?

With camps ending and camps happening

Is anyone interested in the idea of a 'camp' for introverts? Granted, a number of introverts go to the current camps as do have fun and make friends, but there will be many who choose not to go/have a bad experience.

Even in the current camps, there will be chit-chat sharing sessions in after/in-between games, but I was wondering if people would be interested in a more 'low-key' orientation 'camp'. It probably wouldn't last as long everyday, and would be more of a long discussion with maybe board/card games rather than the high adrenaline kind which I feel that not everyone would particularly enjoy it. 

It allows people who tend to be less outgoing to be able to 'play' at their level. After all, we talk about being "our best selves" right. It can be difficult for people (me included) to be at our bests when meeting new people. I have the 'dao' look 95% of the time and I only drop it when I'm engaged in my 'level' ie not at those kind of games.

With the recent decision in the USA that gays are entitled to marriage rights by the constitution, and the ongoing debate over being able to express one's own identity and being able to love who they want, I feel this is an apt time for my story.

I am a girl who fell in love with another girl 2 years ago. I first met her in my club activity, where she was handing out flyers to freshies asking them to join. This was a performing arts club and besides singing and dancing, which she was very good at, she was also in charge of costumes for the club's activities. She spent lots of time working on making the club a success and I fell in love with her diligence and dedication, while at the same time having a cute and engaging personality that charmed me to no end. During some weekends she even worked at a cafe but was too shy to let people know this, and almost tried to run away when I happened to chance upon her working. Even when she became part of the student council, she continued working hard for the club. When she made a mistake over another club's submission in the annual budget meeting, she was distraught and it tore my heart apart to see her like that. Despite this, her mistake only made her more human to me and made me want to care more for her and help her out. Through these past 2 years I have supported her and hoped that one day, I might be able to get together with her. However, hindered by the shackles of what society deems to be moral or acceptable, I have been unable to proclaim my love to the world, to make her accept my love, and for me to see any future with her. Because of this, I have kept my feelings a secret, although I am sure she knows how I feel and does not want to respond knowing the circumstances it will place us in. When I heard about what the SCOTUS decided, my heart leapt with joy. Maybe now, a future where one can marry whoever they want will arrive, and I will be able to be with my true love.

P.S. I'm in love with an anime character.

I'm enrolling this year and never felt the need to attend any sort of orientation camp/activity. Being an introvert, I've attended several compulsory orientation activities from secondary school and JC, only to find myself not enjoying them because I was forced to play silly games and do silly, embarassing things in the spirit of bonding. But the sense of camaradarie that orientation was supposed to inculcate turned out to be skin-deep. Instead, cliques start to form. The shy ones, being outshone by their more outgoing and good-looking counterparts, become more insecure. Everyone knows a bit about one another but not a lot, in fact just enough for judgements to be passed and gossips to thrive.

My point is, as an introvert I've had enough of orientation activities. Recently I've read plenty of posts from people like me who took part in the recent orientation camps/activities by choice, only to find themselves blending into the crowd, not enjoying themselves, or becoming sufferers of camp politics. Allow me to advise these people to rethink the purpose of attending orientation, and if it offers too little returns for the shit you're going through, it's okay to leave the camp, go back home, have a shower and snuggle in bed with a good book. Introverts do need time to recharge, and 3, 4 days of non-stop socialising will obviously take a huge mental toll on us. It is perfectly fine to take a break, or to avoid these extra social activities altogether.

Personally I think making acquaintances is overrated, would rather have a few close friends than a vast network of acquaintances whom I exchange fleeting hi's and bye's with, and who only contact me when they need me and vice versa. It is also okay to lag behind in assimilating to Uni life. We will all catch up eventually, no need to be kancheong. It is perfectly fine to go through Uni as a loner. It is true that the outgoing, vocal ones are highly influential, but there's no need to give in to societal pressures. Just be comfortable with who you are. You can be self-sufficient. While love is a wonderful thing, there is no need to actively search for your other half too. Personally I prefer leaving love to fate, and if I'm fated to be evergreen, I accept the freedom of my singlehood with open arms.

TLDR; If you're struggling through orientation activities, there is no need to keep yourself there for the sake of marginal returns. Look at the bigger picture, consider keeping your happiness and sanity intact. Things will still work out fine without attending these activities.

Do you believed in love at first sight? I certainly don't as it takes more time to understand a person. So how about love at second sight? or third? or so forth?

For me, it took a few "encounters" before I fell in a love with my girlfriend. What's interesting was that we volunteered together in NVAC for a few sessions and nothing quite happened during those times. But when I randomly asked her out, outside of school and I first saw her without specs followed by a few interactions, gosh.. it felt so different. I even messaged my friends, telling them she was as pretty as a goddess. 

We are together more than a year now and yet we never fail to talk about our past times, what we did in this place, special moments etc. 

She is currently in overseas for exchange and I really miss her company. I want her to be back to my side asap and continue to build more memories together. 

I hope to post something positive so that everyone can share their romantic journey as well. 

Stay happy!

Freshie confession.
I have been to 2 orientation camps as of now; my fac's FOC and course camp. I am slightly introverted in nature but when I am close to the people around me, I can be pretty outgoing and vocal. 

I signed up for camps not wanting to miss out the fun of meeting new people,have a first glimpse of university life and not wanting to be lonely when school starts. 

Camps weren't too bad, I did made some friends and OGLs were friendly but honestly... I feel that I TRIED SO HARD to fit in. 

For my course camp, the more outgoing and vocal ones basically took charge of all the games and led the group in everything. But I had a really bad time that I was literally counting down to going home. There was this girl who is really nasty to me; during a game she just shoved me aside because the had enough people/told my OGL to pick another person for a role because(I quote her) 'Pick someone who talks more' etc. All because I play a passive role and is quiet most of the time. Half of the time I just feel very left out. When I say something, they don't listen and once that nasty girl used my idea as hers and everyone thought it was good. 

I did make efforts to make small talks with the girls in my OG(like talk about FOC/jc life etc) but somehow they don't really make the effort to really continue the convo(they rarely initiate to ask me anything) and me being slightly introverted and quiet, I usually listen to their convo and fade away or sometimes comment. However when they talk amongst themselves together, I feel like we do have similar interests and can possibly be rather good friends. 

Don't get me wrong,I mean the majority of them are nice people and we could talk but I don't foresee making much close friends. 

Now I am feeling quite helpless about my social life in university.I am thinking of joining a CCA to meet people outside of my fac but have no idea what to. I know I shouldn't change myself to suit others but this has been bothering me.

Just asking, i met this guy that says that he is interested in me but he doesn't like me enough. But his actions doesn't show that he is interested in me in either way. E.g. He doesn't really reply my texts, he does not initiate conversations, he doesn't ask things about me it's like he doesn't care. Is there a situation where a guy likes the girl but still does all these stuff? Pretty hard to understand for me hahaha.

Commencement is just around the corner. It is a day of celebration for the 4 yrs we spend to become a “bachelor of something in somewhat”. It is of great significance, as we put a closure to this life stage. I have watched you grown from someone who is totally obedient to your mum to someone who enjoys drinking behind her back. From the 19+ year old girl to the going-to-be-23 year old adult.

Let me recap a short summary of our love story. I met you in the middle of year 1 sem 2.. Some day in March during one of the interest group activity. After 2-3 months of knowing each other and spending time with common friends, we got a little bit more serious and courtship started. Then we both went for summer school, two different places with a slightly different time zones. They say distance makes the heart fonder. I guess that was true. Then came year 2 sem 1 where we got together, and also started spending lots of time with each other. I loved your laughter. I loved having breakfast/dinner with you everyday. We also took part in many activities together and organised an event together. Many couples celebrated birthday between themselves. But i know u are well-loved by your friends, and so I made sure that your birthday is celebrated with as many of them as possible. Even so, during our exchange together. 

Yes, we were fortunate that we could go to the same exchange universities together. We made things happen together. Lovebytes, our blog, our Facebook secret group, overseas trip, your fyp and my fyp.. We've been through many things together, stress, loss of matric card, your injury, my injuries and being there for each of us.. Throughout the journey, nothing seems to be impossible.. You gave me strength, you were my destination. As long as you are with me, it doesn’t matter where this journey leads us to. 

There are so many things we want to do together too.. or rather I want to do with you.. starting your own etsy store, renting a villa overseas, snorkelling, adventure cove, getting our first home and so many places to go together…Some people says, relationship is either break up or marriage. I think the longer the relationship is, the more pressing this question becomes...

This june, after your overseas trip.. U told me we are not compatible. I questioned myself so many times.. really? I thought of how many happy times we are together… with our friends, our families, or just our own. enjoying the long stroll, the cycle, watching shows together, slacking, playing photo hunt, playing mobile games and so much more… If we were not an item, we would be best friends…best friends by my definition… And yet, i tried to counter argue or convince you that things would be better for us after ur overseas trip… U would not listen… my emotional words just added on to your emotional turmoil… and mine cascaded too… Love shouldn’t be like a battlefield… 

Relationship has its ups and downs.. it is about growing together… The shared memories we have together, good or bad are ours.. And… in my darkest year of my academic life… u were there for me… you are the reason why i survived… and yet that took a toil on you.. And you decided to give up on us… Now… u are moving on to the next stage of your life while I am extending my candidature.. I got ejected out of your life.

I can think of many many reasons of what leads towards the breakup and many factors that helped u make the decision.. But I just keep telling myself, all that doesn’t matter now because u don’t love me anymore.. And.. all that matters is u don’t love me anymore... no love me anymore.

It’s been 1 month plus since you wanted the break up… The pain in me subsided… though my health is not exactly good now…  Everyday, I wake up missing you .. It’s like, Jaime Lannister losing his arm. The worst pain is over, and the pain felt like a dream.. Yet, I woke up like a crippled, a big part of life missing. I still cry from time to time… The weak side that my friends would never see. Some people move on faster than the other.. Me.. I know I will have a hard time moving on.. Take it as a respect I have for our relationship… U won’t see me in another r.s for a long time to come...

If you ask me, I already can’t remember any part of NUS without you. 

I am missing out on your commencement, the celebration of your NUS life, the growth you went through and the closure to a stage in life and you are moving on. I can’t be with you.. As much as I want to.. I can’t.. I am not supposed to love you or pester you any more.. I need to let you go.. You are the rainbow that I can never have.

Happy commencement.
- Your Whale

Male freshie here. I have a crush on one of the fake freshies from camp. His words to me are always laced with double entendres. There was some physical contact from him under the pretence of a joke. I believe we share a similar sense of humour, hence he is comfortable with cracking subtle jokes with me. Or, is this a sign that the interest is mutual? I'm not sure how to go about asking him out, is he waiting for me to make a move? Not sure how to chat him up in the future since he is graduating soon.

I recently felt that I drifted apart from my bf of 1 year. And it so happened that, another guy came to me and confessed that he liked me since 3 months ago and he had been quietly helping me out because he liked me. He explained that he didn't want to break up my existing relationship at first but then he grew more and more attached me. I admit that I do like him too and if I wasn't attached, I would have accepted him immediately. 

One fine night, I have no idea what gt into me. We were working on our proposal and... we started making out. Now I'm neither here nor there. 

I'm such a screwed up person

For those of you who saw the girl of your dreams and are willing to go all the way to pursue her, it's always good to slow down in case you turn her off.

In freshman year there was this really cute girl in this engineering mod I was taking, and because there's not a lot of girls in engineering in the first place, a lot of other guys were trying to go after her too. I think she announced that she wasn't looking for a relationship, but 4 other guys were still really persistent. Of course, I got anxious because of all the competition, so I didn't stop either.

Eventually, I think she got tired of our antics, and told us to each get her a different item of her choosing to show our sincerity. I was told to get her an asbestos suit (I have no idea why she'll want one), so I bought one online. Thinking I'm the only guy who would actually be willing to spend time and effort getting her what she wanted, I approached her after lab a week later only to find 2 of the other guys already in front of me. The first guy was told to get her some kind of bowl, but she said the one he gave her was a fake, so she rejected her. The other guy was supposed to get her this limited edition jewelry, but turns out he made a copy himself instead of getting the real one, so he got rejected too. I mean, like, okay he's a rival yes, but I feel kind of bad for him too, all that blood and sweat but getting rejected like that.

Then she got to me. I handed her the suit, and she used the bunsen burner to test it. It caught on fire, and luckily we managed to put it out before the fire alarm went off and the rest of the building knows about it. So it turns out I bought a fake suit off Taobao. Needless to say I got rejected as well.

Eventually I think she switched out, because we never saw her in class again. Sometimes I will think all the "what if"s, like what if my luck with online shopping wasn't so bad, or what if I wasn't so persistent and annoying back then.

Kaguya, if you are reading this, please forgive me for being so insensitive back then. Hope you're doing well

Hi! I would just like to share that I think family is much more important than work/studies. I kinda hate people who judge and told me that im ignorant when I said that. I feel spending time with family during these 3 months holiday is important. More important than internship and doing some work just to add those experience in your resume. Well im not saying intership and work are not important. I just want people to understand that different people have different priorities and i want people to understand that and stop judging and telling others point of view is wrong and theirs always right. If i can understand and accept your opinions, why can't some people do?

I met this really nice girl in camp last year. I was one of the committee members and I noticed her from the beginning of the camp. Did try to interact with her but due to lack of manpower, I had to settle some camp stuff. Anyways, the camp ended and i didnt get her number. 

Few weeks back, I saw her having lunch with her friends. We did exchange glances but not sure if she remembers me. I went home I decided to add her on Facebook. Now I'm unsure if I should chat her up. Any advise?

To , Was in the same situation, with 2.3k/mth, all the quarrel at home plus dad who is ill (high blood, high cholesterol, diabetes).
Took some burden off by not taking allowance - taking on tuition assignments, and if you had saved enough from army, you can possibly do less. Also, having a group of understanding friends who doesnt force me to spend more than I could really helped.
After graduation I worked really hard and finished paying off my loan within 2 years. Paying $1k/month was no joke either, but I survived.

Of course, I envy my friends who can spend $500 without batting an eyelid and travel to far and expensive places back then. But now looking back, I am glad for this experience. I am spending and travelling now, but saving alot more since my experience had "trained" me to be conscious of how I am doing the spending. And now I am much better at saving than most of my friends.i

As someone who also passed this phase, I want to tell you that there would be many times you feel like giving up. Uni fees and expenditure is a whole different level from JC, and juggling part time + studies is really bad. Make sure you have "me-time" to keep your sanity, make some supportive friends and also learn to become understanding towards others.

It would also be hard for your friends to understand at first - Dont expect people to simply understand what they had never experienced and what you never explained. 
They might say that you are skipping outings because you dont care about them, and yes, it would be really hurtful. If you want true friends, you need to open up and explain your situation to them first. If they choose a cheaper restaurant so that you can join, be thankful and go along, show them that you appreciate what they are doing. 
Dont expect them to always compromise too - they might still want to try their expensive cafe.

I can't believe it when I see post saying that bf physically abused his gf. I always thought that in this era, guys are more respectful of women. Thus it disgust me that there are still some guys out there who think he can physically/verbally abuse his gf any time he like. Worse, there are girls who chose to tolerate this abuse, hoping that he would change for the better when in fact, this never happen. My mom said that girls in general mostly "can't let go" and repeatedly give chance to the guy despite him not changing for the better. I thought so too, judging from news whereby if the husband cheats, the wife forgive but it's the other way round, we seldom hear husbands forgiving wives who cheated. 

Is it indeed true that girls in general more often "can't let go", compared to guys, especially when it comes to love? Why is it usually girls who can forgive horrible mistakes (eg abuse, cheating) that their bf made repeatedly rather than the other way round?
-
 
To the girl who always tried to talk to me and be friendly with me I could not express how thankful I was. I am never good with expressing myself but I just wanted you to know that I do know that you are interested in me. I really like you too but it appears that we are of completely different personalities.

I get all the hints that you are giving me but I really do not know what to say to you because I am really shy around you. You are so outgoing and are always surrounded by all the alpha males and that makes it incredibly difficult for me to know you more as a person. Even when we are finally alone, I could not talk to you because I felt so awkward:(

It pains me that all the other guys are able to make you laugh but not me. You said I was too honest but I really cannot sweettalk and  much less give witty comebacks to make you laugh. I sincerely hope that I was more outgoing and more alpha. And for all the times I did not go for outings or disappear halfway, I am really sorry because I know I will feel incredibly terrible if I were to stay. 

Please do not give up on me. I promise once the barrier between us is broken you will get to understand my humor and a different me. I am really really trying to open myself.

-Dude who is trying to come to acceptance with his own personality
-If any gals are facing the same situation, please do not give up on us:(

 I'm 21 this year and the thought of finding a life partner seems as unlikely as the chance of Singapore becoming a truly accepting state in my lifetime.

Being a realist and a somewhat pessimist, I've come to the conclusion that if I stick with the status quo, I'd probably die in an apartment too large for the occupancy of one person. I hate loud noisy places and have not been to a club before, and don't intend to. 

I'm not advising you to harden your heart like me. I'm a coward. But, I find that people who open their hearts to others are extremely courageous and somewhat admirable.

What I'm trying to say is that you should always look forward, but learn from yesterday. I believe you have it in you to make the right decisions when the time calls for it.

I'm probably the last person in the world that should put out this sort of advice, so do take it with copious amounts of salt.

The best of luck with life!

P.S. If you think about your exact situation in the gay guy's version, I'd like to think that we'd face pretty much the same thing. You're not alone :)
-
 
I sense that something is missing in Singapore compare to the 15 years ago. No matter how modernized the city looks today, something is lost. Those who have not lived here for more than 20 years will never get it.
-
 
A girl in my cohort caught my eye. However, I always feel like she is out of my league. She is very smart and well to do, yet not proud, and above average in terms of looks. However, given her family background, I am not sure if they would accept someone like me as I believe I am unable to match up to her in the above mentioned aspects.  Just curious, to girls out there, what do you think of guys who might not 'match up' to you? Is it important for family background to be similar? Any guys managed to overcome such barriers successfully?

 Another common thing that happens on overseas trips are new relationships that are built or lost (depending) during the trip. I was very close to a guy on an immersion trip. Shortly after, his girlfriend broke up with him because she met someone new on her SEP. I wanted to tell him I like him and would like to date him but he was totally down at that time. I could only encourage him. Then, he went on a SEP the following semester and supposedly found a new 'girl of his dreams' and even claimed he wants to marry her (she's from the country of his SEP). I was totally devastated but I couldn't do anything except to congratulate him. So, summer trips and SEPs will be bound to send you a hell of a ride down the emotional rollercoaster.

Recently, many focuses have turned to Starbuck. I think there is another kind of persons who go to Starbuck:  they feel their lives quality and taste are improved just because they spend more than usual.  They love the sense of spending, feeling high class than his past live.

To the OP of  

I am the OP of . Well, my bf and i are on a break now. It's complicated as we had been tgt since uni (yes i graduated) and i still care for him. Though i dunno if it is love anymore. 

Regarding the new guy. Well, mine is almost as bad as he also have a hse though he is settling that now. But i told him about my break and he is nonchalant. So while i am still crying alot over him, and drinking, i have decided to try and forget him. And i think you should too. They are just bringing us nothing but sadness. And for u, find someone new. Your bf don't sound great too (sorry to be blunt). As for me, my bf is a great person and i guess i will try to make it work.
-
 
I am op of . Can u all share how to order a Starbucks, and what to order?

Not that I wanna start this lifestyle but sometimes might need socialize. This can help reduce awkwardness.

I'm LOL at my noobnest as I type.  不耻下问。

So I just graduated, and am missing undergraduate life already. However, one thing that I have learnt from NUS is that female friendships are usually superficial, but male friends last -almost- forever. Cheers to all my bros out there :)

I just recently attended an orientation camp and I have a crush on this fellow girl who turned out to be the fake freshie. I really want to get to know her better but its always a little awkward when its a senior junior kind of thing. Any advice on how to court her? 
-
 
To the OP of  what do you mean by "(they) want (your) life to be in hell"? Are you relinquishing control of your life and how you feel about your life to someone else? If this is another love war post, be mature and ask the other party outright (Option A) "eh what's happenning now?" or "are we, or are we not?" If you're too nervous to do that and/or too impatient to wait the scenario out (Option B) why not try Option C: leave anyway and free your mind, fill it with other things, fill your time with other thoughts. There's no need to "turn a cold face" but be firm and guard your heart. Sincerely, a person who thinks they've gone through a similar situation

I don't get how girls will swarm over a guy with a hunky bod and cheap childish humor over a mature gentleman with manners and fine taste. Simply put, I got outshone by my best friend. Perhaps they are girls, not ladies yet. 
-
 
I can relate well to post  as i am just like you. Worse, the females i normally had crush on are usually more lady-like, not the tom boy kind. So i have an even harder time trying to identify if they are femme. Seems like its really going to be tough for us to look for the lady that is the one for us, considering that even if they are lesbian, they are not going to show it for the fear of being judged in a relatively conservative society like ours. Maybe when i am older i will resort to frequenting some lesbian clubs (probably overseas as i don't think there's one in singapore) to increase my chances of finding the one.

Since everyone is sharing their life stories, I thought I'd share mine. This is something not many of my friends know, probably only my boyfriend and my clique in JC. My family (consisting of myself, 2 brothers and my parents) were involved in a car crash while driving up to Malaysia. By some stroke of luck, I survived while the rest of my family did not. (it was also due to the fact that I was sitting in the last row of our 7 seater car). For a very long time I wanted to die as well, since I had lost basically everything that mattered to me.

This happened during my JC2 year and I was deep in depression, while still maintaining an outer facade of happy faces to my teachers and schoolmates. I only ever break down at home. It was a miracle that I managed to get into FASS here in NUS. 

After As, while most of my peers were drinking/clubbing/working, I was emptying out my house that was still filled with my family's things - clothes, books, day to day items, because I was moving to stay with my grandmother in Upper Thompson. I sincerely wish that none of you will ever have to face this alone. It took afew months but I finally settled in around July last year, just in time for school so I did not have the opportunity to join any camps whatsoever.

I'm not poor as compared to all the stories that are shared here, as my parents had prepared for such an occurrence in their will and I am forever grateful to them for that. However, I do not splurge either and think twice about things like starbucks that may seem like a normal good to some but a luxury good to me. 

It's not easy having to partition money to endure that I have enough money for the rest of my uni life as well as supporting my grandma should anything happen to her. So yes, to everyone living life on the "easy mode", please think twice before making a judgement on why people can't club/spend money on alcohol or even things you consider basic or a "given right" like camps and Starbucks.

Treasure your family. Don't wait till they're gone.

I'm feeling really pathetic right now. I've fallen for this girl I met over at my internship, but can only watch as I am outshone (socially in particular - i'm actually stronger technically) by my fellow intern. I'm socially anxious, and this is the hardest I've ever tried to vie for anyone's attention, to get noticed beyond being just a friend. But at the moment I'm just watching as they get closer and closer, I am always just... a friend. Always... the option. It's unbearably frustrating, kind of like grasping really hard at air.
Does anyone have advice for what I could do?
-
 
At this point, I don't know whether you are still having feelings for me or you really want my life to be in hell. It has been over a year and really I don't want to think about you anymore. So don't be surprised if I turn a cold face to you
-
 
Sometimes I feel like the culture in NUS is too heteronormative. As in you commonly only hear about straight couples and people generally pair you with the opposite gender. Maybe it's just me being oblivious because I don't really notice very many lgbt people in NUS. I'm a girl and every time I feel attracted to another girl I don't act on it because I assume she's straight given how straight most people seem. I've always tried to guess whether a girl could possibly be gay/bi or if she'd be open to trying something but i don't want to weird anybody out. So how will I know if she'll be in to me?
-
 
Regarding , assuming two competing people have similar CAP and CCA positions,  i was just wondering if being a pretty girl really does give you a way higher chance of securing a job? Like people subconciously just select the good looking one without knowing it? Or to be more precise, it's not so much on being good looking, but rather being presentable (referring to wearing nice clothes and make-up)? Also i believe even if you are very good looking, if you can't speak well (eg get nervous easily), its not going to make you get past your interview anyway? 

-
 
My problem is opposite of others.

While others doesn't have the gut to confess to their crush that he like her, my problem is the opposite.

Everytime I chat with a girl, she will assume that I like her.
-
 
I knew this girl since I was secondary school through a CCA, and eventually we ended up in the same class due to sec 3 streaming. I really love her company, and sometimes I get jealous when she's talking so happily with other friends, because I wanted her to that happy with me. Fast forward 6 six years later now, we're still good friends, but it hurts that she found other friends and that she supports them more than she supports me. Now that I put everything down in words, I daresay that I'm on the edge on being obsessed with her (within reason though, I'm not going to stalk or what lah).
Plot twist? I'm also a girl.
-
 
I am attracted to someone and the person develops some feelings for me too. Anyway, I am going to be a yr 4 student soon and I try my best to maintain a good CAP so that I can further my study probably overseas and it will be another 4-5 years for a PhD. If you were me, would you move into a relationship with that someone provided that you two have been together for quite a long time? Does a long distance relationship really work? Thinking about all these actually hurts sometimes...Thanks for reading
-
 
I recently met this girl and I think i like her. But she is giving me hints that she is a lesbian but she has not confronted me yet. She understood the fact that I like her and told me that we must only remain friends. Now she is kinda ignoring me.  I want the friendship to continue. What shall i do?
-
 
To the OP of , I am in a similar situation as you, but it's really much more tricky for me...

I'm also in a long term relationship (6+ years too). We drifted apart since last year because of issues with his ex, and other factors (gaming, work, escorts etc) Yes, I allowed him to visit escorts, I don't know for what reasons. But I guess many would think that this relationship a screwed up one, if you even managed to read till this point. 

So anyway, during this period of time, I met another guy. We got really close too, and he was the first to confess to me, and he said that he liked me. At this point of time, I was just starting to fall for him. I knew he had a gf and they already had a BTO flat under construction, but they were not on good terms...

But we got together anyway, we were each others' "part-time gf/bf". But it wasn't the case, we talked everyday on the phone for more than 2 hours, usually till 2-3am. We would meet almost 4-5 times a week till late night (not hanky-panky activities, that didn't happen very frequently). We told each other things that not even our close friends and partners knew, we had our own inside secrets and jokes... Basically it felt like he was my real bf instead... I would hang out with his friends (his gf doesn't like them, she's much older than him). I felt much more comfortable around him only after a few months as compared to my bf of 6+ years.. 

Before I knew it, it was a full blown affair, both emotionally and physically. And before I could realise it, I was totally in love with him, and he told me he loved me too. We talked about replacing our gf/bf with each other, and returning the BTO deposit to his gf... I really contemplated breaking up with my own bf for him. 

One day, he asked me seriously if he should break up with her. I didn't know what got into me. In my heart I was furiously saying "yes of course you should", but I didn't want to act like the evil third party in the TV shoes, so I asked him to consider it carefully. And we didn't talk about it anymore. 

I REGRETTED IT. That was the biggest mistake of my life. 

A few months later, he told me that he was getting married at the end of this year. I asked him what happened to the promises that he made to me, and he replied that he did consider his choices after what I told him, and he chose her eventually as he didn't want to break his promise... 

I was devastated when i heard it. I still am. 

We are still together today, I can't let go, it's too painful. i fought to make him change his mind, I really tried... I know my time is limited with him so I'm cherishing what's left of the moments with him. And I don't know what to do. I am crying everyday because I miss him so much. 

It's impossible to turn back time, and I cannot find back the feelings that I had for my bf anymore. 

I'm stuck. 

I do not regret my decision because this past 1.5 year had been the happiest days of my life. But my darkest days are coming, once he leaves me to get married to her. 

If it is tl:dr for you, basically, I let 2 third parties come into my r/s with my bf (both his and mine), and I became a third party in someone else's relationship.  I'm very screwed up, I know. I don't have any advise for you because I think I need more advise than you. Just follow your heart and don't pretend to say something when you don't mean it. Your heart will know what you want and don't want. 

sigh.

Ever since my breakup one hear ago, I just can't seem to find a purpose in life any longer. Everything just doesn't seem to matter any longer. Some of my closer friends sensed my void but I pushed them away, telling them that I'm just carefree. I've tried to take my mind off by taking up activities and joining a club, earning quite a few good friends and achievements in the process. 

However when I look up into the vast dark sky, spotting the occasional blinking stars, I can't help but feel the sense of void that still exists, deep within my smiling front.

I met a girl recently through a mutual friend. We got along and started texting each other and stuff. After three dates and texting each other for 2 months+, we talked about getting together. And we came into a conclusion that we can't get together.

This is because she is a strong believer of Christ and I am a free thinker. Apparently there is this verse in the bible that states that Christians should not get together with non-believers. She was afraid that we would drift apart because I won't be able to fulfil her spiritual needs. Even her Christian parents and church leader said no. Hence we concluded that it might be better not to start a relationship that is likely to fall apart one day or another.

Despite me saying that I understood what she needs, a part of me just want to lash out at her. So she chooses to sin (ie doing something that goes against some verses) but she cannot go against that verse for me? Maybe she just doesn't like me enough...

And up till now, we still talk and go out. We are even talking about going for a jb trip together (which she initiated). Also, she is not the gold digger type. Always insisting to pay for her share of the meal/movie/USS trip together and she did.

So what do you guys think? Should I move on or patiently wait for the day that she will change her mind and consider getting together with me?
-
 

I feel your pain as well since my family lives on 2k a month only. The frustrating part is that it's really difficult to 1) confide in anyone about my financial status and 2) for anyone to understand that my habits are due to my near-broke situation.

Many seniors advise us freshies to enjoy ourselves and get to know more people through camps and social events, but little does anyone know how much thinking and stressing I go through each time before I sign up for a camp or social event. $80+ for O-Week may seem like crumbs to some, but $80+ can keep me going for 3 whole weeks if I will myself to. Of course many people would say that one cannot and should not compare money with the value of bonds forged through camps and social events, but in my situation isn't it fair for me to consider twice or even thrice before deciding to go? It's really demoralizing when people say that it's disgusting of me to measure everything in monetary terms, but given the choice, the family background and a greater degree of financial freedom, would I do that? Of course not.

To those out there who are playing life on "easy mode" right now, I just hope that you guys will be able to try and understand the mindset of people playing life on "hard mode" before labeling us as awkward, anti-social, "money-minded" freaks. We are here trying to do our best in the hope of breaking out from the poverty circle and such demeaning comments are of no help in alleviating our situation. If you could reach out to us, understand the difficulties we face, give us a pat on the back and say "well done, keep it up", you might just gain yourself a loyal confidant.

Thanks for reading my rant. Bye.

Sometimes I look at my CAP, and wonder if I can ever manage to pull it to a decent CAP of 3.5.

I'm a Year 2 and going Year 3 and my CAP currently stands at 3.38. It's not that I don't study hard or study smart. So far, I've never gotten a C+ or below, but the thing is that I've only gotten an A- so far and most of my other modules were B-.

I once asked my friend, would you rather get a range of As, Bs and Cs or would you rather get just a range of Bs (B+, B, B-). My friend didn't give me a definite reply. Sometimes I feel so small around my friends who are smarter than me, and because I feel so ashamed of my lousy CAP, whenever I'm asked my CAP, I lied saying "It's within the Second Lower Class Honours range".

I don't even know if I will get there. I'm not even aiming for an impossible, like First Class (because I know my abilities). This lousy CAP of mine would probably haunt me until the day I achieve my goal of 3.5. Will I even get there? A train of "What Ifs" ensues as well, What if because of my CAP I couldn't get an internship? And what if I don't get a job in future :( My future seems so bleak.

Guy A and I used to be project mates for a module, hence I knew him and we would say "Hi" if we see each other around in school. Last semester, I found out that he was going to the same summer school programme as me. Hence I was quite happy because this means there's one more person I know going for summer school. 

When summer school started, I didn't talk to him or hang out much with him because I always hang around with the group of friends I signed up summer school with. Somehow Guy A and I started talking more to each other after being put into the same project group. Each time after project, we would have meals together and chill, sometimes with our other friends as well. My other friends thought that we would make a good couple because whenever me and him made conversations with each other, it's always as if we were a married couple, bickering at each other. He would even play along, calling me "Dear..". Initially I found it gross, although it was meant to be a joke, but as time passed, I found myself liking it whenever he does that. And I'm not sure when, but gradually, I found myself liking him.

Time and time again I would catch myself waiting for him to pass by, hoping that he would come and talk to me, etc. Then one day we had nothing to do after school so, me, wanting to find out more about him, I said "Hey why not let's have some proper, deep conversations. You tell me things that I don't know about you and I will tell you things you don't know about me." He found it interesting so he agreed to my request. After sharing 3 things about each other, when it was his turn again, he suddenly said "I like a girl who came for this summer school." 

At that moment when I heard it, I did wonder if it was me (deep inside, I was hoping it was me), but then I doubted so. Even though he played along with the "married couple" joke, I doubted so. I tried to guess who's the girl he liked. He did give me clues on who the girl was, and he even teased me, saying "What if it's you?" 

Well, I am a girl who always feel that guys wouldn't like me, simply because there are tons of girls who are better and that all these guys deserve better. Even though deep down I wished what he said is the truth, I rolled my eyes and said "Please..." and continued guessing who was the girl he like. When I mentioned Girl Y's name, he immediately went "Was it obvious?". Upon hearing that, I wasn't sure what to feel. But one thing for sure, a part of me shattered. I never knew he was actually trying to chase Girl Y - because I don't see them hanging out together often. 

Ever since that conversation, I wondered if what he said was true - that he actually liked Girl Y. I soon realised how if the both of them walked together, he would at times, stop to match her pace (he didn't do that when he was with me or other people); and there was once he even sent her back to her dormitory after school. Upon knowing all these I was a little upset. A part of me wondered if I should stop crushing on him, the other part of me wondered if I should prove to him that I am the one for him. I had the latter thought because there was once, a guy friend of ours asked him if he would consider me as his gf and he said "Yeah, why not". My other friends also told me that they doubted Girl Y actually likes him because he wasn't her type. 

Now, despite summer school's over for me, all the times spent together, the memories never stop flooding back to me. Sometimes when I think about the conversations we had with each other, I thought that we would really make a good couple and hence wish that we could get together. What my friends told me are making me feel that I might stand a chance. But I don't know how he feels about me, if he ever thinks about all these things like I do. I'm not even sure if he's going to continue his endeavour of chasing Girl Y; if Girl Y will eventually like him; and if she doesn't, will he move on. I don't think I will know any time soon

Re 

Hi guys, thanks for giving me advice on what to do. But one thing is that, after summer school, the people who attended the program would meet up to catch up with one another. I went for the first meet up, thinking that I would see him around but he didn't turn up. Girl Y initially said she would turn up but she didn't (I'm not sure if Guy A chose not to go because of this or what). From what my friend told me, Guy A said that Girl Y was sick so she couldn't come. This made me realise how he did try to keep in contact with her after summer school. Another funny thing is, I never knew that friend of mine talks to Guy A privately on whatsapp. This is where things get complicated because Idk why he seems to keep in contact with a lot of people privately but none of them is me? In addition during thay meet up, he asked my friend to take candid pictures of me (I have no idea why??) and then when my friend sent the picture to him, he went "Wah Chio". (Tbh I dont't know if he's joking or..) 

He's giving out mixed signals. I'm not sure if I should really confess

I felt like the hot and dry weather nowadays is making me sick...this time is the 6th time this year i got a dry uncomfotable throat followed by severe congested nose. All these may appear like cold symptoms but then again i don't think a cold occur on almost a monthly basis. Furthermore i had been exercising more, rest more and drink more water this year compared  to any other years so i don't see any reason why i should be having these problems so often this year.

I am beginning to suspect the poor air quality and hot, dry weathernowadays is causing these problems so was wondering, this year is there anyone else who also seems to be falling sick more often (dry throat, congested or runny nose)?

A year ago, i met my sp but our 5min blindfolded convo was so awkward (with a lot of silence and needed much prodding by seniors) and we didnt have much in common to speak about. What's more, we talked about religion and both of our religion are kind of conflicting... So naturally things were awkward and we didnt contact each other after camp, only followed each other on insta... But dayum he's actually quite hot and a good catch... :/ sigh if only... 
-
 
 I really hope that I can meet out with him but I am shy about it. If I follow him on IG, both of us will feel awkward -.-This Sunday there is Sundown and I am very sure that he will be running but I am not sure which distance he is running and even if I know, how can I find him :( I am running 21km so I wish that I can see him somewhere. 

Ps: I will be waiting at the finishing line for you...

I really like this girl from Rv whom I don't know personally. She's like one of the cutest girls I've ever seen in my life. I've gotten her number from my friend, who is acquainted with her but not very close to her, so it'd be impossible for him to help us set up a meeting. I'm so vexed. What should I do? :/

People always say you have to choose between social life and CAP (and also sleep). 
Well I'm starting my final year in Aug. My CAP is below 4. I joined 2 sports, one of which I've played since JC, but wasn't good enough to get into IVP. I have very few friends - majority male - and due to this tiny social circle obviously I'm single. Not evergreen though but been single since 2011...so maybe 'evergreen' in the context of uni life lol. Not to mention I'm perpetually tired.
So basically my point is, I have mastered the art of balancing those 'pillars' of uni life: fucking it all up equally spectacularly. I guess my greatest fear is that I'll graduate as a painfully average phantom, and just fade away into the world.

To  one of the commenters wrote "You should get drunk and see whether you would have sex with someone. Most people use it as excuse, really. You try it, you will know~" 

I've only gotten drunk a few times, and in my most drunken state, apparently I just walked out of the club, took a cab home and went to bed. I have no idea how that happened. Mind you, I was actually intending to hook up with someone if possible, but...I went home. Very lame, that's why post anonymously instead of commenting.

So it's true I guess? Alcohol is an amplifier. I really admire you for wanting to give your bf another chance, but I hope it's really because you believe in him, and not because you fear missing him if you break up! Hope you are not wasting your time. Good luck OP!

Evergreen noob relationship question here -- how does a guy know when he needs to exhibit persistence and determination, and when he needs to stop doing things that the girl would perceive as annoying, when things aren't going that smoothly in his attempts to chase a girl? Am asking because apparently there is this female behavior called 'playing hard to get' which seems to suggest that persistence is required, but on the other hand the guy also doesn't want to be a persistent annoyance.

I am one of the so-called 'intelligent high CAP' students. Many people come to me before exams to ask doubts, questions, past year papers solutions etc. but as soon as the exams are over I am totally forgotten. The friends who contacted me several times a day don't any take efforts to keep in touch with me and even if I initiate, they don't seem interested. I feel cheated and betrayed, as if my only value is my knowledge. I don't like being the first one to initiate conversations and get-togethers everytime. It makes me feel needy and desperate, and the worst part is that I appear cheerful on the outside so no one believes I am lonely.

I m a girl in a long term rs (6 years plus). However a few mths back, when me n my bf started to drift apart, i started to get close to this guy. He also confessed that he had feelings for me. But recently, he is getting distant though smtimes out of the blue he will text me sm stuff saying that he is sorry for hurting me. I tried to ask him now if he had any feelings for me now but he will just ignore my qns n say not to worry. I had contemplated breaking up w my bf over him but now i m just feeling confused over his hot and cold (smtimes we can still text for hrs and yet at times he treat me like a stranger) what should i do?

 What about from a girl's perspective? How do you know if the guy is considering the "outing" as a date?

My boyfriend (of 1 month) two-timed me. 

Initially, He has been leading both me and the other girl on. When he was very pre-occupied with his phone, I confronted him and he clarified that she was only ranting about her boyfriend and work stuff. I let things go. There was once, i accidentally saw their messages, i saw hearts and loves. I convinced myself it must be nothing. I chose to believe what he said.

We shared the same hobbies, likings and interest. We went for a few dates and i fell for him. Then later, he asked me to be his girlfriend and i agreed. Of course, i mind the girl. I tried to ask if he kept in contact with her. He changed the topic. I assumed that since he wanted a relationship with me, he would have stopped seeing her.

After 1 month together, he has always been very commited to me. I felt very loved and fell so deeply for him. I forgot about her until last sunday when i surprised him at his place, i saw his wadsapp and found out that they are still sweet-talking to each other.

He explained that he was trying to let her go slowly after we got together. And because he had never tried dumping people before, it's hard for him. Hence, i asked him how much time he needs to clear things up with her. He said he doesnt know. 

What should i do? Should i wait? Should i just give up on him? Since he can't be honest, should i trust him with my feelings? How should i gauge to see if he's worth my time and feelings? Should i continue to believe he will come back to me?
-
 
Picking up those little signs you showed me through your messages and social media updates, I felt that you were clearly hurt by my confrontation. I was not thinking rationally when I brought up those issues. I was too blunt and outright with my speech that made you upset. I am truly sorry for the things I said to you the day before.  If you are reading this, can you forgive me?

There are so many apps out there (and even websites/facebook groups) that caters to singles looking for partners.

But what about people looking for friends of the same gender? (same gender because I'm attached, and I don't want my boyfriend to get the wrong idea) But yeah, I feel like getting know more people out there, beyond just superficial acquaintances in school/cca. Anybody feeling the same? :S

(I know it takes time and effort to build up a friendship. But it would be good to have somewhere to start :D)

Couples who have been together for a long time.. What makes a relationship successful? 
When a couple first gets together, they would usually be lovey-dovey, romantic, inseparable, but as time passes (3?5 years?) do you still have the kind of feelings you first had for your partner? Is it because you liked the personalities of your partner and that he will be a good wife/husband or is it because you are scared that all the time you invested in the relationship would be lost if you two break up one day? 
In any case, will pure love still play a part for a relationship to be sustainable?
Im just confused, because i no longer had those cheesy romantic feelings for my partner even though we are tgtr for less than 2 months but I really admire and like him for his good personality. Could this mean that we are probably better of as friends instead of a couple?

I've gave my best effort but still failed my Final year project, for that I'll have to retake the entire semester 2 next year and thus delayed graduation. Before even the results came out, I secured myself a well paying job. Turns out life likes to set you back a little when everything was going as planned. I mean, everything that I planned for has gone smoothly my entire life. 

After feeling bitter about it for the past month, today my boss offered me advices and contacts for my project research. The company is alright for me to take a break to complete my studies. 

Life may not go as planned but it made me realized just how nice the people around me are. I thankful for everything thus far, and next semester, I will try even harder. We may fall down sometimes, but don't ever give up. 
-
 


yeah. I've been visiting prostitutes for awhile since my last breakup. I did it at first cuz I was so devastated and broken, and I just wanted to do something to make myself feel something. I went there to escape the pain for an hour each time.

Then it became a habit. Walking out from work I'd even get hard thinking about whether or not I should visit a prostitute. And sometimes I'd get hard enough and try and find one in the vicinity.

But then I've tried to get out of this cycle... maybe if I got attached I could just satisfy my sexual cravings with my gf, and stop this habit.... then I realised, try as I might, I can't seem to love anymore. I've just become really selfish.

I'm all screwed up now.

I am a girl who joined the NUS Chopsticks group recently. Kudos to the admins who are trying their best to organise the first event. I feel so excited joining the first event but I do wish more girls can join the club.  I look forward to meeting girls too. Girls, do not miss out on the chance to meet hot eye candies here. I fear there might be too much competition among the guys haha.

My boyfriend of six years confessed to cheating on me last month.

It happened at the club. He had too much to drink that night and slept with another girl. I've always trusted my boyfriend to be responsible and sensible; it's why I gave him the freedom to club with his friends. I didn't mind. I've been trying to process what happened. He says he's remorseful and wants a second chance. My closest friends tell me I should leave him. That he violated the rule we had.

I'm choosing not to. I chose to stay with him for all the right things he's done by for the last six years and not leave him for the one mistake he made.

My friends think I'm stupid. Maybe they're right.

But is it so wrong to believe that he's genuine about making amends? 
-
 
I'm a girl who gets along well with the guys in my course. (There aren't many girls in my course anyways so I don't have any close female friends.) They treat me like a real "bro" until it comes to situations that call for the "bros over hoes" policy(?), suddenly I'm not a "bro" anymore. It makes me feel like our friendship isn't real - they can discard me whenever they feel like it. Sure, I feel left out sometimes. But.. perhaps ignorance is bliss?

Just graduated here.

There seem to be guys out there who have some form of intention or a last resort to see some prostitutes or escorts. 

Please do not ever do that. I resorted to that and after that this habit controlled me for months. After that saga was over your inner self feels destroyed. 

Having real intimate sex is one whereby both parties feel attached to each other and so on. And after you think youve had a good round youd always try to find that high no matter how long it takes. To have to break away and repeat the cycle only serves to rupture your soul. Your heart becomes hardened after many exploits. 

Post mortem: i dont know if i am capable of real love at the moment. I mean its alright. Im always the one my friends turn to for advice with their relationship and they hope I find someone who really deserves me when in fact I feel too broken inside to put all this behind me. not a soul knows about this past habit of mine. And I dont want anyone who is with me in future to deal with this hard truth. Its not fair to them. 

I know i am  being irrational. We all are. We have these irrational worries. Whether we are facing difficult situations. Or problems in relationships with family friends lvoed ones or other issues in life. Its always clearer from a third person point of view.

In the end I want to strive to help the world in one way or another. A soul too broken to have a mate still has so much to give. Millions of people out there do not have enough food to eat, no clean water to drink and here we are living probably one of the most, i shall put it this way, "provided for" childhood/youthhoods in the world. We all face varying hardships in our lives but when we compare it outside of this comfort zone. Our hardships sometimes cannot even compare.

And it also makes me wonder why we waste our lives on such pleasures that consume us from within. 

Oh why.

i just found out that a guy i used to go out with is homophobic and possibly masochistic . He seemed to be rather disappointed after knowing i didn't subscribe to the same religion as him. I didn't have a good feeling about him back then so all i can say now is, thank god i jumped out of that boat early on.

I hold high respect for people who can tolerate and suffer in silence when they get backstabbed, get used by their friends, get talked about behind their back etc.

If people treat me like shit, I will treat them back like shit.

At least from my point of view.

Should I just reject going out with my ex again? He sounds like he wants me again. Yet he broke up over with me a year ago through whatsapp. What am I? A toy for him ahh?

Eh, did something happen to the Chopsticks group? I procrastinated on accepting an invite, and now it shows up as content unavailable..

I may look nerdy on the outside but I did a lot of hook-ups with guys. It was definitely fun but now I want a long-term relationship. It is just double hard for us to do that cause we all think with the little head down there.

I am attached but recently another girl which is my friend confess that she has feelings for me. However, I don't see any future between us. How should I reject without hurting anyone's feelings.

Referring to the NUS Evergreen group, does that mean once singles in this group gets attached, they have to leave the group? 
And if this group is successful, the more leaving the group the better?

It is supposed to be an honor to receive a wedding invitation from someone, yet it seems to have become a plague which is to be avoided, especially when the person is merely acquainted to us.

Recently, I've have been receiving a lot of wedding invitations from people, even though I've only met them a few times and we are not close. Yes, I am pleased you remembered me and I am most honored to be present at your joyous occasion, however I've been listening to other colleagues around me, and they were complaining they have been "saman" (a.k.a. given a parking ticket), since they were obliged to give the newly wed a red packet with money. 

This made me feel very sad and a little disgusted at their behavior towards a couple's happy occasion. A small amount of red packet money goes a long way for the couple since it helps them to defray the banquet's cost and most importantly, acts as a sign of blessing.

Perhaps I cannot entirely blame them as well, because it's the culture we have which makes a wedding ceremony less and less enjoyable, especially for us Chinese. (I am not sure about the other races) As I've attended countless weddings of family and friends and had been listening to their conversations during so, I realized that wedding ceremonies have become a platform for people to, unfortunately, "hao lian" (show off) to others. 

During the ceremony, their conversations usually revolve around who's winning in life and who's not. And who and who is what and what in where and where. And those who or whose kids are doing well, tend to talk the loudest. 

I really hope that their conversations could be more about interests, hobbies or current affairs, but no, it's usually about self-promotion.

Once there was an auntie (I don't even know who she was or where she came from) who talked to me about her son and how capable he is, how he also studied law but instead from the UK and he is working in a top law firm in Singapore. Her son was just quietly sitting there eating the food. And just when I thought she wanted to hook him up with me since I told her I am single when she asked, she started bragging about how capable and successful his girlfriend is. WTF! -_- Okay, okay, okay. I get it, your kid is awesome and you'll have a wonderful life.

During a casual reunion with NUS friends, I brought this issue up to them. They recalled similar events when they were reluctant to accept a wedding invitation of someone they were not close to. However, they accepted the invitation and give them their blessings anyway. "意思意思就可以了." they advised.

I hate giving someone my blessings casually. It's not because I don't like them, but it's because I don't know them well enough to feel anything genuine for them. I would rather not give them any well-wishes at all, then to give them insincere ones for the sake of it. Hence, when my special day comes, I'll never invite people just to fill the seats and to brag about the number of people who attend my wedding, I will only invite those who I know will truly share my nuptial joy and give me their most heartfelt well-wishes.

I find myself subconsciously refreshing this page every 5min to check for new confessions/posts so that I can be the first one to comment something smart(if I can think of any) and hope that a girl will add me as a friend.

My crush and close guy friend of close to four years is practically using me to get together with another friend of mine. I feel so broken and hurt inside. And the fascinating thing is that she's attached but still ever ready and willing to flirt with him just because he's cute and lusting after her. 
-
 
OP of  again. My gosh, some of the comments are a reflection of the same unpleasantness I referred to earlier. Some of you don't even know how to read properly. If I must reiterate properly: I am not Muslim and I am not fasting (at least not voluntarily thanks to work). But I have eyes and can see Muslim colleagues in the vicinity and even if this is "a test of their temptation" - why must other people go and make it harder for them. And for further context, these aunties don't go and mingle with other staff let alone other races. If you happen to encounter them in the washroom or at the watercooler, they provide you with a dirty look. I suppose that's just how they have become over time: unsure of other people, exclusionary and unfriendly. And what's more, I am absolutely sure that that is NOT a true reflection of their personalities and hearts. But that is what they and many Singaporeans project outwardly. That is the point I was trying to make. Peace.
-- also, I think I can finally go for lunch :)

I dont know if i am in love with this guy or i am just having a phase of infatuation. We are friends and classmates. We dont text often, and most if the time its just me starting the conversation going. He will play along and reply me, but after a while it just dies off. I know this is probably a sign of him not being interested in me.. But he gets jealous and confronts me about my other guy friends. Its hard to put in words my position. I've been counting the number of times i think of him a day and so far its more than 3 times a day, every single day for more than 2 weeks now. Its driving me crazy because we had have a lot of moments/memories together along with other friends as well. Every little thing like items, landmarks, places reminds me of him. How should i get over him? The thing is, i dont thing there was even a thing to begin with. When a guy dont contact you, thats it right?   
-
 
Do other girls commenting frequently (or even just occasionally, actually) receives friend requests from guys you don't know (except that you know they also visit NUSWhispers) and people trying to chat you up?

I don't know what to make of it. Creepy? Or just lonely guys trying to make friends?
-
 
I am aromantic not because I don't crave romance, but because I do not have enough love to give. Crushes are always very short-lived, and they are mostly hinged upon by solely attraction. I have never really liked someone fully wholly and romantically for who they are before. Heck, I don't even love anyone, I don't love my family, even though they are very loving.

Romantically, I'm starting to think that it isn't because the right person hasn't appeared, but rather because I lack the ability to love someone. All that compromises, acceptance, and commitment are too much for me to handle. I love freedom, I love being who I am, and I don't like sacrifices.

I just want a cuddle buddy actually. To think about it, the two more-serious crushes whom I have had are both people whom have intimately touched me and subsequently given me feels. (The first is a guy who liked me and took chances to touch me, the other was my SP) In a sense I'm attracted to people who are sufficiently hot and touches me lol. Strange right. If I ever get a partner I guess it will be for the cuddling and not for the conversations/companionship. 

I'm too happy being with myself. Starting to think that I will never get into a serious relationship ever haha. And I don't hate the idea of that.

So tired of super skinny girls who have figures like sticks or are just nice muscular and toned being all like OHMYGODDD IM SO FATTTTT how am I supposed to eat dessert I'm going to become obese. I've been overweight all my life and I'm constantly battling terrible body image issues. It makes us wonder how you really see us, as fat, ugly people? It's also made me incredibly uncomfortable to eat in front of these people to the end that I've resorted to eating in toilets during lunch in Uni especially because it's so hard to keep friends. I wish you'd know how it feels. I wish you'd know how to treasure your bodies too.

To  Hey! Don't feel so bad about yourself :) I understand how you feel as I have been chubby my whole life. The people I hang out with in school everyday are the type that people will eye candy and then there's me. Initially, I felt a bit insecure etc... But then I realised, they do not care about my appearances! They spend time with me because they like who I am. Granted, I have some other guy friends who will constantly compare me to the more attractive girls in the group but after a while, I realized, they are not worth my tears or time. 

I am sure that if you continue being a sincere and kind person, people will look beyond your appearances :) this are the people you want to spend time with.

Is it wrong if my boyfriend oogles at other girls on the streets  while dating and stalks other girls on fb/instagram/blogs? cause I caught him a few times before but he still continues to do that...
-
 
Not too sure if anyone else has the same issue, but when it comes to BGR, I tend to fall for a person really easily and my mood will be greatly affected by what he does that day. I am also unable to be myself around him( I usually jokes around and shows my lively side to my close friends) but with my crush around, I will become really quiet, withdrawn and aloof. Maybe that's why most of my crushes find that I am a quiet and serious girl which may not be appealing to them.Relationships seem almost impossible for me as I am really awkward around my crush and I don't have the guts to confess. Anyone else has the same issue? Will be great if someone can provide some advice!Thanks in advance!

I like this girl.. but how do i ask her out for a proper date? We have gone out alone before alr.. but we never considered that a date.. so how do i ask her for a date..
-
 
Ok this story is all too familiar but I think I'm interested in this girl cos I enjoy being around her, think of her the whole time, feel happy when I'm with her blah blah blah. Then comes the all too familiar question. I'm not sure if she's interested in me. I wanna confess but I'm afraid it will ruin our friendship. And I can't afford to lose her cos for now at least I still get to hang around and talk to her. But if I confess I'm afraid I'll lose all of that. What should I do?
-
 
To the OP of .
How did you 'semi-confess' to the girl? There could be several possibilities why it is going nowhere.
-She is too shy to show that she reciprocates your feelings although she does know that you are interested in her. 
-She semi-rejected you.
-She is blur. (Likelihood low because girls can feel it usually.)
Maybe you could ask her out on one on one dates out of school or text her personally more frequently to test waters. Good Luck.
-Evergreen girl who doesn’t know how to signal my interest in a guy who potentially has feelings for me.

Girls... what would you do if your bf hits you?

Was it just me or most of you are thinking that ever since last year, the weather had been unforgivingly hot, with so much less rain even during the supposedly wet seasons (eg dec, jan)? 

I felt that the effect of global warming is a lot worst than we thought and it seems to get worse with each passing year. Does anyone felt the same thing?

-
 
To  What kind of "semi-confessions" did you make?Evergreen = no relationship experience. Chances are that the girl isn't sure how to interpret your advances. What seems to you as an obvious display of interest might come across as normal friendly behaviour to a girl who hasn't been in the dating game. It will take courage, but why not confess once and for all and see what happens next? 

Speaking from my own experience-when I first met my gf, she was evergreen. I tried hinting my interest but she didn't dare to think of the possibility that I liked her that way, simply because her hopes had been dashed before and she thought I was just being friendly. I had to take the initiative to text her first and eventually I was the one who asked her out first too. In the end I simply said I wanted to be her boyfriend but I was fine with waiting & getting to know each other better if she still wasn't sure. Now we're together and I'm glad I decided to be truthful.

So many opportunities pass us by cos we are afraid of taking the risk and wearing our hearts on our sleeves. Take my advice with a pinch of salt (sorry in advance if you get rejected/heartbroken ah), but sometimes being honest and sincere about our intentions can open up new beginnings. Enough with the ambiguous mind games and "push & pull".

How do I go about asking someone of the same sex out? I can't risk ruining a friendship by doing this.

There's this guy whom I just got to know for 1 week plus. On the first day I got to interact with him, I'm alr attracted to him as his behavior reminds me of someone special. They behaved and talked exactly the same way. But I know it's not going to be a ever lasting one because we will part ways soon when this program ends. To prevent myself from liking him further, I have been trying to sit as far from him as possible, n reducing my interaction with him. 3 weeks left till this whole program ends n part our ways, should I give up or take a step closer even if just flirting with him?

I don't have the feeling that my boyfriend is "the one" for me. Even in my past relationship I had the same feeling. Is it me having unrealistic perfectionistic ideals or are they really not the one for me? My boyfriend treats me really well and is so loving and accomodating to me. But we have very different career interests and so-so similar personal interests. But our family backgrounds and grades and future career paths seem so vastly different that I can't imagine a future together with him. I gave him a chance from the start because he was so very caring and has a great personality. But throughout the relationship until now, I have this nagging feeling. Like I think we may break up someday over these issues. How do I know if I am being too idealistic orI should really find someone else who can fit those criteria better, to be on the same page for our future?

To: 

I doubt that Internet advice could really solve your problems, but here goes.

The thing about having low self esteem is that you end up telling yourself things that may not entirely be true. It becomes a cycle in which you self-handicap because the anxiety and feelings of worthlessness that result from your low self-esteem probably worsen your performance and end up reinforcing your own low self-esteem. 

It isn't easy, but you have to break the cycle. Stop telling yourself that others have more talent than you, that others look down on you or that others hate you. Yes, there will always be people better than you and people who genuinely do dislike you. But you don't have to focus on them. If you can let go of your desire to prove yourself to others and just enjoy the activity instead of turning it into something that makes you miserable, perhaps you might find your own performance improving as a result. Live life by your own terms, not those of others.

And I find that distraction helps, though only temporarily. Find some other activity you enjoy, reading, watching films, or something that you can do without invoking those feelings. It's not a long-term solution, but at least it may give you some relief.

I think the best remedy for such personal issues is having strong support from friends and/or family who stand by you no matter what, though that's not very realistic an expectation sometimes. But how sure are you that your friends actually do hate you, or if it is your own mind telling you things again? It is true that it is not easy having to talk to someone who has emotional issues and you might feel that you're annoying others (I feel that way too). But there may still be those who're willing to listen and help.

If you really do need help and really feel that you can't get it from anyone, seek professional help. And while it is weird to talk to your family, you really should if you feel that your issues are seriously affecting you. 

I sincerely hope you'll be able to iron out your issues. Hang in there!

Hello guys. I'm not very good with expressing myself, but please advise me because I really have nobody to turn to. I think I've an extremely low self esteem issue problem that's gonna grow serious and I hope I could get advices how to make myself feel more positive before I fall into depression (I can feel it coming.)

In the recent months, I find myself crying after every dance classes I attend. There have been a number of nights too when my tears would flow out all of the sudden before I sleep. I'm one of the lousiest dancer in my CCA. I'm always the only one asking the dumbest questions in dance classes because it seemed that everyone could execute the step except me. And it's not like I'm a new dancer; I've been dancing for 7 years and I recently switched my dance genre to hiphop about a year ago. The pressure to dance better is weighing on me so terribly and I could feel even my instructor wondering why the hell am I trying so hard in something I absolutely have no talent with. But I love dance, I like to move my body, play with the music and all. But these feelings of low self esteem is playing so hard on me so I thought I could get some advices how to handle these emotional issues? I am starting to hate myself a lot.

I hope nobody will tell me to talk to someone else about my feelings because I don't have any close friends now. They have driven me away because I've emotional issues. They get so tired and sick of them that most hate me a lot... Yup. Besides those, I know there've been nasty rumors in schools about me too. It's very weird to share my low self esteem issues with my family... Come to think of it, the main reasons why I want to dance besides liking to move and all is because I want to prove myself that I'm actually capable of something in my life, as well as to show my haters that I'm not that invaluable and 讨人厌。

I guess what makes me more sad is the fact that my other dance mates are better than me so much even though they don't take outside classes and they rarely practice. Whenever they see me, they go "hey! You confirm damn zai one right now everyday go take outside classes!!!" But no, when we start dancing together the disparity is still there, and there I go again - feeling terrible and alone.

I practiced and practiced, only to find myself demoralized every single time and wonder how can such a lousy person exists. It's ok if a lot of people hate me and my studies suck. But why does an activity I put my heart and soul in doesn't turn out well too?

Ok sorry for the extremely long, boring & filled-with-grammatical-errors post, if you read this till the end, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart. So yeah... It'll be great if anyone could advise me on this. How to make myself feel positive. Just anything before I sink into depression.

Got to know this person recently and somehow we will always flirt with each other when texting. However, our text will also normally end up taking about the guys she likes. Happens so often that it made me feel worthless at times. Like what's keeping the conversation alive is cause of the guys she likes. Nothing about me. I'm just an expandable. Makes me wonder why is she flirting with me then? Sometime I wish I can just stop breathing and leave this world...

For everyone out there worrying or being insecure about your looks...

How should i start and keep a conversation going with this girl whom I have never met before and I only have her facebook? I just really want to know her better as a friend.

I am the OP of 4541. From the comments and another confession post, i deduced that these uncivilised men in the heartland tend to target those girls who look timid or innocent (that's me). Am i right?

However it puzzles and disappoint me that some guys still think its normal for guys to behave this way. From my observation, more civilised/highly educated men only steal glances but NOT stare when there's good looking girls around. So i guess you guys are saying its normal that a guy would want to look at a better looking girl, though their ways of looking (oogling/glacing) differs based on education level, orientation? I think men in the past generally do not respect women and this is why they feel if i want to stare then i stare. 

And there seems to be comments that suggest girls don't seems to mind if rich studs stare. Are you thinking that girls mind only when those they deem as dirty old man (DOM) stare? It appears to me girls mind, whether its DOM or rich studs who stare. Correct?

I think generally, girls don't literally ogle at handsome guys. They at most steal glances and talk behind the handsome guy's back. This leads me to the question to guys out there. 

Are guys sometimes unaware that they had been staring at some pretty girls without themselves realising it?

I refer to the post about men oogling or talking up girls/stand close to girls in heartland or near construction sites or wherever regardless of what the girl is wearing.

My girlfriend lives in a mature heartland and she often complains that she gets a lot of such catcalling, or sometimes strange men following her or sometimes asking her if she has time or where she is going. It seems any form of reply, even "go away", or "not interested" seem to spur them on. Shes quite a timid person so she isn't the type to shrug them off or show the middle finger or stuff like that, she often just walk away quickly and ignore completely and hope they don't follow.  I try to send her back as often as i can but it disturbs me to know that there are times when im not there and "anything can happen".

Ive traveled around and it seems Singapore doesn't have as big a problem as others where the law isn't as protective of women. As a guy these things are totally invisible to us, i used to think girls were paranoid about such concerns until ive heard them first hand, it even happens often on public transport. Having a younger sister and a girlfriend i feel very concerned.

A solution would be to advise them to hold their phones and take or pretend to take pictures of their "stalkers", posting them online if need be to warn other or shame/deter other strange men from doing the same, however i think there would be many "fake cases" and many innocent men would be humiliated for nothing. But honestly I don't care, though its technically not a crime to oogle or stalk or borderline harass, i dont want my female friends and family and loved ones to be constantly fearful for their safety.

A concerned boyfriend.

Recently I have started chatting with an ex fling on whatsapp - we bumped into each other coincidentally 2-3 years after the incident and started talking again after we broke off contact because of the awkwardness. Now we have been talking again and truthfully I am glad to have this chance to patch back this friendship which I thought would be lost forever because of the past. I see him purely as a friend only. What is weird thou is that I found he has a girlfriend through instagram but when I requested to follow him (he privated it awhile after) I found that he had removed all the photos of the girl and continued talking to me like normal. (I'm concerned because despite wanting to know him again as a normal friend I do not want to end up as a third party or even be talking to him so much while he is attached to someone else -not fair to the girl and I am not a relationship ruiner). I thought they might have broken up though so I just acted like nothing was amiss. But a few weeks ago I saw he was tagged in a photo by the girlfriend where they went on a date 2gether. Now I m not sure if I should lessen the amount of our conversation since I personally don't think it's being fair to the girlfriend. Or if I should just carry on and not think so much.  I tried to hint about the topic of his girlfriend but he avoided it. Any advice?

A long rant about myself...

I consider myself a rather abnormal person back in JC days. For one I was quite asexual back then (straight now though). While the rest of my guy cliques are checking girls out, I'm the only person who is rather indifferent to this. When girls attempt to want to know me through my guy cliques (i don't really follow my friends around while they are out chatting with girls from other classes), or tell my friends that i'm rather good looking or so, I brushed them off, or even be brutally honest and tell my friends that the girl is ugly in my opinion. I even once said "her face looks like a hamburger" and made sure that girl in particular could hear it. I pretended to be effeminate, pretend to worship kpop flower boys like lee joonki, pretended to be a fan of the guys in Boys over Flowers, tuned my body language and speech. All to siam romantic encounters with the female breed as I was slightly more interested with platonic friendships. I never once believed in relationships that start early as I knew that statistically they mostly do not survive through the period when the guy serves NS. The average marriage age for guys was clear as day back then in singstats. The average duration of a typical relationship back in JC? LOL. The probabilities are stacked harshly. My world view is largely shaped by cold hard numbers and known facts. (no wonder i'm a stats major)
To summarise, I'm a cynical asshole since long ago.

I read internet forums, especially topics where people seek advice, dispense advice, share their life experiences. I've noticed that,

Friendships: many people lose about all their friends rather early on. first wave of fatality comes when your friends hit working world, because work,family,significant other ranks higher than friends but eats up almost all the time one has.
The surviving friendships die off one by one when the particular friend gets married (especiallly female friendships). In fact, according to many, attending a female friend's wedding is almost similar to attending her funeral. This is all assuming that the strength of the friendship was decent in the first place! And we have in fact do have many advocates of "learn to say no" when people seek help from you. No wonder friendships don't survive long. This style of thinking in my opinion stems from the networking/gain friends for benefits way of viewing others(will talk about this later).

Relationships: talking about my observations about this and the views of many people is akin to beating a dead horse. One thing of note to me is that at working age, girls all shift their thinking towards the "how much is he earning" route. And that it is more probable to find a girl who is into "through thick and thin" in a schooling environment. It feels kind of empty that the chance of "true love" is proving to be very low at this point of my life. I sometimes wish I was at least naive early on in life.to have a.better shot at "true love".

Aforementioned things are largely my interpretations of the life experiences of others, often with the tone of resignation, sometimes heated debates. I put a lot of weight in internet contributions because people have much less reason to be EQ-oriented in their words than in real life interaction. I believe people are more candid in their opinions.

Now to uni. The bulk of my whatsapp conversations is initialised by the other party due to their need for my help (mostly studies). Depressing huh. I have people mostly from my major, some from other unis, some from other unis in other countries. I never had an issue with helping unless it takes up way too much resources. 

Until;
1. When various friends/romanical interest hint that another person/group is just using me. I have people leaking by accident to me about their opinions of people around me. I have another set of people telling me in the face who and who is just using me. I could go on and on about the many instances but the thing is, most of this leaking and telling happened when it was uncalled for and unexpected. Its a huge web of allegations. I was still a prostitute back then who availed myself to pretty much everyone. These happenings was what prompted me to analyse my past whatsapp conversations with about everyone.

2. I asked for advice on the internet about this and various beentherethroughtthats told me about the concept of "friends of convenience" in uni and that I should just focus on more worldly goals like first class, getting internship and cushy job as they are definitely real things I can take away from uni. In fact in other discussions I realised many of the first classes and dean listers make no apologies about cutting not so stellar ppl off project groups simply because they do not want to risk their CAP/GPA. 
I am utterly confused as to who is true and who is not. 

I have always believed the concept of networking to be disgusting. To the point whereby I avoid knowing new people. Because I know very well majority of the uni population is developing worldly views especially 3rd year onwards when the perceived need for internship sets in and part of it is buying the networking thing. I do not want to be remotely part of this bullcrap. I'm starting to think that perhaps I was part of others' network all along. 

And as I mentioned earlier I am a cynical realist who weights the opinions of others greatly,statistician to the core. And the funny thing is until a year plus ago, I was able to sustain my own dissonance, thinking all friends are friends and concurrently am convinced that many people are deceitful and self-serving in nature. 1+1=2 came late for me.

I was once convinced to find a job which requires less commitment on the "time" aspect because I wanted to have time for people who mattered. But the number of such people seem depressing.
I'm thinking of working my ass off for my final year, aim for a high paying job and be the workaholic I once set out not to be, get married at say age 32, to someone who is attracted to me for the financial stability I will bring, and maybe she will cheat on me behind my back because I am too busy working and maybe we can get a divorce 1 year or so into the marriage. Or we could stay married for the sake of it. Or I could stay single and thus save lots of money for a fine life of luxuries for myself since there is no child rearing costs, no wedding no HDB.

I will take my current state to be the manifestation of karma as a result of my asshole behaviour in the way I dealt with people I didnt care for in the past, my brutally honest and stubborn opinions in conversations people probably got pissed about. My 0EQ comments were bad, but I make no apologies for being honest.

This long long rant was the result of me being insomniac and long lasting effects of monday blues in an army camp. It bears my signature mode of thought and world view so any friend of mine who remotely knows my style of thoughts would know this post is penned by me. Structure is probably bad, typos and bad grammar littered everywhere because its 4am right now. Would appreciate brutally honest 0 EQ comments because i'm confused as hell. Finally, thanks for reading!

I'm interested in this evergreen girl from my clique and even hinted my infatuation for her numerous times. However it seems like being evergreen for so long has robbed her of many things because she did not really know how to react to my 'semi'-confessions. I'm so vexed since I don't know if I should continue pursuing her or not.. ):

While the whole NUS is in this endless love turmoil where people simply cannot find someone to get hitched with due to shyness, awkwardness, not hot enough, no cars and all the other worldly concerns, I suffer from a significantly different problem.  I cannot seem to keep my females friends who I knew almost all my life, as friends, after puberty. 
The come in a various stages in life, from childhood friends, to my sister's friends, to my schoolmate, pen pal and what not. Bottom line is that these are gals I know for ages. But I can't keep them as friends cuz they at some point confessed directly or indirectly and disappeared after rejection. Like please, can't I just be a nice guy and continue our friendship without you at some point inferring that treating gals 'nice' means I am 'courting'. In order to preserve that last few female friends from old, I resorted to being not so nice to them.   
You know what? We created this cold harsh world for ourselves. These same gals used to complain that good guys hard to find. Obviously so! I need to be a semi asshole sometimes so that I dun get inferred the wrong way. Like can I simply be friends, sincere, be mutually caring, regardless of your attachment status or my refusal to be romantically or sexually attracted to you gals? Too much Korean drama and hinting are not good for your mental health please.

I'm straight and have been with my girlfriend since our first year in NUS. But she wasn't the first person I fell in love with. In the army, I had a good friend, K. I had just arrived to the unit as a newly minted officer. He, on the other hand, was a sergeant who arrived in a few months before. K was a good person. He was smart and helpful. He was exactly the sort of guy you can count on to do things quickly and effectively. 

Due to our jobs being similar, we teamed together and soon, found ourselves a friend in the other. Although he was to report to me, I've never really given a shit about ranks. I saw everyone I worked with as my equal. Neither I nor them were there by choice. My relationship with K was always very informal. We shared meals, played basketball in the evening and even gymmed together. We knew that we could depend on each other to get out of any shit we may have found ourselves in. 

There was one particular weekend we did duty together. This was six months after my posting in. An alarm had gone off at one of the buildings. It was a 25-minutes walk from HQ. The duty driver was no where to be seen. We had no choice but to run quickly there. After shutting down the alarm, we made our way slowly on foot back to HQ. On the walk back, we bitched about how the driver was absent from duty and how I planned to sign him extra duties for making us run. We talked about work. We teased, elbowed and pushed each other around. At one point, I found myself pushed into a drain. To me, that sort of behaviour was common, especially amongst NSFs. Ask anyone who's been through the NS and no one will raise an eyebrow if they see that kind of behaviour in camp. It was just boys being boys. I saw it as mere playfulness and nothing more than that. 

I guess the playfulness got too much that night. He pushed me against a wall... and kissed me and confessed his feelings for me. Not knowing how to react, I pushed him away and told him to fuck off. We didn't speak the rest of the night and the following week. He tried to make things right, but I kept insisting that we be professionals. I became cold to him. I got easily frustrated when people asked stupid questions. It wasn't so much the stupidity of people that bothered me; rather, it was what happened between K and I. I didn't had anyone to bitch to about work; more than that, I felt like I had lost a friend. I had no one else to blame but myself for I chose to call off the friendship. I played basketball by myself, I worked out alone, I ate alone, I swam alone.

One night, two weeks after the incident, I was at the gym doing weights. I remembered feeling so frustrated that night that I took my anger out on the weights. I didn't know why, but after, I made my way to his bunk where he slept alone and knocked on his door. When he opened it, I went in for a kiss. It took him by surprise. We had sex that night (no penetration though) and spooned till morning. That was the first time ever I had sex. Certainly, I didn't expect it to be with a guy. We got into a relationship; unfortunately, things didn't work out. He broke up with me. He knew I loved him, but he also knew that I wasn't fully in the relationship as he was. I simply couldn't see a future with him. He was right. Despite all that happened between us, I still didn't see myself as gay.  Shortly after ORD, he left for his studies in the UK and we stopped talking altogether, despite being on each other's Facebook.

While out in town with my girlfriend, I saw him. He was back in Singapore for awhile. I introduced the two of them to each other. We talked, briefly, before going separate ways. Later he texted me on Facebook to say that I look happy. I told him that I was. That she (my girlfriend) makes me happy. He was glad for me. I don't look at or feel for other guys the same way I looked and felt for K. Looking back, I did genuinely loved him. K will be the only guy I've ever had feelings for and given my heart to. But now I have this wonderful girl... and I love her. And I won't do things to hurt her. She has all of me now as I do of her. But she will never know about this.

Sorry this is so long... It's just that when I saw him again today, it made me think about the relationship I had with him. Crazy, huh?

I am an adopted child. with no cousins or any other relatives etc. the closest family member that i have is my foster mum. it was more than coming from an adopted family, the family that i was adopted into was actually a temple. with the environment i grew up in, i was quite an introvert,keeping all my thoughts, feelings, and trouble to myself. i just felt that no one will understand my situation. i seldom talk about my family. just listen in awe silently when my friends talk about their family. just looking at photo where their family members send them off at the airport for exchange can make me feels .....empty, jealous, and "why i dont have...". i am scared to open up about my family background to friends, afraid of what they might think of me. Yes, i may be smiling all the time, but deep down, i think a lot about life. 

what will your reaction be if one day your friend tell you that he/she is adopted? especially in singapore society.   
-
 
I thought he was a nice guy when he wants a relationship without dramas but a thin stream that flows for a long time. So I accepted his pursue. Bullshit. He laters subtly complains I'm not drama enough ("don't you want to ask me questions about this and that?" + like he went out with his ex for eg. When I said I got no questions for him cauz I trust him, he got upset.) And now he goes to pursue a life with drama. Don't ever look for me again.

In a dilemma here, really appreciate if anyone can give their suggestions and opinions about my plight.

Recently I've went out with my guy friend (I'm a girl). What we had was pure friendship, with mild flirtings scattered here and there throughout the period of knowing him (3 years). On that day we went out, there were instances of our hands brushing against each other, till he actually held my hand. We also leaned against each other and hugged a few times all in that single day. 

What confuses me is that he didn't mention anything about this after that day. We still chat but never actually touched on this incident. What should I make of this?..

This year chinese new year, my older cousins asked if i intend to come out straight to work after uni graduation. Before i could reply him, my dad interrupted and said "she wished to persue phD but i don't like her to study till so high as by then she would be quite old". I was very unhappy when i hear this. All this while i know that he isn't very supportive of me going after phD and he like to say "i will only sponsor your studies up till master. If you want a phD, go find a scholarship and support yourselves through".

Was this because my dad is born is the 1950s and thus from what others say, he may be thinking that if i study too high, men may not dare to chase after me. (In fact i think this is untrue. If it is true then doctorate girls would not have got married anyway). Or he may think that after phD, i would be much older and can't have a family (because guys don't like older women) and to him, he may have thought that a girl should put family before career. But then again i told him countless of times i an intending to stay single and there is no point hoping i would eventually marry and have a family. I really don't know why he's like that so what do you all think? 

My mum, also born in the 1950s, was very supportive about my wish to persue a phD if possible, although she also wish i have a family next time. 

Despite the fact that i am evergreen, i still feel that i want to prioritise my careers and dreams. Relationship and love can be thrown one side, at least in my opinion. I don't understand why my parents still feel that having a family is as important as career so someone please enlighten me on this.

So 1 question to the girls out there, do either of your parents still think its not necessary for you to study till too high or you end up less likely to get married?

To 

I was in your shoes once. I'm the more serious kind and she kinda just wants to have fun. I knew it right from the start; that our personalities were just... different. But I was willing to give us a try. And try we did.

About 3 months on, she must have felt it too. Started putting distance between herself and me, giving short and delayed replies etc. It wasn't until my insistence that she finally told me the reasons for her sudden change of behavior (seriously, why do girls keep quiet and then somehow magically expect guys to know what went wrong, but I digress). Anyway, long story short, I listened to the brain and initiated the break-up.

I thought I could handle it. Never was I so wrong. The heart does indeed wants what it wants. I was super miserable; I did lots of stupid things I wished I didn't; screwed up that entire semester, and the following one too.

I don't know what's the purpose of my post here; I guess I just wanted to share my story with you (and help you make an informed decision), since you seem like you are contemplating break-up. I'm a bit like you actually; if she didn't give hints that we couldn't work out then, I'd probably have held on for years (in your case, 2 years) despite knowing of our personality differences right from the start. Anyway, whichever option you choose (and there's no 'correct' or wrong one), I hope you don't regret it like I did. Good luck!

If my boyfriend of four years wishes his other friend (a girl) "goodnight hottie" but wishes me with a "night", am I supposed to not feel upset about it?

This has happened more than once.. With different girls calling them gorgeous, etc. 

The last time he did it he told me it would be the last time. 

How should I feel? What should I do?
-
 
To  i know the feel bruh. I also kena the same thing but i'm a social work major. 
People approach me coz they have a problem and they need a listening ear. I thought they suddenly wanna be good friends and share this stuff with me but nope! After listening to them and affirming them... Nothing. Until they need more affirmation and encouragement again, of course. 
-
 
He's not the one for me; yet I decide to give him a chance.

Basically, we have very different personalities. While I'm a serious, pessimistic and future-oriented person, he's an easy going and optimistic guy. While I know what I want to do in the future, he doesn't.. And he's also a very lazy and unromantic guy.

2 years have passed and up till today, after knowing him better and all... My brain still insists on telling me that he's not the right guy, but my heart tells me otherwise. After all it has been 2 years and we have spent so much time together.

I'm not sure if breaking up is the correct option because I'm afraid I'll miss him. But I have tried my best, and him too, to accommodate one another because of our differing personality. I'm really tired of all these & I really hope to find a guy who has a similar personality as me so that everything's more relatable. Can anyone advise me what to do?

To  I'm very sorry that you went through such a traumatic experience when you were younger. I'm also sorry that you have to struggle with feelings of attraction towards both boys and girls. 

I think it's amazing that you were able to overcome the transphobic stigma attached with dating a transgender person. I'm sorry that it did not work out between the two of you though. 

On the current relationship issue that you're facing, I hope that you can talk it out with her and find closure. I know it's hard and life seems really unfair that it has dealt so much difficulties and pain to you. 

Please know that you don't have to face this alone and there are many of us out there who are here to support you. If you ever need to reach out for support regarding your relationships, be it straight or queer, do consider talking to someone from Oogachaga. They're LGBT-affirmative and I think it would help if you were able to share your feelings with someone. 

All the best and take care, friend! We may be the architect of our own destruction, but we also are the architect of our most beautiful creation so here's a response to your quote from the poem, Invictus: "I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul."

I'm with my current boyfriend for about a month now, we've dated for 2-3 months prior to getting together. Recently my ex boyfriend, S (whom I've considered to be The One - even the current boyfriend doesn't make me feel the same way as my ex did) have been contacting me, constantly texting and asking to meet up and go out for dinner and movie. We've cut contact since early this year in February.

Please don't tell me that his intentions are harmless and that its just a dinner/movie - I was with S for 1.5 years so I know there are hidden motives underlying this. My question is should I go meet my ex and see what he wants? I know my current boyfriend will not encourage me to do so and I don't really want to bring it up to him because it will end up in a fight and I already know what he will say. Any advice?

To  Moi. Same situation. Been telling myself to trash all hope, but you know, hope is treacherous.
I'm certain a lot of people are facing the same issue. If you crunch the numbers and make some modest estimates, maybe your psyche will finally accept the matter of fact.#moveon #easiersaidthandone

Good luck!

My girlfriend of a year is the most wonderful person I've ever met, for I've never encountered anyone who is more beautiful, kind, understanding and caring than she is. However, beneath the veneer of smiles and laughter lies a maelstrom of unparalleled magnitude. She is plagued by a whole host of problems, such as depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety, an eating disorder and severe mood swings. We can be having a great time together, and 2 seconds later, with no warning whatsoever,  she can sink into a state of depression. This has happened more times than I can count, and many a date has been ruined as a result of this. She has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past 3 years and has been hospitalized at least 4 times for malnutrition and attempted suicide. Each time this happens, a little piece of me just dies inside. I love her greatly and desire nothing more than helping her through this rough period, but truth to be told, I am emotionally exhausted. It seems like everything I do in an attempt to get her back on track is for naught. I've been disappointed so many times, be it the ruined dates, the unfulfilled promises made on her part to change and put the pieces of her life back together, and her constant avoidance of food despite acknowledging that doing so is bad for her health. Am I a bad person for not being able to accept her and her emotional baggage unconditionally? Am I in the wrong for not being like the spouse who diligently visits his/her perpetually comatose wife/husband in the hospital everyday for years despite knowing in their heart of hearts that they will probably never wake up, and that they are holding on to nothing but a silver of hope? In marriage it is said that partners should stick with each other in sickness and in health, and while I personally feel that this applies for serious relationships as well, is there a point where enough is enough? Is there such a thing as unconditional love? Or is unconditional love really just love with hidden conditions tacked on afterall? I'm feeling really lost right now. I don't know how to cope with the situation at hand. Please help me.

Is it common for one to choose to completely prioritise studies over friendship as one matriculates? It's disturbing to see how people drifted away from each other due to lame excuses like busyness over academics and are so indifferent towards people who take time to make time for them. Perhaps it's just a part of life where people come and go, and only those who matter stay?

Hello , I think it is reasonable that you feel upset about it. While some girls may be possessive over their over halves, this is not only being “friendly”, but can be considered “flirtatious”. Come on, “hottie”?! Am sure the general population will be with you on this. Also, it is inexcusable that he did this on more than one occasion – not that once is fine, but you get what I mean. He needs to stop giving excuses that it would be the last time. I think you sound like a reasonable girl, so he should count his blessings and draw the line(s) clearly. You deserve more respect. 

I’m also female. I do have male friends who say similar things to me, but I either brush it off or not reply – so they do get the hint and do not say similar things again. In your situation, I hope the girls don’t reciprocate…   

I don’t think we are in any position to “tell” you how you should feel, but perhaps, what we can suggest is that you have a talk with him? Do let him know how you’re feeling… I really think that you are being reasonable.

How do I stop comparing myself with others? Sometimes, I get a little sad when I browse through social media. All the pictures of my friends having a great time with their friends.. and also pictures of them going overseas.. These pictures make me feel that I have a pretty boring life. I know it's totally pointless to compare myself with others and I should try to go out more and make new friends.. But I just can't stop these thoughts from appearing in my head.

Why do people who work long hours think that their time is more precious than others'? Yes, such people spend more hours than the average person at work. But - this was/is a conscious choice. It is inexcusable to dismiss/put down what others do. It is also not very kind to expect other people to (always) be accommodating. Yes, "give and take" -- but how much is too much? Keep taking and there will be nothing left.

Disclosure: I am from School of Computing.

Over the past month, I have had 3 'friends' approach me regarding their computer problems. They were good friends in the past, but due to circumstances we drifted apart and went our ways. Well, stuff like that happens all the time. I try to chat them up over Facebook sometimes, but I understand they are busy people - one of them has a full time job, one of them is in Medicine, a demanding course - so I'm not surprised when they give offhand responses or straight out ignore for a day or two.

What frustrates me, though, is that as soon as they needed help they would pester me for it, as though suddenly they have a lot of time to chat (about their computer problems). As soon as I helped them with the problems, the lines went dead again.

I decided we're just acquaintances now. It's not really worth my effort to connect with these people when they see you as their local utility shop. Is there any wonder why IT people tend to stick with their own?

If you've been doing this to an IT person you know, I hope you'll reflect on this.

Seriously. What are the possible reasons as to why someone would constantly take hours or even over a day(s) to reply your convo even though they open Whatsapp frequently throughout the day?

I know it could be because he's busy. Or he could be uninterested. Or he finds the conversation boring. Or he finds me so insignificant, I am not worthy of his time. Or because I take time to reply as well, (and that's due to laziness and procrastination) so he decided to do the same thing to me. 

I don't know. But I'm interested to hear out those out there who do the same thing – why would you take so long to reply?

Please note that I'm NOT complaining because even though he takes quite some time to reply, he still does so eventually, albeit very slowly. 

I'm just curious because I honestly feel like I'm bothering him. And if it's really because he is uninterested, then... I feel like I should stop bothering him. :(

I am a straight guy who is attached. I also love talking random stuff to females on a purely platonic level.

However, I find it difficult to sustain such conversations, no matter how enjoyable, once the girl gets attached. It is not because I was interested in them, but rather I don't want their boyfriends to get the wrong idea and be the source of tension in their relationship.

After all, I don't want to be that 'male best friend' that ruined their relationship.

Some friends may know that I have been suffering from kidney damages for five years now possibly the result of a dormant sle lupus. I haven't been the best person at coping and smoke and drink on an irregular basis. 

It's only recently that I stopped smoking and decided to try at life again. But it seems that my lupus might be coming out of dormancy lately. I am scared and afraid and really want another stab at life. Badly.

I'm not sure if I will ever been able to like another girl ever again.  These few years, I have gotten very close with a girl from Hong Kong, and as we grew very close together, everyone around us was already thinking that we were together, but we never were.  As much as I wanted to, she was never interested, due to my uncertain plans after graduating, and the fact that she is going elsewhere to do her Masters, and probably her PhD somewhere in the world also.  On top of that, she has numerous health problems which she cited as reasons for not wanting to be in a relationship, apart from the distance.  

However, the fact that we were living together in an apartment for 2 years, although different rooms, and the two of us even went on a trip for 3 nights, just the two of us, mind you, in the same room, and sticking with one other for 4 whole days, it all just doesn't add up.  

I feel like I've been played for this entire time of my life having known her.  Are most girls like this?  I mean, if you're not interested in a guy, why would you just agree to go on a trip with him?  It's sending out the wrong message to every single person we know.  Even our friends are shocked that she finally said no.

Seeing the recent posts about FwB, just wondering isn't pregnancy a worry? Both me and my partner are looking to step further in our relationship but that is my worry. Condoms aren't 100% safe isn't it?

I graduated from NUS some time ago, currently working. Recently I saw many confessions on NUS whispers on relationship. Probably I could seek some advice over here as well.

I got to know this guy last year through some online dating site. Initially through text messages, I thought we could click. We met up a few times, and during valentine's day this year, he confessed to me.. I did not agree, and we did not date. On and off, we still go out together. But the thing is when we go out, it's just either movie, or dinner. Even text messages are mostly talking about "what you doing?". I am not saying that guys should go all the way out and do fanciful stuffs but for a guy that is interested in some girl, wouldn't you try to talk more and flirt with the girl rather than just some mundane talk? (this is something that I cannot understand) and wouldn't a date be more like a date (quality time) rather than just watching a movie or a simple dinner where there is awkward conversation? (which is more like what old couples do. And to think I have known him for such a "long" time but there is still alot of things he doesn't know about me and I also don't know about him.

 sorry arh, just checking with the public: what's short distance relationship, mid-distance, long-distance and ultralong distance? Like, if my other half is in Boston, how? Ultralong distance right?

People always tell me I come across too strong and independent, too un-girly and too straightforward. These are my traits and I can't change the way I am, and neither am I willing to compromise myself for a guy. I have people telling me I have a pretty face, but I will never be one of those "damsel in distress" or someone who is "deh" to get guys' attention. And I'm starting to feel that I'll be forever alone and stuck at singlehood (I'm not evergreen btw).

I am very close friends with a girl from a different race. Let's call her X. We're very good friends and she cares a lot about me. I am not in love with X but recently realised that what I love is her bubbly, optimistic personality. We have many similar interests and enjoy each other's company. She would be the perfect girlfriend for me. However, I know my parents won't accept her because of her different race. Should I convince my parents or forget about any hope of a relationship with X? What are the pros and cons of inter-racial relationships?

I've been in a long-term relationship. About 3 years now. But i cant help but feel jealous of friends who are single. 

There is this ability to not have commitment and to meet new people. And man am i so curious about apps like tinder that i can't use without feeling guilty. 

Man. Now i am feeling guilty confessing this too.

Conversations—one after another—were so effortless and enjoyable.
Not until they were replaced by awkward silences.
What in the world happened?
Couple of times, she had asked you what went wrong.
But there was no response.
Hurt, broken, and torn; she tried to move on.
But still she struggles to figure it out; she couldn’t just give up. 
She constantly ponders: did she not try hard enough, or never will she be good enough?
Was it something she did, or something she said, that was utterly wrong?
Or was she simply a bother all along?
She’s dying to know the reason; she’s dying to know why.
Tell her everything, even if it’s a lie. 
A sentence, a word, or even just a letter; anything is fine.
At least, there’s a reply.
After all, knowing something is better than knowing nothing at all. 
She won’t have to make wild guesses about your thoughts anymore.
People may ask: why so naïve; why fall so deep?
For something so trivial like a friendship. 
She doesn’t have an answer.
She never thought you’d matter.
If you think you’re the person she’s referring to, talk to her and let her know.
Only then, can she let you go. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since E-Learning week, I’ve already noticed your change. I didn’t dare to ask much ‘cause I thought I was thinking too much. I waited and observed, but you were unpredictable. I thought everything would turn out fine eventually but it ended up like this. Weeks and months have gone by, and I still feel lost, confused, and miserable. What does your silence mean? Are we friends no more? Or were we never friends to begin with? 
Neither of us follows NUSWhispers, so I don’t know if you’ll ever read this. Even if you did, would you know that this post was meant for you? 
It may be nothing much to you but it definitely breaks my heart seeing how we’ve drifted apart.

Is there a difference between wife-material and gf-material?

Hi (again) , im the OP from confession 

Well, to put things in perspective. My life since 17 has been rather uneventful. I had my first girlfriend in JC1. I dated someone who was suffering from Bipolar Disorder. So an inordinate amount of my time was spent with her as she manifested various forms of behaviour. I saw her self mutilate as I tried to calm her down. That's the memories I had from my 1st relationship. Sadly, she called me the night before my JC1 promo exams asking to talk. As i was busy mugging i ignored her. She jumped at 2am the next day - 9 floors down. 9 floors of nightmares for me. I found myself subsequently missing her, and contemplated suicide. Till this day, I still miss her deeply.

Then came National Service. NS is time for you to think and actually reflect about life. Since 13, I began to feel attracted to guys ( Yes I'm a guy ). I found myself spazzing over certain kind of guys ( not going into details on my type ). I took a leap of faith and began dating a transgender first. It was a first time for me as we went out in public, people staring at her and what not. Of course, we went all the way. Had sex, got ourselves emotionally messed up and called the relationship off. Till today, I still wonder how is it possible that I can feel attracted to girls and guys at the same time. It's painful trying to convince myself that I am normal.

Lastly, the 3rd girl I dated was the one I mentioned in post  . As of now, I'm confused over my sexual orientation and simultaneously trying to fill up this emotional void within me. It has reached a point where..... i'm neck deep into flings and everything with the female gender. I go for everything ranging from people my age to mid 50s ( MILF ). Its not so much about the sex now, but the thrill now. Self mutilation does happen from time to time
Disclaimer : Of course, I ensure the other party is willing and is single/divorced.

As I progress on to 2nd year of my engineering studies, I wonder how I have lost my moral compass and entered an emotional void. My deepest fear is that one day, the Mr Hyde in me takes over and I lose myself. 

I am the architect of my own destruction

I admit, this is going to be a rant which will be quite haphazard and not exactly coherent.

So it seems now we are having this NUS Evergreen group where all the lost singles are able to find hope at romance. Then how about the LGBT people? The way I see it, it seems that whenever there seem to be a "missed connection" post that is LGBT in nature, people tend to make disparaging remarks like "please don't turn this page into Grindr" etc, while if the post if hetero in nature, people all swarm and give encouraging comments. So, don't try to insinuate that we are desperate, weird and gross when you straight people have proved yourselves to be more fucked up than us. 

I have just been through a particular orientation camp, and the only thing I can say about it is that it was excessively "hetero-desperado". It was as though people were hungry and desperate about the opposite gender. Intrusive HTHT and traffic light games. And yes I left the camp halfway. I cannot stand being in a camp pretending to be someone I am not. 

Personally, had not been the existence of Qrientation, I will feel extremely lost and lonely in this campus. Then again, we all know that Grindr and Jackd are highly sexed up. So now that the straight world have their little Evergreen group, when will the LGBT community on campus have their little group where lost singles can have a shot at romance? *shrugs*

Being an evergreen guy for so long, sometimes I was thinking if I should turn to tinder or any other dating site since it is rather convenient ( I am quite desperate actually ) but each time I always want to register, it makes me feel as though I have given up looking for my significant other and have to resort to searching only online as a last resort. It also makes me doubt if it is really that effective? Will the relationship appears fake? Hope to hear some advice.

Hello friends, the NUS Evergreen Club is finally here! Check it out at https://www.facebook.com/nusevergreenclub
Now we can plan all the fun activities we want to do in school.

I am an evergreen too. I liked a guy last year, took the initiative and confessed to him but got rejected. I was very depressed at that time. I cried a lot and found it hard to do my day-to-day activities, pay attention in lectures, etc. I thought I would never be able to get over him. However, time is the greatest healer. Over the past few months, I learnt to accept reality and moved on in my life. Now I am a happy person again, just as I was before I met him. 
Most importantly, I learnt that it is perfectly fine to be single. It must surely feel great to be in a relationship, be in love with someone who loves you back and have a companion who cares about you. However, being single is not bad either. It teaches you how to love yourself before loving anyone else. Better not to rush in love. You will meet the right person one day. All in good time.
As my favourite quote says - Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift. That's why it is called the present. So to all the singles out there - don't worry about being single or evergreen. Don't brood over your past or be anxious about the future. Enjoy your singlehood and let's have lots of fun in the NUS Evergreen Club - go picnicking, fly kites, play frisbee at Town Green!

P.S. I guess singles who are not evergreen can join too. After all, going through a break-up is as harsh as being rejected in the first and they deserve to join in the fun too. The more people, the better. They can give the evergreens some valuable advice and tips as well. ;)
However, I still prefer the name to be NUS Evergreen Club instead of NUS Singles Club or NUS Green Club (sounds more like an environmental awareness club).

I had this girlfriend once who was a burden to me. Everywhere I went she followed, even to toilets just to make sure I wasnt planning to run away from her. But in the end, at the end of the day, when she return to the home, things are just so peaceful. My SAR-21, I am thankful for you
-
 
I'm sick and tired of my guy friends complaining that girls have it better. It is only the pretty girls that can have it all.

Comparing guys who can't get a partner and ugly girls, ugly girls have it worse. Unlike men, an ugly girl is pretty much stuck for life. You guys can work harder, get good jobs and earn more to increase your attractiveness. A fat and ugly girl is more devastating than a nerdy guy. The partner she can attract assuming if she can get one will be those at the bottom of the barrel.

I'm far too deep in the gay closet. So it's nice when I woke up this morning to see so many of my friends - NUS, poly, sec school, CCAs - change their profile pictures to rainbow. It makes me feel less alone. Thank you. Some day maybe I'll have the courage to come out.

The groundbreaking news that was (not so surprisingly) relegated to page 32 of today's Straits Times World section makes me feel a nudge deep inside to share this story of mine.

I'm pretty close to my old man, kind of his favorite daughter and always accompanied him for runs and outside makan. It was no different when he was hospitalised with a minor heart attack a couple of months back. There was one afternoon I was alone with him in the room and he was going on cheerfully about the places my ah gong brought him around when he was a boy. 

After a while the conversation changed and he began to reminisce about the fond memories he had of a friend he grew up with from pri school up to uni. All sorts of stuff that ranged from getting caught by the discipline master for drawing on the school walls, accidentally breaking windows while playing soccer and running away, even going fishing in the longkangs and streams near where they lived. In secondary school and his times in NJC, they helped each other get through some tough times like when my dad's rebellious streak got him into a big falling out with grandpa and he stayed at his friend's place for an entire week. Or when they each had their own relationship issues, having each other to lean on through the break-ups. They didn't get enlisted in the same camp for national service but they were pretty much go-to company on most bookouts. Sticking together, they even enrolled for uni in the same dept of business admin course (now the nus biz school). Throughout all this, my dad had this wistful look in his eyes and seemed to be looking at a point infinitely far away.

Out of the blue, I casually mentioned "if you guys are still best pals, how come I've never seen Uncle WK before?" Suddenly he paused and became silent for a while. Then in a hushed tone he told me: "J, I'll tell you something that I've never told anyone before not even your mum". 

He started to recall in vivid detail what happened a couple of months after ord-ing, when they went on a trip to phuket with their mutual bunch of JC friends. One of the nights they were out, all of them ended up in a disco (that's what clubs were called back then). The night ended abruptly when a Caucasian guy repeatedly harassed one of their friends. In her defense, WK got into a major scuffle with the guy, ending up getting cuts on his shoulder, a broken nose and bruises near his eye. It only didn't get any worse because my dad managed to pull the guy off before the management came over. The night ended abruptly and they were bounced out. Back in the hotel room, my dad spent a good while fixing WK up with some first-aid. 

As he was applying the bandages, he said "You know, thanks for taking care of me, all these years I don't know what I'd have done without you around".

To this my dad casually replied "Nah it's nothing, I know you'd have done the same for me likewise without even asking". Being slightly drunk too, he was unaware when WK placed a hand on his thigh until he suddenly leaned in to kiss him. 

My dad was stunned and immediately pulled back. Unable to process what just happened, my dad violently shoved him away before storming out of the room. 

WK trailed him to the beach where my dad was sitting by the water. There was a long moment of silence before my dad demanded to explain what had just happened. 

In a stutter, WK said "I don't know. I guess I've felt something for you all this while and I'm sorry it came out that way. I was just so drunk there I must have lost control and I didn't mean to force that on you"

"So are you telling me you're gay?!"

"No, I mean I don't know. I don't know how to explain this. You're the only guy I've ever felt like this for. And I did really fall in love with Jane and Mei Yuan back then"

"Don't give me this bullshit. I can't believe that you've been pretending to be someone else all this while."

"That's not true! Everything we've gone through is real!"

"Real? Now I don't even know who you are anymore"

"Can we just pretend this didn't happen?"

"Yeah whatever it is, I don't want to talk to you again"

With that my dad headed back to the room and it was pretty much silence between them for the rest of the trip.

For a while my dad avoided him and when it came to uni, things improved but they only met together with mutual friends and it was just never the same between them. They did attend each other's weddings though but it was never more than casual acquaintance. In his own words, my dad said he decided to put up a wall between them. 

"So have you still been keeping in touch with Uncle WK?" I broke the silence that followed.

That's when I realised my dad's eyes were slightly wet.

"No and I wish I had. 2 years ago, one of our friends informed me that he had passed away from heart failure." He paused. "I should have been there."
 
"Hmm yeah well but there was no way you'd have known he was ill." 

"No that's not what I meant, I should have been there for him all these years. Whether or not he was really gay or it was just a spur of the moment.. I never should have abandoned him.. he was the one friend I confided everything in. The one friend who never judged me for whatever I did or how I felt. The one friend who believed in me and all the really stupid dreams I had."
 
And then as the tears flowed, "No one has ever understood me like he did. It's like we instantly clicked all the time."

"Not even mum?"

"No, not even mum."

It was pretty much silence for the rest of my visit.

My dad passed on 3 weeks ago and his story constantly bugs me. I came from a pretty liberal all-girls school here before NUS but it just struck me how in our 'first-world' country and several others in the world, we are still pretty unaccepting of people who don't stick closely to the stereotypes set out by society when it comes to love and relationships. Sure, things might be slowly getting better here but it's still very much a two dimensional affair when we talk or joke casually about relationships and sexuality.. the real stuff's all hush-hush behind doors. 

The thing is no two people are the same and that's what should be beautiful about life. This isn't even about the whole brouhaha over LGBT rights or religion. It's about how we can't and shouldn't box the way we form connections with every one of our fellow human beings out there in the world. I'm lucky to have a life partner for about 3 years and yes he's also my boy who I hope to walk down the aisle with (we're both graduating (; ). But I wouldn't have a moment's hesitation sharing my life with another girl if I really found her to be my soulmate (and yes, it's really amazing how he understands that too)

I hope that when we've reached our parents age having growing kids of our own studying and working, that they won't be judged for who they choose or choose not to fall in love or even lust over. That Singapore would truly be a place they can call Home.

 There can be many reasons why that happened, but I think the most likely reason is because she does not like you in a romantic way. They assumed the friendship was purely platonic, so when they noticed signs that you are falling from them, they pull back. It is also possible that they didn't feel as close to you as you were to them, so you might have subconsciously try to progress the friendship beyond their comfort zone.
Whatever the reason, move on and focus on the people who are and who will be in your life.

In a bit of a dilemma here and in need of advice.

Chanced upon a friend's - friend A's - chat log with another friend, friend B through rather unscrupulous means (can't reveal too much or else I would probably give myself away). Chat log contains nasty things about not just me, but another friend - friend C - as well. And I thought that friend A was our close friend, and genuinely liked us. Turns out not, judging by the chat log, and the nasty things said.

Should I tell friend C what is going on and reveal the contents, or should I just keep quiet about the entire incident, since how I found the chat logs was wrong?

TLDR: found friend bitching about everybody else through unscrupulous means. Tell others, or keep quiet?
-
 
The same thing keeps repeating itself. Somehow I will get close to a certain girl. We will text almost everyday for months. Then out of a sudden the girl stops texting for no good reason. And it's always when I start to fall for the person... Why?
-
 
With regards to , actually the guy did a series of obvious jerk-like stuff and I did gave him some days to explain himself (which he didn't) before proceeding to cut all connections. Don't always assume that guys don't get it. If he is interested, he wouldn't stopped talking. It is pretty obvious that he did those actions because he already planned to cut connections. I just happened to do it before him.
-
 
. Hmmm I did spoke to him in person personally and he seemed interested in knowing more about my hobbies etc as well. He also approached me to talk while I was waiting for my bus. However as we were from different departments, we didn't really get a lot of chances to interact. Other than the few instances we happened to knock off at the same timing, he did not really initiate efforts to contact me even after I had added him on fb. Thus, I am reconsidering my decision to initiate conversations in the case that he may just see me as a colleague and nothing more. His relationship status is unknown to me as well too so I didn't want to adopt a strong approach in case he may feel uncomfortable. He isn't from NUS by the way (even harder to catch up with one another after school starts) that's why i decided to take a step back and see how things goes. This will probably be my last post regarding this issue, any advice will be greatly appreciated!

The first time we sat together at U Town green sharing a Starbucks frap. I remember that day very well. It was something that I didn't expect to happen. Subsequently, I found myself spending more time with you at U Town.There were days where work was crazy, and you would make time to meet me around CLB. We talked it out, cried together. Late night phone calls, crashing each others lecture and surprise Starbucks deliveries.
Then came the day where we were walking to KR Station. You asked if we could take this friendship further. Elation ? Sheer Rapture ? I cannot describe this feeling. It seemed like things were falling in place. As the semester progressed, things took a turn. You introduced me to an exchange student you met at U Town pool. I was jealous, and overly protective. But I left it as it is, after all, everyone needs their personal space. As weeks passed, I had friends telling me that he was spending his nights over at your room. I was crushed.
I was pissed, super pissed and sad. But I decided that I could talk things out, and try to forgive you in whatever little ways I could. But you just blocked me out of my life. Then came semester 2, we met again. I didn't expect you to run towards and hug me in the middle of U town, crying. You introduced me to your boyfriend. I was confused honestly. I asked [why] you cheated, and you began growing defensive. Saying I didn't make enough time for you, and that he understood you more than I did. For all that it's worth, I don't understand why.
It's been 2 semesters now. And i'm still wondering why. I've experienced physical pain, but I must admit that this emotional pain is something that I cannot come to terms with yet.
Was it worth it ?

The person who posted . Don't worry too much about it. It's a sleep disorder called sexsomnia classified under parasomnia. It happens to me too. Like you, I used to be scared what would happen if I were sharing a bed or a room, but that's has never happened. It happens only when I'm sleeping alone or with my partner, so I guess subconsciously I need to know I'm in a safe environment. My pillow doesn't mind it and none of my partners have complained so far. They quite like it infact, sometimes I get told in the morning or right after that it was pretty good and most times I have no recollection of it, well unless it's one of those times where I wake up midway and go, oh I'm doing it again.

I am not straight. I have a crush that I tried hard to forget for the past few years. Sometimes I can't decide if it's better for me to not get over her and stay single(aka stay asexual) or getting over her and dating some other girls - being officially in a lesbian relationship. 
-
 
 I did that to 1 guy before. The reason is because of his actions. Think harder and see if you said anything wrong. That might be a cause...

It's 4.33am and I still can't sleep. I hope I don't die too young. Anyone has any advice for combatting insomnia?

 I personally think it really depends on how familiar the two parties are, what sort of a person you are and how you approach the initiation. Desperate and attention seeking too seems a bit far-fetched unless you do something extreme like flirting. Desperate and attention seeking ones usually don't initiate most of the time? They just want to capture the attention of others, hoping others to approach them? (Though that doesn't necessarily mean they're desperate or attention seeking as they may be interested in you.) It seems to me more likely that you are either sending him signals that you just want to be friends or are interested in him. 

I don't represent all guys but I don't think your perception of a decent girl fits mine. For me personally, it'll be more towards not cheating, not having FWBs etc. (Nothing objectively wrong doing so though.)

All that being said, you should just be yourself and see how it goes for a while. Just be attentive to the signals you are sending.

when I was evergreen, I didn't have much expectations for a bf. It was more like he must love me more than I love him = he love me first. Meaning he has to tell me. Then he must be healthy (cannot be a burden otherwise why would I go into a r/s to suffer, skin disease also NO) and follows basic hygiene. Must have similar education level as mine for communication. Money, talent and looks doesn't matters. Even if 15 cm shorter than me I also wouldn't mind. (I actually liked someone shorter than me once, but he feels threatened by my height, so we didn't start.)

After my first relationship (it was a toxic one) During the r/s I told him I will want him forever until the day he don't want me anymore. And really one day he broke up with me and my feelings for him is dead. But I started to change my view. NO for insecure and indecisive guys. They LOVE TO BRING YOU DOWN TO THEIR LEVEL AND LOVE TO SEE YOU SUFFER WITH THEM but offers no consolence, however when they are sad they expect you to be there for them and is paranoid over everything you say. Get lost!

Hey  给你一杯忘情水. Translation: here is a cup of water that will let you forget. Cheers. 

People have their reasons. I've done that before... But I don't think you're someone I know. He isn't so lyrical.

Something embarassing.
I hired a honey trap against my cheating fiance. Just days ago a friend of mine (NUS) was nosey and seemed to know a fair bit about my current situation. Turns out she almost became the honey trap though she rejected the assignment as she is acquainted to me and my fiance. 
Singapore's too small!

I've been trying to find a gf for awhile. Not successful.

So I thought, since I got urges, i'll find a FWB until I get a gf. I'm definitely above average attractive, people tell me that. I thought I was single mainly cuz I'm not the easiest person to live with, but since I'm not looking for a gf, FWB should be a lot easier, right?

But surprise surprise - finding a FWB is just as hard. went through a few potential people only to have one back out last minute cuz the thought of going physical suddenly frightened her, another not very attractive so we've only gone out once, and one more but things are going slowly.

So I hear people say Tinder is the perfect hook up app. And I concur - I mean how deep can swiping left and right on a person be? you see picture, decide if you're physically attracted, and swipe left or right. Sometimes the pic can't be seen clearly so you wanna see the others, fine. other than that you take no more than 5 seconds per person. Except for that irritating bitch who puts her doggie or cat as their profile pic.

Fine, Tinder gives you many OTMs (opportunities to meet). Then I realise 'Tinder is a hook-up app' is a lie. People on tinder actually tell me they're there to look for a boyfriend, they wanna 'be friends first', they're not into hookups and the rest of the traditional bullcrap.

..........................I mean, say what?! you're here on Tinder to look for a BOYFRIEND for a committed relationship?......................................... and here's the other kicker. it seems like 80% of people I meet on Tinder are like this.

........................whaaaAAAAATTT?...........

so, respond, anonymously if you will; ladies lemme know, is it true that fewer girls actually want a FWB? or are ladies just simply more discreet about it?

I mean just looking at craigslist and locanto, it seems like the list of advertisments of women looking for men is drastically less than the list of Men for Women. Do women simply just want sex less in general?

I met this guy online. 

We were both in U.S. at that time, but stayed in different states. We texted each other for a few weeks. Then the day came when I had to return to Singapore. 

A few months later, he made a week long trip to Singapore (for family reasons) and we decided to meet up with each other for the first time for dinner. That's it.

I thought we would break communication after that and forget about each other's existence, but no - to my surprise, he texted me a couple of weeks later. 

Our texting continued - though replies were infrequent, our conversation never really 'ended.' 

I went for a little holiday to the U.S. a few weeks later to visit my cousins over there, and decided to meet up with him for the second time for a quick meal, since my cousins happened to stay in the same state as he did.

I decided to text him a few days after we met again because he didn't, and I didn't want him to have to initiate the conversation again just because he's a guy, even though I was really scared to (but I was even more scared of the fact that we might really cut off communication once and for all).

I won't deny that I like him. In fact, I'd say a bit too much. And I know I'm silly for feeling that way. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, we're still texting each other. Though I have to say, our conversations are pretty shallow and slow. But it doesn't matter.

Sometimes I can't help but wonder why we're even talking to each other - really, why? Even with the 14,000 km distance between us, with uncertainty of ever meeting again in the future. It's been more than half a year from the first time we texted.

I do it because I really like and admire him. I thoroughly enjoy his presence, be it online or offline. 

But why does he bother keeping in touch with me? He may feel the same way, but I honestly feel that it's highly unlikely; I just can't imagine it, and his replies aren't exactly super enthusiastic. And that's why this question keeps floating in my mind. WHY? Why else? Maybe he'd just like to keep a friend like me?

I know it's hard to say with such vague details, but if you were in his situation, why would you keep the text conversation going with a girl? Especially one who you first met online? One whom you'd potentially never be able to meet again in real life, in the near future?

P.S. This situation is rated PG.

Is there anyone who has the guts to set up an NUS evergreen (singles) club? It can be as simple as a Facebook group which uses your NUS email to authenticate.

We can do fun activities in school like flying kites or picnicking at Town Green and other random stuff! :) I personally feel better in a group setting too.

i just want to ask all the guys, if a guy breaks up with you and tells you to cut off all contact with him and doesnt answer your messages even though you still want to be friends with him, then a few months later he suddenly starts liking your instagram photos, what does this mean? he was never so active on instagram and this happened more than once. to add on, he's already attached to another person.

just wanna know what the hell this guy is trying to do. thanks in advance.

Question to guys out there. What do you think of girls who take the first initiative to ask guys out/ talk to guys they meet during school event, through mutual friends ( without any intro from their friend though) compared to girls that guys ask out. Do the fomer come across as being desperate or attention seeking? Sometimes you hear comments about how a certain girl is different from the rest. In a sense that she is decent and not willing to be manipulated. She's only after love and nothing else and sex after marriage. There are times when I'm tempted to approach guys to just talk and get to know them as friends but I'm afraid of giving them the wrong impression that I'm an easy going girl who is just after sex and someone to love. It doesn't help that I'm naive and have a baby face. Because of this reason and certain pass experience, I find it hard to talk to my guy friends or ask them for help in case I give them the wrong idea impression.
This post is not meant to hurt anyone and I just want all your honest opinion.

How can a person you have known for so many years become a stranger suddenly?
How can one person who used to converse enthusiastically with you just refuse to communicate with you right now? With no reasons given. 
What am I to you now? A stranger with memories?
Why can't I find anyone to replace you?
Why do i feel pain whenever I hear your name or see you?
Please let me forget you asap. I need to get on with my life.

Since the new flavour of the week seems to be riddles i will give you a really simple one that is classic. Those who know try not to spoil and those who don't try not to google! 

So ah girl was a very nice and pleasant girl lah but accidents happen  and she got into a car crash and died. At her funeral ah girl was so popular thousands of people turned up including her bestie meimei and ah girl's sister ah lin. 

They were both grieving until alamak got they see this super uber handsum guy more charming than Chris Pratt and better looking than Christian bale and richer than Bill gates showed up and being good sister/friend they resisted their attraction but everyone else oogled anyway so they secretly did even if they denied their unquenchable lust and obsession. However neither of them talked to him.
 
One week later Mei Mei invited ah Lin over for a sleepover and killed her. 

What is the motive? And don't worry this is contrary to popular belief not a psychopath test. Snopes debunked it. Just have fun because even if you get it right you are not a psychopath... Or are you ;)

I have never hold a girl's hand until recently during the freshman camp. Somehow, I always associate holding hand with the opposite gender as intimate or may  be I am just being too conservative.

I've commented publicly on quite a few confessions before, particularly those relating to love and life (gotten quite a lot of likes which makes me happy because I believe it shows my comments are well received and advice dispensed is sound), but I guess this is my turn to seek advice anonymously.

To many people, I lead an extremely good life. I graduated with a first class honours from a faculty people regard as one of the top two in NUS (although I tend to disparage such opinions - I think every degree is valuable and every calling is meaningful in its own way), finishing 2nd in my cohort. I've published in journals and won accolades, scholarships and prizes. I'm well known in my faculty and it appears like I've no lack of friends or social life. My facebook page displays positive statuses, posts from friends sharing things with me or various tags. People regard me as a kind and happy person, for various reasons e.g. I openly share my notes with juniors and people tend to turn to me for advice, whether on academics, love or personal issues. 

And yet, I'm deeply miserable and depressed quite a lot of the time, something which has been exacerbated by the holidays. I've not shared this with many people but I come from a broken home, with an abusive father and long suffering mother. It hasn't helped that my father is currently being charged with two criminal offences and that I have had to bear the burden of advising him how to escape liability, liaising with the police and having had to generally be the pillar of support for everyone else in the family. Some of my family members, including myself, may further be charged with being complicit in these criminal activities (abetment) - something I worry day and night about. I'm not rich, and am actually in debt due to course fees and paying for my mother's medical expenses. I feel even more miserable looking at all my friends travelling the world on their graduation trips, with nary a care in the world, while I am stuck here having to deal with all this s__t. Even now, I can't rest, having to 'study' various sections of the Penal Code in an attempt to help my family.  I wish I could be like any normal student from my faculty and resent the fact that I had to finance myself throughout university, working and studying. I don't look forward to the future at all and hate myself for accepting a job which will bring great financial remuneration at the expense of my values and beliefs. Deep down, I want to accept a lower paying job where I can impact society and help people with what I do. I also look back on my university days and see nothing but pain and sorrow, as I worked myself to the point of insanity and misery to achieve all I have now. I'll admit now I should feel grateful for all I have, but pardon me for feeling a little like I haven't found what I really want - peace and happiness. It has been strife, pushing myself and fighting to survive all the way. At this point, I sometimes feel like killing myself - that is how much I want all of this to end.

To compound matters, I feel desperately lonely. Yes, I have my friends. But quite a lot of them feel like sycophantic suck ups or people who want something or other from me at times. I'm thankful for those genuine ones but even with them, I feel a huge void left in my heart. I want a girlfriend but it just hasn't worked out. I don't think girls like a guy who is obese, who has issues, generally doesn't dress himself well except on occasion (simply because I don't have time to, I can't afford to and honestly, I really don't care) and who isn't rich. I've tried tinder and okcupid but generally, responses have not been favourable when they know that for now, I am unable to provide financially for them and beyond that, I'm not good looking (I've done the whole improve my health thing, lost a lot of weight a few years ago though I regained some of it, so I hope no one lectures me on losing weight. I can do it, want to do it, but not at this moment where so much is going on). I even was explicitly told by one that since I'm not a ______ yet, I can't provide for her and even though I'm a nice guy, she doesn't want to date me, especially since I'm not handsome. Sad to say, I'm becomingly increasingly jaded with the superficial society we live. Of course, I'm sure I could play up my successes but what would the point of that be? Being with someone who doesn't love you for you but the paper and titles you hold? And I'm not looking for friends with benefits either. Several girls have approached me with regard to this, but as tempting as such a convenience sounds, sex does not equate real love. And I worry that as I enter the working world, the chance of finding someone who loves me for me will slowly evaporate. I'm wondering whether something is wrong with me - I'm a great conversationalist, I don't lack confidence and I'd like to think I know how to flirt. Are weight, money and status such important factors? Please tell me because I'd like to know. Maybe I'll revise my views on the issue someday because I understand girls need someone who can 'take care of them.' But surely, someone's ability to take care of another extends beyond just finances? Aren't things like loyalty, fidelity and stability important too? Personally, I'd really like someone to give me a chance so that I could show them the real me, even though I must admit I'm not very stable :P

I broke up with my ex-girlfriend a few years ago. She is the only person I know who has loved me for who I am and nothing else. She saw me through my dark days, she was there when I had nothing and was a 'failure' (for various reasons). She was my everything as well. However, something terrible happened and we broke up. We tried to make things work after the terrible event but it was just never the same. I miss her because she was my best friend as well (longer than girlfriend). I miss her everyday. I just want that friend, that companionship and most importantly, that someone who never judged me for anything beyond my character. I miss that someone who would laugh at my achievements and pseudo mock me for my successes. To this day, I question whether giving her up, even despite the fact we could never work out, was the right choice. She's getting married this year. To her, if you see this, will you at least be friends with me? -.- 

Thanks for reading this if you've read this far. I love this platform because it allows us to put down our masks and show the world who we truly are. Thank you admins for the hard work you put into this and everyone who supports this page and keeps it going (including serial commentators and just anyone who 'likes' anything :P).

I'll end by saying that it really is true when people say never judge a book by its cover. And that love is the most important thing so cherish it. I don't know where I'm going to go from here but I hope that I find meaning in life. Currently, I'm playing with the idea of applying for a job where I can help people in trouble (this is really vague because I want to remain anonymous) although people will call me crazy for passing up 'greatness.' But maybe, just maybe, it is time I did something for myself and followed my heart.

It's quite common to hear of guys who have ambiguous relationships with different girls at the same time. Not saying it's always intentional, but they often end up giving false hope while "trying to get to know each other better". Sometimes there's already a girlfriend in the picture, or someone he is "amber" with, just that the poor girl doesn't know or fully understand. I think there's even a term called "fishing" and hoping to hook as many "fishes" as possible?! Do  reflect on your own behaviour and if you realise that you're guilty of doing this (maybe not consciously), do remember that these are actual humans you are toying with and they have emotions too. Some may be trying their best to look for the right partner to spend their life with, not just for a casual fling or the excitement of a chase.

So was just wondering.. Recently had person A come talk to me cause person A thought that I did someting really well and we talked for a few days, seemed like a nice person. We talked about normal things. But person A kinda stopped talking after finding out I was attached. So do people just talk to you with the intention of dating you or having a rs? Do friendships no longer matter? (PS my partner knew about the convo and was fine with it)

Hey guys feeling kinda lost here.
Im a NUS student, and I have this best fren whom ive known since JC. Let's call him J.  I have always been more academically inclined than J, in terms of grades. We've been talking to each other everyday and he confessed to me since end of J2, but ive been friendzoning him due to superficial reasons like looks, wealth and academic achievements (he lacks in all these areas) -pls dont judge, im sure im not the only one here who have rejected a guy for these sort of reasons. *but he's the nicest, most sincere guy I've ever met, trust me. 

But only earlier this year, I experienced my greatest downfall, and I was in really big distress, and I still currently am. It wont be convenient for me to disclose what kind of issues i faced but it was smth really severe and life changing. I felt so so alone and afraid, but J was there for me all along, did not leave me in the lurch , not even once. I was starting to rely alot on him emotionally, and jus needed him by my side the whole time. 

That was when i also started developing feelings for him and decided to give him a chance since he was so sincere to me. We've been tgt for 4-5 months, and I'm still struggling with my personal issues.

But i feel guilty because lately, ive been having thoughts like: 
-Will J ever have a future ? Because he has been rejected by all the local universities, his A level results aren't spectacular. His family background is in a mess, and the next step after his NS is unconfirmed..he mentioned about applying to one of the private instituitions after NS but haiz.. I dk , i jus feel that everything's gonna be bleak for us if he stayed this way. 

-In NS, he spends like 3/4 of his time sleeping. Idk what to think about that but i feel scared that he's not even half as worried as I am for his future! And because of that we dont spend alot of time tgt too , i feel really isolated :X

On a side note, he treats me really really well. Like he's not wealthy and all but will try his best to get me things i want, and always there for me when im sad or depressed. 

Seriously, what shd i do? Girls, would u continue dating ur bf if he was giving u this kind of insecure feeling for the future? Also my parents are an issue. They expect me to date some one better like with academic achievements, looks, etc.. And my mum hinted to me befode she'll not approve if I am with J. Altho its easy for everyone to say ignore what ur parents think but theyre my parents , i still respect them alot afterall.

So.. What shd i do..?

Never, in the past, did I think I would turn to this platform of anonymity to seek advice (or rant) but I guess there’s always a first time right?

In the eyes of most people, I led an extremely blessed life comprising of awesome grades, great interpersonal skills, relatively pleasant looks, always surrounded by friends, and most recently, started my career in a very lucrative industry of my interest. People always describe me as a happy-go-lucky person, devoid of worries and with a smile always plastered on my face. However, therein lies the problem. Deep down within the labyrinth of my heart lies a very vulnerable and depressed me. Happiness, to me, has become some sort of a social obligation. Whenever I tried to confide in someone, phrases like ‘you can get sad one mehh?’ comes out of them. This compounded matters and I start to learn how to live in a façade, hiding my innermost fears and feelings away from everyone. The only person who knew me and saw me through my dark days when everything spiraled out of control was my ex-girlfriend, whom for various reasons (the breaking point was LDR where she went to London to pursue her undergraduate law degree) broke up with me 5 years ago. She was my best friend, my confidant, the only person who understood me and knows when I’m feeling down even though I have a smile on my face. I miss her (even if not in a relationship way but at least as a platonic soulmate), her companionship and her ability to understand me more than any others (am I dumb to do so?). I tried dating after we broke up but I just cant find back the same connection. Recently, I just got wind that she’s engaged. If you’re reading this, I know there is a reason for you keeping your distance, but could we be friends again?

I’m tired of living in this façade. Just afraid that one day, it will just overwhelm me, forcing me to be more reclusive as I find it harder to control my emotions. 

Sorry for the long post. I’ll end off with a verse from adele: Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you, too. Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said. Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead..

Still in ns now but im reading this daily. I find it very interesting to learn about the future school ill be studying in. On a seperate note, ill be joining electrical eng and is one of those people who are scared of being forever alone. I have thought of joining ccas clubs or maybe even the council(kinda motivated to lead as i wasnt given the opportunity in the army) due to injury. One last thing, do girls in nus judge you for the job you do in the army? Im a clerk who got injured in bmt after chiongsua and will probably not be able to run for the rest of my life.( i love swimming and can swim well too! Is there a swim club?) sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading and i look forward to your opinions!!

My girlfriend and I had quite a good relationship for nearly 2 years. Then she behaved differently, because of "work". Sure, one should end a relationship to focus on work... So we broke up. Shortly after she presented her new love. In the past 6 months she already had 3 new boyfriends. After months of grief, I do feel great to see she can't find one as good as I.

I have always wanted to go SEP since i entered NUS and recently, i tell my parents about it and they are full of objections. They don't see the reason why i have to go overseas study when i can actually study here though i have already explained to them. And i haven't even tell them i wanted to go sep alone as none of my friend wanted to go into the uni i have set my eyes on. What should i do!?

To OP  

Firstly, the cliche advice of 'Be yourself' is very often misunderstood. It doesn't mean you don't change for the better. It means to change within your comfort level. It's a little oxymoronic but I will explain more later. I will try and answer your problems.

1. 'But the conversations with them would seem so awkward'
Make her laugh. It's one thing to get her to talk comfortably with you. It's another thing for her to enjoy talking to you. Making her laugh will make her remember how much she enjoys talking to you. Don't be shy to say, 'Hey, wanna hear a joke?' Even if she doesn't laugh, she knows you're deliberately trying to make her happy. 

2. 'But I would often fade away in conversations' 
If you met a new girl and you are in a social setting, pick-up lines can be helpful! If it's someone you know like a classmate or colleague, remembering the things she says helps. If she mentioned a TV show she's watching, ask her when the show airs then ask her how was last night's episode the next day. Better yet, watch the show. You can talk about the show and even tell her why you didn't like the show. The fact that you watched it just because of her is flattering enough.

3. 'Yes, I am indeed despo' 
Any good advice involves some effort by you. Girls like confident guys and confidence is not about portraying a facade. It's about the willingness to put aside your fear. Be it changing for the better or showing the real you. 

Some other tips that might help you!

4. Okay, so you strike up a conversation and have her number. You can tell if she likes you by eye contact. You know how people tend not to look at each other in the eye for too long? Well, look at her a little longer than a random glance then give her a little smile before looking away. Don't stare! Just don't be afraid to show that you like looking at her.

5. If you are getting the signals from her, ask her out. Just the two of you. Yes, it's a date. It could be a movie, drink... Don't treat it as if it's a big deal, as if by saying yes she'll be making a big commitment to you. If she declines, say, 'Hey, it's just a movie/cafe/dinner, I'm not asking you to marry me laa.'

6. What's next? You just let it happen naturally. If you've gotten this far and the girl has been showing the right signs, it will happen naturally. No need for confessions. You may be surprised at how easy it was. Which it should be if the guy and girl like each other. This is how mature adults do it. 

All the best! I'm not active here but if you find this helpful and found a relationship, do help other dudes!

It's been almost a year since I met my girlfriend, and it's been like four months since we've been together, yet I still find it really hard to believe we're together. I'm not here to be a douchebag to show anything off to anyone, I just wanted to express how grateful I am to have her in my life.

We met one another during orientation camp (See, this is why it can't hurt to participate in more activities and meet more people. You don't have to be loaded with motives, just go with an open mind.), and luckily for me, she was a freshie in my OG. I had a really good time with my OG, and I had an equally awesome time with her as well. She's a beautiful girl with a beautiful heart, caring, really understanding and child-like at times (Which makes her really fun to annoy).

Fast forward eight months, we've found each other in one another's arms, and it's a really blissful feeling. I'll admit it's not easy trying to balance work and each other, but we eventually found a way to keep things working. I  hope that things will continue to work out for us both, especially now that I don't stay on campus with her anymore.

Cheers to all those who are in love, and for those who aren't yet, don't despair. Just find 10 seconds of courage and little windows of opportunity to make a move. And hey, if things don't work out, your life will still go on and you'll find someone else. The world's a harsh enough place, so hey, chin up and smile! You never know who's looking (:

P.S. Tembusu College is a wonderful, magical place. It's really a Home of Possibilities (;

Single for 24 years here. After much trial and error, I can only conclude that girls don't like shy, awkward introverted guys, and I was only living a delusion in which girls would reach out to me instead of the other way round.

People say, just talk to more girls, eventually you will find the one. Which was what I did. But the conversations with them would seem so awkward because I am shy and I don't know what to talk about. Sometimes girls would even shun me for making them feel awkward with the silence and weird conversation topics.

People say, just be more outgoing, join more activities to meet people, and eventually girls. Which was what I did. But I would often fade away in conversations because I am shy, and I will often observe that girls only pay attention to guys who talk the most, and would find them funny. When I talk to the girls? Well, not so funny. 

People say, just don't be so despo, girls can sense it. Which was what I did, or at least I thought I did. After all, if I really wasn't despo, I wouldn't be seeking help and relationship advice from people, right? Also the very fact that I haven't gotten a girlfriend after two and a half decades on earth signals an alarming 'Yes, I am indeed despo'.

People who are less good looking could go for plastic surgery in a bid to become more attractive.

I guess the day I get a girlfriend would only come when they offer plastic surgery with personality alteration as a package.

Seeing and hearing all the office politics at work makes me so disillusioned about the working world. At my workplace, they ostracise a particular middle-aged woman because her work attitude/performance isn't too good(she tends to make mistakes at work),she's rumoured to be a flirt because she prefers talking to men at work and also at the company's D&D, she went to the director's table and tried to introduce herself to everyone there.Then there are also rumours spreading about her having an incestual relationship with her son who works at the same place. Factually, she's a divorcee and I've talked to her before and she seems like a nice lady and shes lunches alone in the pantry almost everyday. My colleague(quite an old auntie) told me to 'avoid her because her heart isn't good' and 'she's like a chilli padi,craving for sex all the time'. Why do such obviously untrue rumours about a divorcee spread?And even if she enjoys talking to men, why do her personal choices, unrelated to work, matter to them anyway? What if she's just really depressed and lonely from her divorce and this therefore affects her work performance and also behavior with men? Isn't that a more rational conjecture compared to jumping to conclusions that 'her heart isn't good'? 
I feel like when you tend to be not too good at work, the people at my workplace tend to be less inclined to treat you well and also there's this unspoken rule that it's okay to gossip and be snappy at people who are not efficient at work. Good work performance means you'll get better treatment at the workplace.  
And then I notice office people like to get so caught up in stupid things like giving food/presents to the entire dept if they are back from an overseas trip. This is fine if you're generally sincere. But when ive heard a person talk shit about the other person and come back from trips with gifts for them, it just makes me feel really sickened,pissed off and terrified. I guess I have a lot to learn about adapting to the cold hard reality of the corporate world next time.

Now time for me to put in my two cents' worth of advice after reading a lot of the posts recently on being evergreen & wanting to be in a relationship:

TL;DR: Try to look at & evaluate people for who they are, not for the (sole) purpose of romancing them.

I am an evergreen girl myself, 22 years old this year; and if I were to be honest to myself, I would admit that I have always wanted to be in a relationship & have a boyfriend to see what the whole fuss of being in love was about.

But one thing a friend said has stuck with me ever since: "If you're only going to look at guys as meat to snap up, you're never going to treasure them for who they are, or even see them as the people they are." 

I would like to advise the same to guys who are afraid of being awkward when talking to girls (aim being to get close to girls just to see if they are girlfriend material) or girls who are just waiting for Mr. Right (snap out of the cliché too plz) to come along & chat you up. PLEASE STOP. People exist not so that you can just go through all of them to see who's meant for you. You can make all of them meant for you by cherishing their humanity,  friendship & companionship. 

I qualify this by stating that I don't mean that you have to be friends with every single person; I don't mean that everyone will have an equal standing in relationship with you - what I mean is just that please evaluate everyone based on who they are, not who you want to get together with. Don't get close to/start talking to someone just because s/he just seems like someone you could potentially love. It makes your life a lot less shallow than merely making acquaintances as a bridge to love & takes a lot of pressure off yourself. What will happen will happen. Cherish the moment.

To the OP of 

Please treasure him. I was in the very same situation as you. He wanted to continue pursuing his studies till 30, while I was already in the workforce. This would mean that I would probably not have kids. At the same time, I would also have to convert due to the nature of his religion. I thought it was the best way I could move forward. My family would also be happier if I were to end things with him. This was in spite of the fact that he stuck through all the difficult times with  me and loved me with all he had.

To be honest, I truly regretted breaking up with him. If I could turn time back, I would put aside all the practicality issue and stay by his side. This is what true love is supposed to be - "us against the world". Now I am still friends with him but I'm trying to win him back. Everyday, I'm praying and hoping that he would change his mind. 

So OP, don't be like me. The future can be built together. At the same time, you might want to consider motivating  him. Yes, our parents' opinions are important but also remember that we are adults now. How we want to live our lives, is entirely  up to us. When in doubt, always choose love. I hope you would take my advice into consideration. Wish you all the best ahead :)

It kind of confuses me as to why so many are eager to get into relationships, and are worried about their evergreen status. If anything else, I would actually like to return to being evergreen. In fact, I am dating somebody now (does it mean I have lost my evergreen status, even when it's not official?) and it is really not as fantastic as it seems, being in a relationship. I would very much rather be alone. But hey, I suppose different folks, different strokes, and different people want different things, and have different priorities in life.
-
 
So, seeing so many people confess about them being evergreen... I'm here to join them as well.

I'm female and contrary to the other commenters, I interact well with other people. However, I've never had any close guy friends (can't even friendzone people) and people I like never liked me back (even though I had been confessed to a few times). 

People always ask me why I'm still single (or they'd assume I'm attached), and honestly, I don't know why myself too. 

Anyone help?

There's this particular dude (current NUS student as well) whom I got acquainted with during NS. For a period of time shortly after ORD-ing, he was continually bugging me through Facebook/phone messages, asking how I was doing and pestering me to meet up with him for a meal. Initially thinking (naively) that he truly just wanted a simple catch-up, I agreed to the meet-up, which turned out to be nothing more than a pitch for an obscure "business" (in his words) he was involved in, merry-go-round fashion of course.

I did truly consider it (i.e. I did not simply shut myself out from what he was trying to convince me on) but eventually told him I wasn't interested. However, his messages to me continued; he would regularly ask me things like "How's your day?", "What have you been doing?", etc., and I would reply sincerely and sometimes try to carry on the conversations. Yet, the irritating part of this was that the messages would often stop at those few introductory lines/questions, never ever developing into any sort of meaningful conversation. He would initiate, and then I would try to continue, and then he'll be the one to effectively end the conversation by not following up with any substantial reply beyond superficial words. Imagine this cycle repeating itself at least once every few days or so! Eventually after quite a long while of this nonsense I got fed-up so I blocked him on Whatsapp and ignored his FB messages (did not block him on FB, though).

Nowadays, probably as a result of the teachings of the faculty he's enrolled in, on FB he is CONSTANTLY preaching about his "positive" outlooks on life, the importance of making money, his misplaced sense of "generosity" (seriously, anybody would be able to infer how pretentious his posts of this nature are upon reading them), etc., etc., etc. Every other day he posts something like this. Not to mention, his posts are often poorly-constructed, with "u"s replacing "you"s, first letters of each sentence not capitalized, and bad wording. Of course, nobody is perfect when it comes to this, but if one is constantly "encouraging" others on important matters such as life and finances on a social media platform, you would think he should at least take some care in ensuring that his posts aren't downright eyesores to those reading them, no?

The things he posts can get rather obnoxious. E.g. "If I am the boss, you should be asking what YOU can offer ME instead of the other way round", "Anybody wants to work for me?", etc. All this coming from him. And he's being completely serious. And, he's not even anywhere near graduation as of now. Granted, some successful people start being successful from a young age, but until this dude makes it in life, I won't count on him being the general public's to-go guru for insightful advice on life/money/success.

I keep him around on FB solely for his entertainment value. It sure is hard for someone as pretentious, obnoxious, and deluded as himself to NOT be entertaining.   ;)

I let a friend down a couple of times because I was busy with work and as such had to cancel outings that we'd planned in advance. Because of this, he started to distance himself from me, citing that I'd lost his trust. And I guess this "defriending" process was finally complete when a few days ago he walked right past me (we were walking in opposite directions, hence he couldn't have failed to see me) without a single sign of acknowledgement. We were good friends before this, hence it really hurt me deeply. I didn't expect that losing a friend in this manner would be so painful. People, please treasure your friends because you don't realize their importance in your life until they're gone. Don't find this out the hard way. I'm gonna miss him.

Anyone else who REALLY hates it when guy friends offer to pay for your meal, refuses to let you pay them and say that it's your treat the next time we meet?

I feel like I 欠人情 and it's just so annoying. Just AA and pay for your own share, isn't that a better thing?

I am finally ready to admit it. In hindsight, what we had was an emotional affair. 

It's been a year since you graduated and about half year since I saw you last. I have been wrecked with confusion and guilt, it doesn't help that we hold our moral compass & religion in utmost regard. But now I have clarity. 

We didn't intend for it to happen. I don't even think we intended to be friends in the first place. Working together demanded more of us than we had envisioned. While our chemistry was real, so was the real love of your life. She is very real. She is perfect for you in every way. 

I am proud that I recognised that we were blurring lines and I stopped it. I rejected opportunities to meet and catch up. I lessen my attachment to you even though I miss it and many times felt that I needed it. 

I asked to meet her. Because I wanted to meet her. I wanted to know for myself how really perfect she was. Lucky for you, she really is and with a heart of gold to boot. I gave her a hug because I knew she was better. She is the best for you. 

You know I was so happy to see the engagement news. I am happy for you, but even happier for her. She has a treasure. I mean this in all sincerity. 

I dare not put myself into projects the same way anymore. The others may find me aloof but I can't bear to open myself up to another. It must be rather stupid considering these guys are actually single. But I can't, even if I'm missing out of something. And I know I have been comparing everyone with you. No one measures up.  

It's a good thing then that we are different life stages. Being stuck shuffling about in nus helps to remind me of that. I pray one day I meet a man who makes me feel safe and whole. I need not have to compare because there is no comparison. 

I don't want to but I do miss you still. I don't think I can let myself meet you. I don't know how to be friends.

How do you know when you've really fallen in love with someone and it's not just an infatuation or even friendship? Before uni, I barely interacted with the opposite gender. But through uni activities, I made more guy friends/acquaintances and began to see some of them as potential romantic interests. Problem is, this means I end up developing crushes very easily and my over-active imagination & fantasies do not help. This makes me worry that I'll keep confusing friendship with love. Any advice?

Since this week's hot topic seems to be sex/virginity...

Guy A tells me that I've slept with guy B

Guy B says that guy A wants to get into my pants

Guy B says I must've slept with guy C 

Guy C says guy D has been sleeping with me

Guess what, I have not slept with anyone in my life. I don't know why or how people can jump to such rude conclusions or feel that they can shoot their mouths off. I am average in all aspects, not hot or pretty, not provocative. So I don't feel that I deserve such comments. Also, these are said straight to my face. 

It'll be nice if guys will stop putting a price on female virginity, or stop going around hinting to find out if their female friends are virgins. Unless you're some emperor who needs the blood of virgins to prolong your life for another thousand years, then we'll talk.

My girlfriend of 2 years has been suffering from depression for about 5 years now. Recently, it has gotten a lot worse, and she has episodes almost every single time we arrange to meet up. Sometimes I'd be 5 minutes away from the meeting point and she calls to tell me that she can't make it because she had a sudden bout of depression, and she's just lying in bed crying and thinking about committing suicide. She isn't the type that lies, just to be clear. I don't understand depression very well, but I'm always patient with her, and I comfort as well as counsel her when the need arises. She is also profuse with words of gratitude and apologies once the episode has subsided. However, with the unusually high frequency of episodes of late, I admit that it has become very tiring and frustrating to have to be her psychologist/counsellor/lover/friend because doing so drains me physically and emotionally. We both know the toll her depression takes on the both of us because we've discussed it at length. Plus it's not like she's in control of the mood swings that occur when depression strikes, so I can't really hold her accountable for the consequences that ensue. Am I a bad guy for occasionally feeling that she can and should be better at handling her depression after having had it for so long? How can I cope with this unshakable feeling that no matter what I do she's never going to improve and I will be stuck with being her crutch and support for the rest of her/my life? Is there any way I can help her and yet remain emotionally unaffected? I like her very much and foresee going the distance with her (and she feels the same way), but this tiny little snag has been impeding the development of our relationship. Any advice will be highly appreciated.

Evergreen guy here. Need advice on the opinions of ladies out there. 

1. Would you be okay with if your future boyfriend is
 about the same height or taller than u?

2. Does the height of your partner really matter in a relationship? 

(Coming from a guy who's height is slightly above 160cm)

To the guy who shared about his girlfriend having depression. I may not know you personally. But it very nice and motivating for you to love your girlfriend for who she is despite her bouts of depressive episode.  Whenever you doubt your capability ask yourself what makes you love her in the first place and let that be a motivation for you to continue pursuring and loving her. Personally I'm struggling with Anxiety and I understand how she feels. There are times when I  just dun feel like doing stuff and spent my whole day wallowing in pain and misery. I cut myself out from activities, I skip school and do all kinds of stupid stuff. Last minute cancelation of dates. But having and anxiety disorder or rather in your gf case depression is no excuse to cut yourself out from the love of your friends / love ones.  All the more you have to try coming out from your barrow bit by bit. It takes time and it is a long process but with love and moral support depression can be treated. Continue to be with her through her ups and downs and reassure her that you love her no matter what. Listen to her faustrations and advice gently if possible and whenever needed. It is nice that you guys talk about your problems and worries. Do simple and romatic stuff for her like cooking her a meal or making random stuff for her like composing a song. Try doing an activity that both of you like to encourage her to go out. Exercising helps too since it releases feel good hormones.  Encourage her to talks about her feelings and to seek for help.  There are a couple of service out there to help people with mental illness. Something I have learnt Psychotherapy and medication goes hand in hand in the path of recovery. One thing that means a lot to me and I guess to everyone suffering from any forms of mental illness. It is to reduce the social stigma that comes along with mental illness. My illness does not define me. It is just a mask that covers and hinder my true abilities and personality. Do look after yourself too so that you can continue looking out and loving her.   No matter what, I wish the both of you all the best.

I don't understand why would anyone ever comment "NPNT" on NUSWhispers page when it is obvious that the reason of sharing the story on this platform is to maintain anonymity. 
-
 
 When you mentioned nice guy, it would really help if you could actually describe the type of nice guy you see.

1) The "nice guy" who wears a mask who is has a motive for being nice.
2) People who are generally nice by nature, no problem, they're just like that, cannot change them. The "Gentle Giant" type.
3) Those who have gone through things that made them "nice guys" in the first place.
4) The type who simply keeps quiet.
5) The type who is full of himself.

You have a very reasonable taste, and it makes a lot of sense. However (why of course, there is a however), it does take a rather... patient eye to actually appreciate what can a nice guy be, and what he can do. Something like a "beauty is in the eyes of the beholder", and "you need to unlock this character" thing. I think you have heard this argument a lot of times, no? 

It's something which many of them hope for, but rarely get.

And by the time a "nice guy" actually becomes truly better (hey, no offense, but if I have to become better simply for the sake of getting a girlfriend, I'll pass, it's a bit pathetic an excuse), you might find that we would grow up to find ourselves silly for chasing after ladies like that, and won't really... Let's just say it's a lot of changes, yeah? For better, or for worse.

Just wanted to get this rant out because none of my friends understand. I am an overweight girl for as long as I can remember. I never thought of losing weight until last year, when the motivation just came. Pretty clothes did not come in my size, and I wanted to look and feel better for myself. I lost 10kg within the first 6 months.

But after that, my weight has been fluctuating around the same range (for almost a year now). I would lose some, and then gain it back again despite exercising every day. I admit that I have not been eating extremely clean, but the amount I eat is half of what I used to. Because of this, I can't help but feel disheartened and I am losing motivation. Also, all my friends are slim and none of them understands me when I count calories or share stories about my journey. When they complain about the "rolls of fats" and "hideous cellulite" they have, I feel really bad about myself. Some friends have told me to hit the gym, but I don't dare to. The gym feels like an intimidating place where muscular guys and toned girls hang out, and I don't want them to judge me.

I understand that weight loss is more or less a personal journey, but I feel so lonely in this. Some days I feel like I could live with this body forever, but I really don't want to give up this journey and let myself down. 
-
 
I'm a guy who's been fascinated with wearing female clothes since I was a kid. Sometimes I wish I have someone to share my secret with so I could be pretty with him/her, but I've never actually told anyone I know about it for fear of being judged. What do you guys actually think?
-
 
Since the topic is now on sex, I would like to raise my concern that's quite different from the others.

My problem is that I have phimosis, and it is so bad that I can't even pull back the skin to reveal the head. This would likely mean pain during sex in the future. I know that most advices would be to see a doctor and get a partial circumcision. The question is, when? It takes around a month to recover, and it is difficult and find a time to do so when each NUS summer holidays is packed with activities such as exchange and internships. Haiz really regret not doing anything about it back in army T.T
-
 
Do you think if a guy and a girl become best friends for a very long time (eg more than 7 years), it is difficult to escalate the friendship to romantic relationship? Reason being too comfortable with each other etc. 
-
 
Why is there so many people these few days complaining about being evergreen or virgin at 20 plus makes you a failure etc.? Why is sex by a certain age a prerequisite to being a successful human being? 

There are plenty of other human connections worth having such as friends and family. If you had sex because you have been in love/take pleasure from it/fwb/one night stands before, that's good for you. If you haven't had sex before it should also be perfectly fine. Society has progressed such that it is no longer necessary for people to find a life partner in order to be happy.

I am an average evergreen girl too, but I find being single liberates me to pursue a lot of stuff I want. I am not against getting attached but I believe that if it is meant to be the time will come. I find my female friends in a relationship sweet but it isn't as if their existence makes mine any less worthy just because I have never been in love. I feel like the people really deserving of my respect and envy are the plenty number of female doctors in hospitals who are so caring and competent and actually actively make a difference in people's lives. That they seem so happy regardless of their relationship status (and I see a lot of single female doctors around) because they are doing something they love. 

So go out and find something else to love instead of waiting around for someone to love you. And come on lah at 20 plus you have so many more years to get attached. Don't waste your life pining for someone who may or may not come along. Especially the guys who don't have a biological clock and can easily find young 20 plus year old girls even into their 30s. Why the rush? Just use your time wisely, if you get rejected wish the other party all the best and go along your merry way. Your happiness should not be controlled by anybody other than yourself. 

So here is to all the fellow virgins and evergreen peeps like me: be the best you that you can be and let fate/your own happiness which is attractive/natural traits do the rest. Ciao. 

Sincerely, just another 21 year old girl.

Hi!
I'm a year 1 going year 2 student. My first sem CAP  is only 3.0 but this sem it's 3.4. I was damn excited that finally I can pull up my CAP although it's just only 0.4. But, that's okay cause I firmly believe that I am able to pull it up throughout my study in NUS. As parents, I really really understand that my tuition fee in NUS is quite expensive that's why I need to get good grades during my study. When I checked my result from myisis, I cried happily while staring my grades. Why? Finally, I made it even though it's only 3.4.. I'm not a really smart one, but I believe through hard works and dedication we can be anything. I told my parents about my grades, and my dad was really mad at me. The worst part was when my dad said that 'you are a bloody hell and fake nus students'..I tried to be strong and not to cry. This is not the first time he said like that to me, I heard those words like hundred or thousand times..Every time I face this situation, I always try to wake up by myself and try to motivate myself. I know it's really hard and painful, but that's life..I'm writing this post is actually just for sharing purpose. For those who have the same problem like me, I just want to remind you one thing: no matter how you feel, get up, dress up and never give up!
Have a good day! :)

Girls often think guys are childish, old liao still play games watch anime. I think what matters to both genders are diff. Materialism matters more to female, while pleasure matter more to male. Female project their own wants onto the male - what do u think?

Listen, this is for all the poor sap dudes(or girls it applies to both although guys more so) out there who are virgins, can't talk to girls and are wondering why you've never been in a relationship, no girl has ever been attracted to you despite being a nice guy but a bit shy while they always seem to go out with the bad boys: 

The truth is this: You've been probably brought up to think that just working hard and being nice to girls will be sufficient in eventually meeting a nice one and settling down. No. This just equals boring. You got to bring something more to the table. You have to be intensely passionate about life, be it through a hobby or a skill or a dream etc.  Being a stable nice guy is a necessary but insufficient condition in an ideal partner, and this is the kicker - being a stable nice guy is easy, having that innate joy, passion and excitement of life is what most guys in this world don't possess. And that my friends, is what is extremely attractive across the board.  And no, playing video games or being insanely caught up in fandom doesn't count (unless you find a girl who is equally into that but even then I have seen most nerd/gamer chicks still end up with guys who does all the nerd stuff BUT on top of that have a more 'grounded' physical passion). Everyone wants a partner they can go on the adventure of life with and purely stable nice guys don't provide that at all. 

Anyways, this is the main reason why girls are drawn to the so-called 'bad boys'. These guys are exciting - sometimes for all the wrong reasons, such as playing games and having drama - but they can initially attract girls because their lives seem adventurous and everyone (both guys and girls) wants some sort of visceral stimulation and excitment in a relationship. Most times girls might realise the current guy she's with is a dickhead and leave him but she still keeps dating around the same kind of guys until she finally snags one who at this age shows the potential of being an ideal partner - he is exciting with a lot of things going for him but he's a bit aloof and unstable and doesn't treat her the best - she will stick with him in the hopes that he will mature with age and through the course of the relationship to eventually gain the 'stable nice guy' quality in addition to his exciting life. Some of these guys once they get married however end up trading their exciting qualities to become a purely nice, stable family guy and thats when his wife will realise this is not the guy I fell in love with and divorce him - but that's a story for another time. 

So yea, the first step is to craft an exciting life for yourself first, this was going around a few years back and its a good read: http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/

To all the worried evergreen people, a real relationship will happen for you only when you realize you are adequate. 
Confidence attracts people. 
Self-sufficiency attracts people. 
No one wants someone they need to help, people want someone they want to love and know how to love themselves. 
So get on out there and do other stuff, a hobby, a passion, an interest, anything. 
When you stop questioning yourself why things aren't going right for you? That's the time you are ready for a relationship and someone right will be there for you.

I'm a freshie this year 2015-2016. I had to get this out of my mind and what better place to rant eh. 

I've always been the calm and chill guy with my buddies. Evergreen here. I'm straight and noticed many girls seems to be afraid of me and label me as a player etc etc. Yes I consider myself handsome and exotic I acknowledge it.   I received various compliments overseas,  on streets and yea the list goes on. I acknowledge that and thank my parents for it.  I don't smoke don't drink and don't party often. I have a group of really really close friends though,  for more than 6 years. Recently one of my friend pulled me aside and asked me, some questions. Well apparently people have been passing some pretty nasty comments about me over the years.   Etc use looks to hook up ons,  date multiple girls at a single time, bad boy player etc, and even go after girls in relationship. Without a doubt I was shock, I was surprised and who would pass such remarks about me. The closest I ever got with a girl was dancing in a club. 

So yes, to whomever is doing this you know who you are. I don't know you but for goodness sake whatever you're doing someone up there is watching. 

And also to ladies out there, not every good guy is taken out there and don't listen to every word on the street about ppl. And don't ever judge a book by its cover. 

Cheers.  Thank you for reading.

Can we talk about things other than relationships? NUSWhispers is quickly turning into Aunt Agony.

"I'm still a virgin": Get out more, stop being a shut in, get some new friends to hang out with, stop whining on facebook.
"I just broke up with my SO": Delete facebook, lawyer up, hit the gym.
"My girl/boyfriend cheated on me": Shit happens, let it go, make yourself a better person so the other party regrets it.
"I am content with my current life": Why are you here?
-
 
My bf cheated on me with another girl. on the time we had our first sex, he texted her stuff like he missed her and she is special after that. He give reasons like he didnt know what he was doing. we quarrel as he is insensitive about how he should text girls and say things like the girl is hot etc to them. Its his first relationship. Even though half my friends are telling me to give him up, should i? 
-
 
 I broke up with a girl who would swallow my cum to be with a girl who doesn't even go down on me. Sex is not everything in a relationship.

I never believed in love at first sight. I mean, if you can fall in love with someone just after meeting them for the first time, it's obviously based on looks and charisma rather than personality, right? 

Then again, I noticed I've got friends who got together based on love at first sight (i.e. After orientation camps) and they lasted way longer than other couples who got together only after knowing each other for a while.

I broke up with my girlfriend near 1.5 years ago because of issues with her parents' disapproval and build up from small issues. Even up til today, i still miss her and still yearn for a chance to start all over again. Unfortunately, we arent really on talking terms anymore as she seems really cold whenever i try to talk to her. Is there still anything that i can possibly do?

 1. There's nothing objectively wrong being a virgin for the rest of your life.
2. ...not getting a girlfriend.
3. ...not getting married.
4. Learn to think for yourself. Choice is yours, but you ought to think VERY carefully of future consequences.

Hey there so I'm a  25 year old virgin guy..Ive been pretty aware recently about the fact that Ive never had a gf or been intimate with a girl. And any girl I had a crush on had always failed as it ended up one sided. It was not like I went for the hottwst girl or what I went for average looking cutesy type of girls but even they reject me. Maybe I'm ugly or something. 

But my roommate next door who's my best friend he on the other hand just been rude to girls and he gets to screw them every other day and they keep coming back to him with food and stuff and he is just plain rude to them. I of course have to bear the grunt of hearing that. I was brought up to not be like him and my mother taught me on how to be a proper guy(generic gentlemens stuffs.).sometimes I wonder if chivalry is really dead and if any girls like old fashion guys like me. 

Point is. I wish I can get some advice on whether I should change myself to be like my friend or what I should do even. I am extremely worried on being a 40 yr old virgin but maybe even dying as one. I'm a shy guy but I am training myself to be a confident guy that stands up for himself so Id really appreciate it if I could get some advice on how I can chase a girl and keep her.

continue from  um...I agree with what you commented, but that is the most important aspect me and my friends feel what we need in a r/s. r/s have other things like comprimising..etc. over the past 2 years of dating, my ex and I only talked facetoface + phone calls about 7 times in total. I didn't mind that he was busy to reply my msg a month later. I even accepted that he didn't want to meet my parents by visiting my house or his yet cauz we are too early in the r/s.. that i arranged a time for him to come to my house when my parents are not around. Actually I didnt mind that he's to tired to take a stroll with me. But I think its only fair for me to think that we are not that too early in the r/s to have sexual relationship. He started to kept a lot of things from me...different from the open relationship when we just started.

I'm a 25 year old guy that's a virgin. I've never slept with a girl, and the closest to being intimate was probably when a girl grinded me(kinda) in a nightclub. 

Age seems to be catching up and I have lost all hope in finding a girlfriend, let alone get married. The odds of that seem really low as well so I might even end up as a virgin for life. 

I also seem to be tempted to use the massage parlours that offer extra services or even go to a hooker or escort and get it done and over with and lose it once and for all. But the other part of me says that I should not just give away my v-card and keep it..it just tells me I should not give in to temptations. 

What should I do about this? I'm really really confused about what I should be doing. The best opinions are usually from people one does not know so please advise me on what I should do.
-
 
My girlfriend hinted to me that she's ready for the highest level of intimacy on more than a few occasions when we were alone together at home, but I always rejected her, saying that I'm not ready. She was so impressed, thinking that I'm some gentlemen with strong moral values waiting till marriage or something. 

However,the truth is, I've not been able to get myself 100% hard recently. The best I can do is 80%. Moreover, I always finishes within 2 minutes when I DIY. I didn't think I'd be able to perform well, hence I rejected her advance.

Im still so young, and I exercise regularly. I don't smoke and I seldom drink. This is so embarrassing.
-
 
I'm a person of faith, and I'm waiting for marriage to have sex. To all those waiting as well, stay strong <3
-
 
As someone who's never been with a girl my entire life, I constantly feel this crushing sense of loneliness. Maybe I should just go visit a prostitute or something, since that seems to be the only way to get female companionship and intimacy for me...
-
 
 So what if it's his first relationship? A decent guy should know what is appropriate and what is not. Texting a girl after having sex with you the first time, cheating, blatantly telling girls they're hot, flirting with them? Sounds like he is taking you for granted. Girl, have some respect for yourself and dump his sorry (or not sorry) ass.

Did anyone have people always asking you why you are single? When the answer is obvious--I am not what people are looking for. Then they will say, it's ok to be fat and ugly and poor, I know people like that who have boyfriends too. Then I'm like I know, but these people are super kind or friendly right? They gotta have some good quality to overcompensate. Most people look for partners with gentle, or humorous or caring characteristics, which I don't really have. I'm more of a serious, calm, determined type, so I make a good friend but not a "partner". Next time I will just lie and say I'm in a LDR, and they can't confirm anyway.
BTW, I'm a Singaporean who was born in China, and my friends keep on shipping me and any China guy. C'mon, there are 1.3 billion chinese. I usually always meet jerks who think I like them or nice guys but we always end up being friends. I did meet one guy who I could like but he's a stranger so I'm contented with just knowing that "my type" exists.

 Seeing some posts here really makes me want to shake my head. Dude... You are thinking of changing yourself to be an a**hole, just to have sex or getting hooked? TF! Wake up man, like seriously. I'm not sure on what advices to give you on how you can chase a girl and keep her, but if you're so concerned, "improve" yourself while still being yourself. That's whats more important than anything else. Think about it, if it makes sense. If not, just ignore me...

And I'm not so sure what's wrong with being a virgin. From my perspective, you seem to be seeking lots of validation from others. As you gain more confidence, validation shifts from others to yourself.

I'm a 24 year old guy who's never been in a relationship. Let alone touched a girl in an intimate way. I'm currently studying engineering at uni and I feel that I would be single for life(hey it's 24 years of being single, what are the chances of things changing..zilch or close to Anyway.) 

I fell for this girl in my first year but things did not work out. Ever since then things slipped into sadness and depressed mode and I've ended up making a vow to myself that I should never feel for a girl or ever even think about liking her again. 

At the same time as i don't ever want to fall for another girl. I don't think I will get married as well. So I also had wished to maybe consider adopting a child to form a mini family of my own(and maybe even die a virgin..probably) I've given up all hope on finding a relationship and even considered being a very mean/jerk/douche guy to every girl I meet and know except my mother. Cos frankly most of them deserved it but I can't because I've been brought up the wrong way of being kind and gentlemanly to people(pun intended.) 

So what is your opinion on this? Isit worth sticking to my plan of probably just having an adopted son or should I rethink my life planning?

 I think your boyfriend is being a little bit selfish, but he may have his own reasons. personally, I don't like the idea of giving my boyfriend a blowjob and I've talked about it with him, but I'm willing to do it once in a while because I know it feels good for him.

maybe you should try to have a calm and rational discussion with him about why he doesn't like going down on you, especially if he asks you do give him blowjobs (I don't know if he does; if he doesn't and you really do it out of the goodness of your heart, maybe this won't work). I think it's important to breach this kind of topic gently, otherwise it will come across sounding very accusatory, like "I'm so generous vs. you're so selfish". maybe he's really very disgusted by it, which is also a valid reason I guess, but I think there should be a compromise between both parties. likewise, you shouldn't demand that he do it if you know he dislikes it. who knows, he might be more willing if he feels like you're more understanding and he doesn't feel forced to do it?

What do you guys think about jealousy in relationships? Is it a sign of distrust and thus ugly and immature, or an obvious sign of love, thus cute and endearing?

What about using it to provoke a reaction in the pre-relationship phase? Is it a devious manipulative play? Or a fair ploy to make clear a muddy situation? 

Bonus question: based on the above word use, am I a guy, or a gal?

Got to know of this guy from NUS from work. Despite knowing I'm from NUS as well he didn't ever think of telling me that we are from the same school. Not that it's of any obligations of him to tell him but it just feels like he does not really intend to have me as a friend as he does not want to share so much about his involvements in NUS. It just feels kinda weird and unfriendly somehow. It seems so hard for me to understand someone who wants work and personal life to be clear cut and separate. Really makes it so hard for me to get to know him more.
-
 
Is it me or are all avenues to making friends (that people had in the past) are now closing? It seems  that technology has made people antisocial, competition for jobs has made people wary & untrusting and this wariness has in turn made people stick to their comfort zones. Speaking as someone who never went for any camps EVER, I feel like simply striking up a conversation with someone in lectures is now impossible. Like if I try to use the lecture topic as a convo starter they automatically think I'm trying to get free tuition. Or borrow stationery. Or sell insurance. Or steal something. Or attack them with a roll of their own printed lecture notes.
-
 
 Hey there, my gf refuses to go down on me too due to some personal reasons even though I did it for her. Nonetheless, we still had healthy sex lives and it didn't really bothered me that much even though I want to experience it. Thus, I wouldn't recommend you to break up with him over such a trivial matter. If you are really perturbed, try reaching a compromise with him? 
I know some guys won't go down on their girlfriends is because their girlfriends don't shave, likewise for girls.
-
 
Is it just me who cares so much about other people's lives? Like I don't want them to do anything that's harmful to themselves, nor anything that would do bad to their future. There is so much more I wish I could do, but I only have myself.  
-
 
I do not understand all the problems here (i.e. money, studies, relationship, sexual orientation). Life is short, don't make it shorter. Let me give you a quote from my favorite comedian, George Carlin. "Life is not that complicated. You get up, you go to work, eat three meals, you take one good shit and you go back to bed. What’s the fucking mystery?!" 
-
 
Whenever I go out for meals with my girlfriend, I will pay for her meals. However, I will order the cheapest item for myself ( like salad or appetizer) and sometimes I will not eat. When she ask me why I did not order any food for myself, I will lie that I am not hungry but in actual fact I am actually quite poor. I do feel regret for lying to her. Can someone advise me on how to handle this situation?
-
 
Friendships in uni are just short lived conveniences. How can friends not meet for months? Yes we are all on placement and posted to different locations but that doesn't mean it's ok to not meet. When semester starts, don't expect everything to magically pick up. Everything is so disposable, even 'friends'.
-
 
I got together with this girl after knowing her for about half a year. To me, she was innocent, pretty and cute.

Everything was fine until one day I overheard her telling her female friend that she's acting all sweet and simple-minded in front of me so that she can be attached (and then married) to a rich guy. (My family wealth is considered much higher than average in SG (4-storey bungalow) and we have 3 luxury cars.)

I was very disappointed as I'd thought she was different from other girls. Should I not have brought her to my house to hang out / fetched her before we even got together? Now that I think of it, maybe that's the reason why she rejected all her other suitors...

Another issue is, guys take note - a girl should really be the most beautiful girl in your world before you two get together. All along I was attracted by other girls (before and during relationship). I also had a few fwbs and one night stands. I felt that she was a really good girl and I should cherish her. On the other hand, there are so many better choices out there for me and I am not like some old man desperate to get a wife, I keep getting distracted.

Well I guess my good side got the better of me because in the end I gave up my freedom and asked her to be my gf. I guess after dating someone for a period of time, it's difficult to call off the relationship... I'd feel bad if I'd done so... like leading her on :/ 

Maybe I'm not ready to settle down yet... On a side note, fwb are the best relationships, anyone with me on this??? You get no jealousy no drama no expectation but fun and pleasure. Plus it's a bonus if your fwb is your good buddy. 
-
 
 I think you should tell the girl. I was from an emotionally, verbally, physically abusive relationship also. And I only realised when my friend shared her experience on her past abusive relationship. Quite dumb right it never occurred to me that I'm in an abusive relationship even with the physical violence. Broke up and am much much happier right now. So just tell. 
-
 
So guys, I am a final year student (male) of NUS. Not that it is very hard for  me to like a girl, but i never felt the "love" for anyone (maybe because of my past experiences). I met a caucasian girl here in Singapore and she herself felt the same way as me for similar reasons. But over the course of time, we both started liking each other and this turned into more than just "like" quite soon. Never before have i felt this before. Even though we come from different cultural backgrounds, we both feel we are just right for each other. After so much consideration, i realised I am in love with  her. Now, she doesn't feel the same way. she says she loves me, but still not sure of commitment. I accept her decision but when i see her going out with other guys, it hurts. 

what should I do? is she just using me for sexual needs?

-
 
To  wow, you described my ideal man. I don't even need him to be charismatic or humorous. Sad to say, there aren't too many of such guys (as you have described) around. Before anyone says I'm mixing with the wrong company, I do know a few guys who fit the bill. But they are taken. So yes, such guys are ideal and they exist. 
-
 
I always feel pissed off when I see the photos of my friends in orientation camps, first being when I was in NS. And when it was finally my turn as a freshie, I did not manage to get into a single orientation camp. (FYI I applied for at least 3 camps) Yes, I know.. sour grapes that is..

-
 
I'm tired of hearing guys having such low confidence or insecurities about themselves. Well, for a typical abled human, you have hands, legs, can see, hear, speak and feel. You should feel fortunate and be proud of yourself. Instead of saying things like girls won't fancy me because I'm average look, average results or average finance. Or worse still blame those materialistic girls you know and generalize every girls you see. Girls don't owe you a living. Just be yolo and talk to them. Or spend the effort to go work and earn money to spend for your materialistic wants. I've made friends from work whom I go play sports with. I'm a girl anyway.

Trying to use the 5 Whys technique on this question...

1. Why don't I have a gf before?
Ans. I don't see the reason to have 1

2. Why don't I see the reason to have 1?
Ans. Being single is not so bad

3. Why is being single not so bad?
Ans. I think I will have more freedom to do what I want

4. Why do you want more freedom?
Ans. I don't like to be restricted.

5. Why don't you like to be restricted?
Ans. I want to be carefree.

Final Ans: I may get a gf if I can be carefree having one... (FA otherwise)

So I was with this guy a few years back. I ended things because he was emotionally abusive and verbally abusive as well and thank goodness I cut myself loose because I am so much happier now. 

However, I recently found out from someone close to him that he has been giving his girlfriend the same abuse. And I also found out the girlfriend has some issues of her own and is taking things very very badly. I feel bad knowing this but at the same time I don't think I should say or do anything. 

Just thought of getting your opinions on this. 
-
 
loving someone who blows hot & cold really sucks. i gave my last shot, she asked me to give up cos she dont wanna hurt me any further. we said our goodbyes & last ilu. we cant be close like that anymore, i said. now im depressed. im afraid i will see her again around Arts. damn feelings will return ):

how do i pick myself up & move on from here. 
-
 
I know it's been more than half a year since we broke up and you've been giving me the cold shoulder ever since, but I still think about you all the time. I wonder how you've been.
-
 
I guess it could work both ways. But why don't materialistic guys get glorified? My ex is one of them. He dumped me for another girl with rich parents.

Sometimes, my RBF saves me from having to make small talk to people I'm awkward with when I meet them by chance.

Are people really going to skirt around the issue that networks are more important than grades or hard work? Unless it's hard work in getting out to know the right people. Or maybe this is the hard work everyone's talking about so far?

Entering my last year with 4.75 and rueing not knowing even more talented people. The rich has advantage in prefab connections but it's not infallible. I just overdid it with the grade-chasing so don't be like me guys. It's a bit amusing that I'm classified as one of the lazy whiners right now because I misprioritised my efforts...

Honestly, I was an evergreen girl till I was 23. I had some admirers but they weren't anyone I liked and plus, they never took that last step to ask anyway. I'm not the skinniest girl, prettiest, smartest etc but I had some good points so I always wondered why I was alone. I knew I could dress up, so I started being more conscious of how I look in my Year 3. Apparently make up and contacts made me look different and there were guys who had interest after seeing my new look. But the one guy I liked for a year didn't seem to care at all, so it was a bummer. 

After some interesting mishaps that the guy and I went through (we were sort of friends), we ended up together lol. Seeing all the evergreen posts have kinda prompted me to jump on too and maybe give some form of perspective.

As a former evergreen girl (and my bf was also evergreen lol- we're getting married ^^), after talking with my bf, I realised some guys/girls are just rly diff so don't despair if you don't find someone yet! Here are some advice that might help in the wait!

1) Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I honestly think I'm chunky compared to the typical chio blogshop Singaporean girl beauty, but he likes curvier girls. And though I look more "chio" with makeup and lenses, he prefers my spectacles and no makeup face. So every person has their own type, don't feel bad!  

2) Better yourself and help others! 
When I was crushing for a year, I made it a point not to dwell on the crush, but to focus on helping people and building relationships around me. Although I tried to grab his attention by dressing up, in fact, it was that one time thing where I helped a mutual friend of ours that attracted him (he didn't like my dressed up look) and I didn't noticed at all!  Plus, by bettering yourself, you become more attractive and you gain more than just looking back and realising that my one year was a pathetic forever alone phase. 

You're not too old to be evergreen. And if you really are concerned, you could try dating through tinder and okcupid. I know a few couples who got together and are sticking strong.

-
 
 Maybe the other side isn't over you and can't forget the happy times... Maintaining contact just makes him/her think about what was and could be... Not all ex-es can be friends, even if they don't hate each other's guts, even if they still care for each other.
-
 
These dating-related woes have got to stop. Everyone posting these confessions is making excuses for themselves. Both guys and girls are accusing each other of being materialistic or shallow. No one is introspecting and thinking what is going wrong in their approach. I will first admit that I am nobody to talk: evergreen + not many friends in NUS + terrified of rejection + egotistic + selfish/arrogant. 
But last night I had a crazy thought that if I were to drop dead suddenly. The only people to notice my absence would be my parents. That is a simple fact: not morbid self-pity. And I am entirely responsible for that fact. But I am not going to sit and feel sad about my seemingly-eternal loneliness and singlehood (that I largely brought upon myself). 
This morning I saw one of those many emails from here and there about various activities. Without second-guessing myself, I signed up for it. And I actually found myself feeling excited about doing something new and meeting new people. This is just a small thing but truly, we all hold the power to change ourselves. So do a little more thinking and a lot less negative generalizing about the opposite (or same, whatever floats your boat) sex. 
-
 
Girl here. My BF flat out refuses to go down on me, saying that "it's not part of a guy's purview". The thing is, I do it for him all the time! Zzz double standards to the max..... Should I dump him? Is it a "valid" enough reason to do so? Or is it unreasonable? Any advice much appreciated.
-
 
Guys, will you be turned off if a girl approaches you for your number? What are the chances you will refuse to give your contact number to the girl?
-
 
Yesterday I rejected a guy friend who confessed to me. He kept asking me why don't I like him. He sounded so emotional over the phone and he's not in a clear state of mind. I was very tired and feel really awkward to explain it to him in person as to why I didn't reciprocate his affections for me. JT, if you read this, I hope you understand. BUT DON'T TAG ME IN THE COMMENTS OR I'LL BE ANGRY -.-

I know you are not a bad person, but you always seem so critical of others, which I don't really like. When doing our group work, when a friend gives a suggestion or idea, you're usually the first one to gun him down. You are always eager to point out what is weak in other people's opinion, instead of acknowledging the strong points. Even sometimes when I commented on some current issues, the first thing you'll say, "Where got like that?" It makes you come across as someone who is very negative about others. It's important to be diplomatic. Please learn to praise and encourage others too! (-:

Also you like to complain a lot, even over trivial matters. When someone in the group doesn't live up to your expectations, you will nag nag nag, like an old man. And when we queue for the movie tickets or go for a meal, you complained that the queue is too long and showed your unhappiness. EVERYONE has to queue unless you own the place.

 And you are really judgmental and love making sweeping statements before you truly understand people. Just because I usually talk about how hot Daniel Craig or Chris Pratt are, doesn't mean I only like Ang Mo men. They are just my idols! That doesn't mean I will only choose to have a relationship with one or even marry one. Stop accusing me of being an SPG like you did yesterday! It's very offensive and hurtful :-(

Don't always say you're ugly. YOU ARE NOT! Maybe you aren't that handsome too, but you are definitely not ugly. We're both average looking Singaporeans. You need to have more confidence in yourself!

Finally, I hope you are not so clingy to me. You seem to need me to follow you wherever you go. I'm totally fine with it if it's to help you carry some items, but you won't even go to the gents if I am not waiting for you outside. Haiz...

I appreciate some of the small things you've done for me. But I really don't think you're my type of guy. As for the hurtful stuff you said to me last night, I won't take it personally and let's forget it as we can still be friends. I pray you can find a girl who likes you as much as you like her.

-
 
People kept calling me judgemental because I form impressions(bad, usually) of people real fast.  It's just that every small action of a person affects the impression he/she leaves on me. Yes I develop bad impressions of people real fast but they are dispelled as fast too most of the time. If it's this case then being judgemental isn't a bad thing right? :/
-
 
I feel that girls nowadays are getting really materialistic, and relationships are no longer as 'pure' or 'till death do us apart anymore'. Just take a look at our social media- instagram, Facebook. A lot of girls who guys consider as 'pretty' and 'classy' are ostentatiously showy and attention seeking.  The guys they date are also of similar nature- good looking and buff guys who are equally showy and proud, and they are no longer looking for nice and good guys anymore, but rather base them on superficial things like looks and status mostly. Kinda sad actually...
-
 
I wonder if there are many girls who go through this phase too. When I entered FoE after a school of 2/3-girls, I somehow felt the need to 'be one of the dudes' and pretend to be a cool gal. Not to find myself a boyfriend but to just have guy friends. Luckily I grew out of it and went on to find friends of all genders and orientations who accept me for who I really am. People have stupid stereotypes, but honestly I think there is no need to glorify girls in engineering; we're but students in engineering.

 its not really true about guys needs a car. But is more like he cannot be lazy and ambitious is more important. Thats according to what my friends and I think (we are all girls). Anyway, rich family guys can also act poor. I didnt knew my ex-bf has his own car (bmw) and stays in a luxary condo until our first date. When I knew him, he was working his ass off part time working and part time studying. And he's always tired from the stress of his workload. His A level was all Cs and Ds but to me, he was amazing because he works hard to improve himself despite his condition. He also has a big tummy and he's always insecure about it but it makes him appear he can make me feels safe. We took mrt all the time and he will text me about he miss me while waiting for the bus and all. It all spiral down with his car. I dislike taking his car. Cauz I didn't want to distract him driving so I kept quiet for the whole trip and he always tried to arose me even though i told him I don't feel its appropriate too early in the relationship. It's his territory. I feel like he treats me like I owe him or he owns me (we only ate at hawkers cauz I feel that being together is more important than spending money on food and it become one of the reason of our break cauz we don't see food the same way). And then he became the distant guy who wouldn't go on a short stroll with me cauz he prefers to touch in the car. I prefer him in the past when we were just friends. We could go play a sports together and talk  and laugh and wait for the train together and say bye and see his back as the door closed. He changed. He wanted to experience other girls. Probably better than me. I just...feel sad. He's not worth it anymore.

I love jeannel! she is the most perfect girl in nus!
-
 
To  not always. I feel intimidated when a guy who drives asks me out. Unless he paid for the car himself (unlikely, although not impossible), isn't it his parents' money (also not wrong, but well, I prefer "independent" men)? 

Someone I know once lamented that no girl would want to date him because he doesn't have a car nor money to splash around on girls. However, I still feel that I would rather date someone who works hard and earns his own keep. Of course there are hardworking guys who have cars (so expensive in Singapore!) and don't live off their parents, but I haven't met that many. 

To the guys who feel that they are losing out because they don't drive - don't feel this way. There are many girls out there who think like me. 

Anyway, we are looking for a partner, not a chauffeur.

Can someone explain to me why do old people feel lonely so easily especially those who just retired and cannot socialise well? It puzzles me why younger people can cope pretty well even if they are left alone for extended period of time..

I write my food orders on paper because I always feel like I'm taking too much time from the person next in line. Either that, or I buy whatever is ready to go and which only requires me only to point to the menu.

I'm a stutterer. I used to get teased for this when I was a teen. Other boys were pretty mean to me. It's something I feel embarrassed by but I'm lucky I've loving parents who nurtured me to be an optimistic person. I've been in speech therapy since my teenage years, and I'm much better now than I was then :) But it's still something I struggle with especially at presentations. 

The last time I tried to order food without writing on paper, the person next in the line told me to hurry up. It felt hurtful to hear that... but maybe he is a nice person and was just having a bad day. :) 

I don't know what to tag this as... since it's neither a rant or me seeking advice, so I tagged it as funny instead :)

After 1 month at my internship I really want the new semester to start so I don't have to wake up early in the morning everyday

It's just another one of these nights. Thinking about the friendships that have come and gone. It scares me. The ability of relationships  to fade away so quickly, leaving behind mere awkward salutations at chance encounters. 

I am becoming a little bit more cynical and hopeful in finding friends as the years pass. Is it a sign to stop bothering because in the long-run many of these friendships would end. Are friends still considered friends if they don't last more than a year or a phase in our lives? 

Sometimes, it can be pretty challenging to accept how alone and isolated this world can get.   
-
 
It has been a while since I have ended a 4 year relationship and I can't help but feel lonely nowadays. I am too used to having someone there for me and whenever I check my phone there would be messages waiting for me. Nowadays, I would only receive messages from friends once in a while and they aren't sustainable. I would say that I have a healthy social life but chatting with friends just doesn't seem to help this feeling of loneliness. As a guy, I normally wouldn't msg my close guy friends constantly as somehow that isn't the way our friendship functions. While talking to female friends, I'm afraid i give them the wrong idea if the conversations drag too long. This situation gets amplified especially during the holidays, when i'm not living in campus and surrounded by friends. Is it normal not to have someone to talk to constantly? How do I cope with this loneliness?

How to ask if a girl is still attached? I like this girl but I know she has a boyfriend and I would not do anything more than a friend would if she is in a relationship, though I heard things about the boyfriend that are not very pleasant.

Hi I am an evergreen guy.  I'm above average in looks, least that's what some close friends tell me which I usually just shrugged it off. I come from a pretty humble family, neither poor nor rich. Middle class folks that do not indulge in frequent luxury. Many of my friends whom been in and out of  relationships ask me again and again why I'm still single and some even attempt to set up me on dates.  (I know hilarious right). But they do not know I secretly have commitment issues and would probably screw up any form of female relationship beyond the friendzone level and that is why I chose not to get in one and even stay clear most of the time. 

I enjoy some female companionship but at this point in time I'm mentally ill prepared to get into one. The reason why I'm posting this, I've been getting weird stares and recently some guys even try to hit on me. What should I do. If you think this is funny it's not, I shit bricks everytime this happens. 

I get questioned am I homo or into guys whenever I mention I'm not really into girls at the moment. I wouldn't consider myself homophobic but it bothers me from time to time . 
And I'm pretty sure I am a perfectly straight male and how do I shrug of these complimentary "gestures". 

And how do I talk to ladies without giving unintended false signals. Purely friendship purposes. 

Why am I writing this?
1. Does my mental thoughts sound normal? 
2. My commitment issues with ladies, how can I overcome this. 

Thank you guys.

I love Bui Ba! She is everything I have hope for!! <3

Don't know if I'm weird, but I'm an evergreen girl at 22 due to personal issues that made me shy away from relationships and guys in general. Well, I'm just starting to date, and I realised I have this preference for guys who are experienced (have relationships before). It makes me feel like they'll be able to lead the relationship because I won't have any idea how to, and well, if they've been attached before, that must mean they were awesome enough to have attracted their previous partners, right? 
-
 
I love my boyfriend so so much. We go to the same school, hang out with each other a lot, and I know he genuinely cares about me even though he doesn't shower me with sweet talks and affection. 

But I'm insecure. Not about the relationship, but about myself. 
My whole life has been about proving my worth. I'v always been envious of other pretty girls and I've spend every living minute thinking I could be as attractive as them. But it never turns out good. When I talk to other guys, it felt good to know that I could attract them and make them say or frel things I want them to. To seem myself as desirable and attractive. 

I know cheating is a choice. But there's a lack in me and nothing in my 8 years of relationships with the guy of my dreams have diminished that need. 

I need advice and help ):
-
 
I've known of a few incidences where guys directly/indirectly asked if they could just be friends and know me better for the past couple of years. But for some serious health reasons (that makes me feel less of a women), I always shy away from them because I know that eventually I have to tell them about it if things get serious and I don't know if I can handle their subsequent reactions. At the same time, I just wished I can move on from such a mindset. Awkward, embarrassed and shy all at once. Guys, how do you handle such things if you happen to find yourself involved in one?

An unspoken law in NUS: If you think she's pretty, 95% she is already attached.

Hi guys. Can anybody tell me how you would know if you were bisexual?

I have mostly always considered myself heterosexual as I have strong attractions toward girls and have had many female crushes. However, lately I have noticed that I feel a mild sense of attraction when I spot certain hot guys walking around as well.

I have also on occasion found myself thinking that I wouldn't mind being in a relationship with some of my male friends, though not necessarily actively seeking to be.

Is this enough to be considered bi or is this normal heterosexual thinking?
-
 
To . Don't worry, I am a bisexual woman and if I do get married someday I would hope that my husband is bisexual so that we can admire eye candies from both genders together. You will find someone accepting someday.

She named our outings as "fig" when I wanted to take her on a date, I guess she didn't want me to get the wrong idea. But I was pretty excited when she decided to go out with me, just the both of us, for the third time. This is a good sign right? Being the socially awkward person I am (both of us are), this was a big thing for me and I really really liked her a lot. 

I was running out of words, and our time together was filled with so much awkward silences. I attempt to bring out a topic which I thought all girls are able to relate to, make-up/cosmetics. She didn't had any on (I shouldn't mention that to her), not that she needs any, she is beautiful just the way she is (she really is). Little did I know, this topic affected her a lot. She is very... self-conscious on her appearance and really beat herself for it, even till now. Patriarchal power, societal view on beauty, forced image of femininity, "my body was never mine" etc. 

Yes, she caught my eyes in the first place because she is pretty. But it was through the messages we had that I found out that she is such an awesome person. She likes gore and dark stuffs but that didn't really bothers me. She kept 2 tumblr, thinking nobody will ever discover the other one. One filled with fashion/quotes/hipsterism and another filled with anime gifs she made; I have been reading both everyday (she doesn't know that I know).

It has been more than 6 months since we last met. Maybe you got tired of me, I know I am not an interesting person. If that topic upsets you so much, I am sorry. It was supposed to be an innocent conversation starter and not supposed to imply anything.

To her and every girl reading this, you are beautiful just the way you are. If you don't like it, you don't have to subscribe to the conventional view of beauty. You are free to be anything you want. There is no need to chase after something you don't like. The moment you let others' reactions to dictate your choices, you give away the decision-making power to your own happiness. (same goes for guys) Of course this discussion on defending against conventional perception of beauty/femininity/masculinity can go deeper but it is not the point of this post.

There will be someone out there waiting for you, appreciating everything about you. When I said I want to know you better, I am not merely paying lips-service. After everything, I still like you, even more so after knowing you better, even with all the self-loathing part but you should quit that since it is emotionally unhealthy.
I hope this is not the end between us.

After being evergreen for so long, I started feeling comfortable being alone but at the same time, I am constantly worried that I will not be able to find a girlfriend when I am still young. I will get slightly envy of loving couples I see along the streets which I suppose is normal for someone who is evergreen. Age is fast catching up with me. Can anyone advise how I can break free from my comfort zone that is about to ruin my future?

How do introverted girls find their partners? I'm a 21 year-old and yet all I do in my free time is to turn on my computer and play games. I'm in desperate need of someone special in my life.

Simple and modest girls are not as rare as guys think they are. It's just that these girls tend not to catch the attention of superficial eyes looking for supermodel fashionistas ;)

It feels awkward when someone else with the same Facebook name as you comments on NUS Whispers confessions regularly. It feels as if someone is talking while assuming your identity online and you can't really do anything. People who are familiar with my name (by the same faculty/school/module) might misinterpret my character when it isn't true. 

I wonder if I will get weird stares next time. LOL!

There was this girl I liked. She is a friend of my friends and sometimes she joins the group for lunch. She is very pretty and looks like a Hong-Kong actress and dresses fashionably. As I am a rather good looking guy who comes from a well off family, I've got the confidence to get her number. So only chatted via WhatsApp for a few weeks, then I actually asked her out for dinner. She agreed. Yippee! I plan to start off as friends first before going steady.

Okay. So I drove to her place and picked her up and she's darn gorgeous I tell you. She's in a dress, and I'm in polo shirt and jeans. In the car, I suggested to her to go Swensen's for dinner. It seems quite reasonable for a first date and I told her that I'll treat her to dinner. However, she politely started suggesting to go a Western restaurant at Chjimes as she said she had not tried it and her friend recommended it. Although I'm aware it's gonna be quite expensive, okay sure. No prob! I'll love to try something new too.

So when we ordered our food, she ordered the really expensive stuff such as prime steak and the deserts. And she kept asking "Can I have this?" and "Can I try that?" It's really difficult for me to say no, right? I said okay. I am not being a miser here as I can easily afford it because my parents give me about 600 dollars a week for allowance, but I thought she'll be more modest. Never mind that.

But what really pissed me off is that whenever I am trying to talk to her, she's texting on her phone and only looked up to smile at me when the food arrived. It's kinda funny as previously whenever I sent her a WhatsApp, she'll take almost a day to reply even though I saw two blue ticks. And now, she's glued to her phone. 

Later, we went shopping together. And she kept going to the branded shop and telling me this and that look really nice. She's obviously hinting me to get her a gift. WTF. I don't mind if you are my girlfriend or wife, but on the first date? Srsly? Glad I said "yea looks good" but didn't buy anything for her :D

I realised she isn't really my type and after that night, I never wanted to go out with her again despite she occasionally asking me to. I dunno if she's really interested in me or not. Or perhaps some stupid friend of mine told her my parents owned a multimillion dollar business. 

Maybe it's my own fault for being attracted to her because of her great looks in the first place. After this experience, I come to the conclusion that I like girls who are simple and modest. And I hope that this beautiful girl finds her sugar daddy soon.

Saw my female colleague use okcupid like damm pro sia

first let me clarify she is atb but local grad, quite fair skin, soft features type, in ancient china she would probably be like those that run too slow den kenna chop during war time but no one care and the camera pan away after 1 second

anyway she showed me her account, about 5-6 message at lunch time but she say she currently only chat regularly with 2 guys

no.1 guy about 6/10 (I consider tony leung a 10/10, elvin ng 8/10), his profile pic is him wearing some suit standing in the some place that is obviously not in SG, not really tall but look confident

no.2 guy about 8/10, really quite good looking, v broad shoulders and he is drinking beer, like in some cool café at one fullerton or clark quay

and I saw the match %, 90%+! I was v surprised cause what wld this AT have in common with these 2 sakti guys den she told me... she lied in her profile... 

put she is interested in craft beer, travelling, watching house of cards, lived in US, surfing, guitar all those stuff cause she knows guys with these kind of interest tend to be good looking and no aspergers

I asked her but like that you wouldn't have any shared interest, how to click? she say its ok.. these kind of guys like it when girls are dense in their interest and can teach them slowly

damm smart right????

 Hey there. I feel for you. I suffered from depression too and I was exempted from NS. I will never understand what you will have gone through in those times but I get the part about feeling 'distant' when the topic turns to NS. I suffer from a guy-related anxiety so I don't really have much guy friends. But for those that I do talk to, I feel really...disconnected from them. 

I don't think you should feel what you are doing is wrong. I used to worry that I would be judged against for having not gone through that experience, but usually, people don't seem to care. Perhaps I'm lucky I met the right people who don't, but I would still feel that most people don't really bother much.

Perhaps try talking to your female friends? Not all would really ask about your NS and you can feel better compared to talking to guys.

You will have to consider what you mean by "close friends". I'm assuming (from my own perspective), someone who is able to connect with you emotionally, and to some extent hang out with you ALONE on many occasions. Hmm, as I type here I really do wonder who are my close friends, while I can't say you will find one, rest assured you aren't alone. 
-
 
And after seeing , let me propose another hypothesis:
"If you think she's pretty, 95% of the population thinks she is already attached."

So funny, all these posts about "Oh, he/she is so handsome/pretty, he/she must already be attached! Sigh..."

Don't scared leh. Just go only.
-
 
To  I don't know if you're trolling or whether you're trying to paint a bad picture of "pretty girls". I'm an average girl, but I feel that you shouldn't attribute her behaviour to her looks. I'm glad you ran for the hills before you sunk too deep. 
-
 
Do people change (for better or for worse)? It's been so many years and this guy I know still behaves the same way. He treat different girls in a similar way, despite the difference in commitment levels. I wish he would be nicer to his current girl. 
-
 
do I tolerate if my bf lies? We were on the topic about his exes one day (he's my first bf) and he told me he broke up with her more than a year ago. Then he insisted on showing me her photo. It was a photo of them happy together. An event date was written together with the year. I was at the event so I knew when was it and it was only less than 6 months ago. So, clearly they didnt break up a year ago already... I didnt want to make a fuss so I didnt question him. Either way is it healthy to keep his ex photo in his phone after "a year"?
-
 
I recently met this girl for a first date. I think we hit it off pretty well, with many things in common, and we had a wonderful time. She is beautiful, funny, childlike, down to earth and being with her makes me really happy.

 The only possible issue is that she is a good 5-7cm taller than i am. While i sincerely do not mind, and she does not too (what a girl right) im just worried if this might pose a challenge in the future. Does anykne have tips or stories to share?

I've never been in love before. I've had some crushes when I was younger, but they were the sort of feelings that went away when I thought to myself, "Wow, that was pointless". But I've never felt the intense need to have someone by my side before. It's not like I'm a loner either; I actively participate in group events.

I do know what it's like to be lonely, though. I go through life knowing that I am not complete but never feeling that way, which is sort of paradoxical. I always wonder what I'm missing out on, as though there's an entire aspect of life that evades my experience. I look at people who talk about going in and out of love, but I only have superficial sympathy at best.

Suffice to say, I've never felt strongly about anyone.

Everywhere i go, i see people attached. I see ppl on facebook with status: "in a relationship with..." I see ppl with photos of them together with their partners, illustrating how happy they are together. I am not jealous, but admittedly envious. I feel like theres really no hope in getting a girlfriend in this life, especially since i do not have one or a friend whos a girl since the day i was born. Maybe 1 or 2 in primay school but even they didnt last long. So yeah is it ever possible to find one whos not attached or ideally an awesome girl who never had a boyfriend before?!?!
-
 
My partner and I used to have lots of "intimate" time to ourselves when I still stayed in school (one of the Residential Colleges). Now that I'm no longer staying there, things are getting frustrating physically especially since our houses are not viable options. Sigh what to do...

I'm a Chinese guy in my second year of university. In January, I got acquainted with an Indian girl (not NUS, but from SIT) through a mutual friend. We hit it off as friends. I found her funny, smart and beautiful. I wasn't also objectifying her, I genuinely thought she was beautiful then and even now.

After a month of hesitation, I picked up my balls and asked her out on a date. She agreed. Prior to this, I've not been with an Indian girl, only Chinese ones. She also hasn't dated a Chinese boy so we were both noobs. If anyone had told me before her that I would be dating an Indian girl, I would have laughed. After all, I've always had a preference for Chinese girls simply because similarities attract. That first date went well and we had many subsequent ones. Later in March, I asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend. She said yes. Some of you are probably thinking it's too soon. I've known her only for three months. But there are some things in life that I know for sure that it is what I want. She, I'm sure of. Confirm plus chop. 

I've met her family. Her family is Hindu, she is too. As far as religions go, I'm an atheist and I'm not bothered. Her family has been accommodating and nice to me. They taught me their cultures and fed me like really awesome home cooked Indian food. For instance, her mum recently told me that "she was going to curry me up." Lol! 

Here's the problem. I want to introduce her to my family, but I know undoubtedly that my mum will not accept our relationship. She knows I'm dating a girl, but she doesn't know I'm dating an Indian. My mum is traditional in her mindset and has said some rather unsettling, racist remarks about Indians and Malay on several occasions. I grew up listening to negative remarks and having negative stereotypes of the minorities in Singapore. It didn't help that I went to SAP schools, and although there was a handful of minorities, I hardly ever interacted with them. In defence of my mum, she's a nice lady, stay home mum... she's just misinformed.

My first "real" interaction, I suppose, was when I was an officer cadet in the army. My buddy was this crazy Indian dude who made OCS super enjoyable. For me, NS challenged the prejudices I had and changed them. Now, whenever my mum says something bad about Indians or Malays, I would correct her. Even now, after NS, I am constantly listing down prejudices I've on paper and I challenge them to see if they still align my values now. If they don't, they get striked out. Before, on top of being the son of a racist (or a misinformed) mother, I was also a homophobe, but I went for my first Pink Dot this year as an ally to a gay friend. So.. I'm learning. Slowly.

Back to my mum... I'm not sure how I'm gonna let her know that I'm with an Indian girl. I've told my girlfriend that my mum is incredibly racist. That the only reason I don't want to introduce her to my mum is because she's probably gonna say something really insensitive that might be hurtful. She said it's fine that we keep our relationship secret for now, but I know it's something I've to do and it would also mean a lot to my girlfriend to know my family. My dad's pretty bo chap about inter-racial relationships so as far as he goes, I know he'll be okay with it lah. Maybe he'll just tease me about it. 

Also, not exactly a big problem, but I've had a friend from JC ask why I was with an Indian girl. I'm pretty sure he's being an ass but his opinion doesn't matter to me. But it might matter to my girlfriend. I fear she might have to deal with future snide remarks like that.

Any advice for me and her? Sorry, this is super long.. I meant to write like three paragraphs, but went over limit. Paiseh. Thanks for reading!

I read somewhere that contrary to popular belief, guys are actually intimidated by pretty girls. Which means to say that as much as guys in general like pretty girls, they don't actually dare to approach these girls unless the pretty girl appears friendly and rather receptive to have a chat with the guy. Some bold guys may try come nearer or perhaps find something to talk when the pretty girl wasn't with her usual female friends, but if the pretty girl still appear aloof and not very interested, not many guys persist in talking to her, unless they happen to be in the same school/workplace. If they feel that they cannot get to talk much to the girl (mainly because the pretty girl is always with her clique of female friends or she simply appear uninterested), at most they will just steal glances at the good looking girl.

So from a guy's perspective, i noticed that no matter how good looking a girl is, if she appear aloof, not many guys dare to approach her in the first place,which means it is not necessarily true that a pretty girl confirm have many guys chasing her. This happen only if the pretty girl is also quite sociable. Agree?

By all accounts, I am a highly successful NUS student (good grades and all). But I really don't want anyone to lead my life. For I was (am?) afflicted with depression since my army days 3 years ago, and have never fully escaped its grasp.

You might think I'm one of the numerous slackers/chaokengers you met in army, but I'm really not. When your days are totally devoid of happiness and are full of negative thoughts, life gets hard really really fast.

No one in NUS knows this part of my life. In fact, I try my hardest to cover it up. I want to start on a clean slate. I don't want you to think I'm crazy/suicidal/chaokenger.

Because of that, I have to constantly lie to my friends about my past. Like when I meet someone new and the conversation inevitably turns to the topic of NS, I lie about having some condition while trying to repress unpleasant memories. Not only am I unable to contribute anything to the conversation, many of them end up thinking that I had a slack and really enjoyable time in NS, which leaves me stricken.

I know what I'm doing is wrong. The constant deception gets wearisome. But I really don't want to be stereotyped in that unpleasant way.

I suppose I will never have close friends.

I have this close friend of mine who is in his late twenties. I know his family as we were from the same secondary school. Unlike myself who came from a well-to-do family, he came from a below average household whose parents worked as a cleaner and a provision shop assistant. And the problem with this friend of mine, is that he is a spendthrift and wanted to show off that he is rich, at the expense of his family and those close to him.

He graduated years back and is now working as a marketing executive in a local SME. He gets about S$4.5 to S$5K every month. He loves to enjoy the finest things in life, and he wanted to have them. He goes clubbing, drinking, going to posh restaurants for meals, travelling, and a year ago he bought himself a Mercedes. He even bought a $7K handbag for his girlfriend on an occasion. And he loves posting his wonderful experience on Facebook to harvest likes and envy from friends. Okay, I'm fine with that. Have fun.

But the problem is, he is always getting into debts as he spent all his money on the wants and ended up borrowing money to buy those needs. There was even once he borrowed a five digits sum from me because his father needed it for a leg surgery. I reluctantly lent it to him on the account that his poor father really needed it and he even told me not to tell his parents. I agreed as I don't want to hurt his parents. But the amount hasn't been returned till date.

I believe I am not the only one who he had borrowed money from, but I seriously hope the words "loan shark" are not part of the liabilities section on his ledger. The sad part is, his parents who are in their late 60s are still working to support themselves, and when I casually ask them if their only son gives them monthly allowance, they said that he doesn't because he needs to save for his future and that they are still fit enough to work. I am very angry at this irresponsible friend of mine. Even during our schooling days, he always go out of his means to impress others, especially girls, and this attitude brought him more harm than good. 

I confronted him about his issue, and he told me he will soon repay the money. And his "soon" appears to be "never" because he has not even returned a small part of it. And he constantly said he is waiting for his big break in life and always complained about how Singapore limits the opportunities for him to be successful and badmouthing the company he worked in. He blamed everyone except himself.

And a month ago, he told me he is planning to get married as his girlfriend is pregnant. Oh gosh! Does he really think that he can support a family and give his child and wife a comfortable life in the situation like his?! Then I told myself that's it. I ended our long friendship by ignoring him and not wanting to be involved with anything to do with him. I bet he is going to ask me to loan him for the wedding too. I should spend more of my time and money with family and my girlfriend. Enough is enough! I had it with this mf guy in this mf life!

I am now much happier after I pretended this friend doesn't exist. As young adults in our 20s who have a decent salary, it is essential to save and make long terms plans instead of instant gratification. Life is unpredictable, and we cannot always assume that we will definitely earn back what we had loss today.

I feel so awkward when i am with people whom i just get to know and this is especially so when i go for camps. Everytime prior to camp, i tell myself that i want to be able to talk better to others but it just ended up failing badly as i am very bad at starting conversation especially to the opposite gender. Hence, there wasn't much interaction with me and the others and i may come accross as a quiet person to them which in actual fact, i can be quite noisy with people whom i am comfortable with.

 compare his treatment of other people to you. Is he specially being nicer? That's a sign. Of course, it's not foolproof.

Evergreen NUS postdoc here. Trying to get out of my evergreen status starting by asking a girl out but I'm a bit hesitant as I haven't figured out how to respond if she says no or just doesn't bother to reply.  ( Haiz I feel so paiseh as this is a really noob question considering that even secondary school kids  know the solution to. )

Im doing this one day in advance since I'm sure the admins are quite busy: Happy Father's Day! Tell your dad how special he is and how thankful you are for everything. I'm not sure why two separate days exist actually: IMO there should be an International Parents' Weekend so parents can take a staycation with their kids on hand to prepare treats for them:)

just wanting to ask for 2nd opinion.. is my ex using me when he wants to have sex the third time we met on a date (somemore in a car)? (We jump in r/s straight without being friends, we know each other from school) He tells me "guys have our sexual urge you know..." I feel that we are not that initimate to do such things yet so I acted blur and asked him what it was instead. But he still tried to do it and when I resisted he stopped, apologized all the way, send me home and broke up with me a month later.

*background: other than him insisting on driving to meet me, he does not spoil any gifts on me and we split all the bills. And we didnt drink any alcohols.

Going Year 3 next sem. As of now, my past two years' worth of results consists almost entirely of B+s and I'm feeling kinda mediocre, frustrated at not being able to get past this invisible barrier though not overly upset. Anyone else in a similar situation?

I totally agree with ! Where do some guys can't just be friends first before thinking about getting into a relationship? You know... Sometimes being too fast has its demerits and lets you get rejected pretty fast...

Actually, how does a guy and girl get together?

When I below 20, I thought all you have to do is for the girl to give you a chance, and for you to do nice things to the girl and touch her heart.

Then the last couple of years, it came to my understanding that there should be a connection between the couple. Some sort of a common topic and interest, so the relationship and blossom. As in, that should be the proper way.

Then recently, I looked at my faceBook, and read posts from around forums, and I realised, not many people have a common connection, they really woo the girl just for the sake of wooing. The girl is pretty! Yeah, go for it!!! I mean wtf? Like that really means the guy just kk* itchy and needs a good f*g, an object to make a baby/buy HDB, or scare old no companion. Most relationship just feels so superficial. Don't even have to look far, look at my own parents can see liao

My SP in camp really caught my interest and made me feel a little different. Somehow we got to know each other's identities before the reveal, and we were really shy when we met officially (usually I'm an outgoing person). Could sense that he has some interest in me as well. During the games we're awkward at times but we had great chemistry :) The problem is, I've been attached for over a year now. It has been a stable relationship, but I couldn't feel any affection from my BF anymore, despite me constantly making the effort to show care and concern for him when he's in the army. Me and my SP exchanged numbers but I suppose he realised that I'm attached from my WA profile picture. I'd really want to get to know him better (even just as a friend), but how do I do so without letting him get the wrong idea? :( 

P.S. I'm not sure if I'll get a "你算什么女人" kind of comment, but this has been troubling me for a while now.

I really want to have some FWB... I have had only one sex partner which is my ex BF but i have never felt anything during our intimate times before. I am a pretty girl ( almost everyone who has seen me says so) but i do not have much friends cuz i am shy and socially awkward. I really want to know how good can it feels with a guy. I do not like too muscular guys and i must feel that you are decent looking. So i am wondering is anyone out there looking for FWB? If do, please drop a mail at nusfwb@yahoo.com.sg!

I'm feeling really lost while writing this. During the preparation for foc, my fellow in charge and I got really close. To the extent that we sort of crossed the line. We'd often burn the midnight oil to complete our proposal as well as make props. My parents got really worried about me staying out late and so, he started coming over to my house to do our stuffs instead. He'd stay until the next morning before driving home. This action actually caused to neighbors to start gossiping thinking that there was some sort of hanky panky going on throughout the night. I brushed them aside as I thought my conscience was clear. Then during our last overnight props making at my house, we both got really tired and decided to take a short nap before continuing. That was when he rolled himself towards me and hugged me to sleep. I have been attached to my bf for 10 months and he has always been part of our conversation. I'm feeling extreme guilt now....And I don't know how I'm going to face him in the future. I'm definitely in the wrong for not rejecting it but I have no idea what got into me. Can someone advise me on what I should do?

 I personally think you should thread very carefully from now on moving forward, especially so if you very much value your r/s with your boyfriend. We can't turn back time and the world is unforgiving. That is reality. Even if unintentional, some mistakes once committed can never be unwritten and may have grave consequences.

And what sort of guy would hug a girl like that knowing she is attached. A good guy wouldn't do that even if the girl was sending signals. You ought to reevaluate him if there's a difference between what you think of him and his true self.

I think you need to come clean with your boyfriend. Honesty is the best policy and is required for a healthy r/s. Besides, I highly doubt you can keep it under wraps given your guilt. Hopefully everything will work out fine. :)

I don't know why... when my friends get together to play games and I win, they don't like that feeling because they say I never give chance. But when I give chance and my friends win, they say they good.

So should I give chance or not?

There is no such thing as a guy in a friendzone. Only self-entitled, unconfident guys who try to enter a relationship by the friend backdoor.

I am attracted to both man and woman. I plan to get married someday but I am worried on how my wife will react when she finds out my "tendency".

I told my boyfriend I might be bisexual, and to my surprise he's okay about it. There's so much exaggeration over sexual orientation that sometimes we forget the fundamentals of a relationship. He trusts that I am loyal, and in return I stay true to him. To me that's way more important than the gender of my partner. So no, I am not going to kiss and hook up with a girl to confirm my orientation. It can't get any less irrelevant than the colour of my poop today.

my colleague today tell me he is interested in our dept intern and ask me to "put in a good word for him" say he is mid level management at 31 years old, drive Volvo and nice guy overall

I ask him y don't you just talk to her more first? go for lunch with her? maybe try asking her out for dinner?

he say he is not buaya like me, the girl should know he is attractive, his style is not to care until she likes him in his own words "the girl shld chase me"

felt like hitting his face, 31 years old single old man going after NUS biz grad still act like he is some handsome king that don't need to spend effort to chase char boh

One of my drunk friends slept over at my place. I caught him licking my toe in the middle of the night when he thought I was asleep. I freaked out but at the same time got a little aroused and had a semi-erection.

5 of us had a sleepover one night. We started having late night chats and gossips about crushes and the conversation started getting sexual. Then one of us suggested playing strip poker since the room was getting hot and so we played til daybreak. Is it weird to do this since we are all guys.

Greetings fellow NUS peeps! I'm sorry to have to do this, but here's another gay-related post. I know by now some of you are probably sick of reading gay-related confessions. I am too, but please, bear with me for I must rant!!!!

I'm like the Mahcik Gateway to a lot of gay boys. It started in poly. I was from mass comm., so naturally, there were a lot of gay boys in there. The assumption between the girls was to assume all guys in our cohort are gay unless otherwise stated. Yes, it was THAT many. It was in poly too that I became very gay-friendly and started hanging out at gay bars and clubs on invitation from my lovely and fabulous gay friends. So you can somehow guess that my network of gay friends grew and I dare say is really quite extensive. Since coming into NUS (quick shoutout to all my nus Y2 biz peers!), I've stopped clubbing mostly because I tire so easily nowadays.

At my internship, I befriended this really cute SMU boy! He's sweet, charming and very gentlemanly! The kind that holds the door open for you one and buys you coffee in the morning. We always got lunches together and the conversations we've are quite fluid and varied (we both enjoy discussing politics and cats). And I really, really like him, and have half a mind to ask him out a date (yeah, I'm the kind of girl unashamed to initiate dates). We've so far maintained a cordial, professional relationship between colleagues... but recently, he added me on Facebook.

And well... 50 mutual friends. Of these 50.......

40 are gay boys........ That's 4 in 5 chance he's gay. A staggering 80%.

Can I cry now? Y MUZ U DO DIS 2 ME, CUPID? 

- Sad, lonely NUS girl

I graduated from NUS, and I follow this page because there are a lot of funny stories, a lot of heartwarming stories, but mostly because I effing miss NUS a lot. Besides the LGBTQ debate, I realised there are a lot of incoming freshies asking about tips for making friends, so here's my two cents worth.

I didn't manage to go for my own home faculty's orientation camp, but I managed to go for my (secondary?) faculty's one, and I did not regret it one bit. I'm the kind of person who probably looks very bitchy and dao, but honestly I am very shy when it comes to making new friends because I'm always afraid people will judge me and think I'm a loser. However, I think most of the times the orientation camps will really allow you to make long-lasting friendships (okay at least for your 3-4 years in NUS) that will change your uni life.

I do regret not being able to go for my own home faculty's camp, because I ended up always going for lectures and tutorials alone. I tried making friends during lab and tutorials, but it's hard cos I'm shy and I also look unfriendly. However, because I went for the other camp, I made so many friends that have changed my life forever. So to all the freshies out there thinking of whether or not going to orientation camp makes a difference, I say, if you don't even go, it's a 100% chance you won't make new friends at the camp.

Strangely not many have asked about staying on campus, but I'm just gonna put it out here in case any incoming freshies are wondering...do think about staying on campus at least in your freshman year if you really want to make friends. Although going for the orientation camp was useful, I think staying on campus was even more helpful in making friends. All the late nights studying (okay, more like eating supper and gossiping) were really memorable and I would not have traded staying all 4 years on campus for anything else in the world. If you're worried about your studies, just try in your freshie year; you've not much to lose anyway.

Sorry for the long post, but as a working adult now it kind of sucks, and I'm always thinking back on my NUS days and how they were probably the best 4 years of my education life. And all because of the friends I made. So freshies, be bold! Even if you're shy, just try! Think about it this way, NUS is a whole new place. Most people probably don't know you, so you can start from scratch. Everybody's too worried about their own things to be judging you, and people are actually much nicer and more accepting than you think because they're more mature.

(worse case scenario, even if you totally mess up, you get to reset once you graduate, because again, work is a whole other ball game. GOOD LUCK!)

The BF of my FWB is entering NUS this coming semester, and she told me not to look for her on campus. 

Recently, I see him on NUSWhispers, so I want to take this chance to tell him that she treats him so well :(

I've heard a lot of people say, "Looks are not important. Personality is." Really? It sounds pleasing and encouraging but do people really practice that, or is it all talk? People will first associate themselves with you if you are good-looking, before being interested in your personality, especially if you're a girl.

I was born to be short, plump, bad skin, bad hair and I have a slurred speech. Both my parents are unattractive too, hence most of this is obviously inherited.

During secondary school, my classmates are constantly bullying me over my looks, especially the boys. They kept calling me names and even once said that I look as if I got hit by a truck. Some girls joined in too. Thus, I became an introvert, just focusing on my studies and didn't bother to have a social life. It is really very depressing knowing that people always judge me by my appearance. Even if I try to be nice and want to join in a group, they may reluctantly let me but they will roll their eyes whenever I speak and they kept replying "Duh can can" or "Obviously". They blatantly showed me that they don't value my opinion as a person at all. And they seldom include me in their conversations and hangouts, hence I usually stay away from them because it is very hurtful.

There are moments in my life when I feel like committing suicide. What have I done to deserve this? I am not rude, I try to be polite. I know my looks are not presentable, and it is a great disadvantage in my life. At least in NUS, the people here are more mature and they don't intentionally show their contempt. I am thankful.

Especially for a girl, success in life is largely determined by the looks. You get to choose a better husband, a better job, guys will shower you with gifts, and people are more willing to help you and associate themselves with you. Maybe this is a good example of natural selection, to put an end to my inferior genes so I won't pass it on the next generation. Should include this example in my LSM answers lol.

"Like" this if you are still single. (So I know I'm not alone)

Recently, a close friend of mine shared with me about his love story to be. This includes his story of how he is chasing this girl, how she makes him feel, dem feels he had during the first date, etc. 
Normally, I would listen and entertain such stories as they are somewhat interesting. However, when he was sharing his story with me, I felt really uninterested maybe because I couldn't relate.This might be because I do not see the value in relationships.

Coming from a rather poor family, I just do not understand how I would want to spend money on someone else who may or may not even reciprocate the feelings I have for the individual. I guess I just don't want to make an investment where the returns are uncertain and I do not want to feel vulnerable to another person, only to be rejected. "Playing safe" and not taking risks has certainly not brought me happiness.

I wonder how people can spend so much on relationships which are destined for doom, and not save for the future. I wonder what they see in some relationships that the other party is worth spending all their time and money on. I envy some of my friends when their partner understand their current financial situations and willing to share the burden.

Engineering student's guide to confess to your crush and never get rejected:

- Take your crush out for a dinner or movie.
- Afterwards, take her to a quiet and romantic place. Ok, now is your chance to confess.
- Hold her hands, look deeply into her eyes and say: "I've been having an awesome time with you, and its time I need to torque to you about something"
- Before she can say no, lift her hand over her head and twist gently.
- ???
- Profit

You think it is cool to have them as your tool
But one day when you are old and alone
You will realize what a fool you were
For friends like these are just like gold
And only you would treat them with such cold
None will help you in your gloomiest days
And you have only yourself to blame
-
 
So this guy I got close to recently, just confessed. But he also said that the last week we seemed to be hanging out too often and he kinda got a little tired of meeting up with me. (We are colleagues, have lunch 2 times a week together, and met up for dinner once). This notion seems weird to me though. Although I understand how you can get tired of someone who is clingy, but even before the confession, you're telling me you're tired of meeting up with me? Kinda ironic isn't it? Someone please advice because I don't get it. I  didn't accept the confession though, because I think it would be better for us to remain friends.

I figured out what was missing...mental stimulation. I am not very good in sharing my perspective/ideas and talk about it. I sucks at explaining my perspective and when he ask for my opinion on things I don't know how to elaborate how I feels or why I thinks that way which ends up really FRUSTRATING!!!!! Sometimes I feel dumber than other people because I cannot articulate an elegant logic. Is there any way to "learn" to express their thoughts and opinions? I want to improve and being able to hold intellectual conversations with him. HELP PLEASE!!! Sigh. #helpneeded :(

@ 
Note: This is going to be a long post. 

‘’I'm afraid to post on Facebook and Instagram because I know I won't get many likes’’

Firstly, social media (Facebook, Instagram etc) doesn’t reflect reality accurately. 
So what if your ‘friends’ get 200 likes per photo? Likes are not a good reflection of anyone’s worth (your egs). Do you really need validation through likes? Having more likes doesn’t make one any better than the other. You are worth much more than the amount of likes you receive. 
--
Post whatever you want to post. Then again what is your intention for post pictures? Are you posting for the likes? Or do you genuinely want to ‘share’ your pictures with others. I’m assuming it’s the former in your case. If so, I suggest you spend your precious time on something else that will not make you so miserable… Life is too short for this crap! I guess it really boils down to what you want/expect from social media and your purpose for using it. 

//
‘’No one whatsapps me anymore and when I whatsapp them they don't reply me’’

Maybe it’s the way you present yourself to others. Could it be that you might come off as too clingy etc idk and you don’t realise it? You can confide in your CLOSE friends and ask them for some comments and advice. / How do you know that they are replying out of politeness, perhaps they are really busy… Then again true friends would make time for you and have the basic courtesy to reply your msgs at the least. Maybe you can try meeting new people. ^^
 
//
‘’It seems like everyone hates me’’

Don’t be silly! How can everyone hate you? There will always be someone who appreciates you (like you’ve mentioned, your family members. Or maybe you don’t realise that there are people supporting you passively).
Perhaps you could spend more time building solid friendships (quality over quantity). True friends are hard to come by and are worth the effort! You can also join some interest groups to meet new people. Volunteering is a good way to meet new people IMO. People who volunteer are generally nice haha (sry for stereotyping)

//
‘’low esteemed freak’’

LASTLY, you are definitely not a freak and fear not, you are definitely not alone in this. (Shall not go into the stats) You might not realize that some of these people with 200+ likes might be feeling the same way as you do if they are constantly comparing with others who are getting more likes than them.

Just remember: There is so much more to life than ‘’LIKES’’ and social media though I’ve to admit that social media does play a large role in our lives now. 

I have so much more to write but I shall stop here. 
Hope this helps!
Conflicted. Posting as anon although I would love to help if you need someone to talk to. Oh well….
Anyways, Jiayou! :)

Anybody feels lost after graduation? Somehow I feel that I have been tossed into the vast ocean on a tiny boat, not knowing which direction to steer. Seeing friends that know what they want in life and actively pursue them makes me envious. What should I do?

Is it weird for a year 2 girl (who is technically 1 year younger) to date a year 1 guy (yes sg guys in general who have spent 2yrs in ns)?? Idk but it seems so weird like yes the guy is one year older but the girl will tend to treat the guy like a xiao didi because of the seniority of the girl. Relationship wise, how are things gonna work out? Hope that someone can share their experience (anonymously is fine too)

I'm gay, soon to be a year 4 student and I don't have any gay friends to talk to about gay stuff. I don't have a lot of friends to begin with - I'm not very outgoing and find it hard to talk to strangers. I would talk to my close friends about my life but I'm hesitant to do so as I'm afraid to appear to be 'flaunting' my sexuality. Still pretty far in the closet as my entire extended family is homophobic. Sigh.

I thought I had no more feeling for you. But after meeting you again, I realized I still like you. i want to confess my feelings to you, but I don't want things to become awkward. What should I do?

With all the relationship, friendship and related posts in the last few weeks, I decided to give it a shot too. I'm a 22 year old guy in NUS and would love to get to know a girl who is intelligent, loyal, fun, caring and knows how to look after her health. Preferably good looking but honestly looks aren't a big factor. I just haven't found the right girl so far. Would just like to get to know someone first and see where time takes us. Even if it's just a friendship eventually, that is fine. Would prefer if there is no significant drama or baggage attached. I am an intelligent guy who has varied interests and loves nature, movies, food, etc. I love to cook and if you do too, that would be awesome :p

And to keep things anonymous, you can contact me on kik. ID: roaringwhisperz

This isn't a troll post and I would be grateful if I only get sincere messages. Cheers.

PS. If you just want to make a new friend only, that is fine too. Just say so in your message.

I've always made it a point to thank the friends who helped me with studies. Though I befriended them because they are good at studies and are known to be helpful to others. Got straight A-s with a B+ for FYP, placing me at exactly CAP 4.00 so I'm graduating with 2nd upper which was a pleasant surprise because I expected 2nd lower. The truth is I know I will never bother talking with most of these people any more.

If you have a terminal illness and you know the girl you love will definitely be sad to find out, how do you let her go properly? How do I break up with her without letting her know my illness, without making her sad about the break up, without making her feel sad at all. Anyone has someone who faces this kind of problem? Seriously at a loss of what to do.
-
 
First off I am not really good with words but I have something that I have to get off my chest and hence the confession. 

I had been in this 5 year long relationship with my girlfriend whom I met in JC and we were going to get married this coming year end. The reason to engage in this legal ceremony so soon was due to certain unforeseen circumstances which I guess most of of you can guess what it is. However, everything came crashing down when last month, she told me that she didn't want to get married with me. I was devastated. I was so looking forward to building a happy family with her but this dream has now turn into ashes. As I could not take this lying down, I probed and questioned her for the answer, the reason, hoping that I could still salvage it no matter how feeble the attempt could be but I was wrong. The truth as it has always been came in like a wrecking ball, crushing whatever bit of dignity and pride that was left in me. I was uttered speechless and helpless, being reduced to a pile of crap...

As it turns out, the truth is the baby wasn't mine to begin with. It was a product of her and her lover which she got together with when I was doing my time in the army. In other words she was two-timing me and almost wanted to make me the father of his child!!

 I will never ever forget the hurt and pain that she has inflicted upon me, for a scar so deep has been carved onto my deeply wounded heart.
-
 
Once, when a guy confessed to me, I got nervous and turned him down with a stupid reason. It's not because I don't like him; I do like him as more than friends. But I was in a shitty period in my life where I was feeling very low at everything, and I thought he deserved better, and also I didn't know why he would even like a someone like me in the first place. Sometimes I wish I could rewind time and be less nervous, and tell him that we could give it a try. Another selfish part of me hoped that he would pursue me once more, then I'll say yes. But what has passed, has passed. I discovered that he got attached a few weeks later, and I am happy for him. I still have some regrets though; I just hope that I will be more confident in my own skin next time to properly accept a confession.
-
 
I've been with my boyfriend for more than 2 years now, and we have not had sex until recently. I thought it would be good because we have been intimate in other ways excluding penetration, but all I end up feeling is the need to pee, and thinking is it going to be over soon.

Just wondering to all the girls out there, is this normal? Or does the problem lie with me?

(I don't mind you guys making jokes, but also appreciate if there are sincere comments as well!)
-
 
 I am. I really am. I am tired of being called a faggot by my bunk mates in NS who found out I'm gay, of being talked about behind my back. I am sick of having to lie all the time to my parents because I can't tell them all about my boyfriend when I really want to. I'm tired of not knowing whether my job might be in danger if my future employer finds out I'm gay. I'm tired of not being able to hold my boyfriend's hand or lying on his shoulder when we are on the train, like all the other couples around us. I'm sick of having my life up for debate, having my love judged as a sin, having my reality discussed like it's some abstract idea. 

I'm sorry you're tired because of people like me though. I guess you would prefer that people like us continue to suffer in silence, like we always have? 
-
 
I'm socially anxious, low esteemed freak. I take nice pictures but I'm afraid to post on Facebook and Instagram  because I know I won't get many likes, if any, while all my friends are getting 100 or 200 likes and hearts. I hate facebook, I think that it's so fake, my friend A who hates friend B and constantly bitches about her likes ALL of Bs pictures on facebook, but how ever fake facebook is it's still so important, how can I stop it being important to me?
 No one whatsapps me anymore  and when I whatsapp them they don't reply me. Those who do reply, reply out of politeness and when I try to drag the conversation they stop replying. It seems like everyone hates me .I know I looking for social validation in the wrong places and I have parents and grandparents who love me, but this social media is leaving a big empty space inside my heart as I gaze jealously at my friends picture, a picture that got 345 likes.

Guys I need some advice, thank you in advance!
I have met this guy, after chatting for sometime online, he asked me out. I'm an evergreen, I didn't have any close guy friends previously, I tend to stick around girl clicks. Most of the guys that are interested in me (they told my friends) often get to know my friends first, and we usually go out as a group. So honestly I don't really know how to treat a guy as a friend when we don't have any mutual friends. In the end I figured that going for dinner or movie is fine as long as I don't let him pay, and since he didn't make it clear that they were dates, so I went. We went out a couple of times, but the problem is I am a very sensitive person, and he just keep hitting the wrong button when we were talking, and it reaches a point that it makes me really uncomfortable to go out with him again. Now that he keeps on asking me to go out really annoys me, and even though I have been practically ignoring his messages, replying at a much later time and excusing myself from whatever proposal he was giving, he just doesn't seem to get the point that I don't want to see him anymore. What more can I do apart from telling him outright that I don't want to see him? On a side note, I don't think we are not close enough for me to "discuss" with him how I felt, and honestly, all I want now is for this to end, but I also don't want to be seen as a bad person, which I suppose would be pretty hard? So, guys out there, what should I be saying as a hint that you shouldn't be contacting the girl anymore?
-
 
If a girl gives you her number, does it mean she's ready to date? I don't want to ask her for date and get rejected :(
-
 
To  I totally get what you mean. It is super tiring to keep pretending to be someone you're not, just to keep up appearances. And trust me, the other party can feel it. But it seems like he doesn't mind the so-called 'gap' and perhaps he's more interested in your personality or something, to be bothered by this issue. 
For me though, I get this feeling sometimes with my close friend (opp gender). I don't really feel like there's much of an intellectual gap between us,  but I feel like he just talks to me to get his dosage of laughs (I am kind of his happy pill and vice versa), but when it comes to serious stuff/issues, he doesn't share. Not sure if it's because he thinks I'm incapable of understanding these things and hence unable to advise him, so he doesn't bother to say. Feel quite hurt about this. 
-
 
Actually I don't mind a younger guy. But I use age gap as the reason to reject/pretend to be oblivious to your hints. I enjoy getting to know you and wonder how our paths have managed to cross. Seeing you in your no.4 is a bit of a thrill. You counting down your days to ORD and finally entering NUS is as much excitement as a dread to me. The only reason you find me interesting now is because your social circle has been devoid of girls. Once school starts for you, who's to know if there is something better for you? Who's to know if there is something better for me when I graduate too? 

Crossing paths should be enough, yes?
-
 
I'm the OP of . Yes comments that bringing him out as well brings another set of problems such as bringing out other stuff to criticise blah blah etc are absolutely right. This is why i absolutely hated to include him in outings with my mom and me. And yes you are right to say he have very big ego and the very traditional, rigid, those 大男人 mindset and all. In fact gadgets will never solve his boredom because he behave very much like people in his times, unlike us the younger generation who can easily pass time by using smartphones etc. 

Precisely because of his nasty behaviour, my mom and me all the more we avoided talking to him if we can and this worsen the vicious cycle that he felt that we are not chatting much with him and enhanced his insecurity even more?

From what i know, ever since he start NS, his temper turned extremely bad plus he is the only son and the one who earned the most money in his extended family long ago, so every single person gave way to his demands because they were afraid of him. He is also physically big size.

It appears like i would have to accept reality as it is since there wouldn't be any solution to change this given that people have given way to his demands for decades:/ 

Even during school time, he still want to find me to talk boring stuff despite knowing that i need to focus so to solve this problem, i stayed in school to study so that all i have to do is go home sleep immediately and not listen to him nag/criticise/talk nonsense.

The fact that he refuses to let me decide how i wish to use my money seems to hint at his insecurity. I supposed deciding how i use my money reminds him that i now have the potential to earn some money and this threaten his position of being someone who once earned money for the family (even though the money i earned from my intership is a meagre amount compared to what he used to earn)?

Nevertheless thanks to the commenters as this let me know that i'm not alone in this situation. For now, i think the best way is to try stay away from him as much as possible eg mon to fri i am working, weekeneds instead of staying home play computer games, perhaps i should meet friends out.

I am an average girl, average looking with average height and weight and average personality. Plus I am avergreen so any kind souls out there who want to know me better do feel free to leave a message :)

My father is in his early sixties and had retired half a year ago. He had saved enough money to provide my mom and me a decent standard of living. Therefore, currently my tuition fees, food, transport everything was paid by him. 

However, there is something about him that drove my mom and me to frustration. He could not communicate well with people in general and thus he can't socialise well. This resulted in him "feeling bored" all the time, having to scroll through channels and channels of TV Programmes but yet not knowing what to watch. Then he start to look for old things and when he can't find them, he verbally abused my mom with vulgarities and said very nasty things. Precisely because he can't socialise well with people, he always demand that my mom accompany him out for all 3 meals. And because his lunch and dinner is always 2-3h earlier than me, he will only demand that my mom eat with him and as for me, ever since he retired, I never really had the chance to enjoy lunch/dinner company with my mom. 

There was once I managed to end school only at 8pm and I already arranged to meet my mom out for grocery shopping. However, I only ended up having only enough time to eat my dinner and we went home empty handed. Even then, he still shouted and nagged at us using excuses like we never bring him food when the truth is he is afraid being alone at home. In short, when I go out with my mom, we am not allowed to leave him alone at home for too long or he will find excuses to shout and scold my mom.

My mom still felt that we should try to chat with him, if not he might end up with dementia fast. Problem is, when talking to him, sometimes certain phrases for no reason annoyed him and he started quarrelling and nagging and criticising for super long over a minor topic. If you don't talk to him, he ended up finding topics to talk and always kept bringing out old days stories again and again. 

I'm currently on internship and had only weekends to truly enjoy myself by playing computer games. Many times I do not wish to hear him talk because he always talk same old topics and I damn sian of hearing same old things. Then out of nowhere he would start finding things to be critical about you if you refuse to chat much with him.

My dad by nature is very bad tempered and controlling, simply because he think he have the money. My internship paid me $600 and he don't even allow me to use a single cent of my money! I really do wish to bring my mom out for a big meal and spend quality time with my mom but given how he controlled my money, I don't think I am going to get a chance to do so:( 

He is not the kind who can be talked to for the sake of giving way to us. Can anyone tell me if this is typical of growing old? Or is he being selfish by not allowing my mom to go out with me, except once a week and not for too long. Is he simply feeling lonely? Our family is small, only my dad, mom and me so if my mom and me goes out, it's only him alone at home. 

What puzzles me most is why neither my mom nor me minds being home alone but then he minds it so much? Why must he always find someone to talk but yet no topic to talk? No topic talk then don't talk lah, don't find excuse to verbally abuse/criticise or nag us over minor things just to release your frustration of being bored.

I'm so sorry for the long post but I really hope someone can let me know and understand what exactly is going on with my dad...

Sometimes I think I am getting ahead of myself. It is like my head races faster than my heart or is it vice versa? Anyway, I have a major crush on this guy from the engineering faculty. He has a lot of potential in him, somewhat a boyfriend material, humorous, easy going and extremely SMART. I on the other end is barely surviving with exams. I can get really overwhelmed with the fact that an high achieving student is talking to a nobody shrimp like me.

We talked a couple of times before realizing I can't keep up with him. Our level of conversation is like him being very articulate and I a stone head, a girl of few words. WTF. At times I just can't help but being very cautious while talking to him. So CAUTIOUS to the point that I find it hopeless and pointless talking to him because I can't be who I really am. For instance, when we talk, I am the type that take forever to reply because I want my reply to be the BEST one. The one that would make an impression on him. Despite my shortcomings, he still makes initiative, spending time talking to me. I don't understand why would he do that. Guess he is just being nice.

Fact is still fact though, I AM being someone entirely different. Sadly to say, I am putting up an act to impress him or prove that I am of his level. Yes, I am not feeling comfortable. Do you think he realized it all? Fuck la. If this continues, I doubt we can ever continue as friends because plainly speaking, it is tiring, that is not who I really am and my self esteem is going to plunge down Niagara Falls. #averagegirlproblem Any advise is very much appreciated for this current situation. How do I stop being cautious while talking to Mr. Smarty Pants? To all Mr. Smarty Pants in NUS, how do you view girls that are average in their studies?

I'm a year 4 female in NUS. My parents, like any other parent wish that I would find a boyfriend, get married and settle down.

Although they knew that I wish to stay single, they do not know the exact reason why. I always questioned them why they wish I settle down and the answer I always get is "it's just a natural rite of passage". To me, I will never accept this reasoning. Just because it's the norm doesn't mean I should follow it right? Why must I marry a man? Why not I be with a woman instead? Yes biologically it's simple, because a man and a woman can produce offspring. However, I never wanted a child and all I wanted is just a partner who can go out enjoy life with me, provided we have the financial means. Other than the biological reason, or the fact that men offer women emotional and physical security and also because it's the norm, I don't really see the need to be with a man. In fact I felt that women offer better emotional support because they are in general empathetic in nature.

Truth here is I wanted a long term relationship with a woman because I don't think I can be truly happy with a man. I simply like woman more, ever since I was in secondary school. Although I occasionally fantasize sex with man, most of the times I fantasize sexual relations with females and females who attracted my attention are usually average looking but in my opinion, they have a "sensual look". To put it simply, I wish to have a female partner both for companionship and sexual relations. 

I however, stand firm on my value that I would never go into sex with anyone unless I am very sure that this person would be for a long term relationship because I do not want to end up with multiple sexual partners as this increase the risk of contracting STD. So yes, I'm a evergreen virgin because I do not know which other females are interested in women and thus I can't even get started. I look like any other girl and is considered decent looking and no one would ever suspect that I am actually attracted to women.

One more thing, I would only try enter a relationship with a man if and only if a relationship with a woman turns out really bad. Otherwise I will always be questioning the phrase that a woman can only be happy with a man.

Please don't flame me. I need to hear you guys opinion on this... Am I merely confused over my sexual identity? Or rebellious because I always like to purposely do things differently from other people? Or am I really considered a lesbian and is likely to remain so?

Despite being a graduate from one of the top business schools in Asia, I always feel inferior because I am not a banker/lawyer/doctor. Is it true that girls will only want to date these 'high class' professionals? or what other kind of professionals would girls typically like to date?

There is this girl that is struggling so much with her self confidence and self esteem. Whenever we chat, I could sense that she wanted to share a little more but kept holding herself back from sharing. Her replies are always short. I reassured her and prompted her to share and talk a little more but whenever I do that, she would switch the topic we were on. This made our conversation left hanging all the time, like there is no proper ending to it. I think I do like her and enjoy chatting with her very much. I would like to help her in this area but I am not sure how I should go about it. I don't want to appear too pushy which may lead her to avoid or shut away from me. She is also a rather average girl but that doesn't matter. What I really want to get across to her is the both of us can work out and build our relationship, as of now friends, in a much deeper level if she would be more expressive. How can I let her know that it is okay to make mistakes with me? How can I make her feel that it is completely secure to share her thoughts? I really want things to work out between us.

A year has passed, yet I still can't get you out of my mind.
I lie every time I tell people that it's cool that we're not so close anymore.
Truth be told, I think about you every single day without fail.
I still skip a beat whenever someone mentions your name.
And my rejecting your invitations? I'm just too scared that I would be all over you...again.
Sometimes I wish that I weren't born a gay.
Not being able to tell someone you love about your feelings sucks.
and there are still people who say that being gay is a choice...
If I could, I would...

Seeing that so many people call MLM their "business" and categorize it under "proper marketing", how would you know whether someone is asking you to join in a new business venture or an MLM? Any thoughts? I'm asking because recently so many people have been asking me whether I would like to earn extra money in my free time and I'm cautious about it (from many stories, I kind of have an idea how MLM people drag you in). I'm all for entrepreneurship but I am quite put off by MLMs.

Life sucks. I don't know why I am in this earth for. If it weren't for my parents, I would just rather die and leave my misery behind. I'll work just to support my parents and after they are both gone, I don't see a point in living anymore.

I recently got to know this guy through work. Thing is, I think I'm starting to fall for him. Is it justifiable that I'm REALLY falling for him though it's merely 1-3 weeks of knowing him, or maybe I'm just feeling lonely :(. We get along well, always have something to talk about. But I only found out he recently broke up with his girlfriend. Maybe around 1-2 months ago? What should I do? I know there isn't a specific time frame for the 'mourning period' but still. I'm getting slight signals from him which adds to my confusion. We're both entering different universities this year. Worth the shot or no? 
-
 
Ever since i have unofficially graduated, my parents have always been asking if there are people wooing me. Whenever i say no, my parents ask if my standards were too high. Then whenever i go out, they like to ask the name and gender of the friend and how i get to know the friend. And if it is a guy, they start to worry and tell me not to go to dark alleys or do some stupid shit or dont even hang out alone with him.   I feel like i am old enough to tell if my guy friend is decent or not, and if you dont even allow me to go out with my guy friend, how do you even expect me to get wooed? and on one hand, they keep encouraging me to go out with my good friend whom i have friendzoned. We friendzoned each other a few years ago. Yes i understand that they are protective of me but sometimes, i just dont like it that they ask so many questions. And they are always pushing me to my good friend even when i told them i have friendzoned him.

My boyfriend can play up to 12 or 13 dota games daily. I believe he has an addiction and have tried to advise him about it for more than a year. He is adamant that he doesn't have an addiction. 

I have found our relationship to have suffered since he picked up the game as I hardly get to spend any time with him, especially after the exams (which is ironic). 

Time that I get with him consists of the minutes between dota games when I get a reply. Even if we should meet up, he's late and always eager to head home after 2 or 3 hours to play. 

I don't know what else I can do about this entire situation and I am aware that he should never become my addiction (in my bid to raise his awareness of how the game is affecting his studies and his daily life). I think 3 or 4 games daily is fine, but when it takes up the entire day, even eating and studying hours...? 

What can I do? As much as I love him, I don't think I can cope with this much longer. This drains my soul each and every time I see that I'm a secondary option in his life.

I'm the author of . I just wanted to say: thank you to everyone who left comments on my confession and to the page administrators who have provided me (and many others) an outlet for them to express themselves. Actions beget consequences; I understood the risks when I first became an escort. I knew that my past would catch up and there was a high chance that it would complicate any future relationships I have. I thought long and hard about it, and made the decision to be an escort. I certainly don't regret the choices I've made and I take full responsibility for them.

I took the advice of the crowd and one that my heart tells me it is the right thing to do. I told her about my past. We were running together at Bedok Reservoir on Tuesday night; at the end of our run, when we were cooling down at the floating platform, I blurted it out. I told her, "I know we are getting serious now, and I know  that I owe you a reply with regards to our future. But before we even think about that, you need to know that for the last three years, I've worked as an escort." There was neither nervousness nor pause in my speech. I had gone over the conversations in my head hundreds of time — but the truth was, I truly felt nervous and scared. I told her I had resigned from my job, and that my feelings for her were genuine and uniquely hers. 

She kept silent for a bit before she asked me questions. How many women (and men) have I slept with? How many casual partners have I had outside of my job? Why did I choose to be an escort? I answered her honestly. Her voice shook as she asked. I knew she was affected by the truth. I could sense it. I've spent numerous hours listening to my clients tell me about their problems. I've heard the changes in tone and pitch of their voices, and now, I was hearing the same in her.

After she was done asking me questions, she told me she wanted to go home. We had planned to have supper together, but alas, it didn't happen. I walked her home like I've faithfully done at the end of each date except that this time, in complete silence. Neither words nor laughters were exchanged. I knew she was thinking and processing what I just told her. She always had this look when she thought hard about things. I've gotten too familiar perhaps with her facial expressions that I now know them by heart.

When we arrived at her lift lobby, just right before she went in the lift, I asked, "Will I hear from you again?" She turned to look at me and said, "Yes". That she needed some time to process this first and would let me know soon what is going to happen moving forward. The doors to the lift closed, and I made my way home feeling both defeated and hopeful. 

Yesterday night, while I was out bowling with friends from school, I received a Whatsapp message from her. She wanted to meet me. I made an excuse to get out of the game, and left to meet her at the playground near her place. I didn't know what was going to happen, but I felt so anxious on the cab ride there. When I got there, she was already waiting for me on the swing. I sat on the other empty swing. We kept silent for awhile, before I asked if she's made a decision. She nodded her head, and then told that she wanted a future with me and that my past, to her, is just that, my past, and that as long as I remain faithful to her, she was willing to have a go at the relationship with me. She made me promise that her parents must not know of my past.

In my head, I was jumping up and down in secret. I reassured her, again, that my feelings for her are genuine and I too wanted that future with her. 

"I guess this means we are a couple?", I asked. 

"Couple of weirdos, you mean?"

Thanks again for allowing me to share my story and giving me the advice I needed. I promise to treasure her. P.S. It's not all fun being an escort, trust me.

If you love something, let it go. If you don't love something, also let it go. Basically just let go of everything and expect it to come back begging for you ~

Dear , your post reminds me about myself in my past relationship. I agree with you that there are some things he has done wrong. He shouldn't restrict your uni choice and he should let you know about the girls he had been talking to, since it's only fair when he had asked you about the guys you had talked to. Well he's also emotionally dependent on you (nothing wrong with that, perhaps just immaturity). But let me offer you this other perspective about the "cheating" part. I also accused my ex-gf of cheating. Why? Because she didn't spend quality time with me and I felt that she enjoyed herself more with other guys than with me. I don't know about you, in fact I don't know you. But it takes two hands to clap. It could be your actions (or lack of) which made him feel so insecured. It is not so much about you cheating but more of because he didn't feel loved by you. Did you enjoy yourself more with your other guy friends than when you were with him? He might have felt this way.

Having said that, I do agree with the commenters that it's the right move to break up with him. Be careful that he may find ways to come back to you again and ask for forgiveness (read: emotionally dependency). But draw the line clearly, and make sure he knows that you are serious about it. Cheers!

Posting this on both Nus Whispers and NTU Confessions because I really need all the advices I can get .

I ended a 3-years relationship with my boyfriend because we just couldn't align our future goals together. He was my emotional support throughout my days in university. For the first time in my life, I felt truly happy with him together. He was the best boyfriend I could ever ask for. However, after the break up, I'm beginning to feel really lost and empty. It's as if I'm a bird who left a nest that's always so secure and comfortable, and now having to fly on my own through thunders and storms. (yea I know it's really melodramatic but this is what it really felt like). 

While I have my own wonderful circle of friends, a first job I'm very excited about and started some new hobbies, I still feel like he's the center of my world and I'm happiest when I'm with him. For a while, we were able to see each other everyday. Now we can't and I feel a little bit like something has been taken from me. Is what I'm feeling normal for the circumstances or have I become overly dependent on him for my happiness?

For the most part, I feel like I will never be as happy again. Yes life goes on. I will still continue to strive in my career and take care of my family, but I feel as if I will just be living life through the motions and not be genuinely happy. 

Is it normal to feel this way?

Has anyone ever been in a situation where what they thought was their passion in life was actually not, or had that passion stripped away? 

I've already graduated from NUS and am now overseas doing a course not available in Singapore and is what I've always thought for a decade to be my dream career. Or course, I wasn't expecting it to be easy, but I currently feel like maybe I'm not cut out for it and that passion was dying slowly (or maybe it was never there at all). I've been feeling depressed (and somewhat suicidal) ever since and I'm not sure what to do.

Any form of advice that isn't destructive would be deeply appreciated.

People are always fighting for gay rights nowadays and I'm glad that this is happening, but the truth is, gays are only one of the few minorities out there. I have a problem too and i must say i can't help it, i don't have the choice, but my sexual preference is neither for guys nor for girls,its for dogs... :/

I know it sounds gross to many of you but please hear me out. I don't have a choice either, I want to NOT want to have sex with dogs or puppies but i can't. I desperately want to feel more attracted to people than animals but i can't...I always feel horny when i see my house's little poodle and i have the urge to have sex with her. 

If only my mum knew how our old dog really died.... That actually it was a result of me being too "rough" on her that faithful night.

It feels horrible when you like sb and that person is hung up over another person. When you have to pretend like you aren't hurting and type stuff comforting them that go against what is actually screaming from your chest - "just let him/her ago alrdy....I can show you what's love!!!!!"

Just want to rant it out.

My bf is always paranoid about whether I'm cheating on him. He doesn't like it if I even talk to a guy. Back when before uni when i chose CE as my choice he even told me stories to hint me not to choose it but I don't think he should control my future so I still put CE as my choice. Whenever I went for camp he would send a lot of whatsapp messages about being upset. (He's coming into uni same year as me but different uni different course) Its double standard that he thinks I shouldn't even question if he talks to girls when he did. Even if I'm not upset and just slightly mentioned anything about it he would get upset also. The worse was he doesn't like it if i talk to guys when I told him its just project or guy friends. Not like I ever questioned about the girls in his clique.

And everytime he thinks I'm cheating he would just break up with me. And he start asking me about my well-being after a month or two and I forgive him and the cycle repeats. Having fed-up with the emotional cycle, I just make-up some cheating stories all about my guy friends and me to tell him about this time. He blocked me. I guess we would never talked again. It hurts but I guess someone have to take the first step..
-
 
I can forgive her for throwing used sanitary pad on my face, I can swallow my pride as a man and received those abusive slaps on my face. I'm willing to tolerate all these, because I love my girlfriend, going the extra mile because I'm afraid of losing her.

However she told me that " we are over, time's up". When I went down on my knees to beg for her forgiveness ( I really don't know what I have done wrong!!), she gave me a smile and patted my head before she left. What does that mean? Do I have a chance to salvage this relationship? PLEASE HELP ME!

Sometimes I really feel that I'm a failure as a man. Can't even keep a girl by my side.

I finally went to UHC for counselling after so many people asked me to. But let me tell you its useless. They only allowed me to go for 2 sessions and I don't think they helped at all because the counsellor looks like he doing it unwillingly and doesn't cares at all.

 i have to say that i agree with you. i got the impression that the counselor couldn't be bothered. The overall advice i got from him was to basically LLST(lan lan suck thumb)

Is it supposed to be embarrassing that someone is still evergreen and a virgin at 27? I don't think it's that big of a deal, but why am I so afraid to let people know that?

Can you judge a person by who they follow on Instagram? 

If a guy follows a lot of blatantly gay individuals (some of these accounts posting pictures mainly of half naked men), how would you make of it? Would you suspect that he is gay too? (Minus the possibility that he has an extensive circle of gay friends, but could that imply something too?)

Please note that I have NOTHING against homosexual people at all. 

Sometimes you develop romantic feelings for someone and you'd just like to find out whether their sexuality aligns with yours... and for me, as of now, I don't feel comfortable directly questioning them about it to get an answer. 

No hate comments please.

To: 

Your story sounds familiar to me. And perhaps the night you sent this confession was the night when I waited outside my friend's room without knocking her door because she does not want to see me anymore. That day was national best friends' day and I missed her so badly. So i texted her instead and i did it knowing that she would not reply. Maybe i am looking for her because i felt lonely at that time but i am certain that i want the friendship as well. But i can't have it anymore, cos we have changed and so is our friendship. I maybe laughing and having fun with my other best friends  and post my happening pictures in social media, but my life is not complete without her. 

I dunno whether you are that friend or not, but if you are,  please don't assume that. You are like a family to me and i am dying to fix our friendship back.
-
 
 I was strolling through my Instagram and guess what, I FOUND HIS INSTAGRAM!!! Maybe its fated that we meet but I did not follow him because I'm shy hehehe. From his posts, I think he is really gonna be a wonderful boyfriend. His IG display picture looks good :D He seems to like running a lot. Why not we meet for a run in school some day and go have dinner together at the places you go before? I like to run too! Really hope to have a nice date with you :D

Ps: I am still evergreen so maybe if you get to see this or if we meet again maybe you can initiate? And sorry for stalking your insta hehehe

I had a recent discussion with my friend about pre marital sex and intimacy. I asked him, what base he had done with his girlfriend. He admitted that he only made out and did some cuddling. Being evergreen, I didn't have much experience either. I did cuddling and kissed a girl (who wasn't my gf).......

But actually we are talking about the same girl.... T.T and he is not aware.

   Yes, her mum is cancerous and that was why I agreed to break up. I thought she should spend some time sorting out her family issues before engaging in another relationship so quickly. 
Apparently, she doesn't think like this. I guess her life is largely influenced by what her mum wants and not what she wants.

I cannot seek help from anyone because I know it may hurt her and myself. But i need an outlet and I think the anonymity here does help in the situation i am going through. Yes, I did learn a lot from this relationship. 

Parents serve as a role model for their children. Now, I can understand why she has difficulties getting along with people with different ideas at work. Maybe she grew up in an environment whereby the man must always give in to a lady's demand. 

Maybe it is not that i am not good enough. It is that no one is ever good enough for her. Her mum is critical about everything, and she is no longer on talking terms with her parents and siblings for more than 2 decades. 

Yes, i don't speak to my siblings everyday, but we do go out together at times. Her siblings don't even dare to call her out for their outings. She thinks that i am immature, really?

I may not be the most filial son, and i do quarrel with my parents at times. But at least, I do give them money every month ever since i started working. I appreciate them for taking care of me for the past 20 over years of my life, giving me the best they could even when we were poor. Also, i believe in contributing to the family unit.

When she was young, her paternal grandparents used to visit her and did house work for their family. Her mum refused to pay her grandparents, even though both of her parents were working adults. 

I cannot understand what she was thinking. It takes money and time for people to travel around. You can't expect a free lunch just because they are your in laws. Okay, at the very least she could have provided them a meal. But she choose not to and chased them out when she grew emotional.

How will you feel if your daughter scored 250 for her PSLE? Will you feel happy for your daughter, or will you scold her for doing so badly? Unfortunately, her mum choose to reprimand her. I know she has the best interests for her child, but she was still a kid!

We all live in an imperfect world, so let us accept our weakness graciously. We should not allow unrealistic expectations to affect our emotions because it can be cancerous. I think i will be happier living a single life than living in such a family.

I am an evergreen guy. I like flirting with girls but do not see the need to start a relationship with any of them. I am happy with my singlehood.

I'm not a NUS student but it's intended recipient is a graduated NUS girl who is getting married today.

2 years ago, when i was a hardcore playboy, I met this special NUS girl at a club and I successfully hooked her up after months of  hard work. However, I wasn't serious in this relationship at all.. I was dating another girl at the same time, in addition i still have multiple FWBs. 

Ever since the first day i came out to be a play boy, I have always remember the golden rule "出来玩的，谁先投入真感情，谁就输了“

As time passed by, I get to know more about her. Although she came from a broken family and went through a lot of hardships, she is always smiling so sweetly. Not only that, she is always bringing happiness to people around her .Actively doing  CIP at various hospitals, helping out cancer kids. I always find it quite amusing how those kids who are screaming in pain at one moment, can sleep so peacefully in her warm embrace in the next moment. She is so different from all the girls's i have dated, it's just too bright..Too bright for my eyes....

You guys are going to hate me for all the horrible things I have done next.

My worse fear came,when I found out that I have became more and more emotionally attached to her as time goes by.
I told myself, "I have to end this whole nonsense right now! If not there will be one day when I will get entangled in the fear of losing her. 我不能输！我不能输！" 

I met her at our favorite spot at East Coast park and confessed my true identity to her. After that I closed my eyes waiting for the usual slap to the face, blah blah blah..... before the girl f off. The slap didn't came , I received a hug from her instead. She said, " I still believe in you" . I dropped a tear but I quickly wiped it away and shoved her away. ( That tear that I have shed, hurts my pride as a invincible play boy, that I always believed and so proud of)

I shouted at her, " Who you think you are!? You don't have to throw your body at me, why must you be so cheap? 贱！”
I took out my hand phone and showed her all the intimate photos of me with other girls and said, " 你看！她们每个都比你好几百倍！ 为什么还厚脸皮不要走？要卖去Geylang!" She turned and walk away ,crying really badly and I stay there for hours after that. I had never felt so empty in my heart before.

We didn't talk to each others since that day onward, but I will constantly stalk her fb profile whenever I think of her. Until one day I found out that she is getting married. That's why today i went to her place early in the morning to see her for the final time. I secretly hide at a corner, watched her appearing in her wedding gown. Her smile is still the same, sweet as ever with that rabbit tooth. It is true that " a women is the most beautiful in wedding gown, really angelic". The man in wedding suit could have been me.......

我已改过了，可是太迟了。。。我输了. I wish that she will have a blissful marriage.

I used to fell for this one girl I met in my workplace. I ask her out a few times but was always rejected. I decided to confess to her one day and she say she is already attached. Am I considered green or evergreen since it is a one way relationship. 
-
 
I am a evergreen guy.  Whenever someone ask me if I have been in a relationship, I will feel very embarrass and lost of words and will always try to change the subject. Being the shy and timid guy, I really feared people will judge me for that. That is also a reason why I have started avoiding CNY. Is that normal for my case?

In a few months time, I'll be leaving for my student exchange overseas, but it is shaping up to be a heavy heart which might accompany me when I do so. 

One of my grandmothers is getting on in years, and sadly her age has taken its toll on her, especially in the last few months. From the information gathered from my family, she doesn't have much longer to live (yes there is a time frame given since the turn of the current year) and it is very plausible that she might have to exit the door during my exchange, or during this time period, right now. In the past few days, her legs have been drastically weakening and is finding it hard to even get up and sit down, and it isn't very emotionally encouraging that she has been lamenting about it, while increasingly dropping things from her hands of late too.  I haven't been exceptionally worried about this, but now the worries and doubts are slowly climbing up; the possibilities of a greater rate of drastic decline are very real in my opinion... 

As of now, so many scenarios are emerging in my mind. A part of me wishes that she goes smoothly and quickly with the least pain, such that I wouldn't leave with any heavy feelings and yet have to materialise the dreaded fear of taking a return flight home and having a double whammy of losing a part of my exchange life, undergoing the necessitated yet undesirable notions of a funeral before resuming it and losing time in travelling, exploring and comprehending the future. That'll be so disruptive, and so emotionally draining at the same time :(

Another part of me wishes that she lives long enough, and healthy enough for me to see her alive again when I return before she goes, though I fear I may not have this opportunity to do so. 

I don't even know if my family actually understands what I'm thinking, but it doesn't really matter directly to them since I'm the one who might last see her alive at the airport, not them. I've got activities planned up now and the near future and I feel so selfish thinking about them when my grandmother is most likely about to leave the world soon; I don't wish to be seen as foreseeing her passing but the time frame given has made me do so inadvertently. I feel so naggy here but I hope you guys understand what I'm thinking.... 

What should I do to mitigate the contrasting and divisive feelings that I have right now and possibly for some time? ://

 That sounds like my last relationship. Looking back, it was a toxic one to be in, and I was absolutely right that he just wasn't putting much into it (we weren't doing LDR, so do take that into consideration). If it's not just exam period, if he never puts in effort for you, then consider ending it. I'm in a much happier and stable relationship now, where I never doubt my position in my SO's life.

"People make time for who they want to make time for. People text, call and reply to people they want to talk to. Never believe anyone who says they’re too busy. If they wanted to be around you, they would."
So if he doesn't call, text, reply to my text, initiate conversation, show care and concern, ask about my day, ask about my upcoming exam, initiate outings, he doesn't give a damn about me.

  Colin, unfortunately it isn't comfortable as you know her personally and taught her before. I want you to know that sometimes the most joyful can also be the most unhappy. I hope we can all show care and concern, not just to the unhappy souls, but to all those who put on a smile to bring joy to our life. 

While i do feel betrayed, I do pity her for growing in such an emotionally abusive family. The family maybe rich, but empty emotionally. We are no longer friends, because both of us will just get hurt talking to one another. 

I know that her mum likes the current guy. Maybe it is because the guy is willing to spend money on her daughter and buy her jewellery within the first month of the relationship. 

To be honest, I never believe that money can every buy us love or happiness. Her mum places her security in money and not love; and she is never satisfied with the status quo. We will never be always poor, just like how we will never be always rich. So good luck to this next guy.

In every marriage, we exchange vows but not many of us understand its significance.

"I take you to be my lawfully wedded husband/wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part."

The wife/husband should never blame her husband/wife for being rich or poor, because she has taken this vow. But her mum is constantly unhappy because her dad was not able to bring home more money to satisfy her lifestyle. She is constantly comparing him with other better guys, which i think is toxic.

Maybe I am just better off alone without her.

To  please be honest with her. I have experience with this as a girl whose bf has had many many many casual experiences with random girls he picked up before me. He came clean and he let me know about his experiences and he assured me about how his feelings for me were different and how he wanted this relationship for the long term. We've been together almost 3 years now and we are very happy. So please dont be afraid :)

I have been on exchange in a western country for a few months now and I really am beginning to notice the different dating styles. Men in Singapore tend to be highly vague and indirect when they are interested in someone, and it takes them really long to ask the ladies out. Ladies in Singapore tend to also be passive about their relationships, always waiting for the men to make the move and hardly ever taking ownership of the potential relationships they want to be in. Is it an Asian mentality to play safe by securing the person as a friend first before trying to date them?

,  Pink Dot's this Saturday actually, so hey, we could all meet like-minded people there or at least people whom we know won't discriminate us there :)

It's tough knowing that "friends" you once knew turned their backs once they know your sexual orientation doesn't match their expectations, but you know what? Screw them (not literally, pun intended though). There's definitely others you can speak to who will not judge, and I'm glad to have found friends like so. I'm sure you will find yours (or maybe they are already around you) as well! :)

Hi. I am a single guy who have never had a girlfriend in my life. There were a few girls who have confessed to me, but I was not ready for a relationship during those times. 

Currently, I know that there are a few girls who are interested in me. Now that I feel that I am ready to get into a serious relationship, is it ok for me to date a few girls at the same time? (note: it is just dating to find out more about each other first before becoming officially together with just 1 girl)

-Love Newbie

OP here is an evergreen female 20 year old who is perturbed about the relationships she has with her male friends, most especially the boundaries between platonic and romantic relationships. I used to think that it is very normal to have close platonic relationships with the opposite sex (like hanging out one on one, consistent chatting), and have somehow found myself with a bunch of guy friends I have this kind of relationship with. But I think I have been very naive to think that I can treat all my guy friends the same way as my female friends.
I began questioning myself when I realised I started developing interest in one of them, because other than my feelings for this person, the relationship I have with him and my other guy friends seem to be the same.
The boundary seems to have been so blurred that I now don't know the purpose of maintaining these relationships. Do these guys see me as a friend and that's why put in the effort, or are they using me to keep options open, or ...?

When your boyfriend ignores you because he has exams.... :/ I know he is busy, but ignoring to what extent is acceptable? We do talk on online but sometimes I feel like his heart is not really there. And I feel I am always the one initiating things, like sending letters, packages, suggesting new activities to do, remembering our anniversaries.. (we are in different countries) when he rarely does anything back. He eventually gets mad or upset at me if I got upset that he has been ignoring me. Then it turns out to be my fault and then I blame myself in the end, for causing sadness to us, to myself (and causing stress to him when he has to study). I keep telling myself it's okay, that I am fine with it, but sometimes I just feel so, so lonely. Am I not seeing the things he is doing for me, or is this a doomed relationship? Sometimes I just feel so tired. LDR is like living life in extra hard mode. ._.

 Life is too short to be thinking of what if's and could have been's. We ought to be thinking of what will's and can I's. Don't leave any regrets behind.
Step 1: Why did you let him/her go in the first place? Do you really love him/her? Do you still love him/her?
Step 2: Have you confessed? Have you got a definite answer from him/her? Is he/she important enough to you to not let him/her go now? 
Step 3: If things didn't turn out the way you wanted them to, ask yourself if it's time to give up. Can you look back at yourself in the distant future and say "I did what I could."

I'm about to be a final year undergraduate. To many people in my life, I am just yet another NUS kid. What they don't know is that I am also a male escort. I have kept this part of my life secret to everyone including even my family. 

It started in my first year of university. I was waiting for a friend at a train station when a man in his late thirties approached me with an offer for an interview. I thought it was sleazy at first and didn't think much of it until a week later when I decided to drop in for a visit. There, he told me more about the job and the expectations he had of his escorts. I wasn't exactly attracted to the job but rather, the promise of material wealth (money and luxurious goods — think cars, gadgets, accommodation, etc) that came with it. Having come from a low-income family and from a secondary and JC where most of the kids who were in it were extremely rich, I wanted desperately to be them by any means necessary.

Over the next six months, I was groomed to be a male escort. I was given a new wardrobe and overall, a new look. I went for private etiquette classes where I was taught to be a gentleman. I learned how to behave when I'm with my clients. More than that, I learned to be charming and charismatic, traits I never thought I had, especially with women. The grooming  to be a male escort wasn't easy. Often, I was criticised by my agent if my physical appearances (including my body) wasn't "perfect" by their standards. The criticism took a huge toll on my confidence and self-esteem yet it also built an internal resistance to rejection. Within a year after my training, I had earned enough to pay for my degree and still live comfortably.

My clientele consisted of mostly women between the ages of 35 and 50. A majority of them were married and had kids (some even my age) of their own. Others were single and weren't so lucky in finding a partner. There wasn't always a "fixed agenda" when these women hired me for my company.  

Sometimes, all they want is a company at formal events or dinners. Their husbands and kids had their own lives, and as a result, they felt lonely and neglected. I remembered a client hiring me for three hours simply to have dinner with her. She related to me her husband's infidelity outside of her marriage, how her kids had neglected her, and how her "friends" were just interested in her because of her status in society. I felt pity for her and remembered thinking myself that I hoped her story was never going to be mine. 

Most times though, they hired me for company and sex, something I, at first, felt conflicted with my values but became comfortable with over time. It was through my job as an escort that I explored my sexual side. Since I was young, I've always enjoyed being in control of people for my own gain, and with these women, in bed and out of it, I was often in control of them.

Earlier I mentioned that a majority of my clientele were women. As I got more into the job, I began offering my time to gay men who were in sham marriages with their wives. These were men who were in high positions in their companies and in society. Don't get me wrong. I am straight and I love women. But the gay men paid much more by the hour in comparison. Money was the bottom-line for me. If they had it, I was more than willing to go the other way round. Funny thing though, most of these men weren't so much interested in emotional connection (unlike the women) than they were in the physical.

Outside of my job, I've had a number of sexual partners (girls of my age). These were purely for casual fun. I've been unable to maintain a sustaining relationship due to the nature of my job and have never found a reason for it. Even sex, for me, has become transactional in every sense of the word. The reason why I'm writing in is because recently, I met this girl. She is, in all regards, average in looks, and but rich in wittiness, skin-deep beauty and personality. I asked her out on a date five months ago and things are going great for us. We are still in the stage of getting to know each other, but we both feel we connect well and fancy the other very much.

When we were dating, I was still a male escort. At the beginning, I wasn't sure that we were going to be serious but it did. I have fallen in love with her in every way possible. I love the way she squints her eyes, I love the way she looks so thoughtful when we talk, I love that she works with kids, I love that she steals food from my plate and I love that she would travel two hours to get to my place with soup when I'm sick. Now that we are getting series, I've tendered my notice of resignation to my agent. I haven't had sex with her yet even though I would love to tear her pants off; I'm holding back for two reasons: (1) I want to treat her right because she deserves it and (2) I am afraid that she will not be able to accept my past if I told her.

I've never... been in love before. I'm clueless as an evergreen when it comes to this. I'm excited and scared at the same time... I don't know if... she will love me if she knew. I don't want to start a relationship with her with a lie... but I can't bear the thought of losing her. Is this what love feels like? The uncertainty of it all? Fuck, I'm a mess now. Please don't judge me for my confession, I'm in a pretty vulnerable place now and don't have anyone else I feel comfortable telling this to. Even if I had someone to confide in, I wouldn't be able to due to certain legal liabilities (discretion is everything in this trade).

Approach 1: Just approach a girl you don't know and ask her out for date
Approach 2: Know through friends

Problem with 1: Label as creep
Problem with 2: Maybe no mutual friends

Questions for the ladies: What suggestions for guys to approach girls (stranger)?

You chat me up not because you miss me or our friendship.
You chat me up because of the benefits I bring you, because I cure your loneliness.
You know what? Go to hell.

So I met this guy at a party and we hit it off really well, kept in touch, he asked me out a few times and we met once. We had a 'null period' in between but we met again last month. I still am somewhat interested in him, even though he's in a different country and our conversations have kinda saturated. But I don't know what he thinks about me, and if I'm just a friend he made that he could connect with on a deeper level, especially cos I found out he's been meeting other girls too. Guys, what is this supposed to mean???
-
 
To , don't be discouraged or upset. They don't understand you at all. I'm glad that you had the courage to open up to them and to everyone. Let me ask you, do you feel like something is lifted off your chest? Do you feel free? If yes, that's great. Be true to yourself. 

If these friends don't cherish you, find those that will. Those that accept who you are. That said, let me make a guess. Are you those alpha males that girls go gaga for? Since you are previously from this special altheletic clique with good bods? Cos that is an advantage for finding your other half. Just saying.

-
 
 What if it is only one troll account doing all the trolling? Tsk, bet you didn't see that coming. Funny how some of those who liked  don't know one of their friends is in fact the troll.

This is fun to watch. People behave weirdly when anonymous.

I think I am in love with my neighbour. Everytime I happen to meet her outside the house she gives me a wink and a sweet smile. But I am a shy guy so I am nt sure how to react.

She quite pretty and hot too. Should I intro myself the next time I meet her? I think I MAY have a chance with her.

Ps: She has a husband.

What's wrong with a younger guy dating an older girl? Seems like its not really accepted yet? =/

What to do when someone loved you and you didn't realise how much you love them back until they got tired and didn't love you anymore. And now you're left with all the what if's and could have been's and it all sucks cos you only realised that he/she was the one you wanted to spend your entire life with after he/she lost interest and decided to leave:( And then you worry that you'll never meet anyone else that makes you feel the same way again:(

Reply to 
Hey, don't feel too down! There are more of us than you think. If you'd like to hang out or something, no strings attached, perhaps you could write back in? I actually don't really see a good way to exchange contact details without at least one of us no longer being anonymous.
-
 
I used to be part of a super popular and attractive group of sportsmen in NUS. But the day I accidentally confessed to my buddy that I am interested in guys and not girls, I was ostracised like a leper by everyone. And I thought these guys will be cool about it. Deep down, they are just homophobic and ignorant of what people like us have to go through everyday. Makes me regret telling anyone, sending me forever into the closet. Hell, I feel like quitting school now. :'(

Is a year long to recover from a rejection? I randomly cry because of her. Sometimes I wish I could just ask for help, but when people's ties are too closed together, how to?

I am currently Single. And I like 2 girls.. But how do I confess to one, and reject the other without hurting her? =/

There's someone of the opposite gender who has been pretty good to me and I feel really comfortable speaking with and spending time with him. Given that I don't usually open up to guys, this feeling is new to me. Don't get me wrong, he was given the cold treatment as well inititally but he did put in the extra effort to get to know me better whereas other guys haven't bothered to. People around us has been telling me that he seems to be having a crush on me. But he is currently attached and I'm not interested in being a 3rd party anyway, no matter how much I feel attached to him (not so much attraction but emotional attachment). But is there really no way for us to be close friends yet not be in a romantic relationship? I don't know how he thinks about me, but I just really hope this current comfortable state we're in right now carries on without other complications. Guys, it'll be great to hear your POV on this. 
P.S: My other friends have been telling me to stop associating with him for fear that I get hurt because he seems like a player (to them) but whether or not he really is one, shouldn't matter since I'm just looking at friendship between us right? Or is my thinking too naive? 
-
 
Sometimes i just dont understand the girl's mindset. Its like we've been going out for about a year now. But i didnt make it official with her because i didnt know where i stand in her eyes. Was i someone she wanted more than just being friends? Or was i just like a brother to her?

Then somewhere around the middle of last year, she got confessed to by one of her module classmates, which she has known for less than 3 weeks!! She accepted his confession and her status went from single to attached, just like that. But she still hangs out with me. We'd still go out on movies, bowling, late night dinners in town etc etc. 

She even lies to her bf several times saying she's with her girl friends despite the fact that she was alone on a date with me. She complains about him a lot and i'm just like an ear for her. I just dont get it. If you didnt like him in the first place, why accept his confession? What am i to you? You even agreed to be my prom date when we graduated last year. Tell me please. What am i to you??!!
-
 
Hi, I am so vexed with my boyfriend. Thanks to his work, we no longer get to spend quality time together. Even when we have arranged to meet up, he will say he needs to rest and asked if we can meet later. Accumulatively, I started feeling neglected and disengaged. At times
-
 
first sem was great, second sem a little disappointed with my first A-, but at least theres now room for mistake. this sem i got a whole string of A-s but i hardly feel stressed out about results day anymore.

i hope i dont sound like a hypocrite, but i wanna remind all them muggers out there please recognise that your cap is nothing but a line on your resume, theres so many other things you could do to make yourself more employable if thats what you are after.

schools great fun if you do what you like. hall activities, ccas, suppers, list goes on. you may just laugh at yourself after graduation cuz you sacrificed so much for that silly line in your resume.
-
 
Each time I fell for a girl, I realise that she is already attached. Am I really that unlucky? I guess it is about time for me to look for singles.
-
 
 Don't worry about those mean people and their mean comments. They're probably just jealous us gay boys can give way better head than their girlfriends. 

Also, I don't know if you like Neil Patrick Harris too, but here's another meme that hopefully will cheer you up too! <3 

P.S I was just trying to cheer OP up with that giving head joke, so please don't flame me for misogyny; I actually think that both guys and girls can give equally good head though I'll never find out if that's true.

Evergreen girl here, and I never thought I'd find that one person I'd click with but I think I've found him. Wonder if he feels the same.

P.S.:  I feel ya :/

 This is why I don't usually have friends approaching me, but when they do, they ask whether I can write an app for them. No I can't and I won't even if I can.

How do you talk to a guy without sounding overly excited and like you like him A LOT but actually you do! I just dont wanna come across as suffocating and desperate but i rllyrllyrllyrlly like you~
-
 
I am a guy who only have few friends, even after I graduated from NUS. I am also a shy person who don't talk much with new people or strangers. Could anyone suggest me how to make a lot of friends?

Idea for those confessing to a girl in NUS. Make something just like this https://soundcloud.com/taketwosg/u-town-girl-uptown-girl #mucheffort #muchNUS

I'm financially sound by myself without my parents' support, I feel like I have everything I want and am peaceful with myself. How then, can I find motivation to wake up each day without any more goals? When I feel like I achieved everything I ever wanted? I'm just feeling so sick of life. I wonder if there are people out there who feel the same.
-
 
I'm quite confused: if you think you are just a normal guy with below-average looks and can't seem to get girls, why not do something about it? Like go to the gym? Or study harder/read more and be smart?

A message to my friend, assuming she reads this:

You're my best friend ever since JC. Then a sweet guy from JC confessed to you. Hence, you started dating and even the JC teachers know of your BGR as you were always seen together. However, recently you broke up with him. Why? Your reason: because you're studying in NUS and he's studying at SIM.

You told me whenever you go out with your NUS social cliche, you always feel embarrassed to share that your boyfriend is from SIM. And you even complained that you felt pressurized b'cos you don't feel proud introducing your boyfriend to our other NUS friends. As I am a friend of your boyfriend too, I feel this is a really very sad and unfair treatment to him :(

Firstly, you're wrong to think like that. If you choose your stead so as to make you feel proud in your social cliche, that's just sooo shallow. Yes, NUS students may be better students as we need a relatively good grade to make the cut, but is academic ability how you judge another person's worth in life???

That boy worked his ass off in JC, but he is really not academically inclined because he is more suitable for the arts. That's what touched your heart in the first place right? That 12 inch card he drew for you I remember. You guys were still dating when he's in NS, but when he enrolled in SIM, you've changed. 

You are born with good looks, and I know guys tend to flock around you like flies, and now in NUS, there are bigger and juicier flies, but have you forgot the small fly who bought you coffee every morning, help you out with your house chores, brought your younger siblings out for meals? 

I really want to tell him how much I love him, but I am not as good looking or as good with words than you and I know that his heart still lies with you. Hence, I fear rejection :X

Thanks for reading my rant.

My final words for you my bestie: The other options always seem more attractive when they are not chosen, but sometimes, the best option is the one you've already chose.

-
 
There is this guy I really like, but I am so shy, I keep cockblocking any possible advances from myself to avoid awkwardness between us. I even offered to introduce him to other girls to show a facade that I'm not interested in him :( 

I want to ask for help, but I also think I'm hopeless in this field, so nevermind...

(time for ppl to say they are waiting for a 'OP is a guy' plot twist again, yea, do what you always do)
-
 
I don't like the phrase "she wants the D". I'll acknowledge that sexual attraction works both ways, but I think that the phrase is used even when a girl isn't showing obvious interest in a guy. It comes out of nowhere sometimes, and it feels more like the guy is reflecting his own interest onto the girl. Aside from that, it's often said with an aggressive feel which I can't properly express. Also, most societies still accept male dominance in many social, economic and political respects. For it to be reasserted in a sexual domain, in a way which suggests yet again that men are needed for the happiness of women, is off-putting to me. Guys, you may disagree, but ask a girl about how she instinctually feels about this phrase. It might broaden your perspective.
-
 
Are there really many girls in NUS experience sex before?
- a curious virgin guy 
-
 
Has anyone of you ever felt like you lost yourself growing up or like you start to feel that you are unable to express who you really are and also no longer able to smile or laugh from the bottom of your heart because you just dont feel the same anymore about people around you?

i know people come and go and in the end i feel lonely despite being involved in school activities and having loads of friends. I feel jealous of people on the train where they joke, laugh and tease with their friends. I guess deep down in my heart I've always wished i could have friends that stuck around, friends that i mattered to. Somehow it always feels that im the one having such feelings. And please if you are going to give harsh comments just save it. I know how harsh reality is already.

I am a female with a very high sex drive. I "self service" almost daily. I may have a mild addiction to porn too. This is really not a troll. Sometimes i feel like i need to stop. Managed to quit smoking but didnt manage to quit this.

Guess there's no luck finding that special someone all these 4 years of school. I've never been in a relationship, but I'd like to give it a try even if it takes time to develop. But if any girl likes to chat up and get to know each other better, feel free to drop a comment and we'll chat up via pm :) 
-
 
Feeling so vexed now. I'm in a LDR and I intend to see it through with my other half. But recently, I'm beginning to feel attracted to this guy I've been chatting with. I still see him just as a friend though.

Don't get me wrong-I still love my SO and I have no intentions of cheating at all. I suspect that this attraction may be because I haven't been receiving a lot of attention from him as compared to my guy friend. We haven't seen each other in 6 months (we've only skyped once or twice? Ironically, he's less responsive after exams.)  It just feels nice to have someone there you know? 

And I don't think that this friend is trying to seduce me in any way (at least I hope so). Even though he's cute, I suspect he's the bad boy type and totally not worth cheating with imo. I really need to get this off my chest since none of my friends can empathise nor withhold their judgements.
-
 
I fell in love with a girl and when I confessed to her she told me she was a smoker. I was completely heartbroken. She told me she was intending to quit smoking but I just can't accept a smoker as my girlfriend.

If women can have a million rules on how their guy should be I don't think there is anything wrong in me not wanting a gf who is/was a smoker.
I decided to move away from her even though I still care so much about her. She might think that moving away is a easy decision but she doesn't know how torn my heart is.

I maybe ignoring you but I still love you so much.

i am fat and i know it, i wish people (especially my loved ones) would stop telling me that because it hurts. i am trying to change, but change takes time.

a week ago my ex boyfriend was apologizing for wanting more in the r/s than I am willing to give and I told him I dont blame him. And now he dump me and went back to his other controlling ex who is willing to give him more. He often told me its been so long since anyone been so nice to him and hugs me a lot. But now...it all seems surreal and 他算什么男人... My friends asked me what will I do if he looks for me again in the future. I don't know if I want to be friends with him again in the future..
-
 
With all the fwb posts going around, it makes me wonder how many male/female students in each faculty or nus in general has such r/s. How common is it really? Does someone have a good gauge?
-
 
I really fail as a human being~

I see so many couples without any common interest still can along and got topic to talk about.

I see so many friends gather to catch up to 1 another still got topic to talk about.

But my head is always empty...
-
 
Recently a girl confessed to me. The thing is, she is my fwb. I got caught off guard as it was really unexpected. I enjoy sex with her alot, but is unsure whether moving on to a proper relationship will work out. 

In the meantime, I am keeping my other fwbs close as I have a high sex drive. And probably just go ahead with the relationship since I really enjoy the sex.
-
 
I don't presume to be THE EXPERT when it comes to relationships, but hopefully getting married while still being a student gives me some credibility. (No, not shotgun, sorry to disappoint haha)

1. People change. Don't expect that the person you date will be the same person after being together for a few months/years. With that perspective, how much does if the person is/isn't "perfect"?

2. But you cannot decide how they will change. NEVER get into a relationship thinking "he/she will become better", because you are setting yourself up for disappointment. 

3. When people say "We are too similar", they are just using that as an excuse for giving up. It's good to be similar. You can genuinely share your interests! 

4. When people say "We are too different", they are just using that as an excuse for giving up. It's good to be different. You can complement each other! 

5. What matters is that you decide & commit to staying together.

 Hi there.

I think if you're socially awkward, chances you won't like what the camps will do and may not enjoy it. For me, my level of enjoyment at something is very evident if one were to look at my face, and oftentimes things like this leave with with a "black face". So I feel that you shouldn't feel obliged to go for one, it can backfire, and I have a couple of friends who went and it backfired.

That being said, I would recommend you to do your own orientation. Depending on the faculty, try to walk around the place to get yourself used to moving around. Places that you would definitely visit for example the Central Library and Utown are additional places to go. This saves you from being 'lost' when school kicks in. 

You may also wish to reveal your faculty and the major, so the people from that faculty can help you better. 

You may like to consider if you feel comfortable going for classes and tutorials alone. I know of some who join camps so they don't feel alone when lessons start. Maybe that can help you decide if you would like to go for a camp.

I'm not sure about the club part though, you might contact them and ask them about it.

Feel free to reply to this if you have any other concerns, questions

My current boyfriend's ex still has them as her profile picture. Is it something I should be worried about? Should I talk to him? 
-
 
I am a guy who is screwed up in every aspect of my life. It looks like I can forget about finding my significant other.
-
 
I am a virgin and I want to keep it that way because I don't want my future husband to have to ever deal with any thoughts of me having sex with anyone else before or after him. It's my way of loving my special someone :)

To M.H. from chem engine...your friend is right. It is you. 
But then again, I'm insignificant among your big group of friends that you have. Those days were over.

 Want a pure girl? Can, no problem, just distill them till you find a pure girl in your population. :)

Seriously, any Scala lovers here?

I think beauty is not as good as youth.
A 18 years old is more attractive than a beautiful 28 years old.

I have a cap of 3.75 and although I suppose there are people out there that wish they had 3.75 or are content with such a grade, I feel really shitty about it... Especially because people around seem to be doing well. Saying they did okay when they have a cap of 4.0 and above.

Sigh.

I tried so hard, and got so far.
In the end, it doesn't even matter.

My friend-with-benefits is now my boyfriend. At first I was pretty sure that what I felt was purely physical, but unexpectedly, I fell for him, and I'm glad he felt the same. 
-
 
So i've officially graduated, and the biggest relief in my life is not having to see my crush in school/anywhere ever again. Love hurts, they say, but secret love feels ten times worse :)

One moment you felt sad about the break up. The next moment you say you met the guy you have always been praying for. I don't understand girls. Truth is, we will only know someone after years. You are too impulsive.

Was it a bad idea to use all 3 of my s/u options by the end of year 1? ):

I dated a guy who had an Oedipus complex. As if that wasn't enough he also had daddy issues, didn't feel loved, didn't get enough attention as a child, blah blah blah the whole whiny needy package. Needless to say I regretted it. On the outside he looked like any other uni guy but in actual fact he was emotionally AND intellectually stunted. The whole time it felt like he was looking for a mother-replacement. And his favourite hobby was putting the blame on his exes. For a supposedly mature uni guy he was very small and very bitter inside. Like a little boy who got hit by a soccer ball once and continued to hold a grudge for years. This kind of thing distribute blame no point? But in his own eyes he was always the perfect blameless boyfriend. Like seriously it's not a competition, you know. *rolls eyes* He always had to have the last word so he could feel like a man but at the same time he wanted to be sayang-ed. Seriously buay tahan. Boy ah, how old already still want to act like a lil biatch?

Despite breaking up with my girlfriend some 15 months ago, i still miss her a lot. in about a week's time, it would be my birthday and i wonder if she still remembers it...

To  IM not a girl, but I think confidence issues can be solved when you start to not think about what people think about you and what you can't change.

You can't change it anyway, might as well be happy with it. Most of the time, strangers won't care and friends won't mind, it is you that puts unnecessary pressure on yourself. 

Took me some time to master this skill, but after that you can be quite invincible and confident in whatever

Feeling vengeful against someone whom i have spent part of my life with. 

Yes, i did say hurtful things about her - to her, her friends and my friends. This is because i am hurt too.

I know she has done the same as well. 

It is okay. I will forgive her because I have done her wrong too. 

Feeling betrayed, anxious and emotional.

I am going to be a first year student this year and can I just say I'm super excited about school. I'm the typical(?) evergreen dude and gets nervous around ladies easily and I'm planning to stay in hall. Any advice for this newbie freshie dude here! I'm not handsome like leeminho so looks ain't gonna cut for me.

Do you find it frustrating when you go out with your boyfriend during weekend, he will take out his phone to play his game? This is especially so when waiting for food or taking public transports? Not that I'm demanding for 100% attention all the time but we don't spend much time during weekdays. We do sms or FB message but the conversation is minimal since he spend most of his time at work and while going home, he will either be sleeping or playing his game. When he is home, he will playing his game again. I bet he doesn't even know what is happening to me if I don't tell him myself instead of him asking. Therefore, during weekend, it gets a little frustrating and disappointing when I'm out with him and yet he cannot not look at this phone to play that game. I'm sure I don't look at my phone that often :/ So if you were me, what will you do? Tell him how I feel regarding this issue?

Recently there have been many posts about virginity and morality. My 2 cents worth: I have no qualms about a potential gf having had sex before with her exes. However, it deeply disturbs me when the girl has had casual encounters, especially multiple ones.  This year I only dated 2 girls and both have had multiple casual encounters before.  One of them has had sex with more than 20 guys and I found it gross and ended it. To the guys are girls who completely separate sex from love, would you be comfortable dating such a guy/girl? And guess what, she doesn't even remember all of them. I'm still looking for that 'purer' special girl.

I don't want to ask my friends their cap. No one in my family asked me as well. Sometimes I feel so lonely. This is just a message to myself saying that I am proud of myself and one day, I will have the life I want.

Top 5 rejection lines by females and (what they mean):

1. You are like a brother to me. (As my "brother", that means you must do everything for me and not be in a relationship with me, fool.) 

2. Let's just be friends. (I'll expect to end our friendship immediately since I don't want to give you any false hope)

3. I've got a boyfriend (Duh, he's sooo much more handsome and richer than you.)

4. I've got more important things right now. (Yep, I'll be painting my nails soon)

5. *ignores* (I am waiting for you to send me a long message about how you like me, which I'll read and then delete it with a sense of satisfaction, knowing that I am in demand in the market.)

Top 5 rejection lines by males and (what they mean):

1. You are like a sister to me. (You're quite ugly.)

2. Let's just be friends. (Yep, friends with benefits.)

3. I've got a girlfriend. (She will make me feel more proud among the other guys.)

4. I've got more important things right now. (Nose mining [see picture below])

5. *ignores* (You're damn ugly)

Tonight wasnt supposed to be a date , it was just a casual meetup of me giving you the food i got for you from taiwan and you, now being a career advisor, giving me advice on my job hunt. I dolled myself up and hope that you would notice but apparently you didnt. I hinted to you that i gave you specially more stuff, that you're special to me. Part of me didnt want to accept that we are only friends and can no longer progress from that, while a part of me really wanted to confess to you that i still really like you. Thus i agreed to being your partner to do a graduation photoshoot with you. Im beginning to suspect that you are only treating me as a friend even though you asked me to be your partner. i feel so confused. I dont know to confess or not. Or to just forget you which i foresee would require me to give up on our friendship. I really dont want to give up on us.

I haven't met a single (pun intended) super pretty girl that loves coding yet.. :(

I've noticed that every time I tell my friends about my new significant other, I end up single again within 2-3 months afterwards. I think from now on I'm going to keep my relationship status secret as far as possible..

What do you do when you get downgraded by a best friend? How do you cope?

it's the end of the 2nd year in engin, and i actually managed to maintain a perfect CAP. people think i'm like some god, but i'm actually very afraid of messing up my perfect CAP in the future. any advice for the next 2 years? do you guys know about others with perfect CAP upon graduation?

I wonder if I am alone with this feeling:

I stay on campus during semester time to be freeof restrictions, to have my own private place.

Now that it's the holidays, I'm at home, feeling very mentally and emotionally restricted by the presence of my family.

I look forward to my next stay on campus, where there are no strings on me, but somehow there is also this guilt of not running away from responsibilities, of not being there at home.

Somehow I feel a wee bit like Ultron. Evil :/

So I've read comments where people #NUSingles, and I was wondering, is there actually a way for singles in NUS to interact?

I feel deep emotional pain. For the past 6 years, I have been friends with a guy whom we take the same modules together and eat lunch together weekly . I see him as a best friend. Recently, he made a new friend, a girl, whom he described as his best friend ever. This suggests that he has never seen me as a best friend, maybe colleague or causual friend. I feel abandoned and rejected. He has also been starting to distance himself emotionally from me. When I tried to text him to chat, he will say he feel weird to chat online with me and going to sleep while he will still be online for the next few hours. Yet, with the new friend, he will be chatting with her everyday, sharing all the details of his life. I still have to eat lunch with him weekly and keep up with the false pretences and this is giving me emotionally pain and emotionally drained. I want to confront him and discuss with him but given his personality, I am quite sure he will say I am too sensitive and brush the issue away. Also, I am afraid that after the discussion, our relationship will further sour. Given that we are in the same line of work, this is a unwise thing to do. I don't know what to do now. How do I let go and move on with my life, when I feel so emotionally attached to this person?

sorry for long post ahead. on the topic of pre marital sex, i think the idea of girls having to hold their virginity for the one they think is the special one is very cute and highly advisable. it doesn't do to give it up to the first guy that you meet and have feelings for because you deserve to respect yourself and hold it. however, having the mindset that pms is bad and downright deplorable is not good either. because when you're with someone and you feel that physical attraction (usually happens early in the relationship), you'll want to be closer to them, know more about them. and if sex is something you both agree on doing or not doing, it's by choice. and not because pms is "dirty". sex is not dirty. in fact studies have shown that having sex helps to bond a couple due to hormones and stuff. that's why it's good to hold on until you've met someone you think is really special and is willing to commit long term.

but of course there will always be guys who are just in it for the sexual gratification because they're immature and still needy and desperate. those are the kind of guys you might want to avoid. like those confessions about players and cheating. it's ... not responsible behaviour.
I'm not saying that only guys are like that either. but somehow there is this stigma that guys would want to be their gf's first. but their gf doesn't have to be their first. it's a strange double standard which is changing, but still rather prevalent.

tl;dr: at the end of the day, it ought to be of your own choice, made responsibly and while sober. no one can or should make it for you. society doesn't have to know about private choices.

Alot of posts here lately about the woes of guys and the difficulties we face getting girls due to various factors (physical or otherwise).
Guys let me tell you not to worry. Why?
Because time/age is on our (male's) side. You seldom see society questioning why a guy at let's say 35 years of age is still single, compared to a female of similar age who would likely be labelled as a spinster etc. 
I tell you; yes now at this age range of 20+ when it's the prime for girls they'll have all their high and mighty expectations for their male partner. When they start to near 30, I ASSURE you they'll start lowering it alot because they realize that all their preset expectations over the years came back to bite them in the ass because they were unable to get their unrealistic 'perfect' guy. And when age catches up with them they'll begin to eat humble pie in desperation of just wanting to get a life partner before 30 or 35. 

Then there...there is when those girls that used to reject us will start crawling back to us after realizing their follies. 
So guy, don't sweat it. Time is on our side so just sit back, relax and wait for them to come running to you eventually. Remember, girls are always the ones who lose out with age. 
It's laughable how they even dare to have such expectations when they're on the shorter end of the stick. What a joke.

When I entered NUS after my NS, I decided to make a big change in my life. I no longer wanted to live an aimless life mired in mediocrity and just getting by. I wanted to be the best after living my past few years as your stereotypical loser.

Looking at the hugely talented people around me and the world, I kept thinking I was short on time. You have smart people 3 to 4 years younger owning the crap out of you and I realised I had to catch up. It wasn't easy.

Now two years on, I wonder all of this have been worth it. I sacrificed a great deal of my social life, holiday time, sleep time - just for a little more time to be able to punch above my own weight. Academics and job experience wise - I am doing fine. However, is "fine" enough? Doing "fine" seems like a Pyrrhic victory, tryharding, only to be left for a fool in the end.

I take all defeats personally. Defeat plants a seed of doubt and makes you question your abilities. It creates a sense of burning rage that you just want to unleash on yourself.

We only have a few decades to make a difference before we are six foot under. I fear that I might just be a normal person, destined to be filler, destined to be just something in the background. If that is the case, I am having serious doubts about chasing a lost cause, that I am trying to turn an ordinary stone into a diamond by mindlessly and repeatedly hammering it. 

Some things just cannot be fixed..

Let me share my story. I did badly in my Year 1 Sem 2, which made my CAP suffer a lot. It almost fell below 3.5 I think. But I didn't give up. I knew I could do better than this. Guess what, I managed to pull it back to 4.18 this sem. I didn't expect such a good result this sem, but there is one thing I am pretty sure of - I have put in my best effort and I have pushed myself beyond the limit. So if you did badly, just don't give up. Keep the faith, work hard and most importantly, persevere.

I am wondering if there is anything wrong with NUSWhispers because I submitted twice and two times they were both not posted (I know because I sent before the results coming in but now all the exams posts are in, meaning mine is ignored) 

This makes me more sad now. :'( 
And when it gets blocked, admin, can you just give a reason? Like post starting with "..." got blocked because of xxx reason. Just the heading, so that at least the person knows why.... 

And I really wanna know why because mine are all so innocent and harmless D:
-
 
I have a question I really wanted to hear someone's opinions on so here I am on NUSWhispers.

Just like (almost) any girl, I do think it will be nice to get into a relationship, but I don't believe in actively seeking one. I guess for me I have always thought that my future boyfriend will have first been my friend and someone that I will naturally grow closer to.

Perhaps because of that, I think I get scared off by guys who are interested in me. I'm a pretty average girl so I am just basing this on the few cases I have experienced so far. When a guy, who I don't consider myself close enough to, starts dropping hints or confesses to me, I feel like it puts stress on the friendship/relationship and that makes me feel like distancing myself. The way I think about it is, if I am not interested in him, I shouldn't continue to meet him or talk to him so regularly. But every time this leads to the friendship just dying off. 

The contradiction lies in the fact that if I don't give myself the chance to get to know the guy better, I wouldn't start to like him either. And it seems stupid of me therefore to behave the way I do each time. Just wanted to hear what you guys think about this and thanks for even reading this to the end haha!

Just a random thought. Have anyone (male and female) ever thought about what to say to someone who confesses to you (but you aren't interested in them)? (it may not have occurred, but just treat it as a hypothetical question). It helped me get over me being rejected. Cause it feels like we think about how to be closer/how to confess only.
-
 
Unpopular opinion coming through!
Reading some of the confessions claiming that they are moral for not having premarital sex is really getting me on my nerves.
Is virginity a priority in a romantic relationship? I believe sex and romance CAN be separated.
As a single male, I can have a one night stand with a lady without romantic attachment, while we both satisfy our sexual desires.
Likewise, I can have a romantic relationship with a girl without wanting to get into her pants.
That said, having a sexual and romantic relationship with your SO is probably the best thing ever.
Only when people realise this, we will have less "players" who make use of romance to get sex, or "victims" who use sex to sustain a romantic relationship.
Does anyone actually agree with me?
-
 
Even though so much social media content tell us that we don't need to be skinny to be beautiful, I'm still conscious of my own body (I'm quite skinny with wide hips and big butt). I'm envious of curvier girls who are so confident. How do you girls do that? How do you get that confidence?
-
 
It looks like it is a lot harder for a guy to look for a girlfriend compared to a girl looking for a boyfriend. For a girl, as long as she is good looking, lots of guys will still get attracted to her even if she just sits there quietly. From my experience and observations, this is hardly the case for guys. Guys has always to be the one that is proactive.

Hi guys it's troll knight again!! 

Recently I have noticed a lot of posts regarding " confessing to a girl". At one point of my life, I'm also a clueless chap, often conducting kamikaze strike on my eye candies and scared them all away. The problem is..it's really difficult for a evergreen guy to know when is the right time to confess to the girl.

Let me share with you some advice so that you can successfully get your dream girl. 

If you are facing the following problems, chances are the girl isn't interested. It is better to give up and find a new girl.

1) The girl take damn long to reply to your message most of the time, and her replies are one word.

If the girl is really interested in you, she will reply in just 5 seconds. And her replies will be long sentences and full of emoji.

2) If your text conversation with a girl cannot last throughout the day and till late night.
3) If you and the girl are not chatting over the phone every single night.

When 2 person like each other their topic will be endless and they can really talk forever. 

4) If you flirt with her and she is not comfortable with it.

When a girl like you, she will be really happy when you sugar coat her with sweet talks. She might flirt back too.

5) If you stop texting the girl and she won't take the initiative to start a conversation with you.

6) If you drop hints and the girl starts to distance herself from you.

To  please don't sterotype how fat a girl is by assuming their weight in the first place or even say a girl is fat, use words like big size instead. If she knew that you commented her this way she would've been upset. In addition weight would be affected by height. If a girl is 1.4m with 74kg her bmi would be in an unhealthy range if she is not muscular, and if she is 1.8m with 74kg then she is of a normal weight range. Please dont go around asking girls their weight, and just giving an example I'm a girl myself with a body weight around yours (fluctuates between 70 to 76kg) and my bmi is in 120% range. However when girls and guys guessed my weight their guess is usually 60+kg. So weight is really not a good indicator.

Because one of my (used-to-be) close friends introduced me to the awesomeness of drinking tea, I think of him whenever I drink tea. (He used to make me tea in his small but comfy room.) And that's terrible because I miss him so much. 

I just wish he had performed well for our common module, like I had (I guess), because that was how we met. But also how we parted. 

Just where in the world are you right now, and are you happy? Please be because, someone, somewhere far away, still miss you A LOT. 
-
 
SH: It's stupid, talking to you over NUSWhispers, and I don't even know if you read it. But well, apparently there is no other way to reach you. 

I am not sure if you are doing well, probably busy with internship. I am not sure if you are still the same you. After we cut our ties I still think about you so often, and I have no way of knowing if you feel the same. (It's most probably wishful thinking though.) But omg, can you imagine my shock when I see you on Tinder? And that shock grew after I've read the description. I am not sure how you are doing with your girlfriend but, from what I see you guys are still together. So... what's wrong?

I don't know, as much as I miss you, and wish (so much) to just see you again, I want you to be happy. On the other hand, I will be pretty damn jealous to see you happy without me. Because I am not entirely happy. At least for now, you still own a special space in my heart and holy crap I miss you like hell. Those words you said, those things you did, and just thinking of Malaysia... those memories, I can't get rid of them. They haunt me. 

I am not sure what is the purpose of this confession. I guess I just wanna say, the way we broke our connection, it's pretty damn stupid and childish, don't you think? So... if you still need to talk to me, just talking, please contact me. I will even apologise first because I know I did wrong too. Okay, fact: you are a very important person in my life and I don't want to lose you. But if you don't contact me, then... I would just like to wish you all the best for result release tomorrow. I hope we can both perform well for our common module, since we put so much hard work into it, and that's how we met and how we parted.

And I guess I will need a much, much, much longer time, to get over you, and feel fine again.

How does a guy who enjoys chatting and hanging out with a girl he's perfectly comfortable with, continue to do so without sending mixed signals?

I went from an evergreen to a serial cheater. Best part is all 4 girls do not know I am cheating on all of them. Once I have had my fun I plan to come up with a stupid reason to force all of them to breakup with me.

If you want to know how I did it, I would say just make sure the girls are from different faculties ;)

Response to  Like this posts for guys who suffer the same predicament when masturbating. Where got so easy to masturbate four times a day. 

If you live at home, the best place to do it would be the toilet. However, you are careful about spending too long on it, in case your Mum gets suspicious about it.

If you live in hall or something. You can either do it in the room or in the toilet. The room is great for privacy, but the thought of remains in your room is a headache. If you are doing it in the shower cubicle, you have to do it discreetly too.

I'm a evergreen guy that has gotten into a relationship recently. I was expecting a fairy tale happiness, but my spirit seem to be falling apart pieces by pieces, day by day. Being a easy going guy, I allow my girlfriend to dictate my life and follow her orders. I love the sense of control she imposed on me when she prevents me from spending cash on my favorite manga. However I still have some doubts when I compared myself with other couples.

Is it normal for your girlfriend to throw her used sanitary pad at you?

Is it normal for girls to slap a guy's face when she is irritated by his boyfriend?

I can't deny that her actions have hurt my pride deeply, but I still pray that she can be changed. Love is all about forgiving and accepting who she is, isn't it?
-
 
i was not tactful and provoked you during your reading and examination week. truth is, i love you very much but i lost control of my emotions. nevertheless, i am praying that you did well and i hope that you are happy with your results.

i am genuinely sorry for causing you so much hurt. i hope time can heal our wounds. I still want to be your best friend in life. 
-
 
There's this guy whom I just knew and start text flirting with me. After some time, he stopped doing that and seems to be more distance. Now he is like hardly contacting me and when we meet up, he is basically acting like a jerk. :( How should I proceed further? 
-
 
My best friend's boyfriend is horrible but I know I'm in no position to tell her that. She seems so oblivious to it when it's so obvious to everyone else. We are just waiting for the relationship to end because she deserves so much better. Eurgh! Love is indeed blind. 
-
 
@  I don't understand what has 'experience' got to play in the part of being a boyfriend. If you are assuming that their experience will somehow make them better 'boyfriend material', from what I've seen from my friends, it has very little to do with it if any. 
For those who've lost their relationships, why assume that there's something *wrong with them* for their partner to end things? It could be that there's something wrong with their partner instead, no? Also since it's a 2 way street it could just be that their lifestyle/future expectations etc clashed?
-
 
I have this thing for attached girls too. It's like there's a challenge. Attached girls seem more valuable to me as there must be a reason someone wants them. I like to go for attached girls and when they inevitably break up, I leave them. They need to learn the hard way not to cheat on their boyfriends. There's nothing wrong being bad to bad people. 
-
 
I confess that I'm a psychopath. I enjoy seeing the pain of others. When someone fails their exams, I feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside. I can easily fake my sympathy and do it really well. There's nothing wrong in being a psychopath, as long as you don't hurt anyone. With so much misery in the world, being a sadist and psychopath is the key to happiness.

Hi everyone! I am a single guy looking for a gf. I hit the gym 3 times a week and enjoy drinking on weekends. I've also been told that I'm handsome quite often by friends and strangers alike if that matters anyway. Girls, if you're interested, just like or comment on this confession and I'll add you on fb;)

So this summer, I am interning in an international company (not in Singapore). I am the only Singaporean here. All the full-time staff, part-time, interns are from all over the world, but predominantly from Europe and the States. After went for several lunch and dinner with the interns group, I realized that the topic that we always discuss is about relationship. They discuss a lot of stuff about sex, girls problems (related to sex), one-night stand that they have. Oh and I am the only guy intern in that group. I am not sure whether it is just a culture, topics that are discussed by adults, or they just don't care/realize that there is a guy listening to their conversation. Honestly, I am not really comfortable hearing those things. In fact, I have never talked about that stuff with my friends (probably because I have never done it before also). I thought it is normal not to have one-night stand or quickie with your partner before you are married. However, after listening to the interns convo and reading all the post in NUSWhisper, now I am confused. Am I the only one who still have this belief of not having pre-marital sex? Or am I just not mature enough?

To  I'm a girl previously from an engineering diploma to an irrelevant uni course.

I hang out over a period with a 4 guys clique, 3 girls clique and mixed. But in general what i experienced in my class and other class, whether lean to big-size, they are all conscious about their body image, which is a positive thing.

There are sweet-talkers, party-goers, slackers and hardworking people like every faculty would so cant really generalize. But the strangest thing i have experienced is that guys will sugar-coat their words to ask me to help them with their lab report.

In general, the timetable i had back then was 8am to 6pm on weekdays and 9am to 2pm on saturday with 1 hour lunch break everyday. So with such busy timetable if the guy have a relationship, i see that he genreally would be pretty devoted for such a rigurous routine to even cheat.

But girls wise, might be different. I have seen a girl who actually depend on his bf to do all the report for her and she didnt even have to lift her finger literally. There are heavy party-goers who enjoys getting high. There are hardworking ones too.

I see the same people getting attached and breaking up but I haven't even had my first relationship :/

Just got my results, was a relief to find out I can do honours, because I got CAP =x. Found it funny that my CAP went from 3.0 to x then x then 3.0 then x again, although the semester CAP are all different. Also, I think I'm the only one who has NEVER gotten a single A(+/-) in all three years in uni?

I don't want to, but I naturally got romantically involved with four different girls throughout university. I don't want to come across as being a player, but each of them are all very important to me in different ways. Most of them are on and off, and sometimes it could be two at a time. But because I have never confirmed my relationship with any of them before, I didn't cross the boundary in all the cases. Furthest I went was hold hands with all only.  Anyone face similar problems in choosing between girls who are important to you in different ways?

I got a B- for my Honours Year Project when my supervisor continously told me throughout the year that I was doing/did very well for it and I should not worry whenever I ask for advice or help. I feel so bitter and cheated. And yes he was one of the examiners. #fml

I spent the past months getting over someone who doesn't feel the same way, and I thought I successfully did, until I realised my head still turns at the mention of her name, and I still click on everything she "likes" on Facebook without thinking. I don't know if it's out of habit, but looks like this will take a long while yet.

we always have that one friend...

How many times in a day is it considered normal for a guy to masturbate? My friend told a group of us that he did it four times in a day and everyone was very shocked and started laughing but I have no basis of reference ):

Does all girls like buff boys? Cos there is a majority of guys in sch that always hit the gym so often to buff up. But I'm not those kind cos I don't really like gymming.  So is there still a chance that girls will fancy me?

Hihi  I know who you are talking about! That one that laughs a lot at the deck!

But seeing that you received more music (shame on you people -_-") than actual advice... Let me help you! If you are talking about the person I think you're talking about then lucky you I'm her friend. Our favourite chat topic is relationships I have an idea of what she thinks. 

She doesn't need you to defend her from fat shamers, she has more experience in that area. She doesn't bother about appearances, even if you are short and stout or tall and scrawny, if you are kind and down to earth, you can win her heart. If you are brilliant, you can win her mind. I hope you don't just like her because she is your "type". She is more than what's on the outside.  

You can protect her heart without saying any defensive words if you are willing to stay by her like a loyal faithful friend. Maybe you can try and we will get her to give you chance. 

All the best!

Through no fault of my own, I guess I'm about to lose my only clique of friends. Sure, it's easy to say that they weren't worth being in your life, but...it just hurts a lot , you know? I've lost sleep over this and it's not like they care, so I shouldn't. Ha, easier said than done. 
-
 
I've read several posts about people liking other people but aren't willing to go for it. I say, really just go for it! If the friendship is strong enough, the confession would not break it. I personally like a guy in my clique (I'm a girl) and slowly developed our friendship into something more. Of course, I had worries that the guy might reject me or I might spoil the harmony of the clique. But none of my worries turn out to be true and I'm now a girl about to graduate with the man of my dreams. And I really hope people out there will find the same courage I had and go pursue the one they love. Don't cause yourself regret when your crush is ultimately with someone else. Take the chance. ;)

We were never official nor exclusive which means it sucked when I started having genuine feelings for you. These are the 3 times when I tried to forget about you once and for all.

1: After I found out you had a one night stand with someone you met in the club, I wandered around Vivo aimlessly since that was the place where we used to hang out in frequently. A part of me wished that we were exclusive even though we've never explicitly stated that we were. I knew I had to forget you because you obviously did not share the same feelings as I did. 

I entered 4 shops and all 4 were playing your favourite song at that time. So I decided to get out of the mall. I hung around the smoking area, wondering if I should smoke considering that I've sworn off smoking at that time. In the midst of my deliberations, this random guy came over and asked to borrow a lighter. He was holding your favourite cigarette pack - Winston Reds. Wtf world.

2: We were in the same beach party, albeit with different groups of friends. A few days before the party, you gave me sh*t for hanging out with a mutual friend too frequently. You told me to meet you in the party but I refused to because I was still mad at you. That beach party was supposed to be part of my birthday celebration and you completely ruined it, so I decided not to attend the party after all.

You sent me a photo sometime after I left. A photo of the same number of shots as my age that you bought for me as a surprise/apology.

3: You called at 630 in the morning on a Saturday, asking to come to my house to study. Naturally I tried to refuse because.. it's 630AM on a SATURDAY MORNING DAMMIT. But you told me you bought Ya Kun breakfast for the both of us so I couldn't exactly turn you down either. You and your ADHD-like behaviour made you the worst study buddy I've ever had in my life. 

It only took you 30 mins to be bored of studying. Then you grabbed my guitar without my permission and for some reasons... started singing all our favourite songs. After my parents woke up, you decided to play the piano too. I don't think you realised how much my mom loved you after that day. She thought you have a really great singing voice for "someone who's not a professional".. and I agreed.

Falling for you was a lesson. I used to be so critical of people who kept going back to the people who hurt them so much. Now that I made the exact same mistake, I understand why. Love simply makes you weak, as easily as it can strengthen you. Even though we were crap as lovers, we kick ass as friends. I'm just happy that we managed to trash things out and stay as friends. Despite everything, we still do share the same clique and the same interests too.

Tldr: "instafamous" friend now too cool for her normal non-hipster, non-ootd-taking friends. 

I have a friend that I've know for quite a few years who's "instafamous". I've people ask me if she's changed since gaining all these followers and I always bite my tongue and say that she hasn't. 

The truth is, she's changed so much... 

Her Instagram posts used to be about the different aspects of her life. She used to be a really quirky, simple and humble girl. Now her Instagram feed is filled with nothing but selfies and ootds 

The only other people she features on her Instagram are other supposedly artistic, cool, hipster people or other "instafamous" people. 

She used to post many pictures of our clique and proclaim that we were her best girlfriends and favourite girls. But now even when we take decent group pics after our outings, she updates Instagram with a selfie (instead of the group pic) and simply says smth like "had brunch with my fav girls" in the caption.

She is also getting so freaking narcissistic and vain from all the attention. I don't even open her snapchats anymore cos they're all selfies. 

Sure, our clique may not be the coolest and we may not wear the trendiest outfits and we aren't the most photogenic. But we've helped her through some tough times. And for her to be too ashamed of us to even acknowledge us on her social media really says something to me. Especially when she's kissing the asses of her hipster instafamous friends all over Instagram. 

It's getting harder and harder to meet up with her in real life too. She just doesn't seem interested. 

I guess it's time to accept that this friend has moved on to greener pastures. 
-
 
In view of some of the confessions from ppl looking to date. I am looking for something different. I am a girl, from the Arts faculty (year 3). Not so tall. I like to have fun and am not looking for something serious. I am pretty good looking as well I think. 

Most of the guys I meet are looking for a serious relationship which is not what I am after. So if you are interested drop a comment in the section below. I'll pm you. We can 'chill together' and maybe exchange some benefits as well ;)
-
 
Somehow I seem attracted to men in attached relationships. Guys who are still evergreen in Uni somehow seem nerdy and inexperienced. Green guys lost their relationships which means there must be something wrong about them for their partners to end things.

Warped logic I know...

A girl recently confessed to me...but I rejected her by saying that I cant commit. The actual fact is that she is ugly.

I'm jealous of other girls who were born lucky with everything. I'm short, fat, ugly with acne, don't know how to socialize, doing badly in studies, poor family. I feel i'll never get a boyfriend or find happiness in life.

Being a rather conservative girl, I have never believed in pre-marital sex or even sexual activities between couples (by that I mean HJ, BJ). Though I think hugging and kissing are still fine. After my 2 failed relationships, I began to lose faith in guys. And as I looked at all the confessions here talking about pre-marital sex between couples, sexual stuff and all, I realised I made the right decision by choosing to stay single for the rest of my life.

It feels as if my perfect world of love collapsed when I realised that an innocent relationship built on innocent love and mutual affection independent of sexual desires is not possible. As I look at the guys around me looking for a gf for the sake of wanting to have one, for the sake of satisfying their sexual desires, it just feel so pathetic. And those girls, who degrade themselves, who allow themselves to be touched, to be ‘played’ by guys just in order to feel loved, just to have a bf, it’s just as pathetic too. When I read those confessions of guys who fooled around despite having a gf, of guys who wanted a gf to satisfy their lusts etc etc. I am not surprised at all. What has the modern definition of love becomes?

In my past camp experiences, there was always an alpha male in the OG. He was the fit, good-looking and charismatic guy. The more outspoken girls in the OG often try to flirt with him and the more reserved girls usually steal glances at him.

The alpha male is the spotlight of the OG. He is the favourite freshie among the OGLs and often mingle well with them and the rest of the group.

I was always the delta male. People often forget my name. I am always the last few to volunteer for activities (usually the alpha male assign tasks for me). Being scrawny, below-average looking and shy, girls don't interact with me much. Even some of the guys who are sporty and outspoken don't really interact with me.

I know it is up to me to put myself out of my comfort zone and try to be more active and participative. I did try. But whenever I try to lead the group, there will always be someone overwriting what I said. It is really hurting when someone question your abilities in front of everyone.

There have been some occasions where I cry and question myself why I am so useless and inferior to others. I do want to better myself but I am really inconfident now. I am afraid of being talked behind people's back.

Sorry for sounding so emo and depraved, and thanks for hearing me out.

Just wondering does a guy have to pay for the girl for the meal and entertainment on the first date as well as subsequent date? Someone please advise.

I'm an evergreen graduating girl and my Mum is putting pressure on me to find a partner soon. She is afraid I'll be left on the shelf or something.

Problem is, I'm in no hurry to get into a relationship. I want a guy who can make my heart flutter and sweep me off my feet. Either that or I shall stay single once I'm too old to marry. It's all or nothing for me.

Some of my guy friends have confessed to me but none of them interest me. Am I too naive to believe there is knight in shining armor for me?

How does a guy indicate interest to a girl they know?

"do you ever love someone,
you know they are not meant for you,
nor are you meant for them,
but you wish you were?
you are okay with not being with them,
but yet you wish you were,
there is someone else out there,
waiting for you,
yet you wish it wasn’t so,
oh how you wish,
that you could be with the wrong ones,
that it could work out,
but it won’t ever,
yet you feel sad,
you feel cheated,
why did the universe not chose them for you?
you are so wrong for each other,
but in many ways so right,
it just isn’t fair is it?"

 Do you feel you are pretty boring or do your friends think you're boring? If you don't feel like talking then so be it. Even when in small circles, close friends or couples may be silent when together and it's totally alright. You need to learn to be comfortable in your own skin, understand yourself and develop your own identity as an individual. This doesn't mean completely ignoring what people around you think but rather, only do so if you want to. If they misunderstand your silence, just tell them you just don't feel like talking or explain to them whatever reasons you have?

 1) I personally don't like pretentious talk unless I really have to. So, if it's the latter, I just think of whatever potential topics there are. If it fails, oh wells... (awkward silence)... both parties including yourself will want to escape the situation asap. Depends on where you go to but westerners will be more likely to approach you and find topics to talk to you? Especially guys... (D-A-N-G-E-R!!!) Again, same advice as above. You need to learn to be comfortable being you. If you prefer pretentious talk, you probably would be better off googling tips on how to be a good conversationalist.
2) No! No! & No! Sorry mate. Strictly speaking, the answer to your question depends on various factors; for example, which country/city you go to, have you travelled alone/with others before, are you street smart etc. But the very fact that you even asked and the way you phrased your question, the answer for you is strictly "No." Your best shot would be to connect with other Singaporeans going to the same partner university as you or partner universities in the same area and try to arrange to travel together. Even then, you still ought to consider if you guys should be travelling together, if they are trustworthy etc. Can you and should you trust local students or other international "friends"? YOU BETTER THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU ACT. You and others might think these advices are crap, that you only live once, you have grown up now (my impression is otherwise) and that you ought to be adventurous. But more than anything else, being an adult means being able to think independently for yourself, make the right decisions and take sole responsibility for the results.

A concerned friend.

To 

I'm a fat person and unfortunately, a girl too. I have been bullied because of my weight ever since I was in Primary School with people calling me fatty fatty bom bom, saying that I'm not worthy of people's time and people's love. 

It's great that you like girls who are bigger in size but if your friends make fun of the girl you like, I guess they aren't really your friends!

I would love to get to know you tho.
-
 
I think the only way of loving you is to release you from the pain I have inflicted on you. I'm sorry I don't know how to love. I don't know how to care for you.

But before I go, I must tell you that, for all the hurt we've hurled at each other, I still love you. But I don't know if I'd recover; it has been a year and yet I haven't leapt out of my nightmare.

Today at science I saw the guy who helped me the other time at medicine. Now he look better with his hair short and styled. I managed to talk to him and know that he is a year one chemistry major but he was rushing for lab even though it is the vacations. He looks like a boyfriend material guy hehe Anyway if you do see this, I am interested to know you better so maybe we can meet out for lunch or something. 

Ps: I am single and looking for a guy to rely on. (HINT)

To  I can understand how you feel, I am also in NUS with my boyfriend and we are attached for 5 years. I do understand that it is tiring having to be the caretaker as I spend more time to take care of my boyfriend's needs. Once in a while, I feel the sense of frustration and needed to get away as it feels that I take care of him but he doesn't do for me. 

Like you, I wish that he be more positive and be better in some ways. Still, I love him and want to see that he is taken care of, it is because I looked back and always remember how it all started. My boyfriend is the one that I have been waiting for, we share a number of stuff and most of all, we love each other. I feel that I won't get another one like him despite some of his flaws and some negative outlook. We both are closeted and almost no friends like us, we know we only have each other.

So to OP of , we may have walked passed each other in NUS unknowingly, know that I have been in almost the same shoes as you. I want to say that you are not just great friend but also a great partner to stand by your boyfriend through the tough times. Yes, there will be tough times like this but it will pass. 

From your post, I feel that your love will grow after venting it out and it is because you want to continue loving your boyfriend. And that is something very valuable in you, something that is precious and rare. Your boyfriend is very fortunate to have you and your love for him makes it a very good example for our community, and the people like us. ;)

I am currently in a LDR. Quite abnormally, I am a very sexually active and curious girl, even more than my bf I think. Since we are apart, at times I find myself fantasizing about meeting guys at clubs, or on dating apps, just to have one night stands with them. I know this is terrible and of course I have never done it. But I really need it too much. And doing it to yourself is just different. Don't be mistaken, I love my bf a lot and I would never do anything that can hurt him. (And yes we have done it before)

I just want to know what should I do? Is this abnormal?

To 

Hey I feel you bro. I am 24 years old as well with the next academic year being my last year in NUS, and I still have not found a girlfriend. I came into NUS thinking that I would be able to find one, and I am about to leave NUS thinking otherwise.

I tried joining different clubs for the past 3 years in a bid to find a soul mate and as you can see, it didn't exactly work out. I think this is because I am a shy and quiet person, and when I am around girls I find attractive, I don't know what to do or say to them. It also doesn't help that throughout my whole life I haven't had many female friends in my social circle since I was from all boys secondary school, and that I am currently in a course dominated by guys.

I am starting to think people like you and I are destined to be alone forever.

I felt like a pathetic piece of junk loser whenever i see photos of my friend with other girls. I have been single and isolated by girls for the past 24 years. All i could depend on was my right hand. 
I felt so lonely, living a solitary life, with no girls to talk to. Is it just me? or girls are all superficial creatures. The sight of lovey-dovey couples really irks me. Sometimes i would wish they are dead. 
Well looking at the bright side, it motivates me to work hard and build a successful career so that i can spend all my money as a sugar daddy to compensate for the love i lost.

Okay this may sound like a troll post but it's not. I swear it happened and this incident disturbed me greatly and up til now I don't know what to do.

I am a girl and so last week my bf stayed over. I left the room and returned about 15mins later. To my horror I caught my bf jacking off to gay porn. I think he didn't realised I saw him jacking off because I didn't make any noise even though I was in a state of shock. 

I haven't confronted him about it yet and I also don't know how to. Any advice?

When the new school year starts, a guy from my JC will be entering the same faculty I am in right now. Problem is, I had a crush on him and confessed but got rejected. Tl;dr he didn't even know I existed until I approached him, but he was the popular type and probably thought I was bug on his windshield or something. No matter what I do I can't get over him and I know seeing him around school soon will reopen old wounds.

Don't know if this is a thing or what but I've been getting this stupid thing way too often. If I meet someone and tell them I'm studying engineering, they eventually ask "So both you're parents must be engineers". And if I say "No", they say "Well that's how it usually starts". As if it's some kind of disease. #coursestereotypes

I like this girl whom I've known for a few months now. We've hang out together in a group before with other friends. At first I didn't really have any feelings for her but slowly over the months, I've grown to really like her. I haven't officially expressed my interest but I've sublimally showed it.

I don't know how the girl feels but she seems to like someone else and constantly talks about him. When a girl keeps on talking about someone, its indicative that she likes him right? Its one thing to playfully mention but if she continually gushes about him...

So now I don't know if I should proceed. I like the friendship too much to destroy it if she rejects. Quite at a loss now...
-
 
Am I the only one who have cross dress before?
-
 
Hi! Responding to , I am in the exact same situation as well. I think the best way is to slowly drift apart from her or "downgrade" your friendship. e.g. seeing each other within the context of a group, making yourself less accessible by hanging out with other people/lying about it.
I don't think you should confront her about her spoilt attitude because she probably won't change, and you would have made an enemy instead.
When you are less close to her, she will reduce her reliance on you and be less over-demanding and selfish.
-
 
to . i might be an anomaly, but i find the idea of my bf jacking off to porn quite amusing haha not that he does it very often or even recently. i mean it's only "normal" right? but i have a question back for the guys: how many of you would admit to your gfs that you do watch porn? and if you do, would you offer to share it or is it your safe haven? haha

I'm gay and have been monogamously coupled with my partner for four years now. I'm an NUS student, and he's in a different university. Two years ago, he told me that he was in treatment for manic depression. That actually explained a lot of the missing pieces in our relationship like how he would often cancel on our dates because he wasn't "feeling well". 

When he told me that, I said, "Ok, how can I be there for you?". I've held onto my promise to take care of him and offer him emotional support when needed. I've seen him go into states where he cannot even form words and sentences together, and it's so painful to see sometimes. I've been his caretaker... but lately, I feel like I cannot do it anymore and sometimes, I wish I had a normal boyfriend.. whatever the fuck that means. I love him, and I feel like a terrible person for even wishing that. I don't know what else I can do....

So I know she reads this page. But she doesn't know I exist. I only got to know her in camp for a brief moment but was never able to see her around much in school. It's adorable how she types in group chats and a friendly face around arts. M, I just want you to know your amazing and will know who this is.

I am a 22 year old guy looking for a long term serious relationship. I am looking for a girl who is honest, sincere, can be trusted and adventurous. As for me, I am not very tall ( at the most 1.7m) and can look quite nerdy. I am not very rich as well and so you may have to be reasonable when going out. If you are interested to know more about me, let me know and I will PM you. I do not mind knowing you as a friend first and then see how things work out. (:

I get frustrated when my gf prefers to watch porn or play with her toy than to do it with me. I got a feeling that she does it just to spite me.

It also makes me feel less of a man. I don't know how much more of this rejection I can take. 

I have a decent size package with good girth. Any guys out there having the same prob with their gf? 
-
 
Why do some guys have the thinking of flirting with every girl they met and not be serious about it? I get why they can't be serious in getting into a relationship with every girl they know. But if they ever find one, shouldn't that's when they start to flirt and not do to every girl?
-
 
It seems like I like nerdy boys. I do appreciate the other types of good-looking guys (like the conventional almost-flawless face that sends almost every girl or gay heart racing. A hot bod is a bonus), but I don't gush over them as much as my other friends do. 
They say that I have an inclination towards "smart-looking" guys (i.e. not great, but decent in terms of their looks. And they just have this particular look that somehow hints that they might be intelligent. They're just so handsome to me). I thought it was utter nonsense at first. Then I realised that my boyfriend is like that--he's not the best-looking, but he's so brilliant. Recently I was acquainted with this guy who looks (and is) smart. He's so appealing even though he looks like the regular guy. [I have no intention to cheat, was just observing].

I don't even know why I'm confessing this; I just realised it and I guess I sorta need to get it off my chest?

The comments for  are why LGBT people are afraid to reveal themselves :( Why is it that a girl and a guy can express interest in each other after confessions here but not two guys?

Hi OP of  here.

thank you all:) I feel somewhat more encouraged being an introvert. If I may ask for a few more pieces of advice for my awkward self :X

1) What can one say to start/continue a conversation? Like, there's only so much one can say about the weather and studies. This comes as i'm soon to be in contact with international students and I'm still pretty awks with my own friends on bus rides etc.

2) any advice for a girl to be travelling? As much as I would LOVE to travel alone, I literally do not have them balls. And I hear "it's not safe to travel alone, (take this)" (terrible zelda reference), especially from concerned parents and friends.. anything to aid this, I would be grateful :)

To the guy with 2 chinese characters as his name, thank you for showing interest in NUS affairs and giving your knowledgeable advice to almost every nuswhispers' confessions even though you are not from NUS. Thank you for your interest and time, really. :)

I like fat woman.

And I really don't mean the girls who complain that they are fat. I am attracted to girls who are heavy (heavier than my 74kg) and don't let get in the way of how they carry themselves. 

I have spotted some eye candy at the deck. Every time I see her, she is either smiling or laughing. Her laughter is infectious! She is always surrounded by friends.

But I don't dare to approach her. I am not as confident as she is. I don't know how my friends would react or how to respond to nasty comments and dirty looks.

I know it's the guy's role to protect his girl. But it's not easy when it sounds harmless like  'just ask her to lose weight it's for her own good only, etc'. And I have been through this before in NS and saw the hurt that my silence did. It didn't work out.

I am afraid that history would repeat itself if I try.

Just an innocent question: if someone who is 'gay' is attracted to guys, how can 'gay' relationships occur, since there is no way a 'straight' guy can be attracted to a 'gay'? It would be a one-way relationship.

So perhaps the relationship can only occur between two 'gays'? But if 'gays' identify themselves as being female, how can they be attracted to another person who also identifies himself as being female? 'Gays' are only attracted to guys, remember?

So I honestly don't understand where all the fuss about gay/lesbian relationships is coming from. Could someone please enlighten me about this?

 Hm are you lamenting your predicament that you don't have a close group of friends, or that you don't have many social gatherings with the ones that you have in your circle?
Because..I feel you. I'm sort of in a similar Ennui situation myself.

TL;DR — It's really hard to feel so strongly towards someone who you don't know whether feels the same way towards you. It's even more difficult when this person lives in a different country from you. 

I can't say I'm in love with this person, because we hardly see each other, only a few times in fact; I just can't describe this feeling, but to keep it simple, I just want to get to know this person more - their life story, even the little insignificant things. I appreciate every single second I'm around this 'special' person; we don't have to be doing anything exciting, because their sheer presence simply makes me feel adequate, like my life is complete. 

We keep in contact through a couple of text messages here and there daily, but that's really the only form of interaction we ever have. Every single time this person's name pops up on my phone screen, I can honestly say that it makes me feel like I'm the happiest person on earth for that moment. This person doesn't even have to reply me, keep the conversation going, or even bother acknowledging my existence since we, honestly speaking, have no real 'purpose' to do so, but they do, and I genuinely appreciate it. 

It's really difficult when you're always (sub)consciously thinking about this one person; you just want to see them in person (not for any sexual purposes), but you just simply don't know when the next time you two would meet again, if ever. You know, witnessing their one little smile in real life makes all the wait worth it. That amazing feeling you get when you finally get to know that you'll be seeing them again in person, that feeling you get as you countdown from months to weeks to days to hours to minutes before you see them next... then that completely contrasting feeling you get the moment you say goodbye to them in person with uncertainty about future meet ups. It's painful, it really is.

I don't even know how it's possible to feel this way and maintain this feeling towards a person you hardly ever see physically, a person who is geographically far away from you, a person who might not even feel anything more than a friend towards you, but I do. 

I feel so strongly towards this person that I'm willing to put a hold on everything that's going on in my life now and just move to the place they're living at, in the future. Even then, this person may relocate afterwards for whatever purposes. I wouldn't even mind the potential disappointment I might be hit with for doing so, because this is how special this person is in my eyes. 

I really cannot explain what I'm feeling... I just want to be close to them, physically, mentally and emotionally, you know? Perhaps this is simply a phase, perhaps this is what they call infatuation, and for all you know, it may be. I've been through months only communicating through text messages, not knowing if I'd ever see this person again, but this feeling still persisted. Perhaps this feeling may die down if I give it a few months or so, and I guess that may somehow be a good thing. But I can honestly say that right now, my biggest fear is this person making an exit out of my life. 

To answer what some of you may be thinking, no, I don't think I will ever confess to this person about how I feel. I don't have the courage to, and I don't want anything to change – yes, I know sometimes we need to take a risk, but as of now, I don't think it's worth it nor the right time to do so. And because of this, as counterintuitive as it may sound, I act as reasonably nonchalant as I can towards this person, and I try as hard as I can from dropping any hints about how I feel towards them. So guess this person will remain secretly special to me, without them knowing, without anyone else in the world knowing... only me. 

Until next time, hopefully. Till then, I'll continue patiently waiting for your replies, helplessly thinking about you when I'm listening to sad songs, and everything else I do, and put on a strong facade. X

If you actually read everything, thank you, really, for listening to what I had to say.

P.S. I'd appreciate if nobody commented anything negative, because this is something that has plagued me for the past few months and something I've been wanting to let out but never had the chance to as I'm someone who keeps everything to myself.

P.P.S. Apologies for any grammatical errors. If I were to proof read it, it'd probably take me the entire day because I would go on and on.

Friends getting together like raindrops hitting the ground. Meanwhile I'm stuck in a drain somewhere. 
Why is it so easy for others but so hard for me? It isn't like I haven't tried? What's the secret?
-
 
I accidentally fell in love with my best friend. Now, we don't talk anymore and it breaks my heart. 

Yeah, I may like you in the past, but our friendship is more important to me. That's why I didn't  want you to know my feeling. 

But things have ended badly and I can do nothing about it. Anyway, please meet a nice guy and be happy. Take care ^^

Question for the ladies: what are your thoughts on your boyfriend getting off to porn? Is it counted as cheating? What if the girl doesn't believe in pre-marital sex and marriage is like 10 years away?  
-
 
A lot of people talk about the fish in the sea. The ones they caught, the ones that got away, the ones that broke their heart, the ones they caught and released, and maybe the ones they bumped uglies with.

Meanwhile I'm reading these from a desert. There's no sea for miles and I've never fished before, and probably never will.

Currently on an internship and there is this guy whom I'm attracted to. I'm not sure about his relationship status now, but I'm pretty sure that 2 months ago, he still had a girlfriend. Chances of him still being in a relationship is pretty high. From our interactions, I can tell that he is perhaps a little attracted to me as well. The way he steals glances at me when I'm not looking and the way he is always trying to participate in conversations I'm having with other people. And the way he always invites me for lunch and gets disappointed when I can't make it. And the way he buys snacks which I like and comes over to my table to offer me food. The fact is that he doesn't do this to other intern girls? The special attention given to me makes me really confused. Though I know it's really wrong but I can't help but feel a little excited that he is showing a little interest in me?:/

I realised that when meeting with some friends, I count down the time spent with them and hope to go home as soon as possible. Whereas there are others where time seems irrelevant when spent with them.

Too many stories of relationship breakups and failures to get the guy/girl of someone's dreams recently. Here's a happy one! 

I just got attached with my girlfriend yesterday after having a crush on her for the past six months! Here's hoping for many more happy six months to come! <3 Love you!

Is it ok to hold hands on the first date?

Genuine question to all the girls out there, do you mind if your boyfriend still watches and gets off to porn? I mean it's not cheating right and a man's gotta go when a man's gotta go, man.  
-
 
To the guy in  who cheated on your gf with the best friend. I did the same thing a few years back. Except I was the best friend. It was memorable. 

Anyhow, I don't think she has to know. For her sake because then you will be stealing something from her-her ability to believe that there is goodness in the world and her ability to trust. But really do rethink your feelings about your gf. Maybe you haven't met the right one yet. 

We all make mistakes. Chin up, bro.

There's always the negative connotation with the words "Sissy" and "Tomboy".

However, people who excessively behave in their stereotypical gender roles are often more annoying than these so-called "sissies" and "toms".

Guys who are associated with masculinity, often tend to arrogantly shout and behave in a rude manner, as if to impress others. It's not cool y'know. Whereas guys who are more feminine (a so-called "sissy"), are more friendly, polite and caring. 

Girls who are associated with feminism, often tend to complain over trivial matters and constantly hoping to find the "Mister Perfect" to secure their ideal future, while putting the other guys down. Whereas girls who are more masculine (a so-called "tom-boy") are more fiercely independent, creative and always looking out for the well-being others.

Just my little observation.
What do you guys think?
-
 
A shout out to those trying to get over their unrequited love, erasing feelings for someone who doesn't feel the same way. It's a long and arduous process, but better times lie ahead!
-
 
Today I realized that people don't like negativity. No one wants to see negative statuses on Facebook. No one wants to hang out with apathetic, cold and bitter people but that's all I am nowadays - a hollow shell of a man. But that's okay because I can pretend to be happy and enthusiastic, even though that's not what I actually feel. My family and friends do not need to know who I really am deep down. I'll keep pretending to be a good person, if that's what keeps them by my side. 
-
 
interesting how people reply to anonymous confessions with surprisingly useful comments. especially relationship problems haha.

anyway. i would like to ask a question. if a person were to go for psychological counselling for anxiety, will it be necessary to put it into application forms esp for jobs? will going for counselling affect job prospects? better to not go or to keep it secret?
-
 
I am currently in a stable relationship and I foresee marrying my girlfriend in a few years' time. However, I am not really into having sex with her. We are both okay with pre-marital sex and in fact have done it a few times. Yet the frequency is probably lower than the average couple who engages in pre-marital sex.

I don't think it is due to my low libido. I have no problem self-pleasuring while fantasizing about other girls. However, I do love my girlfriend a lot and everything in the relationship is there, except the sexual excitement and frequency.

What should I do?

I have this friend who has been constantly putting me down. She's kind of spoilt and everything has to go her way. Although I do realise that she might be a toxic friend, I can't seem to break off the friendship with her. What should I do? 
-
 
I actually get quite creeped out and turned off by guys who jump straight to giving you hints that he likes you when he's just someone you know that exist but not really friends with yet (really makes the guy look so despo). I would prefer if a friendship was established first before taking the next step. Yeah altho your method defintely wont make you fall in the friendzone, the chances of getting the girl is quite slim..

If I start talking to a girl after my breakup, and she starts having feelings for me, is it considered a rebound relationship if we do end up together? Coz I might have feelings for her too... But haven't gotten over my ex...

Never chase love, affection or attention. If it's not given freely by the other person, then it's not worth having. You deserve better.

I have been sleeping (a.k.a. having sex) with my girlfriend's best friend. The affair has been going on for a few weeks after we met at an event(my gf introduced me to her). 

She added me on fb afterwards. We chatted secretly and I got physically attracted to her and so did she. Eventually we did hook up one night when my gf had to cancel our date as she couldnt make it. 

Right now I am finding it hard to keep things under wrap as it gets awkward when they both show up together. I love my gf alot and I dont want a breakup but at the same time i am lusting for her friend. 

Any advice?

Please do not flame me. I think i am doing a good job of making sure my gf doesn't suspect anything but this has to stop somewhere and I don't know what to do right now.

My girlfriend and I broke up 2 months ago and we have only been together for a few months. But we are still on good terms and we text each other every now and then (about once every week). I know I will still be seeing her in school next semester because we will still be staying in the same hall. What are the chances that we will get back together?

Hi. To all those who have sought uhc's counselling services, how does one get started with booking an appointment?

Would need some advice too:

Had depression last time, but i became much better already. Stopped feeling so "emo" and having a negative outlook of life. No longer suicidal and living quite a normal life. However, just about the past 2-3years (yes it has actually been that long), i think i probably have anxiety to the point where i have insomnia and frequent hyperventilation episodes while trying to sleep (which further impairs my sleep). This gets especially worse on the night before exam or when i have an important (and stressful) event the next day. 

will the uhc service be of help? I dont have the finances to seek out private psychological help and neither do i want my parents to know...

How do you differentiate between a guy being disinterested, busy or simply playing it cool (or whatever else) when he takes hours to reply your Whatsapp conversation? I have to admit I do the same thing to him too though, but that's because I really like him and I don't want to reply him without carefully articulating my message. (Don't judge)

I used to be really clueless when dealing with BGR stuffs. Lately I have signed up for a pick-up course taught by a famous local pick-up artist. His name is Hong, you might heard about him before.

Here are my 10 cents worth of skills I have learnt from him.

1) If a girl keeps on adjusting her hair while talking to you, she likes you.
2) If a girl keeps on liking your fb or insta post, she likes you.
3) If a girl offer you food very often,she likes you.
4) If you found out that the girl is secretly peeping at you during lessons, she likes you.
5) If a girl consumes her food really slowly when having meals together, she likes you.

Here are 5 things that girls will do if they are really comfortable with you

1) They will come very close to you, slight body contact
2) Find excuses to hug you
3) Make you buy sanitary pad for them
4) Laugh at whatever stuffs you say, even though it's not funny at all.
5) Tell you her cup size etc....

Good Luck!

i started going out with my friend 2-3 months after he broke up with his ex of almost 2 years. it was already failing in the end. we are very good friends for 1-2 years. he said he likes me but how do I know if i am a rebound? they say relationships that started off as friendship last longer. does he like me because we understand each other and can share or is he just using me as a rebound? 

(i am a girl he is a guy)

I feel sad when I'm on holiday. Being the socially awkward, quiet girl even amongst my chatty friends, being socially obligated to go on a "holiday" with my peers is a terrible idea. At least when during curriculum, I had common topics to talk about like studies, but now I just cannot bring myself to talk about anything else because I think I'm pretty boring and I'm afraid of being talked over and ignored. 

I feel the need to space out every now and then in my own personal bubble without the need to be interactive and my friends mistake my quietness for judgement or lack of topics to talk about when I just do not want to talk at all. The larger the group, the lesser I talk because I feel the need not to contribute to the noise pollution. If only things can be still, even for a moment, I would be so content.

To all freshies who are worried about camps, my advice is to go for it. Make new friends and expose yourself to the culture. Cos during camps, they will familiarise you with the surroundings. And it allows you to make friends, so that you won't have to sit alone for your first lecture. Not that it's a bad thing. 

If you are really worried, ask the ogls for advice on studies and lifestyle during the camps. Stop worrying and look forward to a great time in NUS.

I am on SEP right now. I pretty like the guy who is also from NUS and in the same partner university as me. We have been travelling together quite a lot and become good friends. I don't know whether I should tell him my feelings or not... I scare we cannot be friends anymore if I cross the line.

Been wanting to post this for a while now. There's this guy that I met during my primary school days. My only memory of him then was that he was a trouble maker. We then moved on to the same secondary school. Being in a same CCA for a while, we became friends. We started chatting online, many a times, conversation went to, who do you like? obviously I didn't like him that way, and he didn't like me that way. In fact, he had a crush on a friend of mine. During that time period, I started falling for a jerk. Which lead to many tears, of which he cheered me up plenty of times. He was always there for me. 

Long story short, I fell for him after our secondary school. After we went out for a movie "date", which I agreed to go, trying to convince myself that I didn't like him. Totally backfiring, I remember telling my friends how sweet he was, or how much he understood me. How he was always there for me. I fell head over heels for this guy. But he didn't feel the same. He told me he liked someone, who I didn't know. I was disappointed, hence I never confessed.

Now I'm in uni. He's now waiting to be enlisted. We are still in contact. After some time, I finally started cool down, and started to look at other things.  We went out one more time to another movie "date"... I guess it was my fault for being so comfortable with him. Now he's the one who likes me.  However, during my time in uni, I started to like someone else. But I don't think there will be any development between this guy and me. We seem to be of different world. but regarding the guy who likes me now... I don't know what to do. I did like him A LOT before. But I think he's getting further away from my ideal type... but then again, they always say its better to have someone who loves you. However, when I told my friends some of the stuff he does.(he might be sorta perverted) They don't seem very supportive of him. But right now, I can't seem to get him out of my head.

Still an evergreen but briefly went out with 3 ladies with romantic motivations during the semesters, at different, non-overlapping time.

1st: Nothing in common but we have a lot of chemistry. But I cannot stand the fact that she was dating several guys at once. But maybe she was just popular and outgoing?

2nd: We have some common interests, but our topics just stops there, coupled with awkward silences and lack of chemistry. 

3rd: I thought we have common interests but it turned out that we like very different genres of the same stuff. Talking to her as a friend is alright and I love chatting with her but things got weird when I said I want us to be more than friends. She said outright she doesn't want a boyfriend and only wants to live with cats in the future.

I just came back from an astro trip to Indonesia and I never really mentioned this to any of my friends... but I really don't feel like coming back to school only to see this guy who I rejected flatly. I complained about him to the staff over his over-friendly advances, but I can't help but think he's befriending my friends to appear friendly, innocent and benign. From the way I see him, he is more of a crafty manipulator, but how do I convince my friends that he's not the kind of nice guy people think he is?

Luckily I'd be flying off for my SEP, so at least I won't get to see him for half a year.

I am lonely.

Loneliness is distinct from being alone; I do love the latter so, for I prefer solitude to downing many a dram of alcohol with a group of friends or acquaintances, or watching a concert. Crowds tire me; even small groups leave me yearning for peace and quiet.

In the silence I find clarity and rest - my thoughts are uninterrupted and unaffected by anyone else.

But I feel lonely.

I know not why, but I cannot feel love for anyone - not my family, not my closest friends, not even my pet cat of several years. If they get hurt, there is only a faint stirring of emotion, easily lost in the utter bleakness of my soul, like tears in rain.

I can only cry for myself - and I have done so until I cannot cry any more.

There are times I can hardly breathe, for my loneliness overwhelms me, and I can only sit or lie and wait for it to end.

But I am strong! My mind suffers no one to insult its ability, so I should be able to overcome it - or at least that's what people say about me. So why can't I do it?

Why don't I just die?

I know the arguments; speak not to me of eternal damnation or the absurdity of this world. Mention not the pain people who care for me will feel - who are you to say that their pain triumphs mine, and that mine does not even compare to theirs?

To be or not to be - that is the question.

I am lonely, ladies and gentlemen, and I fear I am beginning to love it, even as it wounds me to the heart. Strange, isn't it? I am growing to love my own loneliness.

But there still remains the silhouette of a beautiful dream I had: that I can find someone to spend the rest of my days with. It is the only true wish I have right now, and it keeps me going.

But when I think of it, I grow afraid and turn away from it. What if I grow bored of her, as I have done so for many of my past interests? What if I am not good enough for anyone?

You won't recognise me on the campus - I can fake being normal as easily as breathing. I can laugh, I can smile, I can appear carefree.

In the wee hours of the morning, my facade fails.

Today (20/5) I went to the Forum Bookstore to try out my graduation gown. There, I was helped by a friendly and cute girl. I wish I could have known you!

 both my parents came for my graduation (not NUS though) but sat far from each other. I had greatly mixed feelings that day... 

I guess I was important enough for them to be present but still not quite for them to withstand each other (with curious looks from my friends who recognised them but didn't know they were divorced).

I used to know this girl from school. She was nice and friendly. But recently, I seriously can't stand her on social media. I suspect she is secretly bipolar or something. The day before, she spammed pictures of herself on holiday with all those cutesy captions like she is some innocent girl. Today, her posts suddenly change to scolding people and includes cursing too. 

I cannot stand seeing so many posts made by her, regardless of cutesy posts or cursing posts, but I don't want to unfollow her and make it obvious that I hate her now. She claims to have matured in her posts, but I think she means that she matured backwards.

I have gone for uhc councelling and it were a series of meaningful conversation I would say. It isn't stated on uhc website but actually there were eight sessions, normally one every week, and you can call your personal counsellor at any time when you need it. By the end of it I gained confidence to talk more to people around me and started to think positively and laughed more. There was a lot of advice from my counsellor that was quite suitable for me and I experienced a surprising change of my mind. BTW, it's free for NUS students.

To  's 'Perhaps some of you might question why I appear to be so needy and in desperation of new friends when old friends could be enough, but I feel afraid of being socially left out and ostracised after unpleasant experiences which happened to me a good few years back. I hope people would really, truly understand my experiences, but that is a different story for a different day.' There's nothing wrong in admitting that you seek some kind of emotional connection. It's tragic to believe that is something people will question.

“I love being horribly straightforward. I love sending reckless text messages (because how reckless can a form of digitized communication be?) and telling people I love them and telling people they are absolutely magical humans and I cannot believe they really exist. I love saying, Kiss me harder, and You’re a good person, and, You brighten my day. I live my life as straight-forward as possible.

Because one day, I might get hit by a bus.

Maybe it’s weird. Maybe it’s scary. Maybe it seems downright impossible to just be—to just let people know you want them, need them, feel like, in this very moment, you will die if you do not see them, hold them, touch them in some way whether its your feet on their thighs on the couch or your tongue in their mouth or your heart in their hands.

But there is nothing more beautiful than being desperate.

And there is nothing more risky than pretending not to care.

We are young and we are human and we are beautiful and we are not as in control as we think we are. We never know who needs us back. We never know the magic that can arise between ourselves and other humans.

We never know when the bus is coming.”

I'm extremely tired because I feel my mum is quite overbearing. She is the sort of person who screams "Did your friends teach you how to do that?" whenever I start talking back to her. Otherwise, she threatens me by saying she would hurt herself, to get me to do as she wants. 

Talking to her has become a bit difficult. She's the only family I have so I get a bit lonely sometimes... :-(

Well it's kind of a long story how me and Him got to know each other so I'll skip the point. I'm a 2nd year fass girl, and I have been told I am attractive. I do think I am attractive too. This is not my vanity speaking but a self doubting variable at the back of my mind. I'll get on to that. 

There's this guy chasing me, and he's not very subtle about it. He's graduated from nus already, and the thing is, he''s 14 years older than me. He's got an interesting job, makes around $150,000 a year, and he's been single the past 5 years. I do find his quite attractive and secretly admire him and all, but that's still not very obvious yet. I do not doubt that part of the reason why I find him so seductive is because his success gives him this distinct aura that you just can't find in most nus guys. It's like the dragonboat or TeamNUS guys - just that it's actually a real man out in the world, not another fellow undergrad. 

Which brings me back to...why he's innit for me. My *good looks* are duplicated among older women his age too. 

In case you're wondering - no we haven't slept together yet.

How do you know when you are interested in someone beyond just as a friend?

ive some mutual feelings with this girl but she has not given me an answer. recently she just left to embark on her SEP. first few days she was still friendly, sending pictures & chatting over skype. suddenly it got less & less and reduced to emoticons (smiley faces) & "yups". you know, like convo killers.  now she doesnt ask abt me & i cant help but feel like im being a pain in the ass whenever i text to ask her how she is & hoping all is going well. i'm slowly going crazy. how am i to last the entire few mths to come.

After hearing a few comments on how they cannot find internships and things, let me share my experience. 

I'm a year 1 and I know it's a bit early to talk about SEP and internships, but a job is somewhat the same. After my finals, I started right away looking for a job. I've looked through jobstreet, stjobs, nus talent connect, gumtree. But they all want a commitment of 3 to 4 months which I cannot commit. Other than events. 

I've sent out more than 10 job applications. Some may think it's little, but I sieve through and pick those that I can commit, thus this number. I've waited for more than 2 weeks but there's still no reply. And I get the feeling that my parents think I'm just leeching on them and lazy. I don't like this feeling. I want to work. I want to earn money. But employers don't reply. What to do?

When is it the right time to tell her that you're interested in her?
We've gone out on a couple of dates together, but I'm still not exactly sure if she's interested in me. So far I've been the one initiating the conversations and dates, and she's quite responsive to them.

I know there isn't a set amount of time or set amount of dates, but what should I be looking out for?

“What keeps you going everyday? What's your motivation? I'm comfortable being alone and not giving a hoot about anything.”

This is my short answer to your question. Not sure how relevant it is, but I tried.

I am someone with low confidence and who has social anxiety. During school term, I struggle almost everyday with the fear of attending classes and even passing by people along the walkways. Everyday I battle with my anxieties and feel so mentally drained. Even during the holidays, I worry that my condition will worsen because I tend to meet people on a less frequent basis. Still, many things keep me going.

I love my family and friends, and I want to be someone who they can share their troubles with. I want to communicate with them and hopefully learn how to be happier people together. I’m not from a rich family, so I want to work harder to be able to provide a better life for my parents in the future. 

Right now, I am single. Someday, I want to fall in love and get married.  I want to be able to share my happiness with someone else. Usually I am very comfortable alone, because when I am alone, I don’t have to be preoccupied with negative thoughts of what other people think of me. Yet, I know this is not what I want in life. Instead of closing myself up, or telling myself I don’t care about life anymore (because that is easy to do), I tell myself to continue challenging life. Instead of limiting my life experiences, I want to keep living and learning. I want to become emotionally stronger for the people I love, and that is my motivation for living because that will be what makes me happy as well.

I fell in love with my friend I got to know in uni... She's a girl and I'm a girl but I swear I'm not a lesbian. I've been in relationships (not at the moment). I don't know what to do. She's not a lesbian and seems interested in this other dude she got to know. But when we're together, there's something in the way we flirt and look at each other that got me thinking that maybe she feels something too. She seems to want my attention more than a normal friend would to or more than that that she want from our other friends ... I don't know if she actually feels something for me. But who am I kidding, this is Singapore... Where our relationship would never be recognised and even viewed at with disgust. Maybe I should just forget it and move on but I keep thinking about her. I'm just so confused now, about my sexuality as well as my feelings for her.

I really like a friend of mine but he's got a long time girlfriend. We get on really well together and I sometimes think he may have feelings for me too. I know it would be terrible of me to even express my feelings to him but it is becoming damn difficult. I don't want to sacrifice the friendship by avoiding him but I don't see any other way of escaping my feelings. I'm going to unintentionally end up a bitch for ignoring him seemingly for no reason.

To  and 

Hey, it's  here. I just wanted to thank the both of you for your kind words. I did not expect to get any replies, and to know that there are others in NUS suffering the same (or worse) problems just makes my heart sink. No one should ever have to go through this sort of pain and mental stress.

Having to think up of an excuse to avoid eating with groups, wanting to go places to eat but knowing you can't. Reunion dinners and any sort of gatherings are just the worst, because you know you can't really avoid them, but you also know when the food is served it's going to be an awkward scene of you not eating and just finding excuses.

I always think of what it would be like if I didn't have this problem. It seems like a world full of colors and happiness. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating here, but seriously. If I could eat out without issues, the first thing I'd do is invite my family to a fancy restaurant to eat. That's a dream I'd love to achieve one day.

To attain that dream and more though, I'll just have to keep working hard. I should really seek help once again, and seeing both of your kind words serve as more motivation to do so. I hope the both of you (and anyone else facing any sort of difficulties) manage to overcome your difficulties as well and come out as better, stronger people. :)

I just went for the only interview I got from my numerous internship applications. They said they'd let me know next week, but it's clear they were less than enthusiastic about hiring me. Not looking forward to this summer to be honest as I gotta find something else to do to be productive.
-
 
 Since you've never felt this way before, it might just be there momentarily. Or if it's long term, try your best to expose yourself to more things you think you'll be interested in, either as a sideline hobby or what you want to do in the future. It may take a while but it beats doing nothing and being in a standstill. Gl ;)

sometimes I wish I am a girl so I can get my best friend as my boyfriend :(

I have given my everything to you and you vowed to love me when u took away my virginity. But you left me in end. What should I do :(

Guys, hope that this confession goes through as I'm rather afraid to share it in public. So here it goes:

I'm a photographer (stereotyped with professional-looking equipment with awesome prices to match their cost), and to many people, I appear everywhere around school. It's not uncommon for me to be found taking photos for the various school communities in school camps, and faculty and major-level events. I think I'm imagined to be a very popular guy, knowing tons of people and friends, and friends of friends, appearing to mingle around effortlessly with the crowd and becoming part of the image of camps themselves.

But I always, always can't help but feel that I'm living one of the most fake facades ever. It seems that people treasure the presence of a professional looking camera, but not the emotional soul powering it. Conversations take place and start because of the act of photographing, but not because of the qualities of the person who takes the photographs in the first place. And as I appear to know a huge number of people, I'm never included in any close friend-groups, often finding myself lunching and taking dinners on my own. It can't be helped that I'm a rather poor in-depth communicator; often running out of ideas in small, inquisitive talk. 

Even more so, I feel I am valued only because of what I do, but not who I really am; when I am not needed, I feel forgotten and terribly left out of crucial social communications. I just do not know who to call out and hang out with, other than my own old, trusty friends who knows me as a person and more than just a photographer who appears out of nowhere. Perhaps some of you might question why I appear to be so needy and in desperation of new friends when old friends could be enough, but I feel afraid of being socially left out and ostracised after unpleasant experiences which happened to me a good few years back. I hope people would really, truly understand my experiences, but that is a different story for a different day.

I take photos because I like the art and the act of taking them (with the experience of constructing the shots), and also to hopefully make new friends and find potential soulmates. I find myself knowing loads of acquaintances, but almost zero or even zero close friends in university. And I feel very vexed about this entire thing, because I feel like I'm not being emotionally valued, and sometimes being equated to a commodity. 

So to all you camp-goers and other people who meet photographers, please take the chance to know them better. We might appear very sociable and talkative, but in reality many of us could be tremendously shy, and are secretly lonely people who really appreciate a close friendship. I might not speak for all who do similar work to what I do, but we are people who choose to take photos out of our own free will, and that we often enjoy the craft itself, while adding to the smorgasbord of experiences that you all undergo here in higher learning. 

Still hoping I could feel more emotionally important to others, but seems like it's not happening :(

Sincerely,
the frustrated photographer

SLn the day i saw you, i felt the whole world was mine. I can't explain what i feel. I have so many things to tell you. But whenever i see your eyes, i forgot everything. But now day by day, though you are getting away from me, avoiding me, ignoring me, you are still inseperable from my heart. I just want to say, i love you. 
-
 
You could have just told me that you don't wanna help instead of telling me that you can't help. You obviously have the means to help if you really wanted to. Stop lying into my face when you even agreed to help another person regarding the same issue. 同人不同命. A lot of times it's not a matter of can or not. It's just a matter of want or not. You didn't even try.  I will definitely help if I were you. Disappointed. 
-
 
Despite living only over 20 years of my life, i can't help but settle on this thought: I'm done. I'm done with whatever life has to give or what's to come. I don't care if i don't see anything new, find new experiences. There's no motivation. Nothing impresses me anymore.

I don't care if i don't meet any friends this summer. I don't care if nothing is done. To be honest, i don't really care about my grades or what's to come next academic year. I'm not really interested in the future and i don't really care if i die tomorrow.

So tell me guys, what keeps you going everyday? What's your motivation? I'm comfortable being alone and not giving a hoot about anything. It does seem unnatural to feel this way cause i never felt like this before.

I made up my mind last semester (my 6th) to work harder, to be a better person, to stop fooling around. Unfortunately, with a CAP of around 3 flat, things don't look very well for me, and things still don't look good. I am aware that there are CAP below mine, but it still doesn't make my situation better; it just gives me a false sense of security to sit there and say that I should be appreciative of what I have and don't be a jerk. Well,my CAP is still low, I am appreciative of it, but I wish to have a more ideal CAP, as with quite a number of people.

I worked hard, studied harder, and worked towards being a better person. While things do not look very well right now, if I try harder, and work harder, I can make something out of these pair of hands that created nothing for my life so far. 

Unfortunately, in this summer vacation, out of the around 10-20 applications I have made (Again, I am aware that there are others who made more), none have replied. I turned to a self-initiated Vacation Internship instead, learning the skills to be an automotive (car) mechanic, due to some family connections, which I am very fortunate to have. True, at the end of this first week, my hands have cuts and bruises on them due to my own carelessness, but if they are willing to teach me, I am willing to learn. If others see me, and reject me because I have not proven my worth to them, I will just continue to move along. They don't owe me my living. I only need to prove my self worth to myself.

I still have no idea how to write my report,though I am sure something sort of... intellectual? will come along the way while I work along.

True, your story may be different from mine, and the extent of actions you have taken may have been more. I don't know about that, and I am not in a position to criticise you either. However, the point of my post today here is, don't be disheartened, yes? If you have the time to be feeling disheartened and comforting yourself that you cannot do anything, you're burning time in doing things that let you know that there is always something productive and creative that you can do. Have hope, take things slow, and you will mine a way out of this tunnel.

Just a thought - people posting about unrequited love and such and more people replying about how the OP should move on and that the guy/ girl doesn't deserve the OP? 

I don't think it's exactly fair to do that to whoever the OP has a crush on. Suggesting that the guy/ girl in question doesn't deserve someone is basically putting them down, and all because they do not feel attracted to someone? I mean, are you supposed to be obligated to return feelings? If that's supposed to be the case, I don't know how you guys do it. Yes, saying that is a way to validate your moving on/ giving up/ protect your self-esteem whatever, but honestly, this should have nothing to do with your self-worth, so be a lady/ gentleman and respect each other's feelings. Or at least try to.

To  Hey, I was really surprised when I read that you had public eating anxiety, because I am suffering from it too, though it wasn't as long as yours. It started about 3 years ago for me, and still counting. It's been quite a haunting experience, and like you, I didn't take part in activities like orientation, neither did I apply for internship during this summer term as I tend to avoid meals with people. Not many, in fact almost none at all, could understand what I was going through, even my own family. I've only told to few of my friends whom I could trust and most of the time, when I happened to meet new friends in school, I would always struggle with thinking of new excuses to avoid meals with them. Hence, most of the time, I preferred to be alone, and do takeaways as well. I've tried to seek support group elsewhere, but none had an anxiety similar to mine. I thought I was the only one, especially being in a school with so many extroverts and sociable people. Sometimes, this would lead to short periods of depression, when I felt that I couldn't overcome it and it inevitably affected my studies as well. Like you, I've tried seeking psychological help but it didn't help much. However, I'm not going to give up and I believe I'll overcome it one day, and you should too, continue believing in yourself.

 I was in love with my best friend. It ended up badly cos he is a jerk. No idea why my best friend is a jerk.

 U are definitely not alone here.I also suffered the same problem as you except mine is worse and it happened just recently.I couldn't eat properly both at home and outside.I am trying to resolve this problem without seeking professional help 1st.I really hoped it can be resolved within days or at most a few weeks.I can't imagine how life would be like for me if it goes on forever or if it takes years to recover.Don't lose hope yet and hang on!

Those girls who can not keep their eyes away from the handsome nerdy guy in the library, please quit eye-f*cking the guy and make a move on him.

You know, any guy studying at the library on a regular basis is obviously unattached, plus this guy is a rather introvert student with not many close friends, so you definitely stand a pretty good chance of getting him, and you should really move quick, before anyone else approaches him.

Alright, just do it, girls. If not you will put me in a very difficult situation as you all distract me a lot. ;)

How do i understand (in full) what a period feels like? I'll admit, sometimes I'm not a very good brother and I lose my temper at my younger sister when she...you get the idea. I know it can be uncomfortable and painful for some, but how can I understand fully what my sister is going through? I don't want to ask her this question though.

Hi everyone, I am looking for opinions for the following scenario as I am at my wit's ends. 

For the past one year, I have been chasing this girl who I have admired for 2 years. I have done numerous things to show my concern for her, such as buying medicines for her when she is sick and going the extra mile to get stuff for her when she needs it. 
However, even after a year of effort, I am still faced with rejections when I try to ask her out for a meal. My friends have been telling me to give her up as all of them feel that I have tried enough.
I am trying to move on, but a part of me is unwilling to give up. I really really like her, but I am feeling jaded too. I wanted to accept the fact and walk away, but I am also dying to know why she keeps rejecting me. I don't see myself as a bad partner, I may not have an attractive physical appearance but I do have the capacity to treat my girlfriend really well. 

So the question now is whether I should move on or I should wait and continue to try harder? If it is try harder, what else can I do?
-
 
 Well I'm going to take a rather controversial stand. Have you tried liking her? I feel that both of you have similar histories and it seems that you two understand each other very well. Sometimes it may hit you but I'll advise you to consider trying to. Companionate love is actually more long-lasting that romantic love. It may not be much but I really do feel that you two have the necessary 'ingredients' to form a long-lasting relationship. I'm sure you don't want your friend or yourself to have further failed relationships. It may not be easy at first but start of by being nicer and showing more concern? It might work yknow.
-
 
I'm sorry for initiating the break up. Knowing you is my biggest mistake. There is no way I can repay all the sweet things that you have done for me. You came into my life at my lowest point, when I'm struggling with depression and falling out with my current boyfriend. No guy has ever make me cry so much and laugh so much as you. 
I laughed really hard when you tell me jokes to cheer me up, in our late night chat - I felt secured and treasured by you. I cried even harder because I'm guilty of not being able to fulfil  my promises - I still couldn't forget him in the end, no matter how bad he treats me. 

Its my bad for not choosing you in the end, I'm a bad woman that don't deserve your love. I want you to forget me and find a better girl. Please don't think that you are the third party, I'm the one to be blame.

Best of luck.

I broke up with 2 girls in 2 separate relationships and finally single after 7 years. I got together with the first girl at the end of our A-levels. She went to NTU while I was in the army and she was the steady one, always meeting me at Pasir Ris bus interchange when I book in to Tekong. When I finally ORD, she was near graduation and we thought we had everything planned out; a cosy 4-room HDB flat in Punggol and getting married after I graduate as well. Needless to say, when I got into uni and she started work, everything changes. Her peers at work got her to indulge in all the materialistic goods while I am caught up with school and camps. In the end we got distanced and both of us got someone else. We end our relationship of 5 years peacefully without much quarrels since we know that we had another person deep in our hearts. Now, girl 2 was my junior where I was OGL in one of the Freshmen orientation camps. She was a friendly person and chatty to every friends. That's probably how we got together anyway. Things turn sour during the exam last year and we finally ended our 1+ years of relationship as she feel that I am too over-bearing with how she talk to other guys.

So after so much adventure, I am now a 25 years old single virgin all over again.
-
 
One of my Food Science friends posted a very beautiful picture of her as her display picture on Facebook recently. Although I treat her like a little sister, now I realise I am attracted to her but she is attached already. What should I do?
-
 
tl;dr first:
- Same like , never looked for internship / exchange opportunities
- Does not seek said opportunities due to public eating anxiety
- Feels like he's given up on issue and is "comfortable" with present situation although he's obviously not

And now, the full version:
Just like , I do not have an internship, gone for exchange, or any of the like for the past 3 years of college. And it's pretty simple -- I've never gone looking for opportunities.

Yet the reason I don't look for them is because I've been dealing with public eating anxiety issues for the past 10 years. Can't eat out, so I mostly do takeaways. So if I can't do one of the most basic social thing most people do, I feel like I won't fit in with any workplace, nor will I be of great help to any team because I'll be this awkward turtle saying 'no' every time I get invited out to eat. And sure, usually the first day of work involves bosses / managers / colleagues already dragging you out for lunch. What to do when an easy thing in life for most people becomes so difficult?

I've sought help before, but I think I've lost the drive to press on and have left myself turning on the same spot for the past year. I'm disgusted with myself some times, especially when I know of others who have conquered their difficulties, some way worse than mine. Yet I always tell people not to give up when they themselves face difficulties. F*** me for being such a hypocrite, right?

Sorry, just had to rant. I really should re-seek help again and get this resolved. Being a male who has to return for his yearly ICT doesn't help matters either. Just days to a few weeks of near starvation. I'm leading myself to destruction yet I seem to be okay with that.

What to do when a person seems to have given up on himself?
-
 
I know you're there and it hurts for me to see you obviously ignoring me. I was about to write a lengthy hate post about you, but I stood back and put myself in your shoes for a moment. It was then when I realised the reason I liked you in the first place was because our personalities were similar. I realised that I would have done exactly the same thing you are currently doing to me in order to keep the distance between us. I guess there is nothing I can do for now except to learn from my past mistakes and carry on.
-
 
The first time I met this girl was when she sat down beside me in the canteen and started speaking to me. She is so genuine and even asked for my number, so I gave it to her. She seemed very interested in my life as she constantly messaged me to ask about me. Then after a few months of "friendship", she invited me to her church. I was curious and ignited by this new friendship, I joined her. 

It is a modern church, with rock band and all. The people there seemed nice, but after a few sessions, I feel it isn't suitable for me and I honestly told her I will not be coming the next week. And although I stopped going to church, I still tried contacting this girl to maintain our friendship. But then, she ignored me most of the time and when she even replied, it's all about Christian quotes against those who do not have the faith, such as how unbelievers will still go to hell no matter how much good they can do in their lives, whereas those who committed a life of immorality will still go to heaven if they accept Him on their dying bed.  (Is that even true?)

She is completely delusional. I was really disappointed. We must respect others for what they believe in as long as it is good. It's not a common belief or interest that bonds people together, rather it's the character of each and every individual. And thankfully, when I went to her church, I've met some new friends whom I still hang out with, and they never did label me as an "outcast" =) Yet I never talked about that girl to them.

To your friends who are so different from you yet with a strong camaraderie, give them a hug. Trust me, it's hard to come by.
-
 
From what I've observed, this is the usual "type" of girl that most guys will tend to chase (sometimes even multiple guys competing for the girl at the same time):
Slender to skinny body figure, "Innocent", Gullible, Soft Spoken, Dancer/Cheerleader type. Basically the type of girls that tend to reject guys a lot.  

Meanwhile, girls like myself, Curvier, Speaks for herself, have more Common interests and thus gets along better with guys, have no one chasing them, and we have to fight to get noticed. 

Seriously guys, stop chasing after the same person as the rest of the other guys, you're not going to get her because shes either attached or happily single.
-
 
Supp whisperers! I kinda need some advice on how to keep a friendship without hurting anyone.

Well, the story goes like this. I'm a guy and i have a female friend i've known since the era of Secondary school. We've known each other for the longest time and we kinda been through each other's ups and downs. While she was in sec school, she was attached to guy and i was still her friend. She broke up with him in JC and i was still there for her, to console her, to hear her rants and so on.

But the thing is, i was attached with another girl during JC and she was still there for me. I broke up with this girl when i was in NS and well, as you can expect, she was there to hear my rants and all. She got attached to another guy while i was in NS and it didnt last long coz the other guy wasnt treating her right and yet again, she went to me again. 

In short, there was only a small window of time when we were single and not attached. I've been through 3 of her breakups and she went through 2 of mine. Even though we were attached at times, that still didnt stop us from meeting each other up like once a month to catch up on events that happen in our lives, texting our problems and even going for a couple of movies just us together.

Thing is, now, we are both single and she's been dropping hints like a bomb. They are way too obvious and i've got a feeling she's interested to take things between us to another level. BUT, whenever i see her, i have no romantic feelings towards her at all. And then you guys might think, "oh shes fat, ugly etc etc..." Truth be told, she's actually gorgeous. Just that, i really just see her somewhat like a sister and nothing else. How do i go about just being friends with her and not break up our strong friendship ties without getting her hurt?
-
 
It doesn't make sense how friends around you seem to have so much going on for them - internships, attachments, jobs, exchange, travelling, scholarships - and you're just sitting here feeling sorry for yourself because you don't have any of those and are trying to find something to do over the summer so you don't seem like a bum. Yeah, your friends may tell you that a lot of people in uni at our age don't have anything to do either. But why then are none of your friends those said people?

Talk about you're not the only one. #yeahright
-
 
I'm attracted to girls who display their potential to be good mums in their interactions with kids. Not the sort who goes crazy over their cuteness, but the ones who can calmly handle the kids, who look like they know what they're doing and are enjoying it. Any other guy feels this way?
-
 
I'M IN LOVE WITH MY BEST FRIEND. 

Of course, they don't love me back. And yes this is the classic story of unrequited love blah blah. But I'm so happy that I chose this amazing person out of everyone, I want to scream it from the rooftops. Yeah, that will be a bit too dramatic. Hence, I'm resorting to this confession. 

I want everyone out there who is (rather hopelessly) in the same situation to realize that they are not alone. IT'S OKAY. You'll be sad and stuff for a while, and this will also probably question your self-esteem but you must know that for your heart (and brain) to have finally chosen your best friend only goes to show that you are looking for an awesome friendship in your life partner. Not everyone knows what they want, but you do! At least, I do now. 

And the next time you meet them, you will SMILE because that's what you do right? You always have the best of times with your closest friend! Also, no false hopes but nobody knows what the future holds yeah? 

k enough preaching. bye. :)

Hi to continue the starbucks lady story, it was IMH and the counsellor that rejected my first call and requested that I send her to Hospital B & C. Because she was not "unwell enough". Well I didn't really wanted to reveal the hospital name. So, hence...my despair that night.

what would you do when you're upset that you have been wrongly accussed, but have no recourse except to cry yourself to sleep?

After four years in engin (as a girl), my og coursemates think of me as a male-hating frigid bitch. It's probably true on reflection. But I can honestly say that I did try to give strangers the benefit of the doubt when meeting new people; except that in multiple instances, guys who I'd been friendly towards in a completely platonic way somehow ended up taking it as a sign to 'go ahead and make a move' even though I was clearly uncomfortable. I know I'm being paranoid, but these experiences were a bit traumatic; nowadays in social settings I tend to only approach girls with open friendliness, and my attitude towards guys is very obviously more guarded. At this rate I'll probably die a spinster with 1001 cats, but what the heck.

Tldr; girls, don't be as friendly as you are towards other girls as you are towards guys because some (not all. But better safe than sorry) may misinterpret you. To the subset of guys who tend to mistake friendliness as flirtation, please try to be a bit more sensitive towards girls' discomfort at your come ons.

What does it mean when somebody says "I'll let you know again" to an invitation for a date?

It seems to be that depression is a very very common syndrome among people nowadays, especially those our age. For those of you who have been through depression, I just want to know if you'll ever fully be free of it and how you've gotten out of those episodes, regardless of how much it recurs. 

I've been struggling with depression for three years now and when it was at its worst, suicide was always on my mind. I don't mind living with depression but when it begins to interfere with my motivation to work and fulfil my roles as a student/friend/etc. then it really gets crippling. I know speaking to a counsellor/therapist is pretty sound advice but it's been very hard for me to get an appointment and the last time I saw one, it was utterly meaningless. 
-
 
Genuinely curious: why do some people think/act/feel almost like university is the "final" place they can find their significant other? I seem to observe this is some people. Guys generally graduate at around 25, and girls 23. That's still a young age with plenty of time to look around in the world. Many married couples I know met outside after their graduation. Don't sweat it if you can't find your SO within your time in NUS people.

To , sometimes you should look beyond your failures and probably forget about them. Success is not measured by the number of failures and learning from failure helps you to improve. I myself had failed so many times in things I did but I've stopped caring about my failures (probably numbed -.-) but I would rather see how to improve from my failures.

Being evergreen should never define you as a failed person. Is relationship so important in life? Don't rush yourself and get one that isn't perfect for you, it's not like the world is ending.

Regarding friendship, I know making new friends in uni is different and seems more difficult than in secondary or what :( but I would encourage people to join a CCA or smth to make friends. Find one that suits your interest! It really helps to know more people and make friends! It all depends on you to integrate yourself with others and approach them! Not saying that your friends should define you as a person but friendship is a two way thing and people should cater to each other in a friendship to make it work. 

(P.S. Typing on NUSWhispers on mobile sucks)

 I guess if we look around hard enough, there are things to learn from everyone and everything. Even tasks many would simply dismiss as a "waste of time" such as gardening enables one to pay attention to the nitty gritty details and appreciate the simple things in life which most of us have taken for granted. Running early in the morning along the streets offered me a whole new different perspective as well. The fact is just that as some people are "better" in certain areas, they are "flawed" or are "lacking" in others (many a times the latter hidden from sight). That being said, I'm sure he/she too has learnt much from you as well. :) 

Sad to say, regrets are what they are and some doors are left open only for a period of time while others, perhaps infinitely. But at the same time, new doors open while others close. Moving forward, I guess all we can do now is to cherish the moment. At the very least that's what I think I should do and am trying to do. :)
-
 
I am an evergreen with no friends and no talents. I have a pathetic life, always failing at everything that I tried. Literally all of my success stories are thanks to luck alone. Right now the only thing that keep me from pulling the trigger is my concern to those that  love me (i.e my family). Whenever someone tried to cheer me up, I just smiled and thanked them, but deep inside I tought, Jokes on you, failure is my default state.

Maybe I should quit college and work at a suicide prevention center? I just tell them the story of my life and they'll realize how better their life compared to mine. Perhaps only that way will I ever contribute to society.

Looking at the number of posts related to "hopeless" romantics, and all the descriptions of desperate people trying to "get into people's pants", I really wonder what it is that traps everyone in these states of mind. 

I'm a guy from a well to do family studying in a faculty that parents mention to kids in stereotypical asian dialogues, where I balance multiple commitments within and beyond school, in which I hold titles of some sort in many of them. I commit to causes I believe in, pursue achievements that further my career prospects, spend freely on what makes me happy (no need to save for the special festivals and events), and work on whatever piques my interest. Basically all things that could have gone right have gone right. 

To say the least, I would never have been able to survive in those commitments or in my academics should I be in a committed relationship. I believe that neither choosing a relationship or experiences is wrong, as long as it makes your life better. (Sure doesn't seem that way in many of those confessions.) It's all about living life to the fullest, and having a partner to share in your world is just one way. And no matter your choice, to be confident about yourself and the value on life and the events that define it.

Of course, I also know of many happy couples within NUS and to them I give only my best wishes. But would I trade what I have for what they have? I don't think so, not at this point in time at least. Romantic relationships are built upon feelings, and feelings are fickle. They change as we grow and our experiences accumulate. That isn't even take into account incidents that shock us out of our previous world views. What I have won't.

As a disclaimer, I do have a healthy social life and friends from both genders. We hang out, have fun, share our thoughts on issues, and we help each other out when need be. I have also had romantic interests in girls in the past - and I did confess to them, in case some people think this is about guts - and probably will again in future. I am evergreen because those girls turned me down, but hey, at least I'm still great friends (without any vested interests) with many of them and I don't see anything wrong with it, neither do I harbour any excessive hurt or worse, hatred, for the rejections I have experienced. With a good family and wonderful friends, isn't that already plenty enough? Why let your world be so heavily influenced by just 1 form of interpersonal relationships?

I just hope people don't try to judge me for doing things alone. I don't understand the need for people to always require a companion to not feel like they are being silently judged by watchful eyes in the masses (e.g. when going for meals). To me, it is extremely liberating to be able to think of something and know that I can just do it because I have 1 less consideration. To each his/her own. Sometimes, feeling "sad/pity" for someone is about empathy to you as much as it is hurtful to that person who sees nothing wrong with his/her current state, not to mention those who associate myself and people like me with negative character traits. I'm just trying to live my life "without strings" ;)  while I can.

TLDR:
1. Don't judge people who prefer performing most tasks alone.
2. Relationships are based upon feelings, not some objective measurement. Don't get too worked up about not being in one because it doesn't mean that the cosmos is against you.

There was this guy who asked me out when I was fresh from a breakup. I said yes thinking I need a change in my life. Going out with guys which I had an inkling that he might be secretly promiscuous. But I thought WTHECK. It's not like I'll get emotional attached to a person like him. But turns out he was human too. He hurt like I did. He has flaws like I do. Plus he was fantastic at motivating me in my work (not going to say which faculty I'm from cos might be a huge give away).  Felt like for the longest time, I found someone who finally understood me and saw the same qualms I had in school .But I told him I can't be physical with him. But one day, one thing led to another but I stop him before we even reached 2nd Base. Cos I knew that getting physically wasn't something I wanted from this friendship/relationship. Whatever. Cos labels didn't matter to me at all. Then the messages got shorter and brief. Finals came. But he left. I guess I was right. You are a manslut. I'm glad I knew just before things got ugly. But all I want was that friend who was there for me cos I was there for him during his rough times. I want my friend. But he wants the lust.

Is it weird not to have many friends of the opposite gender? I have male friends but I'm not close to them and always hang out with other girls instead. It's not that I don't like talking to guys, but I somehow click better with girls as friends. If this continues I think it'll be hard for me to find someone special...

Im writing this to get some advice... Is it normal that im not interested in the guys who like me? All the 4 guys who chased me were not up to my standards in terms of looks... I know this sounds superficial but looks do matter a lot?

I'm a straight guy. My best friend who is gay invited me to Pink Dot on 13th June. I'm not sure if I should go and don't know what to expect. As much as I want to support him, I'm worried if I meet people I know and they judge me.

To , I do not think that you have been posting anything positive of late and people who frequent this page would know who you are from your post. I have seen many comments by you and it has gotten annoying over time. It isn't the first time you are doing this, you have done it before on the NUS Confession page.

I ask that you think twice before commenting again, some of the troll comments you gave were in bad taste. Not everyone shares the same humor as you. You can be definitely be a better person than this.

Somehow managed to go out one-on-one with my crush the other day but didn't have the balls to confess to her (came reeeaally close to doing so though).

Thinking if I should try for a second time?...

Sometimes I wish my (mutual) crush will ask me out quick so that guy friends will stop advancing their moves on me. And so that I can tell between the real friends who treat me nice cos they think imma great friend and friends who have girlfriend-zoned me. I think guys make really awesome friends but sometimes they are so confusing that it scares me. ),:

I am an evergreen. I have been chatting a lot with this guy in my course recently. Secretly I hoped that he may fall in love with me one day just to prove that it is possible for someone to love me. But at the bottom of my heart, I know that I would never love him back. Unknowingly I am turning into an evil bitch who I have always hated.

They say you can easily see people having sex in the hostels. Is it true? If it is, then I'm surprised by it. Here I thought hostel life is about friendship and bonding, not the gossip girl scenario.

after , would like to ask girls: how many of you actually think that the guy should be the one taking initiative? oh, come on, why can't it be girls making the first move?

The hard truth of an NUS life for me is this... 

Men cheat. Women cheat. I've been on an receiving end all the time. 

It's only one year later after graduation, that I realise that I was a deeply needy person back then - that caused all this to happen. 

It's alright. I don't pretty much give a damn about relationships anymore. 

Truth be told ever since I graduated from NUS, I haven't looked back all the relationships that I've been cheated of. 

It still hurts for sure, but that's the past. It's a learning process and I'm happily being who I am... 

... a player.

just curious: how many of you do household chores for your mom?

It saddens me whenever I read of comments describing LGBT as lifestyles or mere values.

There is this part of me that want to scream out at these people; You don’t know how many sleepless nights I spend crying and praying that I could be straight. Praying that I would like boobs. Forcing myself to look at images of hot girls just so that somehow, I would start to find them hot. I felt dirty and was disgusted with myself whenever I was having an episode of ‘homosexual tendencies’. 

I grew up expecting to lead a normal life - school, work, wife, children, grandchildren, death. Gays were wrong, dirty and intertwined with HIV. I could never be like them. I had to be straight. There was no other choice. 

I forced myself to somehow, miraculously, crush on a girl. It did help that she made the first move. It didn’t feel right though. There was zero sexual or physical attraction, no matter how hard I tried. 

Still, I couldn’t even entertain the thought that I could, in my wildest imagination, be gay. It was simply a phrase that refused to fade away.

It took me months after my twentieth birthday that I finally acquiesced that I would never be able to have sex with girls. To have kids. To lead a normal, traditional and ideal life that everyone seemed to be able to lead. I was, to the very least, disappointed. 

Maybe being LGBT is a choice. Maybe there are some individuals that would rather be discriminated and risk being kicked out of the family. Maybe they would rather be denied the ability to have your lifelong partner visit you when you are in the ICU. It may very well sound like an appealing lifestyle. But certainly not for me. 

-
 
Sometimes all you need is to just cry to let everything out, but because you don't want others to worry, you put on a facade. Maybe that's you at your strongest; controlling your emotions so that you don't hurt everyone else around you because you're hurt. But sometimes, all you wish for is for someone to hold you as you cry.

You never know what people are hiding behind what they present to you. But you might actually unknowingly brighten up their day by just being there :)

Things just seemed to have turned out so different for me and I'm so tired of everything. Why did things turn out the way they did? Perhaps if given the chance, I would have wanted something rather different for myself, to have led a different path, to be someone different, to be just a little more like everyone else, to be understood, to be able to get along more with people. I didn't think I was worthy, able to give, to be accepted. I was hesitant. Yet, ultimately I wanted to give myself a chance and looked at where that got me to. Hope is such a b****. Exams are over but life isn't.

Hello, I'm a girl. All along I thought guys should be the one to take initiative in a relationship but after reading NUSWhispers I changed my mind. I'm not too sure what to do though, any advice on what I can do to 'take initiative' on a guy friend? Honest advices please!

So I'm an evergreen that's about to matriculate this year and I just want to rant about the crappy love life I've had.

For starters, I had a crush on this girl back in Secondary school but I ended up being in the bro-zoned. Its a painful feeling to like somebody and still love them even after they have found a bf/gf. Its also awkward when you want them to be happy with the partner they are with now but at the same time, you wish the two of you were together.

And then there's life in JC. I started to fall for this girl who to me is the most innocent girl I've ever met. We started to hang out often and just before enlisting, I pluck up all the courage I had in me to confess my feelings to her. But alas she wasn't ready. We continue to chat and meet during my time in NS but we slowly drifted apart. Then one day while we were hanging out, I gave her a valentine's day gift and though she accepted it. She kept insisting to not wait for her and move on.

Deep down, I know something was off and what I heard next shattered my heart. She found a bf while in NUS. Maybe the guy is better than me, maybe she deserved someone better unlike me. But courting her for almost 3-4 years just to end like that totally ruined me. Went into a deep depression and some major changes in life including leaving my religion. Even till today I sometimes wonder if I will ever meet someone like her ever again.

I still talk to her every now and then. But after all this, I kind of lost all hope of ever meeting that special someone. She was the best chance I had and to me, I always felt as if I had met that special someone. Even though she's no longer studying in NUS, I sometimes wonder whenever I pass by the halls if she was ever sitting at the table studying together with him.

I know people always say that there are plenty of fishes in the ocean. But she's one of a kind.

Well, all I can say now is, to quote from wicked, who can say if I have been changed for the better, but because I knew you, I have been changed for good.

I am a girl. So lately for the past months, I got to know 2 guys who are good friends, guy A and guy B. we all knew each other from a mod. I hit off well with guy A more and slowly I develop feelings for him. I thought so likewise that he felt the same for me cos we were v v close.  However I was devastated lately when I found out he was already attached to another girl on a LDR and he came clean to me. I felt so cheated and led on, moreover he insisted on wanting to stay close to me, and even admitted he got some feelings for me a few weeks ago. Guy B on the other end, is a very upright, not too bad looking, really humorous and nice guy to me. Although I did not spend as much time with him compared to Guy A, lately he has did some nice stuff for me and also admitted to liking me. He did not once attempted to sabotage my feelings for Guy A and seems to have always been on a lookout for me and waiting for me. Im so lost and confused now. What should I do? can someone with similar experiences advise me on this situation?
-
 
Great... Is that how other people perceive guys from engineering and computing? Desperate people who just want to get into others' pants? I am sorry, but I feel quite disheartened on this matter.

I am a guy who is not interested in a relationship, because of a bad one (with a lady) around a year back. I like being nice to people, doing nice things to and for them, and I was taught by an important figure in my life to always be nice and friendly towards ladies. I find them more approachable than guys, because I connect better with ladies than with guys (I just don't get what's the deal with guys around me always talking about grades,homework, their social life, etc.). As such, I tend to be more open towards ladies, without the intention of getting into a relationship, nor into their pants. I tend to do random stuff for others, such as getting coffee in the middle of the night for some people I don't even know that well (yes, you now know who's posting this). I don't need a reason to do stuff like that, but I do see reasons why I don't need to do stuff like that, reasons which I tend to ignore.

Point of the matter is, if you feel uncomfortable that a guy is being overly-kind or friendly to you, just tell us. It is very hurtful that, if we are doing something in our nature, and all you interpret is that we are doing things with various motivations,dubious ones at that. While it does hold true that many people nowadays do things with practical motivations, it does not necessarily mean that everyone does that. Some of us just see others as simply friendly next-door neighbours, that is all.

Odd guys such as myself, we do exist. We want to be, and act on our notion to be nice to others. Easiest, most direct way is to talk to us about it, face-to-face, and read our replies, body language and all. If not, if you keep posting about how desperate guys from my faculty (engin) are, you are being extremely hurtful.

Majority of romantic confessions seem to be from guys, so I guess I'll be the odd one out?

There's this guy friend I know from JC who I've been relatively good friends with. I've always been platonically fond of him, though I've never harboured romantic feelings for him until last year. We didn't keep in touch for half a year and when we began to again, I also started to see him in a different light. 

For the longest time, I thought they were because he was always such a sweetheart to me and that I was over-reciprocating his kindness, or that it was the guilt I felt for being such an asshat to him previously. It wasn't until exchange last month that I realised I had probably been suppressing my feelings all this time. I really miss(ed?) him and would always wait for him to call me yet not initiate the call cos I was afraid he would be too busy. *self-berates at wimpyness* Every guy I now meet, I instinctively compare them to him (yes, even the charismatic young men of foreign blood who ace the game of chivalry). For some queer, impossible reason, no one is as kind, gentle, patient, trustworthy and can make me feel as safe as he does. 

I keep wondering what it'll be like to be in a relationship with him, but my practicality (or cynicism, if you wish) always project a dead end. Maybe it's because I feel that we communicate differently and have different faiths. And perhaps also that I fear my feelings wouldn't be reciprocated. Any how, it's a friendship I fear very much to lose should things not work out between us if we did get to that stage. 

This feels like such a trivial issue that I should let time dismiss out of my life. But as of now it feels like he'll never stop being an important person in my life. Advice, NUSWhisperers?

When it comes to relationships people are always so scared of the what-if’s that they forget the what-is. They spend so much time thinking, ‘What if I get hurt?’ and ‘What if it doesn’t work out?’ that they stop thinking about that things that are already real. They forget the feeling they get when the person they love walks into the room and the excitement that rushes through them when the phone rings because it might be the person they are waiting to hear from. Never let the fear of what-if stop you from letting yourself take a chance on love…because “what if” this is the person you’re destined to spend the rest of your life with?

Since we are on the topic of LGBT, I shall share my experience on gays and lesbians as well. 

Before you think that I am gay, no I'm just a straight male. In fact, like a lot of us, I had the impression that gays were just "going through a phase" and often made fun and ridicule them. 

It wasn't until I found out that a close friend of mine was gay. I was initially quite shocked and surprised. A friend of more than 10 years and yet I had no inkling? I went to read up on it and soon realized my deep misunderstanding. Upon thinking back on my past actions and words, I cringed and immediately called my friend to apologize. I guess people just don't really care until it hits them close. 

All i want to say is, the change will come, albeit rather slowly. 
Hang in there my friends!

Sincerely, 
Your straight friend. 
-
 
Just because you guys/girls met a minority of desperate guys from computing/engine, it does not mean that ALL guys from these facs are desperate. There will always be desperate guys AND girls in all faculties. Stop judging people based on their faculties when you clearly have not met the majority of the people there

CC:   

 You went read up and still think that it is a phase and you expect a change will come for your friend? Wait I'm really confused now... I'm pretty sure that it's not a phase for many people including me. There is something called Kinsey scale and I am currently 5.5/6. 

Still, I think people care too much about sexualites nowadays. Maybe because it is a basic human needs, to love and to copulate?
-
 
I used to have an FWB and I was so guilty, not because I was attached, I wasn't, but because all my life, I've always believed that intimacy should be between proper couples, regardless of gender. Later when I started to like him, I was so afraid and called the benefits off. Even now, I still have an some feelings for him and I always think about him, so much so that I have been unable to start any relationships with other wonderful people. I wonder if other people in previous FWBs have experienced this. How do you move on? Does time really solve everything? It has been 3 years since our last contact and I still remember the feeling I get when I'm with him.
-
 
To , same bro. My family member passed away during mid terms and I swear it is the worst feeling on earth. I almost wanted to take LOA for the semester. Couldn't study, couldn't sleep...yes time will pass but i guess we will never stop thinking of what we could have done more...

Treasure your family my NUS friends.

I've been wanting to tell this girl how i feel for a long while now but i'm already 4 years too late. And after reading those whispers here of guys not having the guts to tell the girl how they feel, i hope you guys can get the motivation to do so and not make the same mistake i made after hearing my story.

First and foremost, back in JC days, i was failing at my subject combi so bad i wanted to just give up. The jump from secondary school to JC was too huge for me to the point that I didnt care about the numerous U grades i got for exams and had several meet the parents sessions to talk about my grades. This was especially so for my H1 subject as i've held the record for the lowest marks to be given out for the paper for prelims.

Additionally, i was an evergreen myself. Didn't have much contact with the female kind and if i did, i'd find myself in awkward silence situations with them. It was not until a certain subject teacher paired me up with one of my female classmates for a whole term that i got to interact with, lets call her Kathrine. Kathrine wasn't your typical good-looking girl either. She was just above average in looks, the kind where i knew there were several guys in school who eye candied her but not too many to the point she became popular. She was gentle at heart and had a very pleasant character. Her personality was also her charm. But what set her apart from other girls was that she had a strong faith in her religion. She would care for her friends as though it was her own siblings.

She soon learned that i was failing badly at my H1 subject and decided to tutor me at it. She would make hand written notes, lend me her books and even took time out to personally explain to me the concepts of the subject which i couldn't comprehend. We soon found ourselves skipping lectures and remedial classes just to get together to have a meal outside school and went out to study together. As A'level was fast approaching, our study "dates" (if i may call it that) became more and more and to the point my friends thought we were an item. A'level came and my only motivation to do well and not give up (as i mentioned in earlier paragraphs) was so that i could be in the same uni as Kathrine so that i can see her time to time in school. Results day arrived and both of us got into NUS.

But NS was in for me as she entered her first year. We would still hang out on occasions and jio each other out to celebrate our birthdays. But i could feel we were drifting apart because we're not able to see each other often. I could feel that she has been waiting for me but I've still hadn't told her how i felt. I really wanted to but the only factor stopping me was that we have opposing faiths. I knew her family couldn't accept me nor my family could accept her. She told me once before that "don't start something you cannot end well" and sooner than you can know it, our texts while i was in camp was getting less frequent and it would stop for months. We just stop talking.

I matriculated into NUS and promised myself to turn over a new leaf. To not be the socially awkward guy around girls and found myself to go out on several dates (some of them are blind dates while others are dates which my friends set up for me) with several other girls (more than 10), trying to find someone who is on par with Kathrine. To this day, no one i went out with was remotely good as her and i turned those girls down as the dates were over as i didnt want to play with their hearts. To this day, i'm still an evergreen. I would see Kathrine in school once in awhile and my heart would still skip a beat for you. I miss you, i really do.

So to the guys out there who still haven't confessed their feelings to that special someone. Dont make the same mistake as i did. Just go, don't scared.

As another semester draws to a close, people are confessing their crushes on the Internet. 

My finals ended yesterday. I'm waiting for someone to confess that he has been harbouring a crush on me, in person.
-
 
Is it just me, or do others also have the thought that guys spend a lot of effort on themselves to attract attention from girls? Guys go to the gym to train, spend money on protein powder and supplements to buff up, doll themselves up with nice hair and tight clothes to look physically appealing. 

It is sometimes very tiring to do all these. But what to do? Appearance seems more important than personality and attitude.
-
 
You didn't have to go crazy at me when my boyfriend rejected you. If I never existed, you wouldn't have been his type anyway. You should probably understand that.
-
 
Although I've been assuring my girlfriend that it's alright that she chose to accept the job offer for the same company that I am about to work at, a part of me does not want her to take up that offer. I know this might be selfish but I'm just hoping that she can meet a different group of friends and colleagues. Unlike school when it's possible to make friends easily even when we are taking similar modules, I'm just not sure if it will be the same at our workplace. 
-
 
Been talking with this girl whom i adore quite frequently, we really hit it off and she initiates conversations as well. problem is shes really busy and also not looking for a relationship at the moment. Should i stick around? 
-
 
 why are you just... waiting? what if he never does anything? it's the 21st century, go and get him! unless you were planning to reject him, in which case, uh... don't just sit around waiting to break his heart, please.

I find myself daydreaming about joining the navy as an engineer and living an exciting life out at sea. I know the reality may be quite different (I'm a girl and not a very fit one at that) but I keep thinking about it. Is it even a viable option or just a silly notion. 
-
 
I am completely and hopelessly in love with this girl. Problem is, she has a boyfriend. And oh yeah, I don't think she knows I exist. Please tell me I'm not a creep and stalker and others nurse hopeless crushes as well while conducting outstanding research on their hopeless crushes like me . For e.g. I just figured out which unit in army her boyfriend was in. Waayyy cooler than mine 
-
 
Question for girls: is it weird or creepy if a guy you don't know adds you up on facebook and messages you in an attempt to know you more?

To  Sometimes it is just hard, especially when you got distanced for unknown reasons (that may or may not exist at all). It feels awkward and hard at the same time, not being able to find the chance and the courage to ask. I know because it happened to me a year ago, suddenly, when 2 years ago we were fine and now we're both graduating and still remain distant. 
-
 
I'm bored of my boyfriend. We've been together for 3 years now and I don't think I love him anymore. We are going on a grad trip together with a group of mutual friends, one of whom is a girl I think I've fallen in love with. I don't know how to play this right. Should I break up with him before we go, and be awkward around each other during the trip (because at least I can pursue this girl I like), or should I suck it up and survive this trip with him, hoping maybe we can work things out? Or maybe I should plan a little threesome surprise during the trip then if the girl and I hit it off, I can break it off after. At least he would have had a good consolation, no? 

Any other ideas? Basically I don't want to cheat on him.
-
 
Just want to know. Do guys mind a girl with a babyface? Personality-wise, I guess I am an average girl, just a little bit tomboy.

I am an evergreen Masters student who is socially awkward. I've been asking some of my friends for advice on girls but everyone seems to give a different opinion on whatever issue i bring up. For example, everyone gives a different idea when it comes to picking up girls, or different opinions on where is the best place to approach girls. Is there like some sort of manual that i can read to learn these things? Also if there are any girls out there who don't mind a nerdy, marvel fan, i am single. =D
-
 
I noticed that in response to people commenting that they feel lonely, the usual advice is to go "ask people out". Of course, there's an element of truth but does anyone felt even more lonely after hanging out with others? I asked people out in previous holidays and after the day, I felt really drained but not happy. Generally, when asking people out, the activities chosen aren't something that I would like, and it make me feel rather...unmotivated. Often, I feel that I really need to scrutinize people before asking them out so I don't make myself feel worse when my intention was to have fun.
-
 
I'm a guy and I like this girl. However the problem is I don't know how will the girl perceive me as I feel somewhat inferior. With her 'credentials', she should deserve a boyfriend that is better? She is the kind that most guys would fall for, or at least I do. As a guy, I feel that I need to give her a sense of protection and security, so I am just seeking my views here to see what other guys think. To the girls, will you fall for a guy if you are 'better' than them?
-
 
Whether you are a guy or a girl, would you date someone from SMU? It seems scary that whoever you like from SMU has so many more good-looking and well-connected options.

Trying to convince yourself that you should continue to study hard due to your love for your major because in reality, your grades just can't be pulled up anymore.

Why do so many people in NUS have fwbs and casual sex partners? And multiple ones simultaneously. And without telling your other partners. Does sex and trust mean anything to these people? I hope most of you guys know that even oral sex spreads stds  (trust me, many people don't know)

If having girlfriend --> having a girlfriend who cheats, and
having a girlfriend who cheats < being alone, then
having girlfriend < being alone.

It's mathematical.

You're welcome.

 Chances are the girl doesn't like you in that way. I'm sorry to admit that I myself is a bit like the girl you mentioned, so I think I can understand her. She is trying to treat you like her normal friends when she asked you out to study with her, or texting you occasionally, but it got a bit awkward when you keep asking her out for "dates". I myself can't really reject people, so I think the girl you mentioned is also trying to avoid giving you direct answers, hoping you can get that "she's not interested in you in that way" by yourself.
You should just move on and stop messaging her so often. If you keep on asking her out, at one point she will probably get really annoyed and ignore all your messages. And who knows, maybe if you become less "aggressive", she might feel more comfortable around you, and things can develop from there.

Referring to  - It's precisely because I don't want to come off as creepy that I've never told any girls about "wardrobe malfunctions" they've had before. Especially since the stigma of being a creep/sexual predator is greater than ever nowadays, with social media and all. It ends up being safer for the guy to just turn around, walk away and pretend you didn't see anything rather than run the risk of becoming a social pariah/accused of sexual harassment because you were concerned for someone else.

It's sad when the girl you like is so much closer to other guys and you see them texting her but when you text her all you get are lukewarm responses :(

Ever since that incident, I became weird. I started looking at guys from a different perspective. I lost interest in women. And this happened when I was in P4. A senior of mine whom I don't know started touching and squeezing my butt while I was peeing. When he discovered I was the wrong person, he quickly said sorry and left. But that left a huge impact on me. 

I feel disgusted about myself. What have I become? But I cannot help it. I just can't resist the desire.

I met this girl in a module. We texted and stuff and I eventually told her that I like her. She said 'let me know you better first'. We continued to text every now and then, mostly initiated by me - though she does initiate once in a while. However, she likes to disappear half way while texting reappearing hours later - very abruptly.

I asked her out for dinner on 3 occasions, all of them rejected as she already had plans. I tried a 4th time and failed. Though a few days after my 4th attempt, she asked me out to study for the finals (We were from different majors). My hopes were raised and the study together went quite well. I casually remarked that we should hang out during the holidays and she said ok.

Now it is the holiday, and I asked her out. She seemed slightly reluctant and hesitant. This is very evident from her 'disappearing' act whenever I ask her if she is free next week and stuff. We could text quite comfortably until I bring up such issues and she would disappear. Though she eventually said ok, and disappeared again when I discussed the details about the date.

I really cant read her. Is she simply too polite to reject me? She does not seem to show that enthusiasm. Does she see me simply as a friend? She already know of my interest in her. If she wasn't interested, why would she initiate conversation with me through text, albeit occasionally. Why would she ask me out to study together. I am an evergreen, and am really confused.

As an NSF about to ORD and enter NUS Biz next Aug, is there any advice from any current students on how I should spend my time from now till then? Any advice given would be deeply appreciated.
-
 
The less time you spend hanging out with your friends, the more time you have to study.

The more time you have to study, the better understanding and grades you get.

The better grades you get, the more your friends will ask you to hang out to help with work

Therefore, the less you hang out with them, the more you hang out with them.

 I'm the person who wrote . 

I realised that my decision seems to change even on a daily basis, depending on my mood. If something is going my way, or I had a happy time, I wouldn't mind doing so (talking to her).

However, if I'm feeling insecure (I do feel it quite often, although I've toned it down in terms of my responses) or I'm having a rough day, I would be very critical and justify my rude response. So I end up not doing anything at all, but this issue keeps coming to be and I'm not sure what to make of it.
-
 
to , personally i think that person is making use of you as a study buddy and chat buddy. whether you view it as a bad thing or not i shall leave it to your own perspective. however, if you were to ask me, i guess it would be good to remain friends with her for now and what not. be the nice guy a girl needs or wants in her life.

There is this girl I like since long ago. I say I've forgotten about her, but I'd be lying. I say I love her, but I cannot really be too sure. For many many reasons. After so long of not being able to get together with this girl, and convinced somehow that all the other girls don't count, I was pretty much left with the thought that perhaps nothing counts. No relationship is going to turn out. And true enough, none did. I don't see relationships and love as primarily sexual.

But my coping mechanism for the lack of it is. I told myself, just pleasure. Seek pleasure. Because nothing will last anyway. I'm ashamed to say (and it's also my greatest regret) for going to prostitutes. I've since stopped. Because the depth of my desperation irks me so much. This desperation forces difficult questions on me too. If I'm so unsuccessful in getting with a girl then perhaps I'm made for guys, no? And trust me I've tried. But it is only sexual. There is no love. And ironically it takes a gay encounter to tell me I'm not gay. 

Looking back, it just pains me to know that my desperation is so disgustingly deep, that even if this girl that I like since a long time ago were to tell me that she wants a relationship with me, I think I owe it to myself and to her to say no. Because I'll always be more fucked up than her, plenty more fucked up than her. Recently she shared that the next time I hear from her, I'll be hearing wedding news. I'm so happy for her blessedness, but I cannot help feeling so bitter, either. 

They say good things are worth waiting for. I agree. Just make sure you are worthy yourself through the wait.

My girlfriend broke up with me last night. She confess to me that she could not forget about her ex and wants to patch back with him. Thing is, the three of us are in the same school and I am contemplating whether to attend this year's commencement as I feel awkward to see her and him as well as her parents...
-
 
Anyone else feels the same way? For someone who does not have much friends, the holidays makes you feel depressed for no reason...nothing else to study, nothing else to aim for, no more classes means no more meeting up with the regular people (even if they were not close but at least there were people to talk to)...after hanging on for the whole semester, the holidays come and the depressed side in you comes out too...

To  i've waited awhile to get this off my chest, and my darkest secret is that i masturbate too. What makes it even worse is that i'm an active church leader. Often i wonder if masturbation is a sin, or whether its simply another need. And fact is, im often riddled with guilt when i walk through church doors knowing that i just jerked off last night. Or when the pastor touches on themes like holiness. But behind my room doors, private browser comes on and i come on too... Just cant help it man.

This may be a bit hypocritical, since i didnt tell anyone, but if you havent done so already, maybe you should let your bf know? If he is a religious guy, he would know the constant struggle with sexual purity that all guys face, and would emphatise. 

P.S. If by any any slim chance you break up, i hope we find each other to 'help' one another out ;)

To 
You probably already have an answer deep down on what you want to do with your situation but here's my 2 cents worth. 

I used to have a guy friend from JC (girl here) and when I was crushing on him very badly, I found myself in a similar situation as you. Basically, I seemed to be the only one active in our friendship. If I don't contact him, we can go half a year without talking kind of thing. It had gotten to the point when I wondered why bother? and then time passed and we graduated. After I got over my bout of unrequited love though, I decided that some friendships were worth keeping. I messaged him regularly but this time instead of playing the nice person and worrying about his opinion of me, I was quite honest about what I thought. When the opportunity arose, I also talked to him about his past behavior which frustrated me. Turns out, he was plain clueless. Now, we managed to salvage our friendship and on occasion, he's the one to initiate contact and even cheer me on during my exams. (No we're not in a r/s. He's just a really good friend. We've talked about it and he decided not to pursue one so there.)

In your case, my advice to you then would be, assuming you still want to be friends with her, to drop the passive aggressiveness. If you find her behavior to be annoying or worse hurtful, talk to her straight about it but not in a confrontational way. Sometimes you might have to find or create an opportunity in between your friendly banter to do so. If she actually treats you as a friend, she might stick on and return your honesty. From there, adjust and your friendship might turn out for the better :D

Being a psychology major is pretty 'exciting' too. Not only do I get the oh-so-cliche "omg does that mean you can read my mind? Later you know all my secrets :O" talk every time you introduce your course to someone new, I also have to constantly assure my mum that YES I might need to work with mentally ill patients in the future but NO I won't become mentally ill and NO prison counselling is not the only thing I can do in the future.

It's hard being a clinically depressed person. You try to get by each day using what little power you have, wishing that the antidepressants you've been regularly taking would work for once. You know the world is a bad place and you begin to shut yourself. When someone did come along, you took a gamble to trust that person with some of the things you had always been hiding alone... only to find out that the thing that drove the person was just mere curiosity and nothing else. I don't know how to trust people anymore.

This semester, I learned that there is no such thing as a free lunch. 

There are only two reasons when people of the opposite gender are nice to you: to make use of you for their own benefits (to get assignment answers etc), or they want to be more than just friends with you. I defended from the former, but for the latter, I just let my guard down and we'd both be hurt later. 

This has happened one too many times. I'm now confused as to how I should treat the people around me. Is it really possible to find friends who are genuinely nice? 
-
 
To 
I had similar encounter too. But it was during my army days. I don't know about you but I was at my friend's party, I was everyone was so damn drunk and I fell asleep in the toilet. I get how you feel man. And that guy who did that to me, has a girlfriend. How screwed up is this world? 
-
 
to 
I feel you man... I used to have a close friend and we used to confide in each other, but after a while I've noticed that all she does is to comment "Sigh, but what can you do about it..." and I would feel kinda disappointed since I'm hoping to hear a different perspective on the issue/something besides that same old comment
After some time I realise that maybe she just takes it that I just wanna rant, and it'd be nice to have someone who'd just listen to me rant about my troubles, while my take on the issue is that I'd wanna hear her opinion about the issue...sometimes it isn't always clear if she's not listening in what you say or she's just there to lend a ear or she simply don't know what to say...
Maybe it's due to different personalities that resulted in both of you drifting apart...
Maybe she's afraid that she has fallen for you that she decided to distance herself away from you/disappear...
Whatever the reason, i can tell that you still care about the friendship, but since i don't know if she still care about the friendship, i also dunno what to do... 
it depends on whether she still care...

There are many nights in when I feel so overwhelmed by amount of work to be done, anxiety from criticisms, self doubt, lack of company (everyone seems to be so busy with their own things) that I just cry myself to sleep. I wish to take a gap year, but would I still have the momentum to return to uni to complete my final year after a long break? Would anything change at all :(

I used to know a girl of a significant age gap in the university. She knows I liked her, but she said she was attached to another girl. I accepted that and wanted to stay as a friend to her. She agreed in theory.

As a friend would, I would sometimes check on how they are doing through some texts (it's just awfully more convenient and less intrusive than calls or less cumbersome than mail). I couldn't fathom what was going on until someone called me out and told me the following:

"You should be careful about how you treat the people around you. Your messaging may be inappropriate."

Only then did I realise I could have been backstabbed and lied to really terribly by you. Whatever you did, I cannot forget. Forgive? I guess I could.

I know it'll be hard for you to read this, but should you read this, I am still willing to be the friend of the girl who I once knew. Illusions on who someone can be, but aren't are incredibly difficult to shatter.

But I don't yearn to love for now. It's something difficult for me. I'll remember you for all the nice things you tried to do for me, even if you eventually went down a dark path and sent a few flying daggers into my heart.

All the best for your upcoming bright future. Enjoy the vast lands outside of Singapore. You're smart, you know it, and you certainly know how to take advantage of the world out there for enjoyment and learning.

That girl I once knew, I cannot forget. It hurts, but I know nothing on removing these daggers of pain.

It's hard being a closeted lesbian in sg, and especially in nus. And even worse when you've parents who are so conservative they won't let you go out at night. It's hard to meet people who are similarly inclined when I can't even go to nightclubs and such. I feel terribly lonely everyday and it doesn't help that I've no one to talk to,i don't have any close friends. I end up keeping everything to myself and I feel like I'm reaching a breaking point. I've not dated anyone for the past 21 years and I really want to know how it's like to be loved. I'm graduating soon and life is looking bleak.

My girlfriend recently pointed out to me that I almost never looked at girls, only guys. This was the case even when she first know me in Year 1. Upon closer observation, this is really true...

Does that imply I have latent gay tendencies?

I do feel extremely lonely sometimes. My friends are all attached and slowly I feel myself not being a part of their lives much. My family isn't a place of welcome either. I wish I could have someone to talk to but I sometimes don't feel like I have the right to burden my friends with this because other than the fact that I'm lonely, I'm pretty much satisfied with everything else in my life. I have a good cap, secured a job with a good pay, have lots of friends to hang out with but not as close as id like. I know people out there have worse problems than me. But I just don't feel like I would really matter in anyone's life at all. Sometimes I wonder, whats the point of working so hard for myself? I wish there could be more to life. It gets really depressing sometimes to feel so lonely.

I have depression for the last 6 years and I am currently on medication. I dare not tell my family and only a handful of friends know. Uni has been the toughest to manage my condition. Exams are the worst. I feel isolated and the anxiety eats at me. Some days I can't even get out of bed. Today was one of them.

I used to have a really good female friend (I'm a guy). We used to hang out together for meals and study in year 1. Some personality differences created a friction between us, and we didn't talk for most of our year 2, but at the end we began talking and hanging out again. However, the time spent apart made me re-evaluate my own opinion of her, and friends in general. 

I try to listen to my friends needs and rants and offer advice if needed (not just her). Of course, when she had problems she confided in me and for some I helped her if needed. However, she didn't help me with my problems when I confided to her. She brushed off my problems, telling me to "get over it". Once, when I broke up with my girlfriend, I confided to her that I was upset about it and she told me-get over it. There were some other problems too and she often told me to deal with it in the same way. I used to take it lightly before our misunderstanding but after that, I began to be more critical of her attitude to our friendship. I felt hurt when she ignored/forgotten my birthday and often did a "disappearing act". She may ask for help on something, and we would talk about it, then afterwards she would stop responding for a while (weeks). 

The last straw came when she asked about my mid-terms, a full WHOLE MONTH after it ended. I was extremely upset and left a rude message to her. Although I didn't explicitly say "let's stop being friends", but I guess she saw it that way, and at the moment I was fine with it.

5 months on, I feel uncertain about my action of being rude to her. I knew why I was rude to her as I felt that she didn't respond to my emotional needs, as I did for hers. However, I'll admit she isn't a bad person, as my secrets remained "secret with her". I'll respect that she didn't betray me on that. I'm not too sure now if my expectations of her as a friend were too unrealistic. Should I have simply expected nothing in return from helping her? I feel that I'm selfish here, but yet I also feel I can't have no expectations either. I'm not sure whether I should contact her to repair the friendship, and what to say if I do contact her

To , I turned 23 this year and never had any boyfriend all my life. You are not the only one. I think you are just confused now, but don't let yourself become more confused by believing what your friends said. Now that I am graduating, my chances of getting boyfriend in uni is diminishing. I am not expecting myself to get married because I am such socially awkward person that I will not be able to get close enough to any guy to verify if i truly like him.

There is this girl I share a political science module with. She dresses rather guy-ishly and during the sem, she even had a buzzcut. And that looks kinda hot. Like I have no desire to start a romantic relationship with someone my parents would disapprove of (I'm a girl) but I can't help wanting to pin her to the wall and snog every time I see her.

I admit that when I first agreed to date you, I was still not sure about you. But now that I am, I'm going to work harder at this relationship. I'm still scared that you'll say 'it's over', but that's love right? It makes you vulnerable. But when you find something worth fighting for, you fight for it. 
-
 
Out of pure coincidence, I’ve been taking the same political science modules as my crush every semester. I don’t know her personally, but I find her adorable and her awkward actions only make her even more appealing to me. I want to approach her but she’s always with a friend who takes the same modules every semester…

I'm confused about my sexuality. Don't get me wrong, I do get attracted to guys (I'm a girl) but I've never really had a boyfriend and I'm turning 21 in a month. 

The past few years has been different and I feel more attracted to girls. I'm still attracted to guys but the feeling of attraction towards girls is different. 

I've never had a girlfriend either. My friends usually say, "girls who like girls just cannot find a boyfriend." Is it true? My friends usually says that people who like their own gender disgust them and if I do like someone of the same sex, I don't think I can be friends with them again :(

I mean, I feel sexually attracted to girls. How do I approach this?!

Feels like I screwed up my second Sem. Though I still have my last paper. I feel a bit bad but really, I don't seem to have any damn motivation to chiong. Oh but this doesn't mean I've given up.

Everyone fights a different battle. Some good, some... Relatively not so good. Some people have family problems, while some others are troubled over their CAP. Many others fret over relationship problems, while some others have trouble fighting their inner demons. 

Now, I really hope that your days will brighten up,yes? No matter how tough things get, hang in there, and look up, look around. There is always hope. Hang in there.

My friend for whom I wasn't around the club for when you needed support, I am sorry. I am happy for you, and your situation now. I am no longer needed, nor as welcome. All the best.

To: 

There really isn't a need to force-fit yourself into any particular category. Sexuality is a spectrum, and something that's fluid, which would require an infinite number of labels to qualify. 

On that note, you are not alone. I'm sure many others, myself included, don't quite know what to feel about our sexuality at some point. It might not feel normal, but really, there is no "normal". You are the way you are, and things will be that way regardless of whether you like it or not. So, i think it would help to just accept things the way they are, and not feel bothered by them.

Personally, I've been through various phases. I remember I felt quite repulsed by the idea of homosexuality when I was little (perhaps reinforced by the stigma), and only felt attracted to girls. Years later, I eventually got a girlfriend, but the relationship didn't last long. I felt terrible at the time when I found out she left me for her ex. 

I haven't had a partner since, and don't feel particularly attracted to any particular sex. Having a romantic relationship would be great, but like yourself, I'm not entirely sure sexual attraction should come with it. I can't quite picture having sex with my future partner, only romantic feelings makes more sense.

So, yeah, there's no real answer I guess. You're not alone for sure, and let's just accept things the way they are and see how things turn out in the future.

<<  I am a girl in a male dominated faculty and still evergreen even after a few semesters. I admit that i am rather socially awkward. What do guys actually look for in a girl?

Ps looks-wise i am considered average/a little above average.>>

Its a complex formula guys use to judge girls. Might as well don't mention, cos i dunno what it is exactly. Definitely to add points, decent physical appearance, not super lazy, potential family member, loyal & intellectual (i dun mean CAP 5.0 here, just dun talk like a bi*ch). They could cross compensate each other, resulting in an overall good chemistry.

Personally, im very accommodating to people's shortcomings. I don't think i have high expectations for a gf, am almost open to any girl.

Im evergreen (no phd in r/s, freshman in some engineering), so pardon me if my views contrast with yours. On the sidenote, I will feel damn embarrassed if people know im saying all this, gd that i can stay anonymous here:)

Good luck!

To make a long story short, I've angered the family of my boyfriend by unintentionally causing him emotional trauma several times. Because of this we broke up, but a few months later we worked things out and secretly got back together, and things have been great ever since. However, maintaining such secrecy cannot go on indefinitely, and our relationship has to come out into the open eventually, especially if we want to start living together or get married. I'm afraid of the consequences of coming clean. What should I do?
-
 
I've really liked this girl for two years now, and would do anything and everything for her. I've imagined doing everything romantic with her. Problem is, she has a boyfriend.. and I don't want to make the first move for fear of damaging our relationship. At least I won't have to see her when I graduate :)

Frankly i get a bit annoyed when pple say "huh??? you havent clubbed in HOW LONG? you got clubber face leh" or like "huh?? you dont stay hall? you got the hall face!!!"and then proceed to be in a state of disbelief lol. (this has happened more than once alrdy n idk how to respond??) 

what does this even mean, the 'clubber face' or 'hall face'. and it doesnt matter right! sigh =.=

I stare at the confession page for half an hour, but have absolutely no idea how to pen the confession. I realised I have not got over the dark past at all. It has been a few years, and the memories of the past continue their torment.

I envy the guys who have to contend with break-ups: at least you fell in love before. Meet one who has had no chance at all of understanding what love is. I tried.

I envy the girls who say they're looking for guys. They're brave. Unlike me, a scarred self who does not even dare look at someone in the eye too long for I fear liking someone and then getting a dream shattered.

I envy the ones who dare to write a confession even in the face of trolls. Your stories have given me hope that I am not alone.

Yet I stare at the page once again, and I realised I have confessed essentially nothing. I lack the bravery to pen any message.

But I know if I should fall, I gain the pity of no one. I don't want to be pitied. I want to overcome the haunting memories and be strong again, ready to take on the world once again.

I must learn how to forget. Then I can return stronger, having wiped out of existence those that don't deserve any space. And I must learn how to not feel hurt.

 you only have one life. don't waste your life away waiting for such a girl. I can tell you that once the girl enjoyed her "grand wedding", she will be too tired to do it with you. Plus, the first time will be the worst time and she will probably stop doing it altogether out of fear of pain and it's not enjoyable for her. Instead, spend your time finding a girl who research and understand how to please a guy. These girls are way better in treating their man. Worst come to worst, visit an FL instead of waiting and waiting. Condoms , though not perfect, are very effective at preventing STD / HIVs. Do not waste your time. Start doing it today.

P.S: If you think I'm a troll, go ahead and stay with your girlfriend. Tell us what happen when you are married to her in probably 5 - 6 years.

Just want to rant. I am a male. I see myself as an individual with high libido. I yearn for the pleasure that one can derive from sex and yet, I am holding myself back because of my ideals and commitment. I am not a religious person. Because of the struggle between my sexual desires and ideals, I am left with an unfulfilled sexual urge and a great sense of pride in myself. Is anyone going through similar stuff too?

Will sociopaths ever fall in love? Or will the lines between romance and their repressed needs be blurred when they become preoccupied with feeling in control... to the extent of viewing an originally potential romantic interest into a potential conquest for satisfying their innermost sociopathic needs? For the longest time, I've been in love with a sociopath. A pathological liar. But there's a lot of uncertainty involved so I can't be sure what steps to take, if I'm even taking any at all.

 I solemnly declare I am a good guy. Sorry to those who have misinterpreted my comments on NUSWhispers as a serial insensitive troll. I was just having fun. You could tell right? Apologies to the one who I always tag and tease, but I know you're fine with it.

Anyway, moving on, thank you , but I really can't accept you. Not because I like your Boston boyfriend, but I'm interested in neither guys nor girls. I didn't know how to type this and took some time in doing so. But if you wish, we can still be friends --- there're still three years ahead.

I know it doesn't sound like me, but I don't wanna break your heart. I'm really not into romance. I'm into science.

I have always identified myself as gay. I have never had a relationship with a girl before.

But uni has kind of changed that. Honestly, I'm starting to take an interest in girls. Emotionally and physically. 

There is a girl in my clique that I kind of like. She is independent yet not fiercely so. She is definitely not perfect but I am slowly thinking that she could be a really sweet girl.

I wish to explore a relationship with her but I don't know how it can work out. I am afraid of hurting the girl, because what if it doesn't work out? "Sorry, I'm actually gay, I realised I am really incapable of liking you"

Bullshit right?

What do you think?

I am not sure if I should delete my facebook account. You see, no one is actually concerned over what I do, or anything. No one really cares, and because of the odd and extreme stuff I post, no one will. The only reason I need facebook is for news updates. Then again, social media is all the rage nowadays, so I am afraid that I will actually be out of our time if I delete it. So here I am, posting a question: should I delete my facebook account? Can I survive without a facebook account? What is life without a facebook account like?

Anablepophobia - the fear of of looking up

Yup, that probably (partially) describes me. 
I know many people around  my faculty by face, but i am afraid to look up in case i bump into one of them. Some people in my faculty think i am socially awkward and kinda weird, and it has been said in front of me a few times (and rumours too). Over this sem, I have actually grown to be scared of people and drawing away from them. I feel so nervous and often look down, pretending to be using my phone. I dont think I am THAT socially awkward, i am just shy...? But once i step out my faculty to other places around school, the fear dispels a little.

So there is this guy in my course who always boast about his wide social circle and his group of "banker" friends whom he always seek advice from. That's still okay. 

Not until when he starts making insensitive remarks to people (even to his friends). He always poke fun at people who he think are inferior to him in terms of wealth, knowledge and social status just because he is from a wealthy family. Yes I know your father hold some influential position in some company but no, you are not. You are nothing without your father. 

When people ask him some legit questions, he will always give some lame replies to make fun of them or just giving some answers to attack the questioner personally with regards to the person's IQ level. Best part, he laugh to himself every time after his glorious lip bestowed the "holy judgement" to the person while people around him are like "wtf dude?" Hope he knows that his "thought to be" close friends are distancing away from him cos of this shit attitude he is showing in school. 

Anyways, just wishing that this dude grow up soon and start thinking more for others. Stop being so self-centered. Maybe one day, just one day you can realise how wonder this world can be without so many shit opinions you are giving to people. 

Sensitivity is the key dude.

You know, looking back, I sure am glad that you didn't fall for me when you first came in. I am a very messed up person (hey,I just realised it like last year), who, up til today, is still trying to sort himself out. 

I wasn't confident of giving you the security you needed, and though I do feel that I am in a better position today, I know that you are happier with your life and boyfriend now. 

Hahaha, I haven't seen you around, and won't see you anymore for my last year next year, you won't see me anymore, so all the best, m'amigo!!! ;)

I know a pretty and cute CS1010S TA from computing. She is year 2 now. Unlike locals, she has a very unique accent (UK kind of accent) and a very angmoh name. She has a very sweet voice, too. Perhaps, she will make a good singer. Unfortunately, I heard she is attached now :(. I really want  to know her more. #bigfan

 I feel for you. I pray for her safety too. You should share more about what you know; I am personally quite interested to find out about North Koreans. :)

Honestly, is being despo wrong? :( Being evergreen, whenever I  see how other couples behaving so lovingly, I will always hope that I would be able to experience how it is like to be in love. :( sigh

It's normal that parents would have reservations about who you date. The thing is, you chose to be with her so there's got to be reasons why you chose her so stick with that. After all, if you do get married it's your spouse that you're gonna be with for the rest of your life. Your parents are probably concerned but I'm sure that if they see that you guys are committed to each other and that you make each other happy they'll accept her eventually. And even if they don't, it is still ultimately your life and your life partner.

dont know about other guys, but ill be glad if my girl masturbates. Its good to know how to pleasure yourself and enjoy it.  Its honestly not something to be ashamed about.

I adopt multiple personalities for the most of my life. My core personality is a INTJ/P. I study and mimic people.

I've learnt multiple languages in order to connect to people in a meaningful manner. Some I learnt well, some not. I can speak like a native PRC-chinese, I can speak like a brit and many Brits were surprised that I've never set foot into UK. 

I pick up things and pretend to have an interest in them. In fact I can speak as if I am a hobbyist/enthusiast/passionate about something, though the truth is I don't care. Just a month ago I went for a job interview. I steered the conversation to animal rights knowing she's very into this and got the conversation going. I got the offer though I turned it down for a better offer. When I was young I used to find ants to step on. I shot rubber bands at birds.

I've made several close friends throughout the years  and only 2 of these friends (whom I show my true self to), know about this insanity of mine. I am popular in school (pageant), and I sometimes wonder if people really can't tell that something is way off about me, which is the case for many sociopaths.

I go after attached ladies for the thrill as a (usually ESFP/ENFP). I research the needs of the lady before I make a move. I made a couple (now ex) lose their BTO deposit. I made a 28yo lady divorce his husband, only to go cold on her while she was halfway through. 

I take delight in bending things to my will. I am in perfect control; everything's fine and all, yet at the same time there is always this lingering emptiness in me.

I am a second upper student, having a high position in my CCA, a good part time job, and a scholarship. People see me as a cheerful, popular and successful student in NUS who can juggle studies, CCA, and social life. However, not many people know that I am battling with suicidal thoughts. I have visited the counsellor in NUS but it doesn't stop the thoughts. When I felt so depressed I will pon school, lie down on my bed and drink a lot of whiskey . I felt so depressed because I felt that no one really care about me, not even my family. Perhaps I felt so unloved because my father left the house, leaving me to live with my mom who mentally abused me. Because of financial burden, my mom wanted to give me up to other families to take care of me, separating me from my brothers and sister. Then now, I am kinda adopted by a rich man who has no child. I feel so lonely as i  never feel really loved by anyone before. Maybe i have many friends who said that they care about me and what not, but it doesn't make me feel loved at all. I tried to open my heart to my close friends but in the end I left disappointed. Sometimes, i tied a rope on my fan and stared blankly, trying to find a reason to live tomorrow. Behind those happy faces in school, you never know what kind of life those are facing everyday. Be nice and spread the love guys!! Sometimes, a hug, a tap on a back, an encouraging message, and a simple smile can restore someone 's faith in humanity and life.

Guys in SoC and Engine, please stop hitting on every girl you meet even attached ones just because there are so few of us. I know you guys are predisposed by Mother Nature to be horny and desperate but please control yourselves. All your incessant attention is killing our interest in you.

I am an evergreen and recently got attached after dating this girl for 2 months. And so last week, i brought my gf home for dinner for the very first time. After that day, my parents kept asking me questions about her background and finally revealed that they didnt like her on many counts. This is new to me and I feel like i am stuck btwn both parties now. . . Anyone has any advice for what to do? I personally know that the girl has many flaws but i thought accommodation and accepting differences is what makes a relationship work...

There's this friend of mine. She uses her depression as an excuse to neglect all her responsibilities which I don't even know why she took up when she knows she can't cope. I'm sick and tired of covering up for her, only to get flamed by her after that. I may sound insensitive and all, but guess what? I have depression too. So do my mum and grandfather, and I'm struggling to hold it together and stay strong for them even with all the counselling. But you don't see me publicly announcing that I've depression and then using it as an excuse for everything. Sometimes I really hate her and don't even know why we're still friends.

 Food for thought : FWB means that they don't want a real relationship. If you want real relationship, look elsewhere.

Everyone thinks I'm an innocent girl but my darkest secret is that I masturbate. He is a religious guy. He doesn't know but if he does, will he judge me for that? Don't really think it's neccessary for him to know yet but at the same time I don't really want to hide it from him. :/

I am a girl in a male dominated faculty and still evergreen even after a few semesters. I admit that i am rather socially awkward. What do guys actually look for in a girl?

Ps looks-wise i am considered average/a little above average.

Dear crush,
I have been wondering all this time, whether there’s any meaning to a failed love.
Is something that will disappear the same as something that never existed?
Now I know, there is meaning.
There was a meaning.. right here.

 she has good content. before all this expose stuff, she blogged about overseas trips, luxurious things. I live vicariously through her. Also she is entertaining and relatable. She's a blogger, not a model so why would her fashion and looks matter?
-
 
It's pretty comical that there's this stereotype about how a normal girl can get attached easily in a male-dominated faculty yet here I am having FWB with 3 guys over 2 semesters.
-
 
Is it wrong to ask your TA out for a meal to get to know her better? We're same age and all and surely its alright? 
-
 
I like this guy a lot... He tells me that he likes 2 other girls when we chat, and sometimes tells me how this and that girl used to/currently likes him. I want to confess to him, but I'm afraid that he will reject me and that my confession will just act as an ego booster to him. I don't know what to do anymore because I am very sad.
-
 
Uhm... Don't be sad, it is not nice to see someone being sad.

Try not to wait until it is too late. If none of the previous ladies have actually confessed to him, chances are, the person won't take it as an ego boost when you confess to him. 

There is a line between the treatment of something which can be joked about, and more serious things. But still, no harm trying,right? The worse he can do is say no, and watch his step around you more carefully.

A person with a huge-ass ego might not have as big an ego as you might think, if you care to look closer.

At least, that is what I think.

Am I the only one who doesn't care about the Manny Pacquiao vs Floyd Mayweather fight? I don't even know what makes it such a big deal but its everywhere.

Dear friend,

I don't mind you practicing your moves on me since you probably don't have much chance to do so in this male-dominated faculty. However, I need to warn you that I may break your heart if you go any further than that. 

Sorry :(

my ex&i broke up a couple of months ago. the spark was because of his friend from lab. he said there was nth going on and she was a friend. 3 months down, he's now dating this particular friend. funny thing is how he used to bitch about her.
although we have broken up, i still had some hopes of us getting back together. i found out that the girl&him are going overseas tgt but yet i refused to believe they are actually tgt. i even went to ask if he is seeing anyone now, but he said he's too busy for that and i believed him. 
it was only when his friend came to tell me about the new girl my ex is dating that i finally let go of whatever hopes i had. what is consoling is that his friend also said our breakup is for the better, for my ex is not ready to settle and that he is only selfishly thinking about himself at this stage in life. i always knew my ex is quite a selfish person, but because i loved him, i didnt mind at all. 
although still feeling sad over the r/s because afterall, this would have been our 4th year together. but i'm also glad that it ended now, as compared to dragging it on any further. i'm glad he pulled the trigger, because i wouldnt have the courage to end a relationship. i dont really know how to stop caring for someone when over the years, he has already become like a family member.
if my ex is serious about the girl from lab he's dating now, then I sincerely wish them all the best. 
meanwhile I shall hold on to the faith that someone better will come along :)

A particular guy just keeps commenting on almost every single confession posted. Super irritating as he is just commenting because of the sake of it. No prizes for guessing who is it though. To the guy: Just get a life, goddammnit

I have this thing for a guy and we are like officially dating now. However, what bugs me is that he is on close terms with a large number of different girls. Base on his history, he have alot of FWB, but he have 0 gf and isnt a player. Should I be ok with his large amount of girls that he is on extremely close terms or should I just stop everything now before I fall deeper?
-
 
i really like this guy even though he just wants to be friends. we're still on good terms but some days i want to be so much more than just friends.

A question from an evergreen who just got rejected - What exactly is love? Is is just an attraction to the physical appearance of someone or should it be something more than that?

Hi there, I realised a lot of people have no one to talk to like me.. I created a kik account. It is anonymous. No need phone number, can just chat and I can be your friend:) i'm a girl! Add me on kik @ cloudsoph. Girl chat buddies are preferred! Not comfortable talking to guys yet..

Funny how the number is Psych Stats 2 mod code. Heh.

Thanks Ms JC (commenter). But do you know what it would feel like to refer proud people to a counsellor/psychiatrist? He'd feel betrayed. And that feeling is not gonna do him any good.

Coming to a close of two years in NUS and I'm starting to wonder if I'm actually asexual.

I do like a particular close girl friend currently (that is after knowing each other pretty well). I like to talk to her whenever I can & feel lonely when I don't. However sex & physical intimacy is hardly ever on my mind. Nothing more than just slight curiosity or to please a partner. To me sex is simply for the purpose of reproduction to please our parents, a chore so to speak. I don't even masturbate even once as a guy.

While hanging out with my guy friends, I have no idea why my peers would take glances at girls too. While I'm busy doing work. Is this something biologically built-in to both sexes to check each other out?

This does fit well with some of the description on asexuality. The lack of sexual attraction towards anyone. It is normal though for asexual to have romantic attractions (biromantic.etc) as I have read in several sources and I have a very intense "bromance" with a guy friend who I suspect might be in the closet but that's just pure guesswork.

I'm not fully sure. Especially the difference between romantic & sexual attraction. Does it mean that if say 2 girls liked each other very much yet have no desire for sex in the future, it means they aren't lesbians after all? What do we call them then if their attraction is only in a romantic sense?

Sexuality is so confusing.

 Hi there! I know it's hard and I know how you feel. Jiayou okay and know that you're not alone :-) It will take time to love again, but you will. It is possible to love wholly again. You are a precious girl with intrinsic worth <3 Hang in there ok!!!!!

Like many other girls, I thought I would get a bf when I enter uni. Previous sem I got very close with a guy. Being a total amateur at this I thought he would be the one. he hurt me badly and left me scarred. Now I have lost faith in r/s and I don't believe in love anymore. How sad, to want to stay single for the rest of my life without ever entering a proper r/s, but I do not wish to risk my heart.

Sometimes when my relatives ask me, "So when will you show your girlfriend to us? Your friend XXX and YYY have girlfriend alr" Hearing this, I feel kinda... offended? This always happens not only during CNY but also during other family gathering events (just recently, attended cousin's wedding). Why can't I stay single? I just want to focus on my study, have lots of friends, do all kinds of activities that I like. I always have a perception that being in a relationship will limit your freedom. Have tried to explain this and that to my relatives, and everytime they just said, "Probably you have not met the right person!" But honestly, I'm quite tired hearing that thing... Am I the only person who do not want to have any relationship till I die? I just want to be free.

Hi.. was reading some research on how different genders interpret "cheating" in a relationship context and it states that guys will be more affected if the girl cheated physically but girls are more affected if guys cheated emotionally. What do you guys think? Personally I feel it's true from a girl's pov. Idk man I feel like I would be able to forgive if my bf cheated on me via a one night stand but if he is involved with someone else romantically, I'll really be hurt :/ is it weird? Haha not that any cheating has been going on but just wondering.

I thought that I would get my first boyfriend at around 17/18, like most girls. But I'm graduating soon & I'm still evergreen.  I hate feeling so sad about it all the time, & usually I hate reading Confessions/Whispers because many posts are for the kind of girls I could never be. I want to know what it's like to be in love.

 & in continuation from 
Like I said, please do move on as it seems to me that you yourself don't want to be "stuck" where you are right now. Quit inflicting pain and suffering on yourself and smoking etc. if you haven't already done so. Escaping may seem a really nice route, but ultimately, if you think about it, it won't be enough. Running away may prevent you from falling once in a while, but only by gaining strength, being a stronger individual, will you guarantee that you will never fall again.

For me at least, there came a time when I was tired of being weak, that all I was able to do was cry. I was one whom constantly told myself that one day, someone will come along whom will see me for who I really am, to love me as I would for her, perhaps not able to understand me, but at the very least, tries to do so. I wanted someone to be there for me when I needed help, comfort and advice, and to give me strength. But ultimately, I knew I needed to pick myself up. I hated my past self. If you too feel the same way, be the change you want to see in yourself. I'm not sure if these are good advices, but here goes. Strengthen your mind; workout and push yourself, have a headstrong attitude in everything you do, and stay disciplined. And of course, do seek help when necessary.

Why would you think it matters to him, if you are not the angelic, or demure girl that he sees you as? I'm no love expert, but I think love isn't so much of not finding "faults" within the other party, but rather, being able to accept them. I believe any guy who sincerely loves you will try his best to look past them. If he still chooses to stay, doesn't that already say something? Its your insecurities at work and which you'll have to overcome, hopefully not alone.

I'm guessing the emotional support you yearn for is extremely hard to come by, only from someone whom has fallen hard and whom understands you enough to be there for you. Me? Haha... My advice would be for you to first pick yourself up and recalibrate your expectations and figure out your thoughts as you go along. You are just lost and not thinking clearly right now.

Stay STRONG :)

CM1121: I wish that guy will do chemistry with me. But it looks like it isn't going to happen; he has a queue for him. Besides, I'm not that smart, but he's some ex-Chem olympiad guy... why would he ever want me?

I should wait for a better time.

"sob... Y1 sad chemistry major who didn't know who she was up against."

Recently I'm having this problem where I can't help but think about different guys moaning and groaning away under me. Even during this exam period, somehow it gets heightened. Sometimes it gets very vivid. I don't usually exhibit a dominant personality but I do catch myself slowly drifting into a semi-conscious state of fantasy about this and it gets me very horny after.

Friends, acquaintances sometimes but usually people who I barely even know yet. What's made this worse is this semester in FIN 3101 where I have a bunch of fit cute hunks and physically appealing dudes in class. Sometimes it gets so distracting!

So should I just seek to indulge so as to alleviate this? Or keep it to myself? Because it's not going away. If fantasies, sex drives are all human nature for us and our hormones are part of our system, then what's the possibility that they might be secretly into such stuffs too? Ever wonder?

I'm quite flexible and like trying out new things btw so it doesn't really matter about being the top or bottom as long as maximal satisfaction is achieved for both parties.

I feel so troubled. Sometimes i feel like i have really lost the will to live. Having such a disease is not a joke.. And even though my current boyfriend is so encouraging, loving and supportive of me, i cant help feeling i'll just be a burden to him. & i'm a burden to my parents. Who do not know about my condition. I just put on a fake smile everyday so they dont worry or feel heartbroken for me. I really wish things didn't have to turn out this way. I need the strength to carry on.... And the biggest irony of all? I'm a psychology major. And I cant even manage my own setbacks with the appropriate emotion. I dont even know what to feel. My body is deterioratintg day by day i can feel it.. Help somebody help. :( 
-
 
I just want some advice on my choice of partners. Whenever a guy asks me out, the next move after they pay for dinner is to usually go south. What can I do? I mean I enjoy controlling these guys with what I have, but sometimes I am just looking for a stable relationship.

There this girl I really like. I enjoy hanging out with her and she's really nice to me. She has a boyfriend and I'm a girl. Is this wrong?

Exactly 2 years ago, I was told to wait for a guy I really really liked to come back from his summer holidays for him to make a decision to be together. So I waited. Weeks turned to months. Till one day I couldn't wait anymore. So I left. And that was the best decision of my life. He never came back the same anyways.

Do not wait for your romeo. Do not die a Juliet. Love yourself before you commit to a relationship. 
-
 
To post , I believe if you have a boyfriend whom you love dearly and cherish a lot, you wouldn't even care less about the extra amount of attentions you get from other guys even if you did not even tried for it. Yes I have no doubts over the fact that platonic relationships do exist and I myself have many close guy friends but I don't feel happy over the extra attention  (if they have given me). A sincere relationship is not about finding better partners or trying to find someone with better capabilities, it's about accepting all of your partner's flaws and continue to love him. I have a boyfriend and I'm in a guy-dominated faculty a well. I understand how easy it is to gain attention from guys but it's up to you to decide whether you are affected by it, or will you choose to not be bothered about it. You are probably still in the younger stage of life where the idea of settling down seems too far fetched, therefore you should probably not have a boyfriend and enjoy the fun as for now. There's no guarantee that guys wouldn't pursue you in the working world but it just boils down to how much you love your boyfriend, and how disciplined are you to not be bothered about it. When you truly love someone, you have no eyes for anyone but your gf or BF.

In continuation of 

I thought I had moved on after all it has been close to 3 years since it happened. But when I read the encouraging comments that some of you had written, I broke down in tears. I did not expect that this would still affect me so much.

The hall senior broke up with his ex, and got into a relationship shortly after we ended our short-lived fling. It took me some time to get over it and because I felt so bad about possibly causing the break up between my hall senior and his ex, what came after this was a period of self-hate whereby I did things to hurt myself so that I feel less guilty and bad. One particular night when the self-hate was at its peak, I felt so miserable and walked out to a convenience store near my hall to buy a pack of cigarettes. I even had to google a specific brand so that I know what to buy, and also the instructions on how to smoke a cigarette. I knew it's harmful to the body, but I hated myself so I wanted to inflict pain and suffering upon myself on purpose. I started avoiding people in hall, and often get suspicious when I sense people looking at my direction. I had a guilty conscience and I was afraid that the hall seniors would spill the beans as to what transpired between us. Now that I look back, I could have been suffering from mild depression.

As for me, I also got into a relationship quite soon and it lasted for more than 2 years.

When I was in a relationship with my ex, I guess I still felt insecure. I didn't know what he liked about me and would often ask him questions that could prove my self-worthiness and give me assurance. Deep down inside, I know that I am not the angelic, or demure girl that he probably sees me as. After all, I had a fling with a guy who was attached before - I was like the evil third-party who came between my parents. I hated my dad for having a mistress and an illegitimate child, but I hated myself even more because I myself became a third-party in someone else's relationship.

My ex knew about my dad's affair, and he knew about my insecurities. But I never felt or received the kind of emotional support that I needed from him. He was a great guy, but I never felt that I could be in a position to love someone selflessly and unconditionally. Maybe we're just not so into each other, or maybe because it could have been a relationship out of convenience for the both of us. Fundamentally, I guess I don't know what love is. I am so broken, so flawed. Am I incapable of loving someone?

Before I grad after 4 amazing years in nus, just a few words to the 2 girls in nus:

Girl 1: you wrecked me so hard in year 1 and it literally took me years to get over you. I've however forgiven and forgotten about it and I hope you've done the same too. My only regret? That you chose not to remain as friends. 

Girl 2: I had to friendzone you because of the aftermath with girl 1. I just wasn't ready for a relationship. You were everything a guy could have asked for but it was just another typical scenario of the right person but the wrong time. I am however very glad that you got attached after a year or so :) I'd be guilt ridden if you had waited for me but I didn't give anything back.

Do guys like girls making the first move? I have just broken up a while ago and this guy came helping me out and all that. However, after a long talk with him today, I realized that he is single and still looking for a relationship but he is also a player at the field. Though, he says he will commit if he have a gf. Should I make the first move?
-
 
I sometimes wonder why I am such a poor judge of character. Being backstabbed by a few juniors is admittedly painful. Yet I know the majority of people aren't so terrible, but I cannot help but feel indignant. Yet that brings me no closer to anything. I could confront them but that just means the formal end of any sort of friendship. But keeping silent solves nothing either.

Do I necessarily feel better writing this? Maybe, but this isn't the primary reason.

NUSWhispers is more gossip than confession

Confess
: to admit that you did something wrong or illegal

: to talk about or admit something that makes you embarrassed, ashamed, etc.

It's been years. I still can't get over my first crush despite trying everything I can. Dating with other girls, cutting off all kinds of contact I could possibly have with my crush etc... I start to wonder if it's even possible to get over her in the first place.

Sometimes, I can see myself telling my friends 12 years down the road, "Hey, I spent half my life loving someone." 

I thought I'll finally suck it up when she gets attached. Now she is. But I am still stuck.

I used to shun the idea of drinking and going to clubs.. I avoided going for the bashes for uni camps. Now my first year in uni is almost over and I feel like a total noob not having any clubbing experience at all. In fact, I seldom drink too but I was surprised with my own behaviour at one of my cca's gathering. Seniors were offering alcohol and we were playing lame games. I lost once and I took the shot. My friends couldn't finish theirs and I finished those for them. As the night passed I found myself drinking more and more and liking the burn. I felt like a naughty person, bending and breaking the rules I set for myself. And I liked it. 

Now I am very tempted to club, at least once for the experience. But I have no one to approach. Everyone knows me as the person who doesn't party, they probably think I'm not good company to go to have fun with.

My boyfriend is always busy, I don't mind that. But I've gotten a little suspicious these few weeks and scrolled through his whatsapp messages when he was bathing. I couldn't believe my eyes, there were some pretty saucy exchanges between him and guy 'A'. My boyfriend cheating on me, with this guy 'A'! How does this even work!? I don't even know how to be jealous, I'm sad that I've been used as his cover for 2 years. Anyone else had similar experiences?

Recently, right before the term test of a CS mod, I saw an international student sitting right beside me flip open the question paper and started reading and scribbling on it minutes before the test started. I observed him for a bit and confirmed what I suspected him of doing but at that point of time, I didn't sound out because I didn't know how I should have best handled the situation. But I know that if I sounded out, the drama that would ensue would have affected my concentration for the test as I do not handle dramatic situations well.

Till today, I still wonder what should have been the best way to handle this situation. Does anyone have any kind advice to offer?

Is it normal to feel all alone even when you're in a crowd :( I'm an international student and this is my first year in uni. The problem is that though I know a lot of people, I'm just not good at being friends with them, so more often than not I find myself doing things alone. Everyone seems to have formed groups alr and I find myself being left out and ignored. Sometimes I feel so lonely, I just want to give up and go home. I don't feel like I can confide in anyone. I don't want next semester to be this way, any advice?

I want to make a confession. I have a great crush on this Prof for this module in FoS. It is hard to find one Prof in FoS, and particularly my major, to has all his wonderful traits. He is charismatic, eloquent, super intellegent, confident, well-mannered and kind! For those k-drama addicts, the Prof is 99.99% similar to Do manager in "You who came from the star". Just so dreamy! 
Can someone advice me how to get into his research group for my Fyp?

I have a drinking problem. I appear like a demure girl in front of everyone but when I drink, I drink a shit-load and do crazu. So my question is, how do anyone solve someone with a drinking addiction?
-
 
To acquaintances/friends I made this semester: I really like talking to you all and I really do like all of you. But I just don't like talking to anyone after an exam, especially about the exam paper. I'm sorry if I appear 'dao' after the paper and just rushing off. I hope you all understand...
-
 
 I'm a girl taking life easy and simple, in a similar situation as you. Thinking too much into stuff is a form of intellect, and there are girls like me that are attracted to that. 
Well, I'm attracted to him who ended his exams yesterday, and waiting for him to make the first move.

Not sure if this will get posted, but here goes:

University has surely opened up my mind.  I guess people are more open-minded about topics like homosexuality,  so my friends and I tend to mention about this topic.

I feel that homosexuals/bisexuals should not be afraid to be who they are. Go out there and love whoever you want. Gender should not stop you from being in love. Even if your parents are an obstacle, prove to them that true love exists even between the same-sex. Don't let them stop you!!!! I believe that no one should EVER stop you from going after someone you love. (and if you're approached by someone and you don't feel comfortable with it, just shake it off and BE NICE and reject that person, but you can still be friends right)

And if she's reading this,  HI, I think you're the most beautiful girl I've met, and you look really cool with your snapback. But I don't know why, we've recently not been talking as much, and it's getting really awkward. Let's hope things will change ok!!!!

Anyway, what matters truly is who you are on the inside. No one should judge you for being you. NO ONE.

I just want to apologise to my best friend. I kissed her lips for at least 3 times but I kept denying that I liked her. 

Yes, I liked you so much and I am sorry for not saying the truth. I was just so afraid that I would lose you if I confessed. I didn't lose you after I lied. But I lost myself for hiding this feeling.

NUSWhispers is down, it feels like something is missing in my studying session..

I have been eye candying this cute girl who wears a blue jacket and studies at biz library.  She is super hardworking and never sees me regardless of how much I try to get her attention. The only thing I know about her is that her Lenovo laptop has a Patrick sticker on it, and I love SPONGEBOB! Can someone please help me find this girl? I would love to get to know her!

The most significant reason why I avoid my best friend is because I love her romantically and I am female. Same sex relationship is just impossible for us. So I choose to pretend to be "normal" and find a boyfriend.

I am a girl and I used to be pretty naive in my first few years of uni life thinking that girls in uni are fun-loving, angelic and clever people. But after certain encounters and experiences, I have came to realise that there are many girls in uni that loves to play around with guys, have multiple sex partners and attention seeking. I was once put into a situation where one such girl blamed me on 'spilling her beans' after her boyfriend found out but it turned out to another guy who had spreaded the secrets. Faithfulness in a relationship is especially importantly but honesty is equally important as well. Do things that you are not afraid to let people know, or do not do it. Perhaps on the other hand there are certain reasons for such actions that we will never know. Coming from a pretty conservative family background, I cannot apprehend the actions of these girls since I have always believed in being respectful of ourselves and do not do things that we will regret in future. My ideologies may be 'out fashioned' but I hope one day they will learn how to love themselves more and learn how to respect their own body, and partner as well. Of course, I still choose to believe that most girls in uni aren't that bad after all and these few examples may just be a small fraction of the entire community.

 Move on if you haven't already done so, and if that is not the person you want to see yourself be for the rest of your life. Life isn't without struggles. Perhaps you'll eventually meet someone who will appreciate you for who you really are. It may be tough and may sometimes take a while, but I think love has that ability, to allow one to look pass the flaws and "hard facts" of another. I know I will :)

This is my story.. I went overseas for exchange. I met this girl who was also on exchange during a cultural exchange event. We interacted and exchange contacts during that event. Started talking and hanging out. 1 month later we started hanging out so often that we developed feelings for each other. 

After a returning from a party one night, I invited her back to my room. The lights was dim, the smell of her perfume on her body was so alluring and sexy. I began to start fantasizing what I would do to that body of hers... (Stay tune for part 2)

Professors should really evaluate their fyp students on whether or not they are a dick to their other group members in other modules or not. 

I spent my time waiting for and covering someone's ass for 2 projects, neglecting my other projects, which I need desperately to do well in to pull up my low CAP. Someone with one of those star-spangled resumes(yes,we do check you up)

Not a good feeling, and he just waltzes in at the last minute, says a simple sorry (seriously, a simple sorry is not enough when you say it just to prevent us from jumping at you),and throws wrenches into the work already in place instead of working with the flow. 

You want to be sorry? Is a simple sorry enough to make up for how,because of your absence during the entire sem, while we were working, cocked things up for the many group members you have? Best part is, you ain't even sincere in your apology. If you do modules with the attitude to just want to get things just done and over with, I suggest you don't drag others along with you. Oh wait, you are graduating. Good riddance.

I know I may get flamed for posting this, but just wanna speak up for some of the girls who appear to have a few other close guys who are slightly more than friends to them apart from their current partners.To the girl who posted confession  As a girl myself, I do agree that we should respect our own bodies and remain faithful to one partner. I definitely do not condone having multiple sex partners and I am adamant about not giving in to guys' sexual advances whenever I encounter them. If they can't accept it, then they aren't even worthy of being my friends. Fortunately, all the guy friends that I made so far in school are decent guys who will initially keep a comfortable distance from me even when we happen to study side by side. However, my point is, when there are more than one guy who's chasing after you, it is very difficult to stay true to your partner, especially when the infatuation period is over. Being in a guy dominated faculty, even though its only my second year, I have managed to attract a number of guys even though I never make any effort on my part to get to know them better. Its always that they start asking me out first, for study sessions, meals etc. And every guy that I encountered has their own unique attributes, personality and character which I admired a lot. Moreover, I do take other modules apart from my engine core mods so I tend to meet guys from other faculties such as SOC too, and I think they are kind of hot especially when they type furiously away and try to solve some complex coding problems whenever I am studying with them. Sometimes, even though I am aware of having a partner already, I cannot help but try to get closer to some of them because I feel young and attractive myself and I too, want to find a partner who is capable as well. Also, I tend to prefer to make guy friends rather than girls because I feel that guys can be really nice people and are especially less selfish when it comes to teaching you, sharing of notes etc. I feel that as long as I am not married, I should give every guy equal opportunities for us to be together despite being 'committed' to a relationship. Hence, to the guys out there who are confused about whether to pursue a girl who already has a boyfriend, please do so because we girls secretly like it. I mean, who doesn't like the feeling of being pursued?

Now that finals are over, I can read NUSWhispers without feeling guilty ;)

29-4-2015 will definitely be the saddest day of my life. I'm using NUSWhispers as a platform to vent out all my sorrows.

This is my story. I'm a guy that most guy will look down upon, I'm used to being called an "ah gua" since primary school. Unlike the normal conventional guy, i lack masculinity that most girls prefer. To make matters worse, my character and behavior are almost like a girl, because i grew with little interaction with other guys. My friend circle is always just made up of purely girls .Despite having female attributes, I have to tell you guys that I was never gay.

Although I'm a independent person, I do have mood swing sometimes(I confess that I cry a lot too)  and i wish that i have a gf to comfort me and protect me. Sounds like what a girl wants right? Most guy will start judging me and hurl insults at me, but I'm alright... my heart is already numb to all these abuses. 

Most of you will laugh at me and say that I'm a dreamer, truly I don't believe that any girl will love me too. But GOD is really kind to me. He answered my prayers and sent me the women that changed my life forever. Let's call her Jane ( I don't want to reveal her real name), I met Jane from my SS mod. She is a strong women, decisive and full of bright ideas. We started calling each other every single night and chat till 3am, she will always console me whenever I'm crying. She will also knock my head softly when i do or say something stupid, she is a pretty rough girl isn't it? =). She can be quite fierce too, there was once, she confronted a group of young boys who called me "bapok", I was so shocked then! Whenever Jane is around me, I feel so safe and secure. I told myself "this must be my true happiness".  I wish that time can freeze and we remain happy forever. But fate is really cruel,  Jane got struck by cancer. She lost 14 kg in 5 months and lost all her hair, which I always like to play around with. Ever since then, I have been putting up a brave front when I'm around her, in order to motivate her.However she soon found out that I was frequently crying outside the hospital ward. She knocked my head again and said "silly, I'm not going to die" ,and gave me a faint smile. After 11 months of fighting and suffering, she finally left the world today ... leaving me behind.

Thank you Jane, my love. Thank you for coming into my life. Thank you for making me cry a lot lesser and laugh a lot more. 谢谢你，让我知道世界上还有人会爱丑小鸭，爱 ah gua. I will remember all your advice, from today onwards I will be a stronger man and stop crying. I promise!

Never believe his words when he says I love you too soon. 

I've never believed in love at first sight and it was just part of the many lies I've said to get in your pants. I could tell that you were attracted to me and I merely played along. I became your first just months into our relationship. I wanted to end it then but you were persistent and I relented. I did not expected us to last for four more years. 

I was expecting to feel relived, finally being set free from this one-sided relationship. But all I felt was emptiness. Over those years I've gotten used to waking up beside you, receiving the cute morning texts that you'll send, the scent you leave in rooms, the warm embrace that you give. It is only when you lose something do you realize the value of it. I definitely deserve all that I am feeling right now. I wish you all the best in your new relationship. 

There is no love at first sight, but you can definitely fall in love.

"Give a man a mask and he'll show you his true face." This is how things are kept going at NUSWhispers.

While people are worried over relationship problems,i'm just sitting down here trying to figure out how to make the perfect sunny-side ups. And exams. 

Viva la singlehood!!!!

to  dear friend, thanks for letting me know about your story. when i came across your confession, i was traumatized by how the college lifestyle had destroyed my feels. 
before your post, and pretty much for the whole first year in college, i had been so overwhelmed by concerns for grades, deadlines, competitive internships, SEP, boredom with NUS, mugging and all stuff that i barely remembered college was just a short four-year term that may or may NOT decide my happiness. you remind me of tons of things that are more important than grades; you remind me that sometimes, instead of fussing over the tests and assignments, i can actually settle for a slightly worse outcomes at the expense of a better emotional life. 
sometimes i should stop mugging and crying over the bad results to finally go out there seeking for meaningful - a friendship, a self-funded trip, a stress-free labor work or a partner. 
sorry for my rambling and best wishes to you and Jane (for me she is always alive)

 We do not all see guys for their money. I am not speaking for myself only, I believe, or I hope, when I say that I find money to be the least attractive thing about men. I'm an independent woman, if I want something, I work for it. There's more I would want from any relationship than money. Maybe some girls would love a guy who takes them shopping and to expensive restaurants. I personally prefer the guy to just make an effort to spend time with me so that I can respond likewise. If all the women around you are looking for expensive dates, I think you're looking in the wrong place. There's another post recently about men being visual creatures and girls having to work out to attract guys. Frankly, I don't care, I may be slightly plump but I love what I do here in uni, I work with and get to know people who value my opinion and I believe it's better to let your personality shine through. What makes you think your looks are average anyway? Did you conduct a survey? Although I agree that looking decent is important, being healthy is important but it's ok to be yourself and it's ok to hate exercise. I prefer to roll with it;)

It's quite satisfying to see someone who constantly slacks in group projects to finally see what is like to be paired up with another slacker. Karma is a bitch isn't it?

When I was in Year 1, I met a Year 4 senior who was staying in the same hall as me. He was not particularly good-looking, but I found him smart and competent. Maybe I was just feeling needy, but I eventually developed feelings for him even though I knew he was attached. He was in a relationship for a few years and would always tell me how he feels unhappy about his girlfriend. I thought I could be the special one, the exception. I secretly wanted to make him fall for me, as if to prove my self-worth and capabilities. Looking back, I was just an insecure 21 year-old girl who craves to be wanted and loved. When the hall senior asked to come over to my room to watch a movie on a particular night, I did not declined. He brought over a bottle of red wine and we drank while watching the movie. It eventually led to us making out and he wanted he have sex with me. That was something I did not expect. I expressed my reluctance, but he did it anyway. I didn't know what to expect, because it's my first time. Our fling remained for a few months before he told me that he wanted to end this. I was so hurt and felt used even though I knew I brought it upon myself when I tried to seduce a guy who was already attached. Till this day, I am still regretting what I did at a moment of my folly. Just want to remind freshies who are inexperienced in relationships to not fall prey to seniors who may just be looking around for flings or one-night-stands. I was a loser because I started to take it seriously and thought that we might have a future together, and that I could replace his current gf. But I was wrong. I am sorry for what I did even up to this day.

I am a girl who just got into NUS. From all girl drama of the sec and JC, I really want to stay clear from gals. Am I in the wrong here? Any guys willing to be my friend and help me around, pls comment on this post :D
-
  
 I am in the same situation as you are. I do like the way how we chat. However i am beginning to see the problems that will happen in the future as we are too different. I don't mind being friends with him but I am scared of anything more. Maybe you could test the waters? See if she will be interested in the topics you that are interested in? Worst come to worst, the two of you still could be friends. :)
-
  
 Dun worry... Many people do feel that way including myself when strangers say that. However, I feel you should not feel so about guy friends cos it is just a harmless compliment. Just b'cos they praise your appearance, it does not mean they do not like you for who you are :D

For those who claim that "every girl is beautiful" and that "you should not change anything"; it simply reflects self comforting at best and self delusion at worst. 

I think my POV  is bound to get plenty of hate from these people but I will voice it anyway: Hoping for prince charming to appear one day and accept you for all that you are is simply wishful thinking. Like it or not; most guys are visual creatures. Your looks tends to be the first thing that they notice and make them decide whether they want to talk to you or not.

Yes, not everyone is born with Miranda  Kerr's  face but the very least you can do is to take the effort to appear presentable. You can't change your face but you can definitely work out to change your body. And trust me, it makes a world of a difference. 

I am a rather average looking girl but I find myself being able to attract good looking guys by virtue of a good figure and some decent clothes. this may sound boastful but it is just like applying for a job really. If you want a good company to notice you, you would put in effort to write a good cover letter, try to do whatever it takes to have a great CV  etc right? So if you want a good looking bf, put in that effort to dress well,do whatever you need to attain a decent figure. Everyone can indeed be beautiful,but only if you choose to work for it.

There is a girl in political science PS2237 with wavy-curly hair. She has a mixed pan asian face and really pretty legs. She looks very intimidating so I have never gotten the courage to talk to her. However, when I see her attentively listening to Professor Hopf and jabbing intensely at her keyboard, I feel so attracted.

 I'm not sure why there are people pretending to be me to launch a smear campaign against my love interest. I waited for him outside ma1101r today and asked him..

I've always wondered how most girls feel when random guys or guy friends tell them that they are cute and pretty. I'm actually quite annoyed when guys tell me that, makes me wonder whether they like/love me for my mind and personality, or just for my appearance.

I am a freshman and I did not join any orientation activities. So I do not have any friends that I hang out with all the time. Therefore, I eat alone during lunch and I do not give a s***.

This story is about a guy that I met in my first year.
He's an awesome guy. Good looking, friendly, kindhearted, very smart, extroverted, and the list goes on.
His kindness and caring personality appeals to many. In short, I fell for him.
I join the committee just to be closer to him. I try to match our interests so that we have topics to talk about. Numerous efforts have been done just to be closer to him, but not too close to make him suspicios of anything.
One fine night, I blurted my feelings toward him even though I know the chance is near zero. He declined, but he says that we can still be friends. I'm happy, but the childish-me is devastated. So I disconnect any communication with him.
Until one day he got a girlfriend. My feelings for him is more or less diluted already, but i can still feel the pain. The awesome thing? He ask me out for a dinner, just to check on my wellbeing. Another solid proof that he is an indeed awesome guy.
Somewhere inbetween I also get into some relationship, and of course it ended quite badly for me. Apparently, he also broke up with his girlfriend around the same time when that happened.
We try to console each other, and mend each other's wounds. This time, there is no more romantic feelings towards him. It is replaced by a strong platonic love for a truly precious friend.
His ability to oversaw my flaw and childishness, and still accept me as one of his best friend is another solid proof that he is indeed an awesome friend.

And what makes him even more awesome? Is the fact that I'm a guy.

Yes, a guy, fell in love with another guy, and this other guy just stay cool, even offering help to overcome my feelings.
If only all people had such a great, nonjudgemental, open heart. This world is definitely will become a better place right? :)

There was this girl. 
The first time I saw her clear eyes, her easy smile, I knew I wanted to know her better.
Her awkward laugh, the graceful ease to which she held herself drew me in.
We talked. I shared my passions with her, and she about her recent breakup, the depths of the scars left on her from that first encounter. She gave a wry, pained smile, and said she'd probably not love again any time soon. That image stayed with me as I went to sleep that night, and far into the week after that. I made a decision.
I started going to school earlier, before even the first student arrives, just to meet with her a little before classes began. I would bring snacks to class, so she could have something to eat between back to back lessons spanning over lunch. I tried hard to break into her clique, despite my personal aversion to these interactions in general, and succeeded (much to my surprise). But I was naive to think I had time.
She met a guy in the middle of the semester, and at the clap of the hand, within a couple of weeks, about only a month after our first meeting, they got together. There was nary a warning - she would deny it if any were to ask about their relationship - but like the tides, like time, like fate, they came together, unrelenting, unstoppable. 
I hung around, like nothing was wrong, like I didn't care, and expressed my joy with a smile, a smile meticulously crafted, controlled from by a mind now readily separated from the body. I made sure to raise my eyebrows, smile with my eyes, and give them a pat on the back, as I struggled to loosen that tight constriction in my chest, the ice in my hands. I wanted to rage. Wanted so much to hit something. Instead I made fun of them with harsh jokes, witty jokes, as I frantically built my bridge to control under the mask. Fortunately, reach control I did. 
For a long while after, I felt like I was lied to. I would divorce my mind and body each time I met her, and rage maniacally, helplessly inside, while I calculated the perfect response to each oblivious, carefree interaction. Was there a point to the rage though? Was there a point to anything? The silent cries echoed deafeningly only in the darkness of my mind. 
Slowly, as their relationship progressed, I inevitably faded into the background. In the end, I was nothing but a passing person in her life. Why couldn't I toss her out of my life, my mind, as I was so easily, so readily tossed out of hers? Unfortunately, even in that deep abyss, she was just too precious, far too much to just toss aside in any way.
But who was I to demand that of her? That she should keep me around? That she should treasure me as I did her, when I barely had any impact on her - she never did realise, despite all I thought I did. Am I actually not the one who is the failure, to try so hard, and yet make no difference in the end? At this point, I could only give a wry smile, much like the she gave me back then, though the underlying emotions differed. After all, could you truly say you loved someone, if you cannot accept the choice they make for their own happiness, and wish them well?

It's common courtesy to have a TL;DR section if your post is longer than 5 lines now. C'mon guys, catch up :D

Question: If your girlfriend was breaking up with you for another guy, would you rather she tell you the real reason for the break up or find some other reason so you don't get hurt that she chose another guy?

I am secretly happy when friends that I borrowed their notes from, score worst then me in exam.

You only know how to yell at me because I have cheated on you. Do you even understand my pain for the past 2 years?
My mum has been pressuring me to leave you, because she detest your poor family background. I have always hope that you will work hard, climb higher and prove her wrong. However, you have always let me down, times and times. That's why i have chosen him. He is a CAP 5 scholar, he has a very high chance of success in life. He knows that I love a pink Ferrari and he promised that he will buy me one, in the future.

I will never entrust my happiness to a CAP 3.67 guy.
My only advice to you, is to stop your gaming addiction and focus on being successful.
-
  
I think this guy likes me and how he always seem extra sweet in his whatsapp messages, and how he was so concerned about my well-being when I did not find the paper manageable. But... I don't think he's the kind of guy I am looking for. I dont mean to be mean, but i do not want to hurt him by giving false hopes. What do I do? 
-
  
I wonder such are friendships if your "friends" only keep in contact with you during semester.

Its funny what exams do to you. you study with your friends and the person that you never thought you will like suddenly catches your eye. Told you exams make people go mad.
-
  
To the girl who looked lost and asked my for directions while on campus. When I decided to spend some time walking you to you destination so that you would not get lost, it was also because I thought you were really cute and wanted more from you besides the simple thank you. Otherwise did you think I was willing to be late for my own class? smh.

Any graduating students like me who has yet to find a job and feeling anxious that the rest have already done so? :(

I'm sorry if I've ruined our friendship. It was really depressing when we walked past each other that day without saying hi. I hope we can still be friends, like how everything used to be.

This is to my ex-girlfriend who i spoke to briefly the other day at utown...

I know that you are happy with you new boyfriend now, deep down I am still hurting from our breakup. I put on a brave face when I spoke to you and said everything was well. Deep down I hate you and your new boyfriend so much that I wish it will never end well for the both of you and you will come crying back to me asking for us to be together again. 

They say time heals everything, but I say that's bulls*. Call me bitter all you like, i don't care. I will be loving that look on your face when you cry and whine to me about your breakup. No girl rejects me and that time will come.

Love,
Alpha M

Every exam since the beginning of time, my mum would encourage me all the way; grades were never as important as whether or not I tried my best. Since year 1, she would always text me words of encouragement and prayers and it became a staple for all my exams. This sem, she's fallen ill and is in hospital, can no longer be coherent in her thoughts, and not allowed a phone. Before my first paper, I was feeling strangely uncomfortable, and I realised it was because I was missing the pre-exam boost from her. I couldn't call her or text her, so I scrolled back to Nov 2014 (sem 1's exam) and tried to pretend that those words were said to me now.

I am going on a grad trip soon with a group of 'friends'. However, there are some people on that group whom I really cannot stand. I don't know why I agreed to go with them on the first place. I feel like I do not fit in well and the worst part is that we have already booked our flight and tickets. 

I hope everything goes well or I am just going to be miserable on that whole trip. And I hope that 'that person' does not piss me off with his stupid jokes and lame attempt to make the whole group laugh by doing stupid things..otherwise it is on baby.
-
  
I stay in hall and i hate one of my neighbors. That b*tch is so annoying and brings different guys back to her room all the time and thinks that no one else notices. So when I know that she is in the shower i deliberately take the cubicle next to her and pee in the shower :)  
-
  
I know you're reading this because you always happen to be on this platform often whenever you use your phone. I guess its just wrong timing/place that I met you. Really enjoyed the times I spent together with you for this semester but I guess its over once our finals end. There are just too many problems that I am trying to deal with and I am afraid to fall in love & trouble you with my own multitude of troubles as well. I hope you move on to a better person and not waste time on me anymore.

I'm a girl in Engine and this is my first year. My first year in NUS and I still have not made any friends. I did not manage to go for the orientation camp because it was full. Everyone has their own clique and I don't know what to do. I don't want to go through my university life alone!
-
  
Your advice please! 
I'm a girl crushing hard on a senior. He already graduated from NUS and our social circle is very different, so I didn't know how can I get closer to him. In the end, I asked a mutual friend to set us up. 
I was stupid to ask this particular friend because apparently he has no clue how to carry conversations and create a comfy atmosphere -___- . Still thankful that he at least tried tho LOL.
Anyway I chat him some days after and he seems quite disinterested. He responded politely but not very enthusiastically. Also, he did not really ask anything back? So I thought to myself to just forget about it (wasn't very successful but I tried, ok?)
Out of nowhere, a few weeks after, he suddenly messaged me, and his messages were sending a big flashing 'interested' signal. I was super excited obviously. We chatted quite a bit and I think we can probably hit it off? That was a couple weeks ago tho and we haven't contacted at all since then. 
So my question is how can I proceed from this? Do you think I have a chance? Please be sincere, your response is very much appreciated!

Totally similar experience. Graduated senior who seems like he is sometimes interested and sometimes not. So i went ahead and flashed a big hint and got back a hint thats reflects his disinterest. 

My advice is: if you have to guess, he's probably not interested. Some guys are just enthu and random in nature. It's gonna be obvious to a girl if a guy likes her. You can still try though, well at least you tried even if it doesn't work. But our friendship was awkward after and we haven't been talking for months. So, it's all about risk taking and whether you feel comfortable and appropriate to confess. Good luck!

I hear advices about falling with a second person when you are still in relationship with the first one and deciding which one is the one you should follow. They quote Johnny Depp “If you love two people at the same time, choose the second. Because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn't have fallen for the second.”

It really kills me when I think back. I was in LDR with a guy back home and then kind of fell for a freshie in my 2nd year. I treated my bf really bad, never answer his sms or Facebook message and eventually we broke up. Things went on with the freshie for around 1-2 months and we realised we were not meant to be together.

Well they say in love, follow your heart, and yeah I did, but then the important thing is know what you are doing, what is the thing that worth doing.

Now I'm a single happy guy taking a break in this stressful exam period and wondering what I should do next for my love life.

I was a bit too late to jump on the grad trip bandwagon cos I was too concerned about finding a job. Surprisingly I did find a job before graduation and now I got 2 months of holiday. Most of friends have pretty much made their own travel plans with their own friends which makes it hard for me to just join in. Anyone else eager to travel anywhere? Maybe we can work something out!

 it's normal. Can you get hard when you masturbate? if yes, it's a psychological problem. Next time can try to drink some wine in advance and you will be more relax when you do it.

Seeing lots of posts about bad CAP. Just wondering, where is exactly the line to draw to determine if your CAP is good or bad?

Mother's day is coming so ill share my story. I grew a pot of herb. They are small about 1-2 months old but edible like basil. This morning my mother asked if she could cut a few leaves for cooking. Sure I said. But I came home to 5 stumps because my mother cut all of them.

Anyway at first I was sad and feeling dumb. This is my mother's way of reminding me:
1. If you love something that much never trust another person to take care of it. 
2. Someone whom you love and trust can and will betray you, even if they are suppose to be kind, loving, etc.

So to all of you out there who has a lovely mother, appreciate her more often. As for me, I guess should just suck it up and plant a new pot.

I saw a few post saying that their majors are not that well known in NUS. When I am from a major that most people don't even know existed in NUS.  #computationalbiology

 I was in a similar situation like yours but worse. We were dating, not in a relationship yet. So yeah, we attempted it but I didn't get hard. 

I guess that was the deal breaker cause we didn't talk after that. I guess nobody wants to talk about such awkward stuff right.

I've been blaming myself ever since. If only I got hard... The funny thing was I really wanted sex but I just couldn't get it up. I guess this is where being a virgin kills: your nerves will wreck you. Or maybe I was too tired then. Or maybe I'm overwhelmed that I'm the inexperienced one and she's the experienced one.... I guess there are too many reasons. But the fact that I failed to get it up means it's ultimate my fault :/

Hey NUS Whispers, I'm really enjoying the confessions so far! Here's some feedback:
1. Your site needs a feedback button. I don't see one on your site, so I had to post a public confession.
2. You could lengthen the duration between posts. It's hard to keep up at the diarrhoeal rate at which the posts are coming out. It would be easier to follow if they came out less regularly and also keep your site active longer.
3. The Like button on the site is broken for me. I can't seem to click it to add my like. Is it the same for everyone?

Otherwise, great job with the site! I also like the bot which lets me keep track of confess-versations.

I did not attend the last two tutorials for a module as I was busy rushing my FYP. I thought no one would be willing to share the answers with me as it was a dog-eat-dog world.

I was so desperate that I added an acquaintance in class on Facebook and asked him for it. He was extremely nice and sent me the answers.  I wanted to repay him for the favour but he replied that "help is freely given". 

I'm extremely touched by his kind gesture. Hope that we all do well for our paper tomorrow (:

I'm a Year 1 bizad gal. There's this year 1 biz guy who class parts so much during the sem I took notice of him. Eloquent and humorous guy. Quite fair, think he's in usp. Rarely see him around, but when I do I feel happy. Anyone knows if he's attached?

I'm new to relationships but I am interested with someone and we are in very good terms. However,  I find myself as someone who always thinks about things like complexities of life, analyzing things and stuff. She,  on the other hand,  is someone that takes life easy and simple. While we always have things to talk about and we are on quite good terms,  I feel that I'm not able to hold conversations that I usually ponder in my head. Should I continue?  I'm afraid that I'm going to a point where I'm unintentionally "expecting" her to be there for me when I overflow or something, and it might end in disappointment. But I'm not sure if I need someone who can compliment me and be there to slow me down and appreciate life as it is either...

(This confession is long, but if you want the summary: don't feel bad, 加油 for exams, think about life, read the bottom!)

I am a recent alumnus from FoS. I still remember NUS Confessions and I think NUSWhispers is awesome.

Admittedly, after reading social media, it's likely that one  might not be very happy with myself. You might ask why. One could feel:
- envious because others have already got attached but one is left on the shelf.
- backward because others have A+ and A for their modules but one needs to be content with the B+.
- ill-prepared because others have already got life's journey worked out but not one.

But this is social media, friends. There may be trolls running around dissing you, or claiming some other friend is trying to square you up. There are friends of mine who probably posted confessions that turn out to be relationship wreckers more than actual confessions. Sometimes I don't even know if the anonymous CLB incidents were even legit --- I thought PGP was more secluded, or say... near the bus park.

I still remember, when NUS Confessions first started in 2012, it also had such elements. People ranting, confessing real and supposed acts of intimacy and well, frustration with modules. (History check: https://www.facebook.com/nusconfessions?fref=ts). It's a nice experiment with social anonymity: with anonymous postings, what do people make out of that? Apparently, pretty much everything under the sun. In all good fun, I believe it shows the nice side of NUS (with the exception of some trolls who jab a majority of posts). NUS students come together to diss trolls, call out rubbish behaviour confessed by some arrogant punk, celebrate the overcoming of the bell curve god. Sometimes, it shows the ugly side of us: dominating the walls, writing rubbish that no one benefits from reading, not even a good laugh. But these are far and few. 

For people who feel pissed at what you may read, it's a good idea to stop comparing. Social media has always, and will be tinted. People always report the good stuff, hide away the bad stuff, and only on an anonymous platform may one see some of the not-so-nice stuff online. It's funny reading posts like  (how to manipulate),  (silly thoughts),  (probably a shy jock),  (sad but real advice),  (self-apologetic),  (untruth),  (real feeling --- I was like this before),  (trivial stuff making one smile),  (advice from some probably damn old alumnus from SoC),  (actually some debate over NUSSU, phew!),  (desperado, I understand your pain),  (blast to the past),  (satirical),  (serial replier),  (nice guy explaining the grading),  (awwww moment),  (continue discussing about worth of a grad please!) and more (lazy to scroll). Darn, now I feel like I am testing the bot, which will tirelessly fish out all these confessions. Yay to computing.

If one takes a step back, actually we're a cool bunch of people. We joke about trying to overtake the next guy on the bell curve, but recognise we're still friends outside the exam hall. We whine, curse about the serial farting king, but certainly laugh it all off. For a university, this is pretty darn lively and warm culture.

Fast forward to me: currently I work at a bank (cannot say which one, otherwise my boss will tell me to do more work and not post confession!), and life IS stressful outside. Pay is sustenance but at times, one's sanity is called into question. Do we really want to work that long hour simply because we have a job to protect? Unfortunately we do. As a student, I could sometimes just say, heck, let's keep the work for tomorrow. Life can be crushing sometimes; people fight just for the next rung on the ladder, but the battles are much more brutal than those on the bell curve --- backstabbing is common. Consequences are aplenty: the careless folk can be easily sabotaged and manipulated. The workplace is harsh.

I miss NUS, even though some people say it's just a place to mug for 3/4/5 years and then bye. It's really short, come to think of it, considering that the average person now will have to work for 40 years odd.

Sigh, I feel so old now.

Ok, maybe the specific replies I have to some:
- To the employers who posted here, thank you for the time and effort. But I think the young should be given a chance to prove themselves. I think the typical Singaporean is demanding, but when called to the fore, will step up to do something good. NUSWhispers is an example: for a module, they go over and beyond.
- To the sexually depraved: go get a life. Free sex stories is it? Even if we read it, we don't really know if we should envy you or ermmm... think you're just trying to make us all jealous.
- To the CAP 2.0 folk: take heart. It is hard to get a job the traditional way, but there may be other ways to make it big in life. Do you have a skill outside academics? Hone it, and maybe it'll be your lifeline.
- To the chasing: all the best. It is hard, fraught with rejections, but hopefully you'll do well.
- To the chased: play a little hard to get, but don't drive your queue nuts!
- NUSWhispers: Thank you for posting this confession. It's probably the longest confession, but I hope it has been worth your time reading this.

(P.S. I wish I had better Chinese. It might be something not graded anymore, but bad Chinese really hurts chances at going to China.)

All the best for the final exams! It's quite silly to say may you be on the right side of the curve (since half will be left), but I should say, may all do well and prosper. ;)

I like a guy from biz. He have a girlfriend but still hugs me in hall. I know he is a player and not a boyfriend material, but I think I have something for him. What should I do.

I'm a girl from SOC who just finished her last final exams in NUS. Looks and figure wise, I consider myself slightly above average only but not so much that I attract too much attention generally except in SOC. I would probably be nothing if I'm in FASS. Even so, let me recall dating record, 7 propositions from guys in SOC throughout my 4 years, one from FASS and one from Business. I dated 2 guys from SOC for just 6 months in total, FASS guy for 6 months and the Business guy for my final year. We are still together.
Now, this is generalisation, but I feel being in a male-dominated faculty like SOC or Engin really makes me feel like a piece of meat being mentally undressed wherever I go for classes. I seemed to get most of the attention and hence switch off from SOC guys totally. All the SOC guys who propositioned me are either ugly immature nerds or are just plain jocks who chose SOC only because it was the only course they could get with their results. There seems to be a variance between the the number of eye-candies in Business/FASS vs Computing/Engin.
I dated the 2 guys in the hope that their hearts are better than their outside appearances. Sadly, it was not the case. They are more willing to spend time understanding their video games and computers more than they spent understanding me or women in general. Come on, even though unlike most girls, I know programming and algorithms, must you discuss those topics again outside class? Women are not like logical machines, we need the emotional connection.
Dress sense in SOC is clearly no where near the league as in Business for example. Even on important presentations, most of you dress worse than a Business student in his slackest days. In fact, I got weird comments for overdressing when my group of guys chose to present in their shorts and slippers.
I find Business and FASS guys way more articulate and mature. Their command of English seems light years ahead compared to the stuttering nerds. Business guys especially, seem to have the aura of ambition that SOC students seem to lack. They can voice out their inner thoughts and emotions much better, know how to cheer me up when I'm down etc. It seems all the SOC guys are horny copies of each other whereas the non-Science guys have a more unique flavour to them. About the FASS guy, it was only because his parents didn't approve of us because of differing religions.
Fitness wise, I seem to feel that Computing guys are not as physically fit in general. I know they are exceptions so don't flame me, its just that the majority are short, skinny, nerdy dudes who seriously need more time out in the sun and on the track than behind the screen. Business guys seem to be taller, more buff and give me the feeling of protection.
Oh and finally the fun part, the sex bit. I admit my sample size is small, but from the 4 guys I had, the FASS guy was the most creative (sorry my bf, but thats true) followed by my current bf with the 2 SOC guys far behind. I chalk it up to them being inexperienced virgins and if they have, its probably from porn. I know the argument, you can't get better without more experience but seriously as a girl with modern sexual needs, I don't care about your excuse of me being your first gf. It just proves how much of a loser you are for being a virgin or having your first relationship only in Uni. Either you give me a good time or I show you the door, the fairer sex is the one that decides when to spread our legs for you so we make the rules. My rule is that you don't waste my time learning on the job, you better know how to do yours before you start. Your learning should have started on innocent girls from your JC or poly. Imagine applying for a a fresh grad job when you are in your 40s. Uni girls like me have higher expectations of sex as we climb the academic ladder and gain more sexual experience.
So as a piece of advice to girls in NUS, date FASS and business guys. They are more mature, posses greater awareness of the real world outside the land of the Matrix and communicate better with you. Poor communication in a relationship is as good as bad or no communication. Sex with SOC guys, totally cmi, feel more like an emotionless porn actress after the act.
For my final advice to my male SOC mates before I leave, watch less porn and jerk off less, it is not only bad for you, its totally inaccurate. Dress better, go to the gym more often, take up those CELC speaking and writing classes then maybe you stand a better chance with women in the dating game. Remember, computers don't propagate your genes, women do.
#from a girl who actually feels disadvantaged in the dating game in the land of nerdy guys with so few eye-candies.

One of those awesome things about being a loner - I can do all the odd stuff I want. I wander off to places where I can hide, and I don't feel the need to make a conscious effort to fit in. I don't need to be around large groups of people, which makes me extremely stressed for some reason. 

However, having said that, it does feel very lonely to be a loner. I don't interact well with people, I cannot make jokes like many other people, I seem highly unapproachable and creepy because of the odd things I do, and the odd behaviours I exhibit, when I am under stress.

I don't mind company, but I do mind the fact that I feel obliged to try to entertain my company, by constantly trying to talk to the person. If you attempt to reach out to me suddenly, I really don't know how to react and give a proper response.

At this juncture, it really does seem that the best company for me is a probably a Lego figurine, or a stuffed toy.

I'm on my journey of self-discovery.

I've recently found a girlfriend, and I've never been happier than before now, but we don't dare to make it public because we're afraid that people will judge us, since she's both older than me and a poly graduate, and might be seen by my parents and friends as "uneducated", while I come from a somewhat better educational background...

Before matriculating, I thought that I'd get into a relationship pretty quick, judging from the hive of activity 'confessed' at NUS Confessions. Now I'm a 3rd year engineering student still looking for my love...

Phases of reading week study:
Phase 0: Not paying attention during the semester
Phase 1: "Why is PYP so hard"
Phase 2: "Hey this is actually so easy to understand why the lecturer didn't explain it like this YouTube video"
Phase 3: "oh shyt..."

When someone you have never met before joined your project group, the first thing you should do is to add them on Steam.

Got this groupmate who always says he is busy, but when rest of the team is working on the project, we always see him entering Dota2. 

Now, he's known as the Dota Guy

is NUS harder than NTU?

 I am indeed sorry to hear of your predicament.

I am a guy, and certainly have not gone to the point of having a bf/gf relationship. I understand what you are going through. It is very hurtful, and hard to confess to anyone because of the stigmatisation towards human pleasure.

Just don't get into trouble. Some guys would love this kind of girl, take full advantage and leave you with big trouble later. ;)

My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me today and I still have one more paper at 2pm. She asked me to view her confession at Whispers. It's amazing how she conveniently mention we didn't have sex. Oh please, you enjoy it so much at CLB when we were doing our IS3102 project. I hope your husband won't mind that you are not a virgin. Thanks for leaving me.

 I find you cute, but I am not ready to start a relationship. Sorry.

 I'm sorry to hear of the long-distance relationship failing. I am one of those who tried one after my boyfriend went over to Cambridge. It seemed to work out for one semester, but it got increasingly difficult to keep up.

Unfortunately for you, I think I know the guy you speak of personally. If I may be correct, he is indeed harsh, hard to talk to and strange. He may be smart but has so many faults that I don't know where to start from. I was so pissed with debating with him over something in a particular module before that I was left disgusted with his attitude.

Moreover, now that I am chasing someone close to him, he tries every way and mean to disturb me. I'm not saying he's bad, but you must be careful to not get the "wrong impression".

All the best for 03 and 04!

In everybody's life, they are the 'stars'. They are the main characters. They are the ones who will find love, do things, amazing things... They are the ones with all the excitement and joy. They are the ones who will overcome the obstacles, and should they fail, die some honorary death. Some heroic burial.

Yet, most fail to notice that not everyone can be the main character. Not everyone can be the hero. If everyone were the hero, who's the villain? If everyone were the best lovers, then who would lose in a love triangle? Who would have their hearts broken, and not mended? Who would be stranded alone, forgotten...? And who will be left to wilt in a corner? Who will slowly disappear? Whose mark would be the faintest? And everyone says, "Not mine."

For every Princess to find her Prince, there must have been a lot of suitors cast aside. There must be countless other admirers, who will remain as nothing but admirers. They will be others, won't there?

And perhaps, for them to find their Princes, I must remain as nothing... Nothing but an admirer. Nothing but a flower left to wilt in the pot at the corner of the garden. Nothing but forgotten. Nothing but faded away...

And this is so that they will live their happily-ever-afters.

I regretted giving my virginity to you. I'm starting to lose hope in this relationship. In the past, you will always pay attention to all my emotional needs and you will never yell at me. However, everything changed after I gave my first time to you. You became cold and really nasty to me, when i called you in the middle of the night and started crying, you just say that you are tired and hang up the phone. 

My dad and mummy knew that I'm crying a lot lately, but i refused to tell them what happened. They are really worried for me. I need to find the courage to leave you and start a new life.

Getting really envious of my friends who are getting attached one by one. I've never been in a r/s so i cant help but feel lonely. I want to feel loved by someone, have someone that loves me for who i am. But, being plus-sized and not having a pretty face just brings the chances all the way down. I even tried going online to make friends but nothing worked out. Even a text buddy is so hard to find. I never told all these to my friends because i dont want to get judged by them. But in all honesty, i really am lonely. In addition to this, my low self-esteem just makes me feel even more worthless and pathetic. Even worse, Im already in yr 2 and my results are horrible (cap of 2+). I just really dont have the motivation to study anymore. Nothing is going smoothly in my life, i dont know when it will be. I know i should just wait patiently for that "someone" to appear in my life, but right now, i just really want someone to talk to, someone to understand whatever i am going through.

some people don't know how to take a hint. when you say no to a favour, but indirectly and nicely, they don't understand :(  i hate to say no flat out and i don't know how to do it nicely. any advice?

I like one of my guy friend and I think he likes me too. but don't think he is interested in having a relationship now. Most probably he will not make any move. What do I do? My mindset is girls should not make the first move.
-
  
To  I just wanna say that this is such an overgeneralisation because I have friends who are in stable relationships and this sustains their mental health and happiness and by extension their CAP. 

On the other hand, there are singles who suffer from unrequited love and such problems are no less hurtful to the self than those with relationship problems. Try studying for exams while also trying to forget that someone with whom you know won't work out. 
-
  
I hate almost everyone. That's why I flip flop between being really nice and kinda cold, based on impulse. You think it's you, but really it's just my mood.
I look nothing like my more crude, more heck personality. :p
I think one of my profs is attracted to me.
I love studying in the early mornings after 2am. I hate staying up past 10pm.

Is it possible to juggle a relationship and/or go out for dates while maintaining a good CAP? It seems like the people who are doing well and have their shit together are usually single people who are not embroiled in relationship troubles and therefore, actually have the time to sit down and study...

I lost faith in love after I broke up with my ex. 
Even when there are nice guys with good personality around me or chasing me, I have no interest in them, no interest in having a relationship. Instead, I think having friendship with benefits is enough. I guess that makes you think I am a wh*re or b*tch. However, when sex is involved only, there is no expectation, no jealousy, no commitment, no disappointment, purely just the pleasure you have at that moment. I am a girl who used to treat love as the most beautiful thing on earth just like every other little girl would. After that breakup, it really changed my life and my perspective on love and I guess... I will never go back again.

I am in a stable relationship now, but from time to time, I can't help but reminisce about a fling I had with this girl. She was quite hot, smart, made our encounters really passionate and gave me a few good memorable months. Even now, I still can't forget her in her lacy dress and we [fill in the blank with your own imagination].

Alas, she is just fling material and was never someone I considered for the long term. I think she probably wanted something *slightly* longer-term than a fling, but things came to a point where it had to end.

I have no doubt that if she were to come back to me now, I would still choose my current girlfriend without any hesitation. Sure, my current girlfriend may not bring me to those passionate highs, but at the very least I know she is a keeper. Yet, sometimes I just can't help my fantasize...

Well, I guess everyone has taboo dreams/fantasies. As long as we don't act on them, it should be okay. Hopefully.

hello im  the one who feels lonely and worthless.

thank you for all the comments and encouragements, it made me feel better. virtual hugs back to you! really heartwarming that nuswhispers can also be a platform to encourage and spur one another :)

actually huh... i know why guys are rejected by girls most of the time - because they always go for the exceptionally pretty girl, i'm an ugly girl myself and I've noticed that for every girl who looks decently pretty there are about 6 other girls who are not so pretty, and guess what? given the one to one ratio of guys to girls, around 5 guys will fall for the one pretty girl and there'll be 4 rejections.. (more rejections than successful confession) yeah I know that some guys don't fall for girls just because of her looks but you can see for yourself that most anonymous confessions will always have something that goes along the lines of "she's so cute/pretty/gorgeous" or some vague reference to the way she looks when she smiles etc
anyway the thing is, guys will always fall for that one exceptional girl who stands out above the rest of the girls in some way or another be it beauty or personality or whatever, and duh, do the math and you'll find out that if you get rejected multiple times, know that this is absolutely normal since the number of rejections will always be higher than the number of successful confessions

Fell in love with this guy from Eusoff. He's so nice and yada yada and the good news is he isn't attached. Bad news? I've seen him around a few times already yet he doesn't even seem to notice me. How do I know him better? Do I go up to him and talk? But isn't that too obvious that I'm interested? We're acquaintances. (Eusoff guys? Comments please? Maybe one of them is you and I'll know what to do.)
-
  
 It's the same OP here! Thanks for your help guys! All the best for finals and may the force be with us all. 

P.S. The post modernist damsel doesn't feel that she was crude. One does not simply care about being gentile when one is in a state of panic. Ain't nobody got time for that. -inserts imaginary potato-

I'm falling for this girl I got to know a few months ago through a friend. She is from another uni so I rarely get to meet her but from the times we talked I thought we clicked quite well and she at least has a decent opinion of me. The thing is she was attached at least until last year and I don't know if she still is. Would it be weird to ask her directly? I'm hesitant to ask our mutual friends because I prefer not to let too many people know about this sort of things

If you are scratching your head and wondering why your girlfriend is giving you attitude problems.
Let me shed some light, im the one behind pull the strings. 

Remember the day when you rejected me? I told you that i will make your life miserabl

There are so many guys and so little girls in FoE. I always wonder how some guys get to have cliques with relatively equal guy-girl ratio. I hope they are not taking the ladies for granted because many are surely dying to be in their shoes

To be honest, I can say my grade is damn good which makes me quite worried if I cant achieve what I expect

I was trying to start an herb garden a few years ago. That may sound trivial, but it was after my dog died and it was sort of symbolic for me.

Anyway, I was having trouble getting the herbs to grow. I followed all the instructions and even looked things up online, but I just couldn't get it going very well. Most of the herbs were half dead after a couple of months. They were hanging in there, but by no means flourishing. I was having particular trouble with one plant that I really coddled and tried so hard to get it to hang on, but this was becoming my cat all over again. It was heartbreaking.

Then come this year, I decided to enrol into School of Computing . I finally understood through the magic of algorithms and stuff. That what really matters is that you try, and if your heart is in it, any victory is all the more powerful. I was in tears by the end of the last lecture. I finally let go of the guilt about my dog's death; I felt this great release of pressure from my chest as I accepted that sometimes pets die no matter how hard you try. I felt like I was breathing for the first time, and my tears were like letting loose years of pressure.

I immediately went into my backyard and looked over my herb garden. I had tried, and that was what mattered. Everything was still alive, but the point was that I had put in the effort to make it flourish, not that it actually had flourished. I looked at that one stubborn herb plant and finally let go. I was done obsessing over a stupid plant. Thank you, School of Computing.

TL;DR - SoC helped me through a rough thyme

To  and Computing people, can you guys stop claiming you are underpaid and be contented with your $4k pay? My starting pay is only $2.8k just like , and I have to work longer hours and handle more accounts and paperwork than you guys who just to have to type on keyboards all day.
-
  
To  Take care, I know how it feels when it feels like your partner never has time for you, and slots you in as last priority. I got lucky and found someone who values time together after that failed relationship; keep faith that you will too. 
-
  
I keep finding out that my peers are attached even they don't look like they are. Sometimes I wish I have a boyfriend too, but I have never had any crush on anyone before. Totally evergreen eh?
-
  
I'm kinda concerned over my personal social skills. In a group I can sometimes be funny, sharp, and witty, but when alone with another it's just awkward and unnatural.

Especially so with girls.
-
  
The only reason I'm hanging on is because I'm convinced nobody will ever fancy me as much as you do. And for that I feel like a rotten fool.
-
  
I am shy and introverted and I take rather long to warm up to people. I told myself that when I come into uni, I will take extra effort to make more friends and be more friendly. However, after a year, I find it so tiring because it’s not working and I get so disappointed when the number of acquaintances I have increases, but none of whom I will share my problems with/ contact after graduation. My esteem issues isn’t helping either. Even though I recognize many people and some whom ive briefly met before, I convince myself that no one knows me and that im not memorable/ worthy to be talked to compared to all the other popular ppl ard the fac. 
Even though I join activites, many of the people there already know each other from the start, thus it's hard to join in their circle. 
It’s not that im unwilling to open up, but I just need the time to do so.
Parents are also divorced and sigh just feel so lonely everyday. 
Anyway all the best for finals everyone :) Just gotta rant a little.  

-
  
To  
Wow, super similar to my uni life :/ Cheer up, don't put yourself down :) I know how it sucks to have a dysfunctional family.. only difference is that my parents are not (yet) divorced. 
Maybe we could be friends! :)

-
  
To  : Trust me when I say that many people feel that way, and you are definitely not alone in that sense. I know it's hard, but try not to let other people determine your self-worth. Perhaps, even the so-called popular people have problems of their own that are masked with smiles. YOU are worthy. Here's a *virtual hug* from me to you, whoever you are. :)
-
  
'Life is unpredictable', ah yes this passe saying.

Imagine the glee when you realise that you only had 5 pages to do for each reading.

Imagine the glee when you realise that your reading isn't compulsory.

Imagine the glee when you realise you had 20 readings and you are nowhere near done.

Who needs a girlfriend when you're fucked by CS1010E everyday

Sometimes I want to write a confession...but then, I'm afraid someone will recognise me...

I lost my virginity today to CS2106.
-
  
Bad day today- the guy I like is involved with someone else, the job interview today went really bad.. I feel so depressed. I feel that I am prepared for questions, like I have knowledge and all that, but then interview goes really bad. Can you guys suggest something for improvement? 
-
  
 You can't change the past and what happened in the interview. Life is funny sometimes, perhaps you were meant to be with another better guy and a better job then the one you just went interview for. We all have bad days where we are off form but life is full of opportunities and chances, so learn from whatever failures and make tomorrow a better day :)

 If it is tiring and not working out for you, you should take a break. It's more important to have few good quality close friends than many random acquaintances. We are all weird in our own unique way and we are worthy, You just need to find the people who can connect with you. Keep going and i'm sure you will have close friends that will be with you for life :)

 We all have our own demons and battles to fight. Hope keeps us alive and keep fighting for a better tomorrow :)

 Life is full of regrets, don't add to that list of regrets. Just go for it, what's there to lose? No risk, no reward :)

 You don't need to wait for signs that someone likes you, have faith in yourself and if you really like that someone go for it. :) 
-
  
Why are guys(sg guys in particular) so timid? So many confessions about cute girls and how they've missed out on opportunities to get to know them. What's the worst that could happen? She ignores you and then? In that case, you did yourself a favour as she was definitely not worth your time. What could come out of it THOUGH, is perhaps a great friendship and even more.  
-
  
There is a girl that used to be in the same tutorial class as me, and occasionally we see each other and she never fails to smile at me if we notice each other. However, I am always caught by surprise and I don't get to smile back at her. I always wanted to approach her because I find her really cute but I don't have the courage. One day maybe.
-
  
What are some of the signs that someone likes you? clueless evergreen here :(

I love to go people watching at biz library. 
Hot guys and hot girls available.

I admit, I am beginning to fall for a batch mate of mine in freshman Chemistry. He sounds harsh, normally difficult to talk to, but he is quite smart and personally, his kind of strange character is what I find fascinating in guys compared to the typical Singaporean.

I used to have an American boyfriend until he went back to Boston to do his undergrad studies, and a long-distance relationship didn't work up.

I know you read the Whispers page because you comment a lot. Just know there's someone who likes you even if people all find you weird. And I know you're single, your friend told me. :)
-
  
Hey buddy. I had enough of you, bragging about your sexual relationships with your gf. Do you know that everytime when you bring out this topic, i'm mocking you deep inside my heart. I guess your gf didn't tell you that i'm her ex? Truth to be told, whatever position that you mention, i have already done it with her. Moreover,we have done more stuff together which you never tried before. I'm the one who took away all her 1st time, while you are merely a 2nd hand owner. 

Im LOL-ing at you. Have fun playing my discarded toy. LOSER

Although many might say engineering has a lot of guys and even the average looking girls would have experienced a fair share of attention, so far in my first year I was only approached by guys from other faculties. 
-
  
Why are there so little girls in engin? I'm a girl and I have yet to find a girlfriend to confide in 
-
  
I don't want to be tied down to a relationship, but sometimes I just miss the intimacy and level of connection.
Maybe I just need a cuddle buddy. 
-
  
It's hard being a woman but every time my boyfriend tries to hide his erm... "excitement" when I tease him, I'm silently glad I'm one.
-
  
Honestly, I really don't have anything else to keep me going.

My family is a mess, and I suck at academics despite my trying my very best. 
Maybe some people are just meant to be losers.

Is it considered as cheating if someone starts looking at the questions even before the exam starts? Saw someone doing this today..felt really annoyed

OP of 
i posted  and i think u really need to talk to ur partner because i don't think we're the same person, =.=" personally, i would never have been mad at u for not replying when driving home from my place.

continuation:
we did break up. i initiated it because i realized even though i may be able to cope with this now, i won't be able to do so for the rest of my life.

maybe u'd be a 'drama queen' too (why assume i'm female? stereotyping much!) if for eg, u went thru something traumatic like loss of a loved one or discovery of some terrible health condition and ur 'life partner' wasn't there with/for u. cannot even be reached by calling. and when u finally reached him/her by call/text, he/she refuses to come find you or even let u find him/her. cos he/she is busy w smth that isn't u, or he/she just doesn't want to leave the house or wdvr. for ur sake, despite ur judgemental comment, i hope u don't ever have to understand what i mean thru' actual experience.

There are two kinds of FCH: the overachiever, and the no-lifer graduating with nothing but a good CAP. Being the latter, it sucks.

Goodbye NUS, I hardly knew ye.
-
  
He was already attached before we met. As time passed by, I found out that we have a lot in common and,  eventually, that I had feelings for him. Sometimes I find myself wishing that he's single so that I can have a chance. But I guess that's just selfish, I should just wish for his happiness. 
-
  
Day 6 of NoFap; feeling good about it so far :) Hope I can continue to keep it up (or rather, not).

Hi, I am a girl. 
Why some guys like me? 
Because I am confident and I love myself.
-
  
Tomorrow will be my last paper and my last day as a student in nus.

And most importantly it's "my last day as your girl friend"

I admit that i have used you as a stepping stone. 3 years ago you came into my life when im struggling with my grades. You will always offer your unconditional help to me. I know your feelings towards me and I decided to exploit it. I don't have any feelings for you. You are not my type to begin with. Geeky...clumsy..boring
However you are a great tool when it comes to school work, for the past 3 years.

Yeah. Now that you have seen my true colours. I hope you have learnt a valuable lesson in life. You didn't lose out much actually... I did compensate you with kisses and cuddles, excluding sex ofcourse.
I would give reasons like im not ready etc.

Good bye my dear. Recover soon.

-
  
I am the one who wrote . I understand the point of me being unreasonable, that's why i am trying to hold on to this relationship. But what if my boyfriend said something like this to me:
"There's not much different being with you than being single" 

-
  
I am an evergreen girl that likes being single. Friends around me are getting attached and they keep telling me that I should "experience attached life". I don't deny that I sometimes wished that I had a boyfriend, but not because I am desperate, just a little... curious. 
-
  
It's exam period. But I can't help thinking about the girl from my class whom I offended instead of befriending. Just thinking how we could have been friends hailing from similar backgrounds... What I fool I've been, to screw things up by not being myself.
-
  
My first and only crush got a boyfriend. Honestly, I'm broken. But I just act like it doesn't affect me because I don't want her to feel burdened. 

But everyday, I pray and pray they'll break up someday. 

Am I being mean? :( 
-
  
>Be me
>University student
>Spend most of my time by myself
>Had always a crush on this girl
>Didn't know how to tell her or approach her
>I sit by her in tutorials 
>Noticed how she would smile and say hi to me sometimes before class
>I decide to talk to her one day
>Need something really good to say
>Early one day before class starts I sit next to her
Ease myself closer to her, she is looking at me
>Look at her and say, "A-are you sitting on the F5-key babe, cause your ass looks refreshing"
>Everyone staring at me, apparently I yelled it
>Very calmly, she leans over and whispers in my ear
>"E for effort, but this is not real"
>"Now go back and read the first letter of each line"
-
  
I scared myself reading the confessions about girlfriends accidentally getting pregnant because my girlfriend and I always "gets it on" without protection. I panicked and wondered if she could be hiding a pregnancy from me and I was about to talk to her about it until I realised.... We are both girls. Silly me. 
-
  
the friends arnd me are too smart and it just gets really depressing. they can answer each others qns when i don't even get what they're talking about (LOL) 

am i the only one who feels this way? 
-
  
1265, no one can ever be "too busy". It just about the priorities.
-
  
 Please kindly break up with your boyfriend. He deserves better.
-
  
yes, u're absolutely right. u're just simply too busy, too busy to tell me u're busy, to be there when I needed u, to be there at the phone. it is simple really. even factual. u can't text or wdvr when u're ...

rushing for time
eating a meal
out with friends
out with family
showering
brushing your teeth
working
in a lesson
in a group meeting
doing lab work
driving
talking to somebody
sleeping
doing your tutorials and assignments
doing your projects
revising
....

and of course, also when u're chilling alone (because that's UR alone time). so yeah, u're busy. real busy. forever busy. it is all legit. i can't even deny. u only look for me when u're 'free'. like when u're bored. if wht u're looking for is just companionship, someone to fill ur lonely days, then what u're looking at, me, isn't when u're looking for. cos i want a life partner. not someone who conveniently forgets my needs and desires when u're 'busy'.

Any ideas how to celebrate first anniversary?

Dear prof Ben,
You advise students to marry the right person. Then how do you define a "right" person, I meant how do I know if my current gf is the right person for me.

Everyone thinks I'm a mugger...but in fact, I only feel like mugging when I'm around with others, and i barely did much work these few days studying alone. Worse still, finals are coming and I don't feel worried at all...
-
  
 I don't know who you are, who you might be or what. Just know someone is out there who believes you'll overcome whatever that you may be facing.
-
  
To , I am exactly in the same situation but we are boys, we hardly talk to each other after that. I just want to love, that's all, but maybe it's hard. I think I will leave my love gradually disappear within the air. I am looking forward to the summer vacation and I will find who I really am. 
I'm glad to know that we are both experiencing the same thing. How magic the world is! Study well for your finals.
-
  
I'm attached but I have a really close lady friend whom I MAY have the hots for and I've only met her this sem. I love my girlfriend and I'm really confused about my own feelings.. Any advice?
-
  
My friends think I'm a mugger but actually, I have afternoon naps everyday at home. So I guess I deserve it if I fail my exams?
-
  
I dream that one day, I can have a normal family, a loving wife, and two kids. But then again, my CAP's already in jeopardy,and I don't exactly have the ideal character, so... I guess I'll be alone for quite some time, or maybe til I end up in my grave.
-
  
That awkward moment when you are studying for GEK 1064 and realize the symptoms for depression and schizophrenia applies to yourself :/ Now too sad to revise the other chapters 
-
  
, 
Tell me about it. My family by far is screwed up in a mess of cancer and divorce issues. Sometimes I feel that depression and exam stress do not relieve me much from existing problems.
-
  
Hey, I know I should be studying now. But I can't. I fell in love with my own best friend (we are both girls). I guess I figured it out when we were hugging in my room and I ended up kissing her lips. We were both laughed and thought it was an accident. But I lied to her and actually I did it on purpose. That happened several times. And now we still like to hugs and kiss each other cheeks. There is no point confessing as she said she is straight and she had boyfriends before.
-
  
There's this dude who I used to hang out all the time when we're still a freshie. Being who I am, I thought he was a pretty nice person to hang out with. We're always having lunches with our clique of friends and attending lectures together. Nothing changed until one of my guy friends asked me what's going on between both of us (which I denied) and told me that that dude was a great guy. And... I begun to see him in a different viewpoint. There were times when he would tease me and argue with me. But there was specifically one time when he just wanted me to acknowledge that he is a nice guy. What does that mean?! Am I overthinking too much? Because slowly, I think I am crushing on him. >.<
-
  
To 
Please lah! Conversation related to studies and work can be interesting too. Not every girl is so stupid and superficial. 

I was attracted to my bf because he is so charming when he talks about his studies and work.

The worst thing about breaking up is losing a best friend.

I wonder will NUSWhispers remain so active after the exam period... 
-
  
There's this girl that has been chasing me for a while now. She's asked me out like 3-4 times, keeps throwing compliments my way, and gets quite jealous when I so much as talk to other girls; asking me stuff like "Do you like X" when i sit next to X in class, and so on. The only thing is that I have no romantic interest in her; we became friends only because of a shared hobby. 

I keep turning down her advances, but she seems to be unwilling or unable to take the hint. How do I get her to stop chasing me? I don't want to hurt her feelings by telling her bluntly, but I fear there may be no other alternative...
-
  
I have a boyfriend that are currently in army. I love him very much but i am not sure whether he still do.. He dont treat me like he used to anymore. Like He rather play dota than visit me when i am sick and He is always playing app games when we were together. There are much more to tell but that will be too long. We have been together for more than 3 years and I am hoping is because of army stress. But It feels so sad. I do not want to break up but what if he really do not love me anymore? I have tried communicating with him but all he do was avoid the topic or get angry. Should i tolerate or should i just break up:,(

Interesting advice from a room mate: Don't dive straight into a relationship. Unless you are rich.

That weird feeling that, while you're walking to your tutorial, the group of ladies in your tutorial class whom you've not spoken to the whole sem starts saying hi to you... That was weird. Makes you think, did I do something weird again last week? Wait, what did I do last week?

Can we have a "Haolian"/"Boast" category for confessions? I think there are too damn many boastful confessions especially after seeing the MA1506-related confessions.
-
  
What to do if I have an overly-attached Ex-gf who keeps pestering me even though she went back to her former boyfriend? I keep trying to be nice, by emphasizing on a clean break, and giving some advice to help get her feet up after the break-up. Come 6 months later, she still insists we meet up. What should I do? What does she want from me...
-
  
Broke up for more than half a year. We both moved on - she has a boyfriend; I am pretty sure I don't want her back. 

But sometimes, I miss how we used to talk. Is it a good idea to ask her out (just to catch up), or leave her be? How many of you still keep in contact with your ex?

In order to prevent yourself from falling into friendzone, you have to pick up flirting skills. If your conversation with the girl are mainly related to studies, school etc. and nothing else, you will never ever break the "friend barrier". Girls do not like to hear all these boring topics. Entice them with exaggerating sweet talks even though it may not be true. 

There's a saying, " Girls love to hear sweet lies".
Inflate them with all these sweet lies and coat their minds with sugar, she will fall in love with you deeply.

This method is 100% effective to evergreen girls. They will believe whatever you say and promise =)
-
  
While revising for finals, I found a phone number scribbled on my lecture notes along with a smiley face.  I added that phone number to my contacts just to see who this number belonged to, only to see the whatsapp picture to be someone i often sat beside without talking to in a lecture.
The notes were Week 4 of the semester... :/

Really wish that my family could be more understanding during the exams period, where Studying > Family time. 
I promise to spend more time with you folks after i'm done with finals.

Its early in the morning and I can't get to sleep. I haven't known you for very long but deep down inside, I'm saddened. It really isn't so much of the dishonesty that's been going on in speaking of the r/s between us although that is really something I'm struggling with and will probably continue to do so. I'm saddened as you don't appear to be behaving like yourself, the girl I know, or at least the girl I think I know. You are not being you. Through the shameless stalking and the short period of time I've gotten to interact with you, you are in my heart, a girl whom is truly in some sense admirable and amazing. And I truly believe that.

It's totally fine to stop in our tracks once in a while, and we all do at different stages of our lives. Sometimes, a bit longer than others. But please do remember to move on. We can't say for sure what lies ahead, but perhaps it's something worth hoping and living for. You are so much more better than this. I know you are.

Just Stand Up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAhpdXMh7NY&spfreload=10

Right now, perhaps I'm more certain than ever that I'm in love with you. I'm not giving up on you, so please don't give up on yourself and on us.

was together with my ex for 3 years in nus and we went separate ways a little while after graduation. the years in campus were great. he's still in nus doing his post grad and heard that he's with someone new. its been only a couple of months and i still miss him though. meh.

My girlfriend's mother tried to open the locked doors when we're having sex. We took around 10 seconds to open the door and it was very awkward. Has anybody encountered similar experiences and how did you deal with it? fml. 
-
  
If a girl is already attached, and she still flirts or drop hints to me, is she interested in me? Or am reading things wrongly? 
-
  
Only if study week last abit longer...
-
  
For attached girls in an affair with another guy, don't ever trust his words on loving you and rescuing you from your current relationship. Chances are that he just enjoys the sex you are giving him and possibly the kick he gets out of knowing that you use the same pair of lips to kiss your boyfriend after sucking him off shortly before.

Besides, if you ever left your boyfriend for him, he will ask you, "If you can leave your current boyfriend for me, why would you not leave me for another guy next time?" The poison/doubt/rot is set in from day 1.

Trust me, because I am a guy, and I asked the very same question to the attached girl. Thank goodness it is over now.
-
  
Well, where do I start, well there's this the guy, let's call him guy X (how creative) whom I've liked for a really long time..but I think he might actually like my friend more than me (I think, I'm not very sure) but she has a boyfriend and is obviously not at all interested in guy X. Sometimes I think maybe I'm crazy or paranoid for thinking he likes her...he even knws she is attach...idk, there were times when he led me to believe that he might actually like me...but i dont knw. Why is the world cruel? <sigh>

Accept the fact that you're screwed, and work towards screwing up as little as possible

I didn't regret being in a relationship with you.
I just wasn't appreciative of what I've had, I guess.
We appeared in each other's lives at the wrong time, the wrong place
Now that we've parted and you've found another partner, I feel
Glad that you're once again happy
Sad that I'm not the one to make you smile
All the best in your new found love
While I silently weep inside

Reply to  People wouldn't say such stuff unless you bother them with your problems. I mean, what do you expect the person to say if you're whining to them about an exam. The responses you listed are perfectly normal. Quit being jealous.

seeing all my friends starting to get attached one by one, and then there's me who never dated before. sigh :/ cant help but feel lonely, especially when i dont even have a friend that i can talk to about anything and everything :(

There's this girl who's been liking my instagram posts. Is she trying to send me some kind of a signal? Or am I being too sensitive?

Confession: it's a make or break. If you break, you feel stupid about yourself, especially if you do it multiple times and get rejected on all occasions. Good thing is that you can laugh about it (all the silly instances, and stupid things you might have done), bad thing is some times you might even cry thinking about how foolish and embarrassing it had been. Yet if you don't confess and a take a leap of faith, nothing can happen.

I suppose there isn't a full-proof way to go about it - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I was told though that love isn't something you can mug for it. Whether the other person reciprocates isn't necessarily equivalent to the amount of effort or feelings that you might feel. Kinda sad huh..

Personally, I feel thrice broken. But I suppose that makes me who I am now. Can only hope that the next time will be better I suppose.

tldr: never try, never know.

and with regards to MA1506: You die, I die, everybody die!

PS: Thanks for NUSWhispers, it was a good read

Hi guys... I was a loyal reader of NUSWhispers, but it seems more like NUSStorytellers.

Is it just me who find it annoying when business student pretends to know everything?
-
  
 I lost a good number of friends because of r/s gone wrong. I don't know if some folks will ever get over it. So maybe the real sign of getting over the r/s is just not realising the existence of a previous r/s. You know, it's like, if you look like you hate someone, deep down, you might still have feelings for him/her, but if you don't even care a damn, the heart is truly dead towards him/her.
-
  
 You'll fail.

 Except that many relationships are nowhere dramatic, but are boringly good.

 Sorry to hear.

 Laplace was a mathematician.

 I know you. Now your friends will hate you.

 I know you want guys to cuddle you. Is that abnormal? ;)

I don't understand why some people keep saying that if you like the other person, you should just confess. Spare a thought for the person on the receiving end, and stop making yourself look like an idiot who can't control your own feelings. Can you imagine a world like that, where everybody just goes around confessing to everybody else? I definitely wouldn't want to live in it.

We used to be really close during year one. Although you dont look like my ideal type of girl, I still like you pretty much. I know that im a jerk for ditching you when another pretty girl appeared. Sadly the relationship didnt work out and im left with nothing.... Till then i realised that deep in my heart, i still really love you! However, its too late now... I dont blame you for being cold towards me now, afterall im just a dog that hurt you. I wanted to tell you the 3 words and hope that we will be together, however that is my own wishful thinking. I didnt treasure you at the start, I dont have any rights to say those words.

J im really really sorry.

My advices for the rest is... the one you truely love may not be the ideal one. Dont end up like me.

To  you should be nice to people because you want to, and not for a purpose. My story: before I agreed to date with my ex, he was the nicest guy ever, i don't know, he sorts of like reads my mind and voluntary do things for me without me asking him (which surprises me). He listens to my rants and I felt pampered. (He never spend money on me for we split all the bills). He text me good morning and good night daily until one day when he asked me to be his gf I agreed. And everything changed.

He stopped the textings. He's always depressed and drinks a lot. I rarely got the chance to see him. He doesn't want to listen to my rants anymore and I really hope to go on a proper date something decent like watch a movie, i mean, he was the one to suggest to watch a movie 3 times then near to the date he would say he's busy and cancelled it. Sometimes when he's in a good mood we get to talk more, but its rare. It feels like 2 persons before and after he got me. This is what happens when you are nice for a purpose, this isn't the real you. This relationship lasted for a year plus..

Quite some time ago, a friend confided to me that she was extremely jealous and pissed that her bf was very close to a female colleague (who is married) when she was on exchange. 

Red flags (what my friend told me) included her bf and the colleague NOT corresponding via whatsapp and using some other messenger app (avoiding traces), going out one-to-one many times, the colleague telling my friend's bf about her marriage troubles and not having sex for a long time.

She told me that her bf "didn't do anything that betrayed her". I didn't probe too far, though I believe she meant sexual stuff.

My friend belongs to the blur/clueless type, and was evidently blur when she confided to me because she was simply not thinking right and not drawing the obvious conclusions, and has little sense of how guys think, or even how women/girls think.

And so I told my friend the obvious, that the colleague was clearly improper and wanting intimacy from her bf, and that she's definitely right in wanting her bf to stop contacting that colleague. I also told her to obtain more advice from married women in her late 20s (same life phase as that indecent colleague), and get validation for my opinion.

What I didn't tell my friend, that it was also obvious to me (from a guy's POV) that her bf was "looking to eat outside", and at the very least there was some form of emotional betrayal. I didn't dare to make quick judgments as the guy felt like some easy-going chill dude (don't know him very well), and I thought there's a chance her bf really was clueless. I didn't want to be responsible for breaking up a relationship, even though I kinda liked her.

Today, they are still happily together. I'm not sure I did the right thing, still feel a tinge of guilt.

I've an idea for a new nus app.. Maybe someone can design a 'meal buddy' app where people can form/find groups of several people (say, 4?) with similar interests to have lunch together in school. No one should be left out eating alone! It's a good way to meet new people too. Let's create a friendly and fun NUS!

When you are ready to "confess" your love to a girl which option will have higher success rate? Option A: Ask her to be your GF. Option B: Just hold her hands. In my limited experience with 3 different girls option B was successful 2/3 and option A was a failure 1/3. Like to hear views from others :)
-
  
This is a long one. Guys mention about being friendzoned, being afraid to ask the girl as they are not sure if she seems them as only a friend or more. Well I would, JUST ASK and do it sooner than later. Why?

Say you know a girl for like 5-6 months, you see her as more than a friend, you have feelings for her. Just tell her in person what you feel. Pros: TADA gf. Cons: It probably would probably become awkward as hell and u 2 might even stop talking. No daily SMS-es, not seein her smile on a daily basis and basically becoming strangers. Is it worth it? hell yes. Because you were being honest to yourself and to her. She isn't a mind reader to know how u feel if u don't tell her. And the longer u wait before asking her it just becomes even more harder to get over her if eventually you do ask and it is negative. The consequences are painful but time will do its magic. Join ccas, hang out with other friends, focus on studies/passion, hit the gym whatever. Occupy yourself. You will move on. You may even meet another girl and she could be the one. The longer you wait to ask, the longer the healing process and I highly doubt by just being around her she will magically one day know your feelings for her and say yes. So just be honest to yourself and to her. Don't be afraid of losing her as a friend, since you always saw her as more than a friend :)

she caught my eye. i'm a freshie, she's a senior. 
I got her number, and we chatted. For months.
Only to realise, she's attached.

All texting stopped and became a hi-bye friend. 
*fast-forward 2 years*

We met again while studying. Not together, but same venue.
We chatted, again. She's single now, but i'm attached.
I felt the feeling again, that feeling 2 years ago.
And i'm pretty sure she had it too. 
normal conversation, but she didn't dare to look me in the eye. Her fast talking speed and dilated pupil.

Man, i'm confused.

Dear @

I'm a girl, and I like nice guys. And by nice I mean whatever you just described. Not-so-nice guys puts me off actually. Don't concern yourself over questions like "Should I be the nice guy?" or "Should I be a typical bad boy?" I think girls will like guys who're genuine and sincere, not whether they're bad/good. Just be yourself, and chances are, the one might appear soon enough! :)

Don't act like you have done nothing wrong and post 'I am innocent but it's okay' kind of messages on social media. Perhaps you have no idea how traumatizing your action was. I was indifferent to it, but now I can't help venting.

If it is any comfort to you, I know many girls from NUS who also like girls ;)

To  I'm a girl from arts and it's quite true that (it seems) girls tend to hang around with similar looking friends. Haha. However, not all of us are fashionistas. I don't know how some of the girls have the time to choose such pretty clothing and apply make-up all the time before coming to school. And if you really look around, you'll see random pockets of people (like me) who's just too socially awkward to mix around with others. I usually eat by myself at the deck, so... 
Fashionistas or not, I think we're all nice people :D

 I feel you my friend. Money is such a big problem now in uni. However I am in a different position that I'm an international student. My family is considered middle class in my home country but that doesn't mean shit here due to exchange rate. My parents' combined salary is about SG$400 per month. Some month if they save up really hard they can give me $100 but less often that not. I'm not on scholarship so I have no choice but to work part time. It's really tough and stressful when you are doing part time job plus hall activities plus 6 mods per semester. 

One of the sad thing about being poor is that it's hard to make friends with Singaporeans. I really like most of my Singaporean friends but it's really difficult to get in their clique while you reject every single hangout invitation from them because you just can't afford to hangout and spend money. A simple meal could well cost over $15-20, and maybe a movie or clubbing on top of that. Eventually no one ask me to hangout with them anymore. My best friends in JC are all Singaporeans and I haven't met them since the start of uni because of that.

Sometimes my mom called me to have a little chat on Skype, but I had to reject her because I was busy studying/doing CCA/working. It's the worst feeling ever.
-
  
To  You're not alone.

I'm not a student yet.

I like girls.

But I'm a girl.

...and I was born a boy.

I don't really need that many friends, and I'm not very sensitive to general strangers/coursemates' attitudes like being talked about behind my back, as long as we can get business done. But still I'd like to know, how fucked am I? I'll be in SoC, if that matters. Also I'm not concerned about not being able to find a partner; singlehood is just fine for me.
-
  
I'm a Year 3 student.

I like girls.

But I'm a girl.

Should I continue to live the rest of my life in order to maintain my existing friends? Find a boyfriend and get married. I still can't discount the possibility that I might find a guy who I can bond with on a deep emotional level but it'll never be a bond that is physically and sexually fulfilling. Divorce is unacceptable especially if we end up having kids.

Being in Singapore means its tough to avoid homophobic friends, means saying that 'I'm a girl' can only come with a 'but' after 'I like girls'.

Do I be who I am?

It isn't a simple choice.

I hope I'm not alone on this.
-
  
Be overly nice, comfort her when she's feeling upset, go out of your way to do nice things, and eventually, congratulations! You'll end up in the friendzone.

PSA guys. Being too nice gets you friendzoned faster than the biz western food uncle taking your order. As paradoxical as it sounds, when girl's say they want a nice guy, they're not referring to someone who is nice to everyone, or whom does everything they say. Why would a girl want someone who treats everyone as special as her? Don't believe me? think of the nicest person you know of. Chances are, they're single.  

Limit your niceness, but also, don't be an outright ass. You won't even have friends then.
Good luck!

To 
I guess this confession is from the other perspective. Honestly, as an Arts student I find it hard to befriend people from other faculties. Most (*not all) people I've met from other faculties just don't talk about the same things I care about. 
Often, it seems like their conversations revolve around gossip/small talk/the other sex/relationships. 
When I bring up topics like current events, gender equality, religion, the media .etc, most of them either give a polite reply or 'Oh I don't know much about that' and the topic ends there. 
Of course, it isn't easy to find friends in Arts too but it seems like I meet more people who I can converse with in my faculty. Anyway, people become friends when they have common interests?

I wouldn't want to generalise though. This is just what I observe from my personal experience. 
-
  
To 

I am sort of on the opposite side of the story, (don't think I'm the one in this confession directed towards). I knew this guy through a mutual friend. He's sort of a shy and geek kind of guy (he prefers staying at home but doesn't play computer games). He looks quite handsome in my point of view though and hes very smart, which a CAP above 4.5. We chatted online for a few months, and it's always me who initiate the conversation, he replies my msg everytime without fail when he comes online, with logical comments and appropriate jokes which makes it feel good to communicate with him. However, he never initiates anything and subsequently I realized from his replies what excites him to reply the most is when I ask about schoolwork I don't know so subsequently our conversations is mainly about me asking questions...

I don't know, I stopped texting him awhile ago due to exam period and all. I dont wish to bother his studies. Sometimes I hope that he actually initiate something. Maybe you should try texting her?
-
  
From what I observe, Arts students are the most difficult to befriend with (as compared to any peoples but Biz people, because from what I know, they have quite a reputation). I have roamed the places frequented by Arts students, in particular UTown and FASS for the whole year, and from what I see, the girls are all fashionable, always hanging with a look-alike friend(s), and chatting happily. None of them seems...available for a new friend or one with different taste of fashion, height, or IDK, a different look? As for the guys...hmm...I assume most have already had some girl friends or well, committed themselves to befriending some popular girls. Maybe it's just me and my stereotyping fashionistas as aloof or unfriendly, but really, after taking a few modules in Engineering and Science, I felt college less suffocating and isolating, in a sense that the girls there are more homely looking and thus, approachable .... Sorry don't bash me...Some girls in Arts are also adorable...I was talking about those who live their stereotypes :(

Freshman year; you get extremely excited to see that you have been accepted into one of the most "popular" halls on campus. Decked out in blue, shorts and slippers most of the time, you have a hellvua fun in those years: Sleeping at hours where even ghosts have decided to retire, having the wildest activities that paint a happening life on your social media pages, and forever being surrounded my friends; never needing to fear you would go for a lecture, or even supper alone. 

In these four years you have become the cool kid, the Mr.Popular, the jock who does well in many sports and hangs out with all the pretty girls. On top of all of these, you carry a decent CAP and become the envy of many.

Then, as you near graduation year, you proudly send out your CV to all the companies that surely, must be dying to hire the charismatic, multi-talented you. Yet, it has been weeks, months and all you've got are rejections or worse; no replies at all.

You get desperate, your supposedly nerdy peers at school have found nice high-paying jobs while you struggle to even get an interview. In a last ditch effort, you call the career services centre; a place where you have not once stepped foot in for the 4 years of your college life. When you meet your career counselor, you spill your indginance and worries: Why is it me, the popular, charismatic guy who has captained over half a dozen sports teams, took part in nearly every CCA possible and with half a decent CAP can't get a job?!

Your career counselor looks at your CV, shakes her head and drops the bombshell: "well, to be frank, these activities mean nothing actually". And the facade of what you thought were you most glorious years came crashing down upon you
-
  
There is a perfect girl of my dreams whom I knew through a mutual someone. We talked online regularly for some months but all this stopped after I did not initiate, because I was afraid that I was being bothersome. Neither did she start any topic.

"I have died everyday waiting for you."

I missed those times when you felt so close. But We met at the wrong time I guess.

It's funny how lots of things got so complicated the moment uni started. It's as if JC was the last time u could freely walked around and made friend purely because you wanted to. Sometimes it feels like people just grew more lonely, more calculative and more unpredictable. Or is it just the 'welcome to adulthood' stage?

Since there are so many single guys and girls out there who are complaining that their crushes are attached and are unable to find other single people, is it possible to have an app (like tinder but not photo based, randomly match people together like matchmaking?) for the single NUS people to have a higher chance to have a more fruitful and wholesome university life?

Have you ever thought about it? How many of our friendships are friendships of convenience? Due to proximity, groups demarcated with socially-defined boundaries, socially-accepted conventions. When do we learn to break free and make friends with who we want to? See each other as actual human beings with a whole different story to tell each and endless possibilities. Not just nameless blips on a radar or files in a folder.

so I got to know this girl. Our parents are friends. She and I seem to click quite well despite we only meet a few times. She is 1 year older than me. Problem is, she is already working for 1 year plus while Im still just an undergraduate. She seems like she doesnt think thats gonna be a problem, while neither do I. But I cannot deny that gap isnt present. There was this time a mutual senior friend of us invite us out for dinner to catch up since he both helped us secure my internship and her job at his firm. She offered to pay for the meal as a nice gesture to thank him. While I respect her for being professional and thoughtful, still, I cannot help but feel really bad about our social status. The only thing I could do is sit there and thank her since by right Im still a student and hadnt made any real money yet. I was crushed at that moment, just like that... I would love to get any advice on this matter, like how should I approach this..? Thanks a lot..

 Don't be naive.

"She'll fall for him some day." That doubt will linger so long as we remain good friends. You're also afraid that you'll fall for me, if you haven't already.

@769 (the platonic friendship one)

It's totally possible, but kinda rare now since everyone is all "either go for the kill or don't go at all"

I have a best friend that's of the opposite gender too. We know each other for quite some time alr, gonna be half our lives in a awhile more (then again we are young so half isn't really alot).
But the main point is, it doesn't mean that friends of opposite genders must  always end up in a relationship with each other right? I've liked her friends, she liked my friends, but we never liked each other. Call it friendzoning each other if you will, but we never felt attraction to each other all these years. Everyone around us kept teasing us, placing bets on when we will get tgt etc but hey, if we aren't bothered by them, then this platonic friendship will work out just fine.

Besides, it's always good to have someone of the opposite gender that you can find for help ;) [like getting present opinions, outfits, explain how people think, even to quality - check the person I'm interested in hehe]

NUS has not been an easy ride. I study but I don't understand anything. I feel like giving up all the time. But then I look at my parents, who never went to uni, who are proud of finally having a son who made it. I bite my lips and go on, fighting for my family.
-
  
 Yes they can. I think it depends on whether both of you treasure the friendship enough to move beyond the rejection and remain as friends.

And if you are him, please know that I'm so sorry for everything that has happened. And I really hope that and will work to be your friend again. ><

How many of you have ever gotten the feeling where your efforts hardly translate into results? The feeling of despair and hopelessness when you know that whatever you do, however much effort you invest in something, or really anything, it's not going to amount to much, but you still do it anyway, because you are clinging onto the glimmer of hope that after all, things might just work out.

As a procrastinating (graded) exchange student, I want to offer alla y'all a little bit of love advice from across the pond, which me and my friend epiphanised the other night.

1. As long as you are not obvious about your stalkery, boys, you can woo waaaay more girls than you thought possible, just by paying attention to them. Honestly - a gal's perception of you will change if you make them feel wanted. Literally, any guy. It's properly easy, and even though I'm not one to stereotype, it's tried and tested. Just be nice and gentlemanly, and the worst thing that could happen is that you have a nice friendship with a nice girl. Just ask her for lunch one day, or offer to buy her a Starbucks if you're a classy guy who has money to burn.

2. Girls, unbeknownst to you (or even them) it is possible for you to get any guy you want, or at least a nice one who you are pleased with. If you show confidence in yourself, and that you're comfortable in your own appearance (regardless of your appearance, honestly) and personality, you will ultimately succeed in the game of luuuurve. I know it's easier said than done, but if you act like you are the most awesome person ever, people will start to believe it, despite their own thoughts. Mind over matter, folks.

I don't understand how there are so many couples here - everyone appears to be so shy! But don't fret, follow my advice, and you will prevail. 

P.S. Apparently guys don't really like girls wearing make-up, and most of the time they can't even tell the difference (so why waste your time and pores?)

P.P.S. In terms of your chances with the exchange students, the poorly (yet so accurately) termed "yellow fever" definitely kicked in a good month or two ago, and what with the end of term swiftly approaching, alongside a whole lotta time to fill with procrastination, now is the perfect time to romance an international hottie. And they will definitely appreciate a free coffee cos now they're poor AF.

@confession 769 -

It's.. not likely, but it's possible. In cases where the girl is attached and the guy doesn't feel like being a relationship-wrecker (because seriously don't go around ruining lives leh), or when the girl makes it somehow clear that she's not looking for a relationship. I think at points like this the mature thing to do would be to put infatuation aside to get to know the other person better as a friend.

as rare as it is, guys can bro-zone girls too, haha. pointless to ask for statistics, too - maybe take a look around at your own life and see what the statistics are like? :)
-
  
Here's the question that my friends and I have been discussing over and over again, but never been able to agree on a final answer: Can a guy and girl just be best friends, without any of them wanting something more/falling for the other part? And if your answer is "yes, that is possible", out of how many cases will that be possible? Every 1/10? 1/20?

Thinking if I got the right couple here, cos I was wondering who was J for a while but then I realised you didn’t use his real initials but something similar sounding lool. Anyway I totally had a crush on J when we met at zouk one night at one of the usual weekend parties. He was looking quite upset and I helped him up from an episode of puking.. it was after you guys had that falling out (yup i was at Attica and saw you guys fighting) A fair bit disappointed that J probably might not have any interest in me as a girl but I think you guys are really gonna make a sweet couple tbh even though you both face some social obstacles. Glad that you guys patched things up!

If you’re wondering who I am, my boyfriend was one of your wing mates and I was at your commissioning dinner but we’ve broken up already (big clue right) and yup I’m in NUS too ;)

To her: You are probably not ready to accept me yet, but know that I'm trying and will keep trying. Maybe it's my fault for escalating things. Maybe it's my fault for letting my emotions get out of hand. Maybe I should have held it all back. I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable. At the end of the day, I just wish we could be close friends again.

why is it that guys think its okay if they're not virgins but not okay if girls aren't? What makes it right for guys to impose such judgement on the opposite gender? 

it's kind of sad that girls even think of themselves as "second hand" and guys can joke about things like master key and shitty lock. something is very wrong with how some guys/our society think if girls should have to feel ashamed of not being a virgin while guys can boast about not being one. we really need to rethink how we label others.

The world certainly has all sorts of people. I used to think that  people, once in a relationship, will become totally committed. I was totally committed. But i have since learned otherwise, and my heart was shattered. Having given almost everything into this failed relationship, I find myself a broken figure with a shattered heart. Its difficult to deal with, especially considering how deeply i fell for the person whom i thought was the one. 

I guess, life goes on, with or without me.

i love nuswhispers. thanks admins for taking time out to update so consistently and keeping us sane during this hectic stressful period. 

one thing though, the types of confessions that come in are so different from those received on nusconfessions (juicier heh). please invite all your nus friends to like this platform and submit confessions guys :)

Haven't u noticed that it's always the girl who friendzones the guy and not the other way round. If u are a girl who's hot and sexy we don't give a shit whether u r a good friend or not, we will just date u straightaway
-
  
Got to know this guy and he's kinda cool and all. But he smokes, just a random question when he is planning to stop smoking bacause he freaking told me that he knows it's bad. But he obviously is in love with his ciggs and gave me the cold shoulder. I said sorry then asked to meet then I think I did'nt ask nicely or whatever. Cold shoulder again. I am rude and he is so sensitive. Relationships are just freaking complicated. srs

Rather than being the key, I like to think of myself as the boltcutter.

Two words to describe myself - passively suicidal. I think of all the ways I could possibly die, but I don't want to end my own life with my own hands. I'm afraid that one day I would.

Just to jump on the hype train, can 2 people no longer be friends after rejection?
-
  
I know that I won't be able to take away your sadness, but can I help to carry it for a short while so that you can take a breather? Just a short while is fine... I hope to find the key and help you with your problem but I'm not sure if you'd let me. No matter what, I hope for the best and will support your decision.

Response to   As a female who has not done it, I think that sexual experience is something that is valuable and that sexual compatability is extremely important in a relationship. It depends on a person's values, religious beliefs (if any), and sex drive. While I wouldn't do it on the first date, I would definitely not wait till engagement/marriage. Now my question is, do guys consider girls who have already done it as "second hand goods"? To me, I think this is a manifestation of misogyny.

My boyfriend will be starting his university life next semester and he will be entering a different university. Seeing how he can be quite popular with girls,
I'm feeling a little afraid that I'll lose him to the girls at his university due to them more common experiences than we do. 
-
  
I am so worried. This girl I like is going to summer with my best friend who is hot and single. What if he dates her? Should I be happy for them?
-
  
 Many a times we very much like to rely on reasoning, but perhaps sometimes we give it too much credit? Feelings may be inaccurate at times but at the very least they don't lie. How do you feel he feels? They say hope is a very dangerous thing, but should we then stop hoping altogether?
-
  
U know how some guys gay with other guys for fun even though they r straight. I might have overdone it too much. My whole faculty, even my family, now thinks I'm gay
-
  
Reply to 
It really depends on the guy. I for one, wouldn't mind entering into a sexual relationship with a woman who's a 'second-hand good'. I mean it's supremely unfair to slap that tag on someone without an inkling of the circumstances behind their 'first night' and generalise her as being promiscuous or loose.

P.S. and yes, I have done it with such a woman before. Even though we have since gone our separate ways I think her having prior sexual experience made my first night slightly less awkward and as prone to making amateurish mistakes on bed :)

I have a crush on a guy friend...Hes evergreen and single, very helpful with my little problems in studies and life, he laugh a lot at what I say, and I've tried asking him out a couple of times but he would always reject me. Am I being friendzoned? ): #socgirlwoes

A guy is sexist if he looks for a girl with model figure.
So a girl who won't consider a guy shorter than her is...?

@

Friendships are forged not through happenstance. You have to make a conscious effort to want to get to know people more. That said, it also depends on certain circumstances, namely, 

A common interest, a lot of common time, convenience, and stage of life.

You don't become friends merely through one event, or just because you take lectures together. You need at least two of the circumstances above checked, before there is even a chance of a friendship, and two being the most minimal. 

Of course they are going to ditch you, you aren't that important in the beginning. But you have to try to reach out and get to know people, and show an interest. It's a tiring thing, but that's how you make friends past your adolecent and teenage years. Everyone starts getting busy in the routines of their lives and you dont have as much common time together.

So.... cheer up! While being alone may suck at times, you seem pretty well adjusted. I'm sure you can make friends, it's just that you might have been approaching it with the wrong mindset :)

Friends dont come about by happenstance!

To the lady(I think) in ,  :

I'm in a sort of a similar situation, but I'm the other party, i.e. a guy(don't worry 
I'm not the person in question this confession is directed towards). I think that the subject does have feelings for you.

Either he is really keen on chasing you regardless of your current relationship status, or he feels that it is blissful enough to maintain what he has now and does not want to risk destroying the friendship. I think that it's probably the latter but you know better than I do.

He probably won't know that you're starting to get uncomfortable for being treated overly nicely, unless you tell him. You can choose to avoid him from now on too, if u're certain that he takes the hints. Otherwise, it'll be better if you can tell him personally as it might be a bit cruel on him if you don't say anything. If he likes you and/or is understanding enough I'm sure he'll fall back and maintain some distance after hearing how you feel. I'm sure he has helped you at some point in your school life so now may be the best time to return the favour, maybe? This way it won't be awkward when you see each other and you can still have a simple, healthy relationship.

If he's not as understanding as you would have hoped(I hope it won't be this case), then I guess he'll be intruding your privacy and not thinking about your feelings. In that case, you should probably put some distance between him and you, on your own, and move away from him. You should be able to judge it yourself.

Good luck.

On that note, if person A likes person B, then is it impossible to be friends? Especially when B knows A's feelings towards him/her, does A only have 2 choices, i.e. to chase after B or to stay away from B completely? Will B believe A if A says that he/she only wants to be friends? If not, isn't maintaining a boy-girl friendship also a desperate attempt not to fall in love with the other person? There exist a limit to how nice A should be towards B, but is it really wrong to treat the guy/girl one likes super nicely? 

I don't know the answer to all these myself.
-
  
To ,

Oh come on, all these expectations on guys to be fun, interesting and aggressive in asking girls out on a date is so borderline sexist please. 

If a guy expects a girl to be demure, receptive and submissive, I bet that guy will be burned on a stake faster than you can say "chauvinist". So much for #heforshe 

Anyway, serious and emotionally mature guys can be equally amazing too! 
-
  
Should i tell her how i feel or just continue to stay as friends?
-
  
My friends told me some guys are so desperate for girls that they will try their luck and chase many girls and see which girl would accept. Others told me older guys in University are usually even more desperate. I also worry that I may not be as special to this certain guy as I've hoped. Sigh.. but actually I think I already have an answer. 

I know what my friends say have some truth in them but they are really just stereotypes. What is important is that I want to trust him. I'm not sure if we still have a chance since he seems quite shy. I also have my own problem - I fear getting into relationships a lot. Which is why I've been keeping a distance from him though I really like him. Is it weird that I still feel this way? It's not like I'm a kid anymore.

I don't know if he reads NUSwhispers. Study hard for finals... :) Hope we can talk more again after finals.
-
  
To  Giving my humble opinion as a soc girl too: having a guy to chase you doesn't always pop out from nowhere, some are lucky, otherwise, you just have to make them notice first by making yourself appear approachable. Don't be afraid of initiating conversations with opposite genders and smile more. Then be yourself. The rest will come naturally. Just know that even if things doesn't turn out as planned you will still make a bunch of friends. Cheers.

 Rejecting guys tear a part of me away too. Can Ben Leong Lonely Hearts Club teach me how to gracefully reject guys? #socgirlwoes
-
  
The irony of having lots of acquaintances yet so few are close friends. Spending time in solitude has become a norm especially after college life started. You attend lectures with a bunch of friends, join numerous events, know lots of people from various faculties, yet none is considered close. Friends ditch you when they have more important things to deal with. None show p at times when you need them. Indeed, nobody could have 100% of his/her time to you, yet having to spend a day without saying a word/making any contact with another human being is unhealthy.

Yes  I do enjoy solitude, but perhaps human are just social creatures. Prolonged periods of alone time are unbearable. At times you are glad to be independent and just spend some time with yourself, at times you will start to feel the loneliness creep in bit by bit till it consumes you. And the latter just gets worse in this stressful period of finals preparation. 

A universe full of humans/lives. A world just with myself.

Guys : Looks first, personality later
Girls : Personality first, looks later. 

Is that true?
-
  
 yea, and then when the guy confesses and you reject him as nicely as you can, you get bashed by the people around you for leading him on. Because why would you go out with him 1 on 1 if you don't like him? And you end up causing so much hurt to that guy friend and feeling like the worst person ever.

Why do couples fight over so little issues over n over again? And most of issues don't make any sense, seriously! Isn't is good at lease you've found someone you like, why don't you try to tolerant a bit? I don't know why but most of my attached friends tend to ask me to be the mediator(I'm evergreen pls)....So now I'm really tired from helping them reconcile their conflicts, and I think I won't want to be attached for a long time, because it seems so tired:(

Programming is like sex because...

• One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.
• Once you get started, you'll only stop because you're exhausted.
• It takes another experienced person to really appreciate what you're doing.
• ...Conversely, there's some odd people who pride themselves on their lack of experience.
• You can do it for money or for fun.
• If you spend more time doing it than watching TV, people think you're some kind of freak.
• It's not really an appropriate topic for dinner conversation.
• Public schools don't do a very good job teaching kids about it.
• It doesn't make any sense at all if you try to explain it in strictly clinical terms.
• Some people are just naturally good at it.
• ...But some people will never realize how bad they are, and you're wasting your time trying to tell them.
• There are a few weirdos with bizarre practices nobody really is comfortable with.
• One little thing going wrong can ruin everything.
• It's a great way to spend a lunch break.
• Everyone acts like they're the first person to come up with a new technique.
• Everyone who's done it pokes fun at those who haven't.
• Beginners do a lot of clumsy fumbling about.
• You'll miss it if it's been a while since you've done it.
• There's always someone willing to write about the only right way to do things.
• It doesn't go so well when you're drunk, but you're more likely to do it.
• Sometimes it's fun to use expensive toys.
• It usually goes faster when you do it alone.
• When women hear guys bragging about it, they become disgusted.
• If you're not careful about how you do it, all sorts of nasty bugs can appear.
• ...And debugging is annoying, painful, and very embarrassing.

What are people's thoughts on male crossdressers? Would a girl ever date one?

To  i think i know which girl you are referring to. where's the girl going and confessor, where you headed to?

I am feeling very conflicted about my emotions for a week now. For now  I try not to think about the things that have happened. My close friend had suddenly passed away, I don't know what to make of it and I'm still seeking for a closure. 

Sometimes, the images of us having fun together in our past adventures just flood into my mind without a warning, I would almost break down immediately in tears while studying in the library. 

It would mean a lot to me if you guys can post some encouragements on this post, just to get me through until I go for some counselling. Hopefully I don't need them. 

Thanks in advance :)
-
  
To , im so sorry to hear that you lost your friend! i don't know you, and i don't know how your friend passed, whether you feel that there's closure from the way he/she passed or not or you cant comprehend. whether your lack of closure is from the way he/she left. but i hope you know this, there are still people out there who love you. whatever you're going through, there are people going through worse things (this is not any consolation) but things will get better for you. your friend would want you to chin up and live your life :)   no matter how bad things get for me, i always tell myself, someone is dreaming of living my life right now. stay strong anon. we all here for you.

 It is really nothing. Until the guy confessed to you, nothing is going to happen. If guy ask girl out alone means something, then why am I still single? Lol.

Why are there so many girls here rejecting someone who is interested in them but no one has tried to chase me before :( #GirlInSoC

I really enjoy attending lessons because of my tutor. Does it make sense if you find someone attractive because he's so smart? I like challenging his viewpoints and see what he's got to say about my arguments. I hope he doesn't find me too annoying. Anyway he's completing his graduate studies so I won't see him around anymore. Wishing him all the best in my heart. 
-
  
There's this guy friend of mine who recently asked me out for a casual, catch up meal. I didn't think much about it and just agreed. But now my other guy friends are saying no guy would ask a girl out alone unless he likes her. I have zero romantic interest in that guy and I don't want to lead him on, but it seems horrible to cancel on somebody just because of what your friends say :(
-
  
My guts feeling is telling me a guy likes me. I spotted him looking at my direction during lectures irregardless where or who i sit with. He also replies to my messages instantly whenever he comes online, listening to my rants both online and offline, teaching me step by step when i don't understand the topic. He never confessed so I can't be sure whats his intentions or mind is... but i dont intend to drag him along and I've told him I am attached but he's still as nice to me. It makes me feels even more terrible inside... I feel like I wanted to avoid him before the situation gets out of hand. Or am I thinking too much...
-
  
If the two of you are together can you just come out and say it? It is really annoying when that's all you guys do and we are still supposed to be "friends".
-
  
I never thought I would like you. In fact, I hated being around you or spending time with you. But now that I realise I will never see you again, I think I might just miss you.

i think many tall guys have fetishes for girls who are much shorter than them. speaking from experience

It's terrible isn't it? That fear of falling behind, of failing. That all consuming loneliness. That taste of rejection. 
It sucks right? Don't just swim in it though? Feel it deeply, then decide to take action on it. It's an adventure, it's a challenge, it's a climb. Better yourself! That discomfort is your strength. The world owes you nothing! And eventually, with that strength, make your own luck!
All the best, in exams, in love, in life!

When was the last time someone had touched you affectionately? 
-
  
I don't know why people in NUS usually make big fuss about CAP. I have seen a lot of friends who is not exceptional in school but have super outstanding portfolios and show great skills/knowledge, hence usually end up getting the best jobs that they wanted. Really just stop chasing CAP and be interested in the knowledge itself, all your efforts will be paid off.

Korean universities students have this thing known as '미팅’ (meeting), which is basically a group blind date. Arranged by someone else, a few guys meet up with a few girls (say 3 guys & 3 girls) for a meal, and they exchange contacts. 

If any of the guys/girls find someone within the group they're interested in, they can try to bring the relationship further after the 'meeting'. 

We don't have such a culture, but looking at how many singles there are in NUS, it would be nice to start such a culture here. Well, even if it doesn't end up in a relationship, it's always nice to know more friends right? 

Wonder how many in NUS are interested in such an idea?

J and I met in army. We were officer cadets in the same wing. We bumped into each other at the sauna where we talked. Just talked. Over the next few months, we got to know to each other better and soon, found ourselves falling in love with each other. Our relationship went well for first year, but spiralled in its second year.

I was addicted to alcohol. It started in army. My weekends revolved around opened bottles and loud music at the clubs with my camp mates. J hated it when I arrived at his place drunk. I would get so high that I don't even remember the events of the night. Things get so dark when I drink. I lose control of myself and I get violent. My friends and I were Attica one night. J was there too. I drank too fast and too much. J, being the caring boyfriend he was, told me to stop. When I refused and chided him for overreacting, he forcibly took the bottle out of my hand. I got angry at him for that, and made my way out of the club (miraculously given how drunk I was). J followed me closely behind. When I told him to fuck off and leave me alone, he wouldn't, and I guess I lost all rationality and punched him in the face. I don't remember what happened after that, but I awoke in his bed the next morning.

I apologised for my behaviour, for which he accepted the apology. But that unfortunately was just the beginning of things which eventually drove him to end our relationship. When he told me I needed help that he couldn't give me on his own, I knew I had lost the most important person in my life.

J entered NUS soon after we finished army whereas I deferred an additional year off to get the help that I needed. I'm happy to say that I'm a year sober now. I contacted J last night for the first time since we ended army and we arranged to have coffee at Starbucks U-town, where I am due to matriculate in August this year.

"You look good," he said.

"Thanks," I replied in kind. A long pause ensued. "You look well too."
I related to him that I've been a sober a year now. He was happy for me that I had my issues sorted. He apologised for not sticking through, but said that he was at his wits end, and he didn't know what else to do to help me. I assured him that he had nothing to apologise for; that his decision to leave me was just what I needed to put my life together again.

"Love forgives, love forgives immeasurably," he said. J and I decided to have another go at the relationship again. Clean slate, we agreed. I am hopeful — no, I am certain — that this time, I will treat him better. I can't deny that there are times when I desire a sip — he's well aware of this — of a drink, but I'm well equipped to know that I can stay away for it.
-
  
This confessions thing is very interesting. They're written by real people. I could just walk past them in NUS without ever knowing that this person wrote a heartfelt love confession, or just some thing he wanted to get off his/her chest. Online anonymity is brilliant. 
-
  
23 years and I'm still evergreen. I really hate this. I would say my social circle is still quite okay. However, none of my female friends has ever been interested in me in a romantic way. I know I'm not the most awesome guy around but I'm pretty sure I'm not that bad either. Average at least. I'm also sure my female friends that I ever was interested in are all below average. I know this cause my friends will usually give me a 'wtf' look if I ever share with them the person that I'm interested in. Actually the real reason is because I wanted to increase the chance of my love being reciprocated. Why is this even happening to me? I'm not even asking for someone with big boobs or some model look alike face or some kpop girl group figure. All I want is just a special someone to be a part of my life and share my joy / sadness. Why is this so difficult? It doesn't help when my friend made it seem so easy to get a girlfriend. He's like inhaling girlfriend. 要就有. Life is unfair. Sometimes I wish I could use everything I have now to trade for that special someone. 
-
  
Now that my journey in NUS has reached its end, it feels really lousy to leave school with two bachelor titles. Sometimes I wonder will I ever be able to find someone who cares at all? 

What seems relatively natural to many others has never been possible for me. I have always dreamt of  finding my other half while I'm still in school but that will probably remain unchecked on the list.

Now that I will be stepping into the working world, my chances are... I feel like giving up and getting myself a puppy as my companion instead. I know this is not the best solution, but at least there is no need to put up a strong front and pretend that everything is fine.

To my love in one of the course in Engineering. From the day you spoke to me during Engin Camp'14, during the Secret Pal segment, I knew that you were the one for me. Although I had complained to many people that I hated you because I didn't like the way you commented on me during one of the segment in SP. I just want to tell you that I was just trying to attract your attention because I feel that the only to get you is to get your attention. However, we didn't talk much after the camp although we are from the same course. I just want you to lay me by your side, next to you. Cos all of me loves all of you. Please accept my love for you. 对你爱爱爱不完 <3

With love, princess.

I shared the feeling of those who felt lonely despite knowing many people. Honestly speaking, I have thousands of facebook friends and tons of contacts in my phone. However,  when life takes a turn for the worse, I don't know who to confide to and just hide one corner and think about it myself.

One day, i was thinking 'What the heck!' I took a leap of faith and called one or two friends to hang out. Their quick positive response surprised me. I am able to unwind and let go of some emotional stress.

Go on and take that leap of faith. I'm sure there are many of your friends who is facing the same situation, but simply push it aside and sweep it under a rug. Be spontaneous once in a while! (:

Cheers

How do you tell if a guy whom you just met online for 1 mth if he likes in you?
-
  
This is probably not the right place to post this, but I really hope someone can help me. My sister has been cutting herself for the past few years, we found out about it early on and she has promised to stop. But we suspect the truth is that she never stopped and always tries to hide it from us. We tried to ask her what the problem was, but she refuses to tell us.
Her tweets are very worrying and I don't know how to help. I think she's facing a problem that she can't solve, but she doesn't want to tell anyone. Every day I fear that she will one day not be able to take it anymore and end her life. I really want to help her but I have no idea what to do. She does not to see a psychiatrist.
I'm posting this here in hope of finding someone who has similar experiences and is willing to share or know someone that can help.

Loving you was the best thing of my life. Although you are with another guy now. I still love you and wish to talk to you. All I want is to see you happy and able to talk to you. Even though the person that is making you happy isn't me :) So dear "I", what's really stopping you from talking to me again? Saying nothing to talk about is really lame. I am not trying to win your heart either. I am just a guy who truly wish to support you & be there for you. I am just someone who treasure human relationship and do not wish to lose those that important to me.

I'm not someone who studies in school but for this really beautiful girl at CLB level 6, I am here everyday waiting for you. Never seen a Malay girl who can pull off that bob hair as well as you. I think I'm in love. Sadly, I am not brave enough to approach you.

I never thought I end up in NUS despite not studying for a long time. Coming here in reality was a painful choice for me...for someone who has lost touch with writing and studying.

However, it made me realise my purpose - to get a degree and look a for a better paid job I was previously in but it seems all too hard...

To the grey one, your commenters might be trying to say:

I spoke to your soul because I saw it glimmer.

I merely swept the dust away to reveal the color.

You talked to me only because you let yourself.

You know you're not good enough because you said so.

But maybe I am too hopeful. Best of luck.

Since someone has confessed to the Year 5 Econs Tutor / DDP Econs/Accounting, I would also like to confess my feelings... I think she's quite a friendly person, and a kind one who will always think of her students! Admiree Admiree
I really really really really really really like you <3  #SOW15
It's the worst and suckiest feeling so far I've ever experienced.When you spent hours of time and effort on preparing and crafting a personalized gift for someone that really matters a lot to you for her birthday, hoping that she could sense the effort that I put in. But the moment I saw how happy she was when some other guy from miles away mailed her a Paddington bear on which arrives just on time on her birthday..... Totally crushed. I feel so silly now...
I got accepted to the School Of Computing but I've mixed feelings about it. Can somebody give me a balanced view on the good and the bad there, i.e. why do some people hate it but others love it? What I should do if I want to enjoy myself there?
No matter what, you'll always be my goddess.
I don't understand why people are so judgmental, and sometimes even spread false rumors to make other people's lives more miserable.

Not many people know this, but I broke up with my girlfriend of close to 4 years just before entering uni. I may seem okay, but I'm actually very much broken inside.
I don't think I'll miss NUS or SoC when I graduate this sem. It was a horrible experience. Mostly my fault for not dropping out sooner though. Out of all courses, this is what I hate the least so I chose it. I should have known that "none of the above" is also a valid option. I can't believe how I spent those 4 years trying to convince myself that I will like it.
It's been one month since that day, and I'm so happy that everything has turned out this way :)
I see you lamenting about how lonely you are, your nonexistent love life and how hard it is to find a gf etc....... I don't know anything much about you, but why can't you tell I've been looking at you for what, almost an academic year now. Sigh nvm

There seem to be many relationship woes on the page, so here's a cute little piglet to cheer up your day! 

I don't know when or if your relationship will blossom, but happy people are generally more attractive than the less happy people. 

So smile! :D 

Until that day arrives, make the most out of your 'waiting time'. All the best!


Looking at the other confessions on love and romance, I cannot help but be amused at some of them. But it reminds me of my own struggles of finding that special person; an issue which could be very serious and a genuine concern, at least for some of us. (Yes I'm still evergreen)

Like some of you, I worry about finding the right partners, having tried some or other ways in finding suitable people that I could comfortably share my life with. I've been languishing in university for almost 2 years now, lingered around in camps and even in school matchmaking (!) events, finding ladies whom I felt attached to in the process. It became clear that even the end result of falling in love is hard; because girls and ladies are extremely hard to comprehend, and it is made all the more harder with my weird personality and my own concerns over their emotional stability, religious beliefs or simply the attention that they give me. A lot of my friends tell me that I try too hard. Actually, I don't even know what I'm doing; stumbling around school, orientation camps, welfare events, trying to know people just to maximise my chances of finding the right one.

Then one day during a certain school outing, I got to know this girl. She doesn't really seem to fall into the type of lover whom I desired to have, but I immediately got the fatal sense of attraction towards her. Somehow, I even invited myself to have dinner with her at her residence for a couple of occasions already, getting to know her better, and I found myself talking about suitable types of ladies in school. The thing is, though we are currently friends, I just feel afraid that she would be just like the others; eventually floating away and losing contact. Yet, I have this sense that she's waiting for someone to chase her; and yet I don't know how she feels, it doesn't seem like she's showing anything, or any telltale signs. I don't even know if we would have the chance to meet more often; and I'm scared to push things. 

I’ve been attracted to so many people that my friends call me popular and as the guy who seems to know the entire faculty. Yet, I've never felt lonelier here in school. All I really wish for is the chance for me to continue having contact with this girl. I'm so tired of waiting and trying; it's not funny anymore. Being alone is okay and bearable, but I just desire to share my life with someone else.

What should I do? 

(Sorry people if I've been extremely long winded, just trying to express my inner thoughts here:/)

First time I'm on herre, last time I'm on here. You know how it is said that if you want to attain a goal, go make it known among people, so you'd be socially pressured to take action? I think that's crap. It's applicable to how some of us are posting on NUSWhispers, is it not? Sure, this is a venting spot. But you know inside of you that you want to do something. You are telling the world about it, whatever it is. Don't feed your uncertainty with distractions. Don't sit in your warm bath of telling a confession. You felt like you did something about the situation but you didn't do sh!t, sorry. Just go for it. Do yourself some justice. Don't leave anymore what if's. All the best.
Liked this girl who is my project mate. Shes really sweet and looks remarkably angelic and i really had a great time chatting with her over lunch. I dunno whats the right approach to direct my confession to her. 就是开不了口让她知道
There's this econs tutor. She's in her final year. Year 5. Double degree in economics and accounting. She really pretty and cute. She loves to run. Is in nus x country. She's well liked by guys and even girls. I want to approach her but don't know how. She's an incredible girl, while I'm just...your average nerd...not incredible...

To the dude with the "long-winded post" on girl problems, I have been in those shoes that I think I know how you feel. 

I have been hungover from my ex girlfriend for almost 3 years now. I got quite a baggage from the breakup that lead to my tendency to emotionally withdraw from girls that Im attracted to (Im not a shy person per se, I've been told Im quite friendly and open to making new friends from both genders). Also, since my faculty (engineering) doesnt offer that much a chance to meet and mingle with new people, I do take parts in camps and activities to make friends and find The One. Odds have not been in my favor though. But still, I do try to keep my hopes up and keep improving myself for some day I might find her. My personal advice is take the leap (who knows, but dont be pushy though), and learn to self-bandage your heart when it gets broken.

But yeah, since finals are here, study first lol.
I think all interviewers and audition judges should give feedback to those who were rejected. You'll never know what went wrong unless someone tells you right? 
Let's all improve and not keep honest feedback to yourselves.
I am in love with Professor Yoshinori Nishizaki but too bad he doesn't know of my existence even though I regularly ask him questions after lecture.
One of my friends became a Christian half a year ago. Sometimes I would confide in her about my troubles, and she would ask if she can pray for me. I would agree. It's strange because she would feel that she's helping me, and I would feel that I'm helping her feel helpful. As an atheist, I struggle between being myself and being respectful to her faith. It's a delicate balance that I have yet to find. Help?
"You will definitely find a boyfriend when you go to university because there will be a lot of desperate army boys!" . Well friends, it's almost been a year, and I think this is bullshit.
"People are meant to be loved, objects are meant to be used. The problem with current world is people are used and objects are loved." 

Why is this so true.
I am going to start school in NUS SOC this year! I am super excited but yet at the same time really really afraid. But still.. Woohoo!

I wonder if it is possible for one to start off as a heterosexual, but as life goes by and such gender identity is eroded by apathy, one becomes an asexual shell? 
This post was not meant to be depressing at all. In fact the lack of romance in NUS, as anything in life, can be explained.
Applying Porter's Five forces, we are the customers, the "company" is the idea of romance. Unfortunately, all odds are against the "company"'s favour. Due to higher barrier of entry (none of my relationship comes anywhere close to the idea of romance), abundance of substitute (friends, YOLO attitude...), high bargaining power of customers ( the switching cost from being single to coupled is pretty high given the high opportunity cost of time "wasted" with one partner), and so on.
Here is a business idea: someone can design an app to help NUS students to arrange speed dating. For example, one can meet up and talk to a new person for one hour during lunch break, but has no oligation to see that person again whatsoever and has plenty of options to diversify one's lunch experience meeting with other people. If such app existed, NUS students might be willing to pay, perhaps, 1$ per match. I know I would.
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

I think I'm in love, for the first time in 21 years.

Hi guys,
When I see people posting every day about how much they hate being single and how girls have screwed them over, I feel truly bad. Everyone goes through times where they feel lonely, but that doesn't make it easy, and it's a feeling nobody deserves.

You may think that you will be single forever, or that you are marred by some flaw that will keep any decent girl from wanting you, be it acne, your physique, or your ability to interact comfortably with girls. However, I promise that this is not the case.

There is something about you that makes you irreplaceable to the right girl. The right girl might not be a 10/10, but she is the right girl for you, and as such, you will think she's beautiful. All of you are attractive in some way, even the "weird ugly nerds". Maybe you are funny, or you are smart, or you are dependable, or you are just good at listening. The girl who is worth your heart will see these things in you and you will be in love and happy.

I'm ashamed for how my sex treats you sometimes. Like a lot of guys, a lot of girls look for the wrong things in a partner. It seems like everywhere you look, people just want somebody who is "hot" and "charismatic." You've wanted a lot of girls who haven't given you the time of day. However, you are better off for having these girls pass you by, because they are vapid, shallow, stupid girls.

Someday you will find somebody who loves you deeply and completely. When this happens, I hope you realize that all of the time spent striking out was worth it, because it led you to something wonderful.

I love all of you and wish that you could love yourselves. Things will fall into place in each and every one of your lives. Just hold tight until then.
My bf is studying in SoC. He's not a romantic guy and he's always busy with studies and CCA. I may not be happy with him sometimes, but I love him and will be with him forever >.<

I'm an SoC girl and every year I have crushes on my TAs/GAs too :P

Submit your own confessions at: http://nuswhispers.com
For some reason the girls I like are always either attached, or become attached soon after I meet them, and I just never have a chance. I'm in my 4th year now, and I have never dated, and I'm always awkward around the girls I like... Sometimes it just seems like I should just give up and prepare for a life of solitude...
Every semester for the past three years, without fail, I would have crushes on the TAs and/or GAs.  But it's so sad that I only get to see them for one semester because they are graduating already. I miss my CS1020 tutor the most. J, hope you're doing well.
I am a final year student who happen to be an evergreen. So recently at the start of my final semester, I got to know this girl from another faculty and we appeared to hit it off well. Fast forward three months to today, we have become an items and I have grown attached to her. However, after a quarrel yesterday, she told me she's sick of trying. Although i could see several differences btwn us, i must admit i was never good at the dating game and it will only get worse when i leave school and go out to work. Now I am wondering if i shld persevere and pursue further, or should i just let it be, and be a #foreveralone. ?
I know this guy since Y1S1. Let's call him XF. We have many things in common and we became really good bros over the years. However, we have that weird friendship thing where we get along by insulting each other, but in a friendly way. Out of everyone in school, he's the closest friend I have. 

However, recently I realized that he has traits that really appeal to me. Our sense of humour match, he's really musical and eloquent, loves animals as much as I do, and as much as we rib each other, there's care and concern below everything. Few nights ago, I had a dream where we almost kissed - which freaks me out, because I have never thought of him that way before. 

Now I am confused and slightly afraid, because we've been bros for so long, getting together is probably going to be just a fantasy. Furthermore, I'm not even his type. 

TDLR; so deep in the friendzone, not sure what to do.
Seriously? I have been a TA in SoC for many semesters but how come not a single girl had a crush on me?
I told my TA that I wasn't depressed, but in truth, I am.
So there is this senior, who has been always helping me since we barely know each other when I first came to NUS. He has his girlfriend and we all know each other. He seems to be nice to everyone but I feel that he pays some special attention to me. I do not know how he feels about me, and I am not sure whether I like him or not. Nevertheless I really enjoy being together with him, but I will not be staying in hall next year.
I've known this one girl before going to NUS, and now we both study in FoS. We were somewhat close friends considering what I've heard about her attitude towards boys before becoming her friend. We talked a lot, sometimes went out together, and I really considered her my best friend. However, things have changed since we went to NUS. It seemed to me that she doesn't want anyone to know that we're close friends and try to distance from me. I don't know why, but that shit drove me mad. I became an ultra-jealous monster who exploded every single time she talked to somebody else "too friendly". I tried to control my temper, but it kept bugging me that even though she tried comforting me that I'm still her best friend here, she never displayed that when there were more than two of us (I was basically invisible to her in a group) and tried so hard to avoid me and limit our time together to a much lower level than close friends should be. I asked her why, she never gave me an answer I could understand. I became more and more jealousy, our fights got bigger and bigger, we started throwing insensitive words to each other... Now she has blocked all communication with me. It has been a few months, and I missed her so much. I tried to reconcile, but she refused. I just want my best friend back. So can someone show me how to get to 4k5 mmr in DotA 2 while waiting for her to (hopelessly) change her mind?

P/S: For romantic lovers, there's nothing between us. She has warned me not to fall in love with her (during the time when things were not that bad) and I haven't dreamed of that either.
Should I feel bad for being called an introvert?
I am stuck in this endless need to prove myself in this world of intense competition. With whatever I do, there is someone who is always better. I'm tired of finding meaning in this endless competition. I'm just lost in the crowd of the ordinary. I long for a day when there is nothing that matters, but a single cause. A single cause which I can fight for...A single cause which I can die for. That then will be my purpose in life.
I'm a sociology major. I love my major, but there is one think I hate about it: an overindulgent feminist. I'm fine with a girl being a feminist. In fact I support feminism. But what I hate is when they become overindulgent and start thinking that all men are out to suppress them. Oh please... There are times during tutorial that when the topic of women's rights enter into the picture, the discussion starts getting really heated. What's worse is that I'm the only guy in many of those tutorials. X.x Many times I just want to leave and let them indulge in their 'discussions'.
I feel like now, with all the progressiveness, that it is more socially acceptable to just say I'm asexual. At least, rather that than admit to a terrible truth that I try to deny: That my standards may be a tad too high for my own good. 

At least, people find you a lot less of a b***h/arrogant if you say 'I may be asexual, I don't know' compared to 'I just haven't found someone I respected enough to really have a crush/fall in love with.' At least I don't get reactions like 'Well maybe you should stop having such high expectations/be so stuck up/idealistic.'

Ok, so respect may be the wrong word. Something closer would be admire with more than a point of passing interest. And so I pretend to have frivolous crushes on people that most people find good looking (and objectively, they are) but I absolutely feel nothing for. I don't even find them attractive. 

It's not like I don't want to try either, but feelings are hard things to fabricate and I find it far more cruel to lead a poor guy/girl going on a date on hoping I'd finally have feelings. With all due respect to everyone I have amazing friends and meet wonderful people in my life but it feels so hard to form connections that are beyond friendship. Trust them with my life? Yes. To bail me out of jail if I do stupid things? Yes. With my heart? Absolutely not romantically. So maybe I need a reality check, but I a) Don't fangirl over any celebrities, singers, bands, actors or otherwise. b) Don't really fall in love with fictional characters in anime/movies/books beyond really rooting for them against their enemies. (For instance, I adore Tyrion but marrying the man? Never.) 

Yet I know I am not fully asexual because I have been capable of having a crush once, and it's not like I was burnt, I simply fell out of my crush once I wrote down a confession speech and everything and realised that I just didn't feel it anymore. 

So now I'm stuck. I'm okay with living happily alone till old age, but I do wish I can genuinely join in or empathise when people have relationship woes. It makes me feel like a terrible human being when I catch myself thinking 'She/he can do better' or 'Eh, if you want to settle he/she's a good choice.'

To the girl who has been asking around for my thesis progress, STOP BEING SO OBSESSED WITH ME!
imma freshie. maybe that's why loooking at slides full of minimininminmini words turns me off. and the lecturer loved talking non stop for 2 hours on it and going through every single word. OMG. so what's important and what's not. 
><
Uni made me realize on a different level how important it is to choose your friends wisely. There are times when you're just stuck with a small bunch and their negativity keeps getting to you, and then you become another source of negativity for more people. Remember to get outside your circle for a breather and keep your mind open for new experiences. It helps you reflect on you poor attitude.
Because everyone can use a compliment once in a while and feel good about oneself:
I think Haruhi you are the prettiest girl I've seen in NUS and I consider myself really lucky to have had a chance meet you for that briefest moment. Keep up your bright personality!
I would have loved to get to know you more (since I'm a huge Japanese culture enthusiast as well) but too bad you're on exchange and leaving soon :-(
さようなら。
I was about to start a romance when finals suddenly came. Oh I feel like stuck.
when you find out that the girl you've been seeing has also been seeing another guy.. ;_;
it's gonna be week 13 already :'( can we not?
There is this girl that I knew since year 1. We were more like acquaintance to each other having took similar modules since my second sem. I find her to be very adorable and want to know her more. But I am too shy to talk to her and have to wait for her to talk to me every time. I also get jealous very easily when I see her talking to another guy. I am such a useless guy T.T
I have a crush on one of my angmoh profs, who's married to the love of his life. I know I'm not going to take it any further and neither is he but....it's just that painful sinking feeling that his classes are ending because it's Week 12 and I'll never get to be in his class again :(
Anyone else wishes you make new friends in college that willingly take a GEM with you, sit with you in lectures and lunch with you? :( Feeling so lonely without a clique here
I have had crush on a guy for more than a year and was thinking of confessing. Last month, we were talking about love and people we could possibly end up together with. And he said right away that the girl he would end up with is nothing like me.  He is looking for someone sweet and cute. Ouch. Apply cold water to burn. One month has passed and it still hurts. This sucks.
There's this girl I knew since the first year, from soci class, and I'm in my third now.

For the past 5 sems we'll often bump into each other and say hi, and without fail part of the conversation will look like this: 

Her: So you are doing... Polscience right?
Me: Nah, history.

And I'd ask for her major. Because for some reason I'd forget after every semester; maybe just to find something to ask her again the next time we meet.

But that's not the only thing I've forgotten. There's something else I need to ask her, and I've not been able to. It's just too awkward. Nobody just suddenly pull this on someone that you've known for 3 years.

Thought she was on exchange this sem but I did see her again last week; but she was with a guy i didnt know so it'll be even weirder.

But if I do bump into her again, and she's not with anyone. I'd pick up my courage and I'm going to say it. That line I've been wanting to say since the last day of that soci class, and every subsequent time I saw her.

"Eh, what's your name ah."
It's been six months, and I still miss that 30 minutes that we spent chatting. Do you still remember that moment, E.K? Oct2014
My girlfriend is in computing. I confessed to her in binary. I'm so glad I managed to Capture The Flag.

I've been in love with her for so long, but I watched her get together with him and watched him hurt her. All these while, I never dared to tell her how much I love her and how much I wanted to protect her all my life. I remember how she came crying to me, asking me for help and I was as heartbroken as her. I wanted to give him a beating so badly but I never had the courage to stand up for her. I hope that one day, I will get to tell her how I feel before she leaves for SEP. By then, I hope she will accept my request to join her in Shanghai. I don't know how she will respond to my sudden confession, but I know that deep within my heart, even if she rejects me, she will always be that important someone in my heart. I hope you see this, and realise its you I'm talking about. You have such a beautiful smile which I want to keep there forever. When will I ever find that courage?
I was an exchange student in NUS last semester. When people ask about my experiences in Singapore, I burst out my answer, it was absolutely amazing! Except from all the awesome people I met in NUS, I realized all my good memories come down to this very special person I met there. 
So I was showing him some of the posts from this website, he said you should do it. And can't believe I am seriously doing it. I see many posts about love at first sight, I think it is truly great. We had a debate about whether it was love at first sight, but I dont even know. I remember telling my friends about this guy I really like. They said they were more than happy to help. so I told them the story and they were like you really dont need us. It happened rather fast before I can figure out whether it was because of love at first sight or because we hung out so often. although, Im really grateful to have been where we have been. 
I remember you holding my hand to cross the red light when all I wanted to do was being a good citizen. I also remember you told me that I should buy new clothes so we went to uniqlo and bought matching snoopy t-shirts! I kept the tags cause its so cute, but we never got to wear the tshirts together.  :( I also remember being on the plane in the middle of the night, crying and all too tired, drenched with all the good memories I had with you.  
Now that we are half globe apart, I still can't picture myself without you. cant wait to tell you about new stuff in my life and so "sian" when you go to sleep. considering how hard it is to find someone to like you back  as this website is suggesting, being so far away from each other still makes me a heck of a lucky person. 
I guess thats how relationship should be, if it's too easy to get, nobody's gonna treasure it. & just keep it up! 


I feel all the beautiful girls in SOC are exchanged in this semester....... If not, reply this with your photo!  <del> I am not trying to add them by posting this ...</del>
Sometimes I think hall is only for the extroverts or the super outgoing. Introverts like me just have no place to fit in and when I talk about moving out to somewhere quieter, everyone just asks "WHY?????". I think a lot of them don't really understand that I need my own space too.
I can't wait for summer so that I can interact with this sweet fellow LP more! <3 #SOW15
I feel like the reason Nus confessions died off pretty quickly was that unless some other countries in Singapore there is only so many things to confess to. Nobody in their right mind is going to confess to taking hard drugs with a death penalty hanging over their heads. And while drunken stories and partying definitely occur there is relatively far fewer of them to confess to real debauchery like cheating or orgies or messy break ups  or whatever people get up to that needs confessing without mentioning specific circumstances that narrows people down and loses the anonymity.   So we are left only to confess about crushes which is sweet but gets stale after a while or bitch about group mates. And even then it wears thin because of corse everyone's crushes is unique and something beautiful but it is the same boy meets girl or girl meets boy and they are too shy so too bad you're Gonna miss the girl/guy. There is only so much variation. Here's to Hoping whispers will last longer.

To all kids still studying in NUS - cherish your time there. I can honestly say that my time in NUS was the best 4 years of my life. I was lucky enough to meet and make friends with many highly intellectual people and it opened my mind to new perspectives and possibilities more than I could have ever imagined. 

Staying on campus was THE BEST - making new friends, gaining a greater sense of independence. If you are undecided as to whether or not to stay on campus because you fear for your studies, JUST DO IT! Even if it's just for a year. Personally, I couldn't imagine having as awesome a time if I didn't stay on campus all 4 years. As somebody else said, after you come back from SEP, your perspective changes (also because you're going into year 4 and don't give much of a crap anymore).

I went back recently just to see the campus for the first time since I graduated in 2012 and I realized I miss NUS so. damn. much. So students, don't just spend all your time mugging, make friends and have fun. This is probably the last time you can really let go and do whatever with little consequences.
Whenever I am about to do something embarrassing, I convince myself that nobody is going to remember me
It's just so hard to get friends in Science fac, in tut people just walk in , sit and listen, walk out and never communicate :(
Someone use me and my senior as shield for her study date. She better treat buy us a meal for that.

There's this girl in my CCA who's smile I just can't get over, it's too beautiful. Though I think I'm not well liked by her, I guess looking whenever she smile is good enough.
Many people say that they are very busy and stressed out, yet they aren't doing any goddamned work for most of the day.
Every time I read a confession about a crush without a name, I pretend that the person is talking about me #findmesomebodytolove
I just wanna say that, I hate to bump into my ex in school. Sometimes, there's no choice.
Sometimes, I feel so hung up about what I've lost, that I forget about moving on.
Hey CAPT girl :) I just wanted to say that I love the way you smile and laugh, how you're always the life of the party, and most of all, that you're so bubbly and pretty that each time I see you, my heart skips a beat.

I'd never dare to introduce myself to you in real life, so I guess I'm stuck looking at you through my binoculars.
"I got a huge crush on my classmate. I knew he likes me too but I guess he just couldn't gather the courage to approach me. Other guys in the class came up and talked to me quite comfortably but not him. Think he's too shy. Haizzz I even dreamt of him the other day. As an Asian girl, I have never approached a guy before so... I guess this gonna just go down with the semester end."

Perhaps he lacks courage. Perhaps he's too shy. Perhaps he's someone whom takes relationships very seriously and isn't the kind to casually approach girls. Perhaps he has little faith in himself and in others. Perhaps if you think he's also into you and he's worth it, you should take a leap of faith to just to get to know him more. Perhaps he wants to get to know more about you too...
I am following my crush everywhere and he doesn't even know. My 'friends' ratted me out but he doesn't believe them? HAHA
I don't get how people get sucked into a romance so quickly (superficial infatuation?). Furthermore, it's absurd that they begin spending a bulk of time with the new interest (of a few months) and ignore friends who have always been there for them.
We broke up last week. The fire stopped burning and I wonder how we even got together in the first place.
To the group of guys who always talk about sex-related stuff. I hope you do realize that I am still a girl.

It has not been long since I started liking this girl but I hope we can be together.. I hoped my actions can move you :)
I've had this crush for the longest time on an ex TG mate, and everytime i see her my heart aches because i know i will never dare confess or do anything about it, yet i want so much to.   

She is from nus jazz and law. Did i mistake the look in your eyes, your smile, ever so encouraging, as i faced the class in year one? 

Unfortunately we are from different worlds. You, with your clique of cool friends. This may well be my first and last, my only chance of expressing my feelings. 

Imagine that which could be, if only I dared.

A look, a longing, a wistfulness, is all i can muster, even if i cared. 

All i can do, is love from afar. 

Though i know the door was actually ajar. 

Everytime i see you, i tell myself "i just can't". 

A heart broken, before love even begun.
Lol, I cannot believe people are really posting lost and found here #interesting
I have a crush on this graduating senior but I just don't have the courage to own up. The thing is that he is my TA and I see him once a week. Now that the semester is ending, I may not get to see him anymore. Should I confess to him?
