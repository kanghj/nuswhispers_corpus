HI administrators. Part of the guidelines of posting on this site is 'No sensitive material'. Would it be possible to provide a more precise understanding of what it means to be sensitive. Because what is meant by sensitive is highly subjective and is dependent on one's upbringing, views and perspectives. There is going to be a risk of putting a party in an uncomfortable position when one posts on this page, but when would we accept that this is a risk worth taking. I really appreciate the chance to be anonymous while giving me a platform where there is a targeted audience, and I do acknowledge that I should practice responsibility and accountability if the message gets traced back to me. However, if what is posted is not evaluated adequately for its sensitivity (of which it should be a consensus amongst the moderators), it may forebode poorly on the degree of freedom of speech in the university, considering that even though this page runs to some extent independent of NUS, it still reflects NUS and its students.

Sometimes, I wonder why the society favours people with tremendous level of egotism and elitism, offering them scholarships and recognitions, when they are too self-absorbed to even offer sincere apologies to a mistake they made. Is this a self-fulfilling prophecy to these people absent of humility? I pity my society.

To all the recent EDMW-ers trying to stir shit here - you really aren't welcome in our community, and your trolling just makes you look ridiculous more than anything. 

I think I speak for the vast majority of the NUS community when I say we reject your racist and backward views. Go back to HWZ and SBF where you guys can fester without bothering us, thanks.

My present china & malaysian friends tell me their 60+ parents and relatives are retired. Same with former India, Bangla, Burmese, Pinoy friends. They tell me when they first come here they were surprise to see so many senior citizens working in sinkapore as cashiers, plate collectors, dish washers, cleaners, security guards, etc etc.

Sad isn't it? But sinkies still see their countries no up, think they are backward, third world while we are first world, 'rich' and 'advanced'!

I've been called a traitor because I choose to do what I think is right regardless of which team I belong to.

I've been called an ungrateful fellow because I want everyone to move beyond status quo and be better, instead of always dwelling on our past successes.

I've been called a trouble maker because I see the need to voice out a problem, instead of following the herd and pretend the problem doesn't exist.

At the end, I've been called to remain silent because I was right, and they were wrong.

I warned them but they never listen. I may be younger, but your 20 years of experience doesn't really mean anything if you refuse to acknowledge the underlying problem with the company's management and structure. 

Now the whole lot of you older, more experienced, overpaid but foolishly stubborn workers will be out of jobs soon.

I will be unemployed too. But only for three days. A great company has offered me a job because I am not shy to tell them I am a traitor, an ungrateful fellow and a trouble maker.

That's why they are a powerful MNC while you are a little SME for decades. It's because they listen and consider people's honest opinions, while you assume a problem is insignicant just because only a few speak about it.

It was nice knowing all of you. The experience wasn't pleasant but you taught me a lot the hard way.

Today I came across a news article on more young boys finding prostitutes for sex, mainly due to peer pressure (especially during NS) or more exposure to porn. 

I had a burning qns on this: why is it that if a guy have good self control and thus is still a virgin by say 18 years of age, people tend to laugh at him for "not being a man" and imposing pressure on him to have his first sexual experience? Why won't society in general see these guys as a good man who have good self control and encourage him to continue avoiding prostitutes for as long as he can?

 You may find some flaws in EDMW. There are alot of siaolangs in EDMW. What is most important thing about EDMW is that it is a place where you can get insights about things which will never be reported in mainstream media. It is BETTER than STOMP. The academia knows nuts about the real world. It's too naive to believe in whatever the authorities and professors tell you to do. Internet forums and social networks are now forcing companies and politicians to be more transparent. #LindyEffect

I am not sure if courtship/marriage serves its evolutionary purpose anymore especially when we have IVFs, extending social networks which can replace traditional "family" as the strong emotional support, etc.
Perhaps the societal pressure on getting married is getting closer to becoming a remnant of the old world?
If it were up to me, I'd wish humans are asexual, productive human beings who work tirelessly to contribute to the betterment of society. I am currently in "fwb", hating myself for giving in to sexual gratification...
To the those desperate singles out there, cheer up. You men and women could be the pioneers of a brave new world.

 Memes don't justify how much effort is put in to be nice. If you go around treating nice people like shit, thinking that they're hypocrites, then eventually they stop being nice and prove you right. After all, either way, the good intentions are being perceived as bad intentions. So why bother? 

People don't have to give you empathy. They don't have to be nice to you. They owe you nothing. And whether courtship or not the effort is real. At least they did something whilst you're judging on your "high moral ground" at the receiving end of a nice treatment. 

If you suspect they have an alternative motive, it's your right to be suspicious of them. 

But unless you really know them as a person it really says a lot about you to ultimately determine who they are through a meme.

I am born to a relatively poor family. With my dad struggling to put bread on the table. My mum worked as a babysitter to supplement the family income. And we even have to sacrifice a room to a tenant just so we could make ends meet. I just got into NUS, I’m a year one student and that means greater burden on my parents. But that gave me the drive to work hard, to get the hell out of this situation, to stop being poor. I managed to get myself a scholarship which was the only reason why I could afford a university education. Trying to save money, I only ate chai fan or bread I brought from home and I haven’t taken a single cent from my parents since I enlisted. 

I didn’t intend for this to be a sob story, but just to put you into perspective, my dad is still using an iphone3, my parents have not been overseas for the past 20 years. That’s my family’s financial situation. AND IT REALLY SUCKS TO BE POOR.

As for my brother? He's spending money as though he owns a bank. He’s 24, with an N-level qualification. He has never been a role model. And what he did today just made me give up hope on him. For the sake of 5 dollars, he was willing to pull a knife from the kitchen. For the sake of a few dollars, he was willing to rip open my mum’s coin pouch. And what does he do with all these money? He spends it on cigarettes, he spends it on his E-bike, he spends it on his bunch of hopeless friends. 

What have I ever done to deserve such a useless, hopeless brother? I’ve seen how loving, patient and protective elder siblings can be. And I envy them. All I wish for is a peaceful house, a brother that does not rob our own parents. Is that too much to ask for? Sometimes I really wish that he can land himself in jail so that I don’t have to see him ever again. He doesn't deserve my parents, he doesn't deserve everything that was given to him.

Decadence of the SUN - Chapter 1

*This is a fictional story and all resemblances to any person, alive or dead, or to any occurrence in reality are purely coincidental.*

Democracy is like romance - sounds good on paper, difficult to execute properly and substantially unfair to some. This is especially so on the student level where student committees and clubs purport to practise democracy. However, such "democracy" is no more than a mirage.

To most students, democracy equates to being able to vote for their student leaders. Yet, human ingenuity and desire to attain or retain power know no bounds. Yes, students may have the right to vote, but other matters like who is eligible to stand for election, methods and location of voting as well as appeal procedures - they are levers which the insiders use to ensure that the odds are never in the favour of outsiders and coup-attempters.

This is the story of the Students United Network, also known as the SUN. It is the largest student committee in Utopia School by membership and by budget. Contrary to its grand-sounding name, it is highly fractious. It is made up of 20 factions and a federal faction, each with their own Faction Council. Disputes on the Federal Forum, made up of the high ranking Faction leaders, routinely occur year after year over relatively minor matters such that other students have given up rolling their eyes. In fact, there is a well-known nickname for SUN amongst some students - Students United, Never.

Killsteal is the Federal Faction Chief. He was given the nickname of "Thronesteal" by his peers after he was almost single-handedly gifted the "throne" of Federal Faction Chief by his predecessor the Soul Father through electoral procedural tweaks. Killsteal did not like the original nickname and decided to change to the current one instead shortly after his ascension.

Killsteal's deputy on the Federal Faction Council is Kennedy. Kennedy is a young rising star, having been plucked from one of the biggest Faction Council. Unlike Killsteal, Kennedy retains a disdain for outright power grabbing and holds on to ideas of fairness and equity. His time on the Federal Forum has disillusioned him somewhat, but not enough to completely extinguish his flames of idealism. He feels that Killsteal is not the brightest knife in the drawer and owes much of his position to the Soul Father. Yet, Kennedy is able to keep his mouth shut and bury his disdain well.

Joker is the last of the triumvirate on the Federal Faction Council. Having served on a small but influential Faction Council, Joker is hard-nosed about student politics and not afraid to sway where the political winds blow. Although a member of the Federal Faction Council, his heart is still towards his former Faction Council. He is afraid of Kennedy's desire to bring about fairness and equity will harm his former Faction Council's interests. Therefore, he supports and actively encourages Killsteal's attempts to thwart Kennedy's reforms.

It was late spring. The Federal Faction Council was already two-thirds into their term. Killsteal was justifiably worried about his succession. Although he had a candidate or two in mind, he was unsure whether they would survive the electoral process, especially when they spent the entirety of their student political time in the Federal Faction. Killsteal took off his glasses, put them on his office table, closed his eyes and rubbed his temples.

Various thoughts swirled in his mind. Other than the usual academic matters, he thought of how to fix the Federal Forum Chief, Simcity. Lately, Simcity had been making noises about the Federal Faction Council's opacity in operations. Shutting Simcity down was not an option as that would lead to an outright revolt by the other faction leaders on the Forum. Letting him continue would just make the Federal Faction, and Killsteal in particular, look bad. Killsteal was vexed. Perhaps, if his successor secures the throne soon for the next term, Killsteal would be able to nerf the Forum Chief's powers without fear of a political backlash.

He opened his eyes and looked at the pile of papers in front of him. At the top was a report by Kennedy's committee. He looked at the title - "Reform Committee: Reforms for the Federal Faction Electoral Process". This is bad, Killsteal thought to himself. He put the report down, picked up his phone and made a call.

"Hello. It's me. It's time for Operation SEeX."

There are so many ways of speaking and using English. Why are there grammar nazis (especially those academics) who think that there is only one proper way of speaking English? Language is just a tool to communicate your thoughts. As it is instrumental, as long as it can be communicated and understood, I don't see why people should be penalized.

I don't mean to sound rude, but I think it's time we start taking ownership of our behavior and lives, instead of always using the guise of "psychological problems" as an excuse to externalize our own flaws or mistakes. I am not a psychology or legal expert, just a normal girl. And every time I read about people on the news who committed a crime or tort, their lawyers will always try to put the blame on some psychological problem. Injured or killed someone? Sure. It's not the perpetrator's fault. He should be pardoned instead of facing the full extent of justice as it was probably due to an inevitable problem with his brain in managing anger or violence, and therefore it is totally beyond his control. Really? I didn't know the brain and its owner are separate entities. So Mind blowing! -_-

Also, unfaithful people who cheat on their partner through acts of promiscuity such as Tiger Woods irresponsibly attributed their wrongdoings as a mental health issue of "sexual addiction". And some money-grubbing professionals are often too eager to justify that these "sex addicts" need professional help instead of taking full responsibility for their actions. What's really funny is that only when they are caught red-handed or have to face legal liability, then they realize they have a "mental health condition". On the contrary if they are not caught, they do not see it as a health problem. Suspicious right? 

Similarly, when people in school say they have difficulties interacting with people or making friends because they have "social anxiety" issues, they are saying "Hey! I don't want to take the initiative and make an effort to go out there to make friends because I have a mental issue. But I expect people to take the initiative to come make friends with me instead." 

If you want to make friends or find a girlfriend/boyfriend, you must do something about it. And you have to stop complaining you have trouble interacting with others because you have a "mental problem", but yet you expect others to take all the effort to get to know you. What makes you so special anyway? For any relationship or friendship to work, it takes two to clap. Although you cannot guarantee that the person will reciprocate, at least you have done your part. 

But to be fair, some really do have personality issues which they find it hard to change, perhaps due to their upbringing or bad experiences. While there is no such thing as a magic pill to turn you into a different person overnight, you have the choice to choose how you want to think about yourself and others, and let these thoughts guide your behavior. And over time, it will become your habit and it will feel natural. Be patient, take it bit-by-bit and you will achieve your ideal self one day. And all these start with the willingness to do it :D

Hi, Im a medical student too.
While it is true that we are the group of people who suffers from high depression rate and high "self-harm" inflicting thoughts... I think that this is sadly, a norm for us. We are going to face life and death situations in future and that is a norm. We have to deal with other people's family grieve and happiness, that is a norm.

I support the decision to seek medical help or psychological help for that matter. As much as people say that your medical records are confidential... the medical world in SG is really small. I am really doubtful if such record won't affect residency application in future...

In any case! fight on! Even if you don't practice as a doctor, you can still give medical advice to other people and find joy that way!

Lots of posts about gf leaving bf for richer guys lately. I teared up a bit at your stories, though I am glad that such sensible men actually exist in this universe.
I am girl, born into a lower middle class family. Basically I could never depend on my parents’ connection or assets for my future. That very circumstance taught me to be fiercely independent, to study my ass off to get scholarships, and slowly build up my career. That very circumstance has also taught me how meaningless and ephemeral material desires are. I will be 110% comfortable with my partner being a househusband lol.
But I am no one to judge other people. Your exes indeed had their own struggles, and they must be very decent to be so honest about their feelings.
I am sorry that your love stories had no happy endings. Keep writing your own life stories with the same values and ambitions. May true love come find you one day.

To  INTJs are at their most attractive when they do not try actively to attract a partner. This is strange but true. Just keep excelling at what you love to do, make a great career out of it, act from a standpoint of outcome-independence, and use your systemising abilities to make sure you actually can play the social game when needed to. This is how you will find your match-made-in-heaven ENFP. Most girls are of the SF variety anyway and trust me, there is no utility to be found there.

To 

You sound like an ISTP. Are you? 
Let's presume you are one or else there is no point for me to type this.

I'm an ISTP. I think it's best to be yourself. Try not to look so cold when meeting new people. Flourish your Se well. Usually ISTP that have good command of Se are the ones that can make friends more easily due to their easy-going nature. 

& try to learn to hold conversations well. Yes actions are louder than words but some girls will prefer more communication. Isn't it good if you utilize both methods?
-
 
. Sadly, I agree with some of the points raised by the op. I think spelling should no longer be an issue because we have spell checkers and auto correct functions.  The problem comes is actually complex grammar - countable and uncountable nouns. Monies and money. Equipment and equipments.  Data and datas, etc. It's not as simple as you think. Then you have the problems of subject verb agreement e.g. ARE either my brothers or my father responsible? IS either my father or my brothers responsible? Our assets were wiped out by the economic meltdown, etc. 

I think we should strive to improve ourselves. 

The problem with the op is the condescending view of those with poor language skills. Clearly, having good grammar is not everything because the op has to depend on others; why not do everything yourself? 

I think that's the problem with grammar Nazis; the view that grammar above content and belittle those that has bad command of a language.  

Language is a the basis for communication. Grammar, content and tone makes up the communication. 

The post is really a bad example - grammatically perfect but stupid in content and tone. A post to encourage others to improve their grammar becomes a post ridicule those bad in grammar. A post that achieve the opposite of what it is intended. Really stupid. 
-
 
I find the standard of English amongst my peers to be quite appalling, especially where most are almost completing their degrees but still expressing themselves in incredibly substandard ways. While I understand that colloquialism brings a sense of closeness amongst people, I don't see it as a reason to be lax on grammar. At all.  

Disgustingly simple things like "supposeD to", or using the correct past participles such as "have DRUNK"/ "have RUN"/ "have EATEN" are still being used and abused because people can't be arsed to learn them up properly. 

Words like "luggage", "sheep" and "equipment" have the same singular and plural forms, and don't get me started on people who go to BKK to buy loads of shit and post on Instagram pictures of their "loots" or "stuffs". 

NO. JUST NO. 

(In case some need clarification, the plural of loot is STILL loot, as with stuff. Chucking an "s" at the back of a word doesn't automatically make it plural, as you may mistakenly think.) 

Commonly misspelled words still include "separate" or "weird" (seperate or wierd, anyone?), and I regularly hear things like "she don't" or "he don't"... like wtf bro get your grammar together already!! People are still getting simple things wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong. Somewhere out there, an innocent puppy dies every time a grammar mistake is committed.

Extra tip: there is also never, ever an "of" after the word "comprise." 

For goodness sake can people also learn how to pronounce the "th" sound in "three", "thought", "then", "thanks" or "third" (turd, anyone?) Is it really that difficult? 

I cringe every single time I see/hear people make these errors, and while I owe it to myself to use English properly, I never actually correct my friends in real life. It's called EQ I suppose. I still need my friends even if their English sucks balls. I also feel like my dating pool dramatically decreases every time someone cute cannot hold himself well when he opens his mouth. 

So please everyone, pull yourselves together now and improve the collective grammar of our nation.

The university is a place to learn skills. To develop the inquisitive mind. To seek knowledge. 

What appalled me is that Singaporeans in general like to compare. 

ITE vs poly vs KC 
Smu vs ntu vs nus. 
Com science vs engineering vs arts/law/ medicine 

You get my point. If you are always comparing about who is the best, when will you ever realize that for a nation to grow, you need to stop comparing, start respecting and work together. Did our forefathers build this country by comparing? No. They worked together. 

You can be in com science/law/medicine, but once you see yourselves above your peers, than you can get a CAP of 5.0 but still be a failure. 

Often we are asked what's Sg 50 and beyond. Here's my view. If we don't start respecting the profession, and see it as equal, I doubt we will even see Sg 75. We need to work together. 

There is no "best" degree. It's all a matter of perception, your perception. With this thought in mind, please keep Ur views to Ur eyes and your opinions in Ur head. No point shooting down a faculty just to boost Ur ego.

This monadology is mindfuck.............

1. A monad is is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By ‘simple’ is meant ‘without parts’.

2. And there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form [figure] nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and, in a word, the elements of things.

4. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.

5. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into being by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the combination of parts [composition].

The best apology you can give is to make a sincere effort to reduce your anger (and other negative emotions) and to treat others (and oneself) with kindness.

It may seem easy at times of peace, but when we are in a hurry or threatened, suddenly everything goes out of the window. Scratch that, it's not at all easy even during peaceful times. Nonetheless, you have got to try, try, try.

Hello NUSWhispers fans,

Our team would like to address some of the concerns regarding fessup.

Firstly, we would like to make it clear that NUSWhispers is NOT collaborating with fessup in any way, neither do we have an intention to do so.

Like most of the other local confession pages, we have been approached by them for a possible collaboration. We have decided to turn down their request as we have our own platform to maintain and approve confessions.

Nevertheless, we are disappointed that fessup continued to imply that NUSWhispers is supported in their product based on their Facebook advertorial.

We have been, and will reject any confessions regarding fessup.

Secondly, we would like to address a Medium article made by its founder claiming that he has been a victim of cyberbullying at NUSWhispers.

We would like to make it clear that we DO NOT condone cyberbullying fellow users within the platform. In the past we have been banning several users for troll commenting and sending warnings to commenters who may have crossed the line.

Like always, if you have any feedback, feel free to message us or drop us an email at nuswhispers@googlegroups.com.

Responding to . Just went through the confrontation of my dad about this. It's painful.

1) you need evidence. Sry. Immediate response is to deny
2) be focused on the pt of your confrontation. Mine was to make sure he realises what he's doing is wrong to my mom and he needs to stop or fix it or wtv
3) make sure he tells my mom about it. Or you tell her yourself.
4) your mom will cry but she will thank you forever for telling her as soon as you can

At the end of the day, what's the purpose of the confrontation? For me, it was to ensure that my parents dealt with the problems in their marriage- so that means reconciliation or divorce. 

Still a horrible experience. Got my church ppl on standby in case of a huge physical fight. Might wanna be with ur mom a few days after the confrontation to see the situation.

I've always wondered, does having better handwriting make a difference in marks? My handwriting during tests / exams / under time constraints is usually.. less legible than I would have liked. I mean, it's definitely readable, but it might be annoying for the marker to read it since it's quite ugly and there are many crossing outs. Is it likely that someone who writes exactly the same thing as I do in a better handwriting would get higher marks? Or are profs / TAs objective enough to look beyond aesthetics and at the content?
*again, my handwriting isn't illegible, just ugly but still readable (albeit a little annoying to do so) I would say.

To  I don't have the citations, but I vaguely remember learning in an FASS module that the statistic of 1 in 5 female graduates being single can be attributed the following phenomenons - Males in SG marry women of the same educational status or lower, whereas females tend to marry males of equal or higher educational qualifications than them. Males effectively have a larger dating pool, since they're open to dating equal or down (education). Occasionally, we see anomalies such as the male hawker who married a female Uni graduate (story seen in the papers).

To  Here's a point that I found missing in most discussion of expat vs locals. OK, it's simple. By and large, it takes a special trait in a person to leave their home country in search of fortunes abroad. Adventurism. A host of things come with this: thrill-seeking, live for the moment, confidence, bravado, daring, etc ... All of which are pretty attractive, by and large. It's either in their nature, or by selection: aka, people who don't have this trait can't cope, drop out, and go back. I've seen many foreign students can't stand the change n environment and go back.

Anyway, some worked and lived in godforsaken places like sub-Saharan Africa where they need armed guards with AKs just to not get murdered in their sleep. I know one of them used to live in mansion by the riverside. Every morning, the butler has to wake up earlier than the guy, go down to the river, push a corpse that washed up previous night back into the river for it to float away to wash up somewhere else, and for the boss to not see a corpse on his porch. Holy shit, people actually want to work there? You see that mate? That's adventurism. Or a guy who live in a Middle Eastern country with some really zealous religious police. No porn, no pre-marital sex allowed. and they mean it. Not some lip service, ala Singapore's law; but they kind that they can bust into your room, search you laptops and will, then sentence you to who knows what punishment.

So, in comparison, you have the cream of the daring, adventurous crop against guys who might still be living with his mom. Besides, how can you date a modern woman without a crash pad to bang her, heh? Don't underestimate the power of physical intimacy. It can trick both sides to enter a relationship prematurely.

I'm a foreigner in Singapore, but I'm not exactly the most adventurous type. I take a normal boring office job, and rent a normal boring room. But this I think is a really easy to see facet. Expats are expats for a reason, that reason is their personality. Just so happen that the same personality is attractive, no need to be butthurt.

In order to offend the other gender, for me to be a complete asshole to both sides of the debate, that comparison is like comparing girls in porn to girls in real life. I know some weaboos who don't believe me that real Japanese girls are not "that" physically attractive. Their evidence? Just look at JAV. Holy shit mate. Anyway, I've been to Japan, and just like girls elsewhere, there are varying degrees of physical attractiveness. But this is what I can say for sure. They are not a happy bunch. If you look at the stream of office worker in suits walking to the trains every morning, they look rather tired, grim, and stoic. Front line customer service workers always smile, but it's a frozen, mechanical smile. You gotta understand me, I come from a place with really bad customer service. They might curse you just for being a little too picky with your orders. It might irked me in the past; but as I grow older, I appreciate the honesty. I am a very honest and direct person, so I always like it in returns.

Really? Someone can't even send in funny posts without getting questioned about originality, presenting citations etc. It happens all the time. You guys do know that it's an anonymous platform right? He/she doesn't get any form of credit lol. Unless his/her post earning multiple likes doesn't seem to settle well with you... (clearly) Find it funny? Like it. Don't? Then move on to another post. It's really that simple. Your so called 'intellectual' in depth analysis and lame attempt at trying to ruin the joke is just so unnecessary. You even have to find fault with a joke? Wow... 

Oh and incase you were wondering, this was an original post. Can't wait for the snarky comments! : )

 The single $ingaporean women will start blaming the Singaporean men for being useless, unromantic, not handsome, not rich etc. Then, they will praise the Ang moh and recently the Koreans for being handsome and romantic etc. 'Why Singaporean men cannot be like them?'.

What most of them don't realize is that they have no thoughts on their own. Their thoughts are dictated by popular cultures.

To ,

Hi classmate. To be honest, I'm sure most of us are polite by nature. Even if we don't like a certain prof, we won't be rude to him or her. We are all mature adults here. If we don't like a certain lecturer, we skip the lesson on our own will. It's as simple as that. I don't think I have ever seen any of us being blatantly rude to a prof openly (this is coming from someone who attended like 99% of lectures since y1).

As for the recent incident you mentioned, it's a well known fact that lecturers from a certain faculty don't follow the 15-20min before rule. They tend to drag their lectures to the 2h mark. Usually, most of us that have something on will just leave quietly. But in that recent incident, the prof asked the class why do we have to end earlier. To some people who are more straightforward, this may be a"duh" kind of question and hence the not-so-pleasant remark that some of us have electives to rush to. I'm not the one who said those remarks but I'm pretty sure they didn't mean to be rude. Maybe they were just being direct and honest? I admit it could had been phrased in a nicer way but I'm confident in our classmates in that they never meant to be rude. 

Tldr; believe in your classmates, don't jump to conclusions

As a final year student in chemical engineering, I can say that this module called design project is truly a Nietzsche project. You learn everything from nihilism to Will to power so on so forth. Seriously speaking, I think design project is the abyss because the more I gaze at this abyss called the simulation window, the abyss gazes back at me. It is honestly a living nightmare which makes us all live in Bad Faith. Completely. Inauthentic. Help me Sartre please...

To those who know me well, you would know that I spend an inordinate amount of time by myself.  It is no surprise to find me sitting outside my classroom reading a book, scribbling a few notes, or even just staring into space. Perhaps you find this behaviour bizarre, simply discounted as one of my many idiosyncrasies. Perhaps you’ve even stopped to sit beside me, confused as to just why I am here, all alone. To those who have, I have nothing but utmost gratitude (thank you!), but I also have a question: why is being alone a cause for concern? And why do you presume that I don’t want to be alone? 
Granted, as Aristotle said, “Man is by nature a social animal”. Evolution itself has shown that humans were meant to interact – our brains are larger than most mammals of comparable size due to the growth of the neocortex. This is the part of the brain that accommodates the extra functions of language and emotional regulation, empathy and social learning (the ability to transmit ideas and information). It is safe to say that we inherently crave company and thrive in communities. After all, it is through socialisation that we establish relationships as well as develop ourselves as individuals. 
However, someone who eats lunch by themselves, or goes out unaccompanied isn’t necessarily lonely or antisocial. We live in such an interconnected world: we are constantly bombarded by endless notifications of things to do and places to go, even after spending an entire day surrounded by people. Aren’t we entitled to simply not feel like making conversation, or socializing in general?
Perhaps the problem lies in us equating being alone with loneliness. Living in a social environment creates the constant pressure to connect with other people, and the absence of such is such a discomfiting feeling that some people would prefer the physical pain of an electric shock than spend time with themselves. This instinct to socialize is something that is cultivated from young. According to psychotherapist Ross Rosenberg, those with a healthy early childhood felt secure in their world and are thus more comfortable opening up to other people. On the contrary, children without that experience develop coping techniques – the ability to self-soothe – and find comfort in being alone instead. Moreover, it has become increasingly difficult to find space to be alone. Most of the time, the sight of a solitary figure is impetus enough to go up and offer a hand, or a listening ear. In the vein of doing unto others what we want them to do unto us, seeing a person alone and extending a conversation is more than offering mere pleasantry, it is offering rescue.
That being said, it is important to differentiate loneliness from being alone. The former is a feeling of isolation that results from loss, separation or unreciprocated affection. Aloneness on the other hand, is finding freedom in that same isolation, a joy found in being unapologetically yourself. To me, spending time alone is not more than a defense mechanism, but a healthy habit that that I consciously try to cultivate.
Being alone gives our brain a break.  Letting our brain switch off after a long stretch of being “onz” frees us from distractions, and gives ourselves the chance to clear our minds and focus on the task at hand. Completing your math Vectors tutorial or doing up Ionic Equilibria notes gets done a lot faster without having to be conscious of the person beside us. After all, there is simply no need to have company when doing work. Solitude and silence should be a precious thing especially in the cacophony of this world – not something we fashion our lives trying to evade, but something to embrace.
Being alone helps us get in tune with ourselves. The fact that I defined myself by the relationships I had used to be something I struggled with- how competent was I as a daughter, as a student, as a friend? I saw myself as only the roles I played in other people’s lives, and how big a part I played in them, measuring my importance in how much they acknowledged and needed me. By taking time out to be with myself, I learned to recognise other qualities in myself that didn’t come up in the company of others and acknowledge the accomplishments that I had achieved on my own.
It also gives us the freedom to do the things we really want to do. Researchers Christopher Long and James Averill characterise solitude as “a state characterized by disengagement from the immediate demands of other people – a state of reduced social inhibition and increased freedom to select one’s mental and physical activities”. Truth be told, taking other people’s opinions into consideration or making compromises to cater to the whole group can be taxing on our emotional and cognitive resources. Taking time to be alone frees up the mental capacity to listen to our own long-term needs, finding satisfaction in simply doing what we know we want to do.
Being alone helps us practise mindfulness. Perhaps some of us might remember the assembly talk by Mr Chan earlier this year about the importance of being alone. What made the greatest impression on me was one key idea, that we should “spend time with yourself, not spend time by yourself”. It is not about cutting yourself off from the world, but carving your own little space in it. Making a choice to be alone is deliberately allowing yourself to step back and take stock of your current thoughts, emotions and surroundings. Many of our decisions come about unconsciously, so being able to pay full attention to what we are thinking and examine just what sets off this thought process and why, enables us to gain a greater consciousness of the way we do things, and how it can be improved on. As we mature into self-aware and well-rounded individuals, it is imperative that we take time to reflect about our own personal growth, if not for our own personal development, then perhaps for our future university admissions. And what better way to do that than in our very own quiet space?
After all, we mustn’t forget the second part of Aristotle’s quote: “…an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human.” Maybe, just maybe, by taking more time to be alone, we can transcend the part of ourselves that make us mere humans, and transform into a truly enlightened version of ourselves – and wouldn’t that be a miracle in itself?

Modern-day education:

Instead of developing the student’s own faculties of discernment, and teaching it to judge and think for itself, the professor uses all his/her energies to stuff its head full of the ready-made thoughts of other people.

To  I will get straight to the point. I think what you wrote is quite frankly, rather insulting. Statements like "foreign girls being more easy" and "if you have no game, then maybe foreign girls are best"?? First off, there is a big difference between being open to knowing other people, giving chances and being easy. Please don't jump the gun. A lot of foreign girls are NOT as easy as you have claimed. Easy meaning what? Easy to bed? I know a larger percentage of foreign girls who are virgins as compared to local girls in all honesty. 

Second, what do you mean by having game? Pretending to be someone you're not? Splurging on senseless clubbing, birthday parties? What is it exactly? You make it sound like getting a Singaporean girl is the "ultimate prize". In what way, exactly? To brag and show off to your buddies? Yes, being around a foreign girl, especially those from developing countries might not confer on you additional social cred amongst your peers but if you think attaching yourself to some local girl simply because she is local and presumably educated/smart is going to lead to a happy marriage, I disagree. The rising divorce statistics seem to support me on this. 

Lastly, you seem to think that anyone who doesn't date a local girl has NO game. Huh, really? Maybe, it's the other way around, and many are simply fed up with the entitlement attitude that many local females have? Or the fact that we see no point in wasting time, energy and money on girls who will NOT stick with you when you're down. This is going to offend Singaporean girls but by and large, they are less loyal and more selfish than foreign girls. Most relationships are one directional. I would give the breakdown as such - 70% favor the girls, meaning guys give way more. 20% is about equal, and maybe 10% favor the guys. I know of male friends dating blogshop models.. Yes, they go out with a pretty face but they have to do and give SO much.. I quite frankly don't envy them, especially when they have personally told me how messed up and hypocritical their girlfriends are.

To  hey bro, I've been following your thread for awhile. Just wanna say that I've done a few exchanges in other ASEAN places as well and managed to date quite a few of these other asian girls (i.e. taiwanese, hong kong, korean, vietnamese, thai) easily. I can testify to your words that they're damn easy to get, and some of these girls can be really pretty and easy-going. 

I might sound very non-PC but here goes: the double-edged sword about easily getting these foreign girls is that they don't tend to be from well-off families, so that already lowers their standards for guys by quite a bit. As a Singaporean guy who can go there on exchange, you can easily win over those guys from their hometown. While these girls from other cultures are a different experience, most of the time they just value a sense of security and are not in it for anything heavily emotional or intense. They're typically quite submissive if that's what you're looking for, so they're best for guys who don't really have the game to chase. The rich girls there won't go for poorer blokes usually.

At the end of the day I still think Singaporean girls are the best fit for me. After looking around so, so much, I want someone more challenging and capable yet complementary and similar enough to keep things fresh and exciting, rather than an easy and submissive girl. If that's what you prefer, no worries man. Everyone wants different things. Not to say that these other asian girls aren't capable of being good life partners, but Singaporeans have grown up in the same kind of culture and environment, so it's much easier to communicate misgivings, thoughts and connect better. 

Language can be quite a barrier especially with other asian girls if you don't have the same level of competency in each other's mother tongue, and it's hard to reach a level of sophisticated conversation if you're struggling to express yourself. Culture-wise, some of these girls just cannot survive the competitiveness in Singapore, so some kind of compromise has to be reached on living arrangements if you plan to be together long term. If you just wanna date around that's cool, but I know for me I want to eventually marry a girl from my home country. 

You can say all you want about local girls being ridiculous, hard to get (which can be very true), no manners, don't pick tissues up in the car etc, but having experienced both sides I can safely say that if you up your game and become a damn stellar catch, you're more likely to get a high quality Singaporean girl you're happy with.

good luck

Based on a sample size of 10 girls, basically almost all the girls i have known in my life. yes, i am a guy. What i have observed is they may have like an entitlement attitude and less loyal and more selfish. But they are not really at fault in this. It may be because of competitive nature in Singapore. Also sometimes it is also due to mood swings. Foreign girls and local girls are brought up differently, so it is hard to compare also. Like i have said its a small sample size, so it may be inaccurate.

About Singaporean females and expectations. At least for me I don't want gifts or flowers or parties or expensive meals. I want someone who likes me, shares the same core values and some interests as me, our personalities match, can accept me even with my weaknesses (and I can do the same for him), and is willing to commit to making a long-term r/s work and to helping each other become better people. Doesn't have to be buff or super hot etc, but at least be presentable. No need to be rich at all. 

Maybe it's because I'm in my mid-twenties, but I am not interested in fairy tale princess dating kind of life, because that's so not real. You know what's real? Bills. Work demands. Stress. The monotony of life after the romance wears off. Caring for older family members. Office politics. Aging. Housework. Grocery shopping. Cleaning toilets. These are coming your way real soon, young people. (Unless you are filthy rich)

I just want someone who can be a companion through all the life challenges coming up, who likes me enough to stick by me. Someone I can sit down with and discuss how we should manage our money, how many kids we should have. Someone willing to cover housework and make dinner when I have to work overtime, and I do the same when he works overtime. Someone who can argue rationally and talk things out with me when we disagree over something, and not turn it into a personal attack. I don't mind living in a tiny flat, no car. I don't mind doing housework. I don't mind giving him a back massage after he comes home from work and talks about his problems throughout dinner. But I still can't find someone like that. Am I asking too much?

Do you have that one Facebook friend that has to post a lengthy opinion as to why people shouldn't be liking/sharing certain posts on Facebook, just cause it doesn't fit with their ideas?  I mean yes, they do make sense. But it's Facebook? Must you really comment on what people should or should not be doing on it? It's not like I'm sharing something derogatory or hateful. 

Facebook is a platform used for various purposes. I'm sure you are smart enough to know that by now (or do you?). For me it's mainly a source of entertainment and for you it's a platform used to share your thoughts. Liking a bunch of entertaining videos does not make me immature and dumb. Likewise, commenting on what people should or should not be sharing/liking does not make you appear smarter. It just makes you appear critical. 

Me liking something interesting or entertaining does not and should not create an opportunity for you to judge me. If it does, then it says a lot about you, not me. Must everything be criticized?!?!  I mean isn't it easier to click the unfollow or unfriend button than to share a long winded post? Or would that mean missing a great opportunity to judge someone and show how intellectual you are. Wow. Quit being judgemental guys. It ain't attractive. 
-
 
With regards to , what if I wouldn't date someone from my own race, simply because I don't think it'll work out in the long term? I would naturally gravitate towards those from my own race/culture as practically speaking, they would have more similar upbringing and possibly fewer obstacles to a future relationship etc. such as familial objections and issues with religion. Would that be considered racist?

My responses to people posting on NUSWhispers:

. Privileged people who don't understand how privilege works and think they've gotten successfully because of their own hardwork and effort. Terrible leh. I hope you guys realise how mortal you are and weight of the bag pack of privilege you're carrying.

. Sexists and racists who have no idea they're bigots. Look, it's rare that prejudices are realised by the people having them. E.g. dude, having preference for people with lighter skin is fine. But if you met a dark-skinned person who is amazing in every aspect and you feel a deep, romantic connection, would you still be with him/her? If no, you're racist. You can stop lying to yourself and the world now. If yes, congrats! You're a decent human being. 

Also bro, calling a male the term "pussy" intended as an insult is hella sexist. 

. Really, really superficial people. Eh halo, you must be very attractive and kudos to you if you think so. But do realise, that looks should not be the basis of your affection for someone. It shouldn't be the primary screening of whether a person is suitable for you. It really speaks about you as a person. If what you value is your image more than what an actual person makes you feel then my condolences: you will always find life to be bland and insufficient. 

. People who use language proficiency as power play. Eh come on lah, knowing the differences and nuances between certain words doesn't make you better than the person you're arguing with. In fact, argue that you're not an asshole, only a frustrated human who needs some love and comfort. I am with you, friend. Stop arguing with people you don't know on the Internet.

Girls, which characteristic do you look for in a guy before wanting to date with him? Looks? Talents? Physique? Humour? Artistic? Charisma? Sociability?

To the OP of # 17838.

I totally feel you dude. I'm Caucasian and I've been in Singapore for two years now. I can't appreciate Oriental features to be honest. I received quite a bit of flak from my friends too. But hey does that make me a racist? Of course not! It's not like I'm going to avoid befriending someone with Oriental features. It's just something I don't find attractive. Same thing with your preference for light skinned individuals. Its a preference just like height weight etc. Having a preference is not discrimination. Ignore your friends dude. Not everything has to become racial. Peace! 
-
 
 Dear OP, I get that it was a htht session, but I guess sometimes it's best to keep such opinions to ourselves? Your friends weren't coming from a bad place in my opinion. After all,  skin colour is a pretty sensitive topic. Far more different than picking an ice cream flavour. Plus stating that you 'don't appreciate' darker skin tones sounds pretty harsh. You have every right to determine the physical preferences your partner should possess. I mean beauty is subjective right? But in a time where fair skinned people are still deemed 'more beautiful' than dark skinned individuals (even in dark skinned countries) your comment does sound unfavourable, however way you look at it. 
-
 
The other day I casually mentioned in a htht session that I didn't appreciate darker skintones in my personal tastes (physically) for a partner. I almost immediately had accusations of racism thrown at me even though previously I had mentioned that physical appearances were secondary to actual mental/emotional/personality compatibility with a potential partner, and they refused to listen to me explain that I don't exclude or refuse to befriend people of other races.

Since when did stating physical preferences = discrimination? Physical preferences aren't equal to thinking that all fat people or dark skinned people are subhuman and/or evil, it's just simply a preference like how some people prefer certain ice cream flavours over other.

Sigh. This PC culture is really going way overboard...

Gosh away from this page for a few days and it has degenerated to this state.

Some words of advice from a casual reader of NUSWhispers:
1. Some commenters ought to to know when to draw the line. Take your feuds elsewhere, please.
2. Language! Is it really that difficult to maintain some decency and civility in the choice of vocabulary? This page deserves better, really.
3. Otherwise, the silent majority would prefer some tranquility - we rather be entertained by some heart-fluttering confession, or serious intellectual debates revolving around issues with wider implications to the community, thank you.

P.S. I will really kill for some troll posts. Beats what we have now.

Personally, I feel that the emissions of a car needs to factor in the energy and pollution it causes during the manufacturing process, as well as the grid needed to power it. 

It doesn't matter if your car runs off batteries and doesn't produce any emissions but your country is burning dirty fuel to power your grid. Then a modern Diesel engine is a much better option that the spanky new EV car. 

There is a big difference between emissions required to build the EV as compared to a gasoline car. Lithium batteries are very polluting to manufacture and harm the environment greatly. 

Emissions should consider the entire chain of production, not just the end part of the chain, since the aim is to reduce overall emissions and "save the planet". 

It's damn cock and hypocritical to ask for lower emissions taxes when the net emissions are higher when you look at the entire chain. 

Singaporeans only know how to complain. 

Well done LTA. I support your stance. Tesla is a hypocritical company. I hope this opens up a can of worms for them. Everyone thinks they are oh so environmentally friendly, when it actual fact they really aren't.

People here need to learn how to detect commenters in a Triggered state.

1. Typing >=50 lines in a single post without paragraphing
2. Replying to the same post >3 times within 10 minutes
3. Takes no prisoners - surrendering is insufficient atonement
4. Wields very large Lame, Abhorrent, Maddened, Pugnacious Ad Hominems (LAMPAH)
5. Demands to meet you IRL (e.g. Tiong Bahru Plaza 7pm)

Stay safe, look down and keep walking, and God bless you if you decide to wield your own LAMPAH against his.

I love my family, but my family over-protects me and I can't think straight. I'm set back because I cannot thrive in a competitive environment like NUS and it's so unfair that other children learnt to be independent and tough when they were younger while I never did, and suddenly I'm thrust into adulthood with a scholarship I don't want and can't live up to :(

Just to add on to my previous points someone defending the OP. To the particular guy who expressed extremely strong views against the OP: No I do no think that the OP is publicly shaming the professor. I think the OP is just venting his frustration. And isnt whispers a platform for ppl to vent their frustrations? Your argument is that the professor is nearing 60 years old and hence should be pitied upon. I'm not sure what module you are referring to. But does being 60 mean that he is old and fragile? What sort of lame argument do you put forth that oh just because he is 60 means that you should not complain about him. And many ppl in their 60s are in the pink of health too wtf. Yes, as a student ofc we should respect him but we also need to voice our complains if we are not satisfied with the quality of education right.  And the case you brought up abt the 'student bullying the prof'. Yes, ofc it is wrong of students not to respect the prof as a person but surely they do need to earn our respect by at least putting in the effort to give us a decent lecture?  And you told the OP to quit stats? Sorry i dont buy your argument. SO you expect stats major to just sit thru shitty lectures and waste our money learning nth? wtf..To the commenter, I find your views rather polarized. And im sorry if i came across as vulgar, but I just cannot buy your argument and how you slam the OP.  TO the commenter, what right does it give you to criticise OP writing as well. Sure you write beautifully, but the OP and I dont have the time to put forth a beautifully written prose about our frustration. And while I apologize that this is a personal attack on the commenter, I felt that the commenter was being to harsh and insulting the OP at a personal level. As someone whose views resonates strongly with the OP, of course im defending him/her la, even though i have no clue who the OP is. And yes, Im biased towards the OP bcos im currently taking one hellavu stats mod where im practically teaching myself. To OP, just skip lecture and self-study though it's tedious and time consuming? No pt wasting time attending lectures.

I am the original poster of the China professors' accents. The other post with the 'bad English' was by someone else, not me. To that particular commentator who is very personally affected by it I just want to to clarify that I'm not even a stats student. I was referring to a class I had which included some statistics (I said 'statistical modules', not 'statistics modules'). Since when was any prof "made to apologise"?  But looking at how you tell others to quit and denigrading them by calling 'pussy', you should think about how that reflects badly upon yourself. I won't be meeting you tmr cos I don't even attend that class, but everyone there would know how you reacted so strongly over nothing.

To the stats year 4 Commenter:
I concede to your arguments that as students, we should definitely try our best to learn from a module regardless of the teaching quality. And I agree that we should highlight it with the prof/department if we feel that they can improve on their teaching. Nevertheless, we do have the right as students to expect decent teaching standards. Ps. I'm taking neither survey meth nor the mod you mentioned in NAK. Perhaps you could try taking a particular biostatistics mod that I'm taking?:) And I can't believe that you would stoop so low to use the f-bomb on the confessors, insult us personally by saying that we do not deserve the spot in university and calling us pussies. (BTW I'm a girl so it would be extremely degradatory if you call me a pussy haha.) As for hiding behind the veil of anonymity, I would not like my fb profile on NUS whispers and subject myself to being stalked(more frequently) since my name would be all over whispers-just a personal preference la. Unfortunately, I'm too lazy to pm or look for you. Because I doubt you would be capable of a debate without lapsing into insults. There is definitely some validity in your points if you do not lapse into a personal attack though:) 
-Sincerely,
A Stats Junior
P.s It has been interesting reading the arguments put forth both the other 2/3? confessors and the 2 stats commenters, albeit one being much more vocal than the other

I'm the OP for  . So apparently there are 3-4 people posting on this topic now lol . 
You commented that my English is bad so u try to use big words to impress me ? " veil of cowardice " walan eh u think u Shakespeare si bo . Fyi there are tons of foreign prof in the uni in every faculty . There's noone trying to launch a personal attack on your dear beloved old Prof . And no I'm not stats student . Funny how someone can be smart enough to do well enough for A level to get into uni but can have such a low eq . Low iq also for stating redundant facts without understanding the post . But before i contine let's see what u wan to comment here first . I actually wan to see to what extend your stupidity is XD

Singapore is ranked NUMBER ONE again, 3 times in a row! For being the MOST expensive city to live in. It is not so much the cost of NORMAL living that is SO expensive, but because GOVERNMENT added SO many things to make the price SO high.

COE, ERP, GST! Cost of houses so high, even after our property market contracted for the past 2 years, STILL so expensive! Squeezing more money from our middle- and low-income family but not heavily taxing the upper-income family! We are being squeezed to death already and the wealthy + government people all live such good lives!

Context: http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35765378

I think we all need to reflect for the next 4 years!

There is nothing wrong with what the previous op said even thought he might have worded it harshly. This is Singapore and our working language is english. If some china professor talks in a hard to understand Chinese accent, that is unacceptable. But the fault is not entirely his, but mostly the university's.

Haiz I am losing faith in Singapore. 

A mother lost her son and she is charged to pay for the legal fees. 

A man imported a green zero-emissions car and is taxed for his good intentions to the society. 

So much extra money to pay when we are already the most expensive city in the world... 

Is it better to migrate?

 OP of you know which one lah

Firstly you are the one who started calling the offences I brought up as being petty. No one argued on whether they violated TSR either. I'm just not going to bother arguing with you because you're clearly too far gone. It's morally wrong to mess with smoke grenades now? What happened to morality is independent of rules? Your set of rules with the  omniscience of hindsight?

I said your arguments were straw dummy ones because they are so bad I would literally make them up just to tear them down to make my point seem stronger.

Ah well we seem to have bored the crowd, so let's move on to more exciting stuff like our frisbee trowing free-for-all sex-athon

Responding to  and 

Rules are broken, that is the fact. If one does not like those rules set, he/she should seek to repeal it and not to take the easy way out by not abiding it. 

How is 'throwing 3 times the number of smoke grenades' something trivial? A smoke grenade is still a grenade when being categorised. How is this non-morally wrong when one is seen to be messing with grenades? 

I did not suggest that anyone who violated the TSR is right. And drawing your examples from the movie, together with your own assumptions is a real shock for me. Non-petty offences are those that could jeopardise one' career, or worse still, take away the lives of others. What is your definition of petty? Please enlighten the crowd. 

There is no need to describe my 'arguments' being 'straw dummy' ones. However, who knows? Probably you have assumed right from the start that I am not right at all. 

Like I said, I am not going to dispute the judgement handled down by the courts. I am just going to stick to the view that they have violated the TSR.

To the China professors who can't get their accent and grammar right- why can't you just prepare a script and read off it if you really cannot cope with real time speaking? No one will blame you for it; they will be grateful because grammar connotes cause and effect, plural and singular which are important concepts especially in Statistical modules. This is compounded by the accent that already obscures a large part of the sentences. 

It is very rude to have no consideration for your audience when you speak so atrociously. If you can't cope, use a script.

disclaimer: i didnt write the original post.

you win liao lor, so following tsr = morally righteous? dude, you gonna blindly follow every rule ah. As an exaggerated example, your clique is secretly gangster and they tell you molest girl for initiation, it's their rule. are you gonna do it? it's the rule leh. where's your moral righteousness?

rules are flexible and we are but human. if you keep doing X and nothing wrong happens, what's stopping you from doing it again? you think the world is black and white? please remove your monochrome filter, this is not instagram leh

OP of  in response to 
How does it feel up there on your moral high ground? Is the rarefied air there any better? Ready to come down and share more of your wisdom? Cheap shot for cheap shot wew.

Clearly I don't have evidence that everyone in the SAF has violated the TSR, but my assumption is that most people have, at least in my experience(even you seem to assume so but qualify them into petty and non-petty offences).

How do you qualify these offences as petty? People have died or been severely injured from heat injury due to insufficient hydration(didn't you watch Ah Boys to Men? :O). Not bashing in 10m when theres an armor vehicle on the road? Wait til there's a case of someone being crushed by a 60-ton Leopard tank reversing into the bush then tell me (no sorry tell that to the parent of the guy) that's a petty offence again. 

My point is this: prior to the incident, throwing 3 times the number of smoke grenades was seen as these offences you yourself deemed petty. No-harm, non-morally wrong offences. Like you said, being morally right has nothing to do with whether there are rules or not.

I literally couldn't have crafted a better straw dummy argument than you did lol.

 Also one last thing before I go back to lurking behind the screens. Did I mention anything about my gender? Why does everyone assume I'm a guy? Girl cant earn that much money ah?

My simple method of enjoying life without much crippling depression.

You see, your body need dopamine to get some enjoymeny out of life. The two most natural ways are food and sex. The first one, too much if it causes obesity. The second, if you pay for it, the dopamine release is usually accompanied by massive injection of guilt and worthlessness, especially when that's the only way you can get your jollies off. Unless you are so dead inside that you can just "fuck, pay, and go", basically treating protitutes as subhuman cum dumpster. Otherwise people get into a relationship, a friends with benefita, or a marriage (last one not guaranteed) as more reputable ways to have it. People say doing the fwb is gross, why not just pay a pros. No, it isn't. Do you know how hard it is to seduce someone to get them to attracted to you purely physically? Yes, very hard.

Otherwise, another way is to accomplish something. This, is hard. If you measure your accomplishment comparing to others. There will always be someone who is smarter than you, richer than you, or better than you. Wallowing in self pity and depression decreases your chance of food, sex, or success. Furthermore, if you measure success at work or school, it comes very slow.

Instead, make yourself do something manually, with results you can see. Construction builders don't get as depressed as office workers. Definitely way more shootings at office and schools than building sites. You know why? Because a builder see his work right in front of him. Later in life, he can drive (or walk) past a building and can proudly say to himself: yes, I built that thing.

So do something. Create a small garden and care for the plants. Learn about coffee and find the way to create a perfect drink. Learn how to cook and cook a meal. Build something, small to start. Woodwork, crafting. Read esoteric stuffs that may be you will enjoy only. Watch movies but look deeper into it. Things like that.

looking at all these posts on investing and wondering how come I turned out so differently.

maybe it's my family background? not too well-to-do. maybe it's my life choices? here I am digging my nose with my leg propped up on a chair while I tab out of my game to type this confession. hais

 in a nutshell: nobody does the right thing, therefore non-adherence must be the right thing.

Borrowing the reserves of the newfound element Hb (Hyperbole) discovered in your post, I exhort the authorities to remove stop lines. Face it, only P-plate drivers stop at stop lines.

I also welcome the public to borrow this indomitable element for use in their daily lives.

Oh, I didn't know that our smoke grenades are so high-tech that they do not detonate if no living human is in range. All my CSGO training is wasted.

Because many of the things I'm about to say regarding NUSWhispers have already been beaten into the ground, I will try to keep this letter short. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that once one begins thinking about free speech, about testy buffoons who use ostracism and public opinion to prevent the airing of views contrary to their own invidious beliefs, one realizes that I wonder what would happen if NUSWhispers really did make it nearly impossible to disturb its abusive, pretentious gravy train. There's a spooky thought. While NUSWhispers has been beating the drums of radicalism, I've been trying to oppose our human vices wherever they may be found—arrogance, hatred, jealousy, unfaithfulness, avarice, and so on. In doing so, I've learned that it alleges that mediocrity is a worthwhile goal. What planet is it from? The planet Obnoxious? The most appealing theory has to do with the way that NUSWhispers is a gin-swilling rantipole. I'm being super-extra nice when I say that. If I weren't so polite I instead would have stated that by supporting misinformed, prudish paranoiacs with inferior moral standards, we devalue ourselves, the lives of our children, and the heroes who died for our freedoms. It may be more correct, however, to say that it and its fans are a cancer on our society. They will therefore do what cancer always does: kill the host. What's noteworthy about that observation is that NUSWhispers refuses to come to terms with reality. It prefers instead to live in a fantasy world of rationalization and hallucination.

NUSWhispers looks down upon the rest of us. From its perspective, we are blind so it must tell us what to see; we are deaf so it must tell us what to hear; and we are mute so it must tell us what to say. Such views may fool the most gutless polemicists I've ever seen, but I insist that I want to say a few things about NUSWhispers's biggety imprecations. First, its imprecations place indecent Bolsheviks at the top of the social hierarchy. Second, they enslave us, suppress our freedom, regiment our lives, confiscate our property, and dictate our values. Third, they destabilize the already volatile social fabric that it purportedly aims to save. I could list a few more things, but you get the picture. The important part is that I recently overheard a couple of maladroit casuists say that undiscoverable, unmeasurable, magical forces from another plane of existence have given NUSWhispers superhuman wisdom. Here, again, we encounter the blurred thinking that is characteristic of this NUSWhispers-induced era of slogans and propaganda.

When I first heard that there exists a crazy, grotty devotee of conspiracy theories who has been mollycoddling pudibund, nasty nitwits, I was completely bumfuzzled. Who could be so haughty, so deficient in human grace, as to do such a thing? After learning that NUSWhispers was the inerudite stuffed shirt in question, I realized that NUSWhispers will promote, foster, and institute negativism in the immediate years ahead. Alas, this is not a tinfoil-hat conspiracy theory. It is cold, hard fact. A related fact is that I plan to stand uncompromised in a world that's on the brink of NUSWhispers-induced disaster. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that if you think that NUSWhispers can achieve its goals by friendly and moral conduct then you're suffering from very serious nearsightedness. You're focusing too much on what NUSWhispers wants you to see and failing to observe many other things of much greater importance such as that the purpose of this letter is far greater than to prove to you how brusque and feckless it has become. The purpose of this letter is to get you to start thinking for yourself, to start thinking about how it once said that space aliens are out to lay eggs in our innards or ooze their alien hell-slime all over us. Its coadjutors tried hard to blame that polyloquent quote on me. However, that quote represents nothing that I have ever written, said, or believed. I contend, therefore, that most people pretty quickly figured out that if society were a beer bottle—something, I believe, that NUSWhispers holds in high regard—it would indeed be the nauseating bit at the bottom that only the homeless like to drink. Lastly, I can't end this letter without mentioning that most people's overall impression is that it would be more productive for NUSWhispers to take a more diplomatic and conciliatory approach.

P.S. I am willing to discuss my opinion and may be contacted at: http://www.pakin.org/complaint/

To  
1. I wasn't saying that most guys creepy and gross. This was the opinion of a random commentator. I was trying to say that that wasn't even my concern, whether it is true or false. 

2. I agree that dependency to a certain extent is natural. I was referring to being overly emotionally reliant. I don't think that is healthy or 'natural', and I find it hard to extricate myself from almost relationships easily. Thus I try to guard against being emotionally dependent on another person, but I don't know how to change how I feel. Being easily dependent and being 'so quick to share [my] world' with another are not synonymous. The latter can be controlled, the former not as easily so. 

3. While I agree that introversion is used far too often than necessary, I find your dismissal attitude towards introversion ignorant and bigoted.

 We have already downgauged from a big friendship to a small friendship. I think we need to call it quits because no one benefits; I don't see how your network benefits me when I already know your entire network through a higher-yielding friend. And I definitely don't see the value in you jumping on my network and leeching my friends. There is little high-value transaction and hence I unfriended you.
-
 
 If and only if you find them to be persuasive? I'm not sure what you mean by "let yourself," but if you're implying that one abandons his rationality in favour of the viewpoints of others, that's a very dangerous proposition, especially if you come to know men.

 Read the post after you,  and chuck your phone into the nearest recycling bin for electronics. Just kidding.. The only way to change yourself or anything about your lifestyle is to develop habits and you definitely want healthy habits.

1. You need to start telling yourself that you're not stupid or obsessive. Everyone has so called "issues" or basically parts they don't like about themselves. Your psych affects you in many more ways than you think. There are probably people who develop the habit of going to the mirror daily once awake and say to themselves, "I'm amazing."
2. I'm not sure in the long run, but in the short run, you definitely can't manage it. You need to use texts only for short conversations, i.e. arrange meet up, get quick information. Given how much of a huge role your phone plays in your life, it's likely you'll lack self-control for the habit formation or following or just not looking at your phone. You may need to just leave your phone at home, or turn the services off in a way that's hard to reactivate, or the like (these are habits too).
3. For the needy and emotionally attached easily part, it's unlikely the NUSWhispers community can help you. Understand yourself better through some good online psychology articles? Also, it might help to get some long-term/observant friends to point out some other noticeable traits to you. There might be more that has gone past your attention. Just saying. Habits wise, you can try the online ones as well.
4. For how to get over someone part, again, I would think online articles for what habits to develop? It probably involves some happiness and lifting of moods. You can try taking a 10 min walk around your neighbourhood every morning for fresh air, get a plant on your table or the like? Yoga? Breathing exercises?

Basically the process is simple. For the most part, you have already identified the problem and what you want to change (keep at the reflections). It's just figuring out how to affect that change. Online suggestions of what habits to form and maintain are just starters and each individual is different. You can also come up with your own habits and experiment with them. If I told anyone my habits, they will go O_O. Even lacking self-control for all these habit formation or following can be a problem in itself and you can think of and develop habits to correct that.

  Not sure if you will come to agree with me, but here are my thoughts. Imagine the following scenario. X is in a relationship with Y and has found out that he has a serious health issue. Is it right for X to hide it from Y and break off with Y through say, an intentional quarrel or without giving any reason? To say that that's love or something like that? I believe each party is an equal in a relationship, and if you agree with me, respect your other half as that. Be honest and talk it out with her. Give her her right to make her own decisions, and not deprive her of that. From here on, it's plain simple. If you two agree to continue or try to work things out, continue. If either one of you doesn't want to continue or try to work things out, respect that and stop the relationship.

You might think that if you don't want to further the relationship anyway, it doesn't really matter if you tell her or not. Or that it's best that she doesn't know the real reason. But that's not right if you are with me in that each party is an equal in the relationship.

Saw this on the fb page called The Chindian Diaries. Thought I'd share.

"To a young Tamil Singaporean woman like me, the concept of racism is nothing new or inconceivable. Nonetheless, it wasn’t until I started going out with my fiancé, who happens to be Caucasian, that I began to see a new side to racial discrimination in Singapore.
The surprised looks by strangers were one thing, but the harsh comments made to me by fellow Indians, especially men, implying that I had somehow betrayed Indian men as a collective, came as quite a shock to me. I have been trying to grapple with this response and believe it all boils down, as do most issues, to racism and sexism.
Now I always knew that Singaporeans have particular dating preferences, as do people all over the world. I was acutely aware of this growing up, when I was mocked by some of my peers for having dark skin and curly hair. I wanted to sink into the floor when my teacher in Secondary School declared that she, a Chinese woman, would never date an Indian man.
So you can imagine my genuine surprise when I flew to Europe for a university exchange programme and started to be on the receiving end of a fair amount of male attention. More importantly, while I personally believe that a woman’s worth shouldn’t be connected to the number of guys who fantasize about her at night, this sudden change in how I was perceived by others spoke volumes to me about racial preferences and standards of beauty in Singapore. The dark skin and curly hair that I was ridiculed for in Singapore were admired and complimented for the first time in my life.
I did wonder if I was being exoticised by some European guys, but the fact that I had to even question why anyone would find me attractive reflected a bruised self-esteem that growing up as an Indian girl in Singapore had dealt me.
Before I say that minority women, especially those with darker skin tones, are generally considered to be less desirable in Singapore, I must admit that I personally know many dark-skinned Indian girls who are dating Chinese, Malay, Eurasian or Caucasian guys here.
But the statistics suggest that I may quite possibly know all of them. 48.4% of inter-ethnic marriages that took place in Singapore in 2014 were between Chinese grooms and brides of the “Others”[1] ethnic group. Another 12.7% took place between Caucasian grooms and Chinese brides. Indian grooms and Chinese brides rounded up the top 5 ethnic group combinations at 5.2%[2].
I have also heard Chinese Singaporeans state unequivocally that they would never date Indians. Furthermore, conventionally Chinese or East Asian features are constantly lauded as the ideal standards of beauty in Singapore. Numerous advertisements and the recent Cosmopolitan Singapore controversy are testaments to this.
Perhaps this is why so many people do a double take when they see my fiancé and me out together. Would seeing a Caucasian man and a Chinese woman together elicit the same reaction?
Strangely, the most disapproving looks I have received are from fellow Indians. Some of my male Indian friends have remarked to me that my decision to date a Caucasian man, presumably before other Indian men, speaks to a broader pre-occupation with the white male ideal. These friends have even implied that it is insincere of me to be critical of heterosexual white male privilege and date a white man at the same time.

This begs the question: why is dating within one’s own ethnicity and socio-economic class considered the norm? Moreover, why does it appear incongruous when a white man and an ethnic minority woman are seen together? What sorts of power structures and hierarchies does this pairing upset?
The answer is not as simple as saying that people prefer to stick to their own ethnic groups, where they can find partners with whom they have a greater cultural affinity. Even evolutionary biology would disagree with this explanation, as interracial relationships are biologically advantageous.
Instead, I believe this is the result of what Elizabeth Spelman called “the ampersand problem.” I am caught within a blend of both patriarchal AND racist structures when I am criticized for my choice in partner.
Here is why: If race was brought out of the equation and I dated an Indian man, it would be considered “appropriate.” However, when I go out with a white man, I am accused of disingenuity and betraying other Indian men who I should have dated instead.
If it was not race, but gender that was the issue and I was an Indian man with a white woman, would I be criticized of the same? My guess is that I would be getting a few congratulatory thumps on the back instead.
When Indian women, who are generally considered to be less desirable in Singapore for aforementioned reasons, date white men, this upsets the racial hierarchy in Singapore which places slim, porcelain-skinned Chinese women at the top of the totem pole and dusky Indian women at the bottom. It upsets gender roles that seemingly entitle men to women of the same ethnic group.

Looking for some advice. He currently does not have dogs but he loves dogs. He would like to have a dog in the next couple of years. I have a fear of dogs and would literally go out of the way just to avoid dogs. I am so averse towards dogs that I would rather lose my career and wealth than live with a dog. How can we make this relationship work?

Live life to the fullest. Do what you want. Well, you can do anything you want, but not everything is beneficial. You just gotta learn to live responsibly. YOLO is a thing, you only do live once. But if you live stupidly, you'll just end up being a really sad person.

I would like to summarize my overall experience of nuswhispers. On normal days, there would be facepalm worthy posts of people seeking for advice when they already know the answer or people who proved that cancer is contagious through bad grammar etc etc. Well, what I really enjoy is not the stupidity of the posts, but the wittiness of the comments which come after. I mean how do you even be so witty that my thumb clicks on that 'like' button without a second thought. I am actually impressed how nuswhispers actually became a contest of wit where rewards come in the form of 'like's. Anyway, keep the weed level up, I shall continue looking out for those comments to 'like'. Cheers!

Why so many sad posts?!?!?

 Emotions are more powerful in driving our actions than Reason. It's mostly fear that stops us from doing something rather than 'pros & cons' analysis. We hide our emotions behind rationality by giving some 'reasons' why we don't do something. Emotion is primitive and is the source of creativity and our sorrows. It is also why Love can be so painful yet exhilarating. I suggest you read Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther.

It appears that someone is pretending to be me online. I do not see a need to draw a bigger target on my back than what it is now. It is quite clear to me that there is an imposter posing as me and/or my ex here on NUSWhispers because I just saw a recent whisper that was a word for word copy of something I wrote in private on my wall a long time ago. You can have your fun. I won't breathe life into all this malice.
-
 
To  Yes, I’ve been in your shoes before and the worse thing was some of the guys even ghosted me :( I know you can’t help thinking that something is wrong with you but trust me, it’s them and not you! If any one of them were genuinely interested in you, they would not let the convo die and won’t let you drift away.. So as long you’ve tried enough to keep them interested and to engage them, I think you’ve done your part :) Someone better (and one who will cherish you!) will come along~
-
 
 &  Drifting is very different from Ghosting? Regardless, they may happen for a variety of reasons I guess. Since no one has yet mentioned them, I'll just list some of the reasons I can come up with.

1 - Unforeseen circumstances like phone drops into the toilet bowl or phone gets stolen (yes, they do happen).
2 - Interest still there but not intending to further relationship for private reasons.
The most likely case for either gender however would be the following scenarios.
3 - Unclear of feelings.
4 - Lost interest.
5 - Lost interest and the other party did not pursue.
6 - Lost interest and interested in another party.

Blame in situations 1 & 2 is controversial and is dependent on specific details, but 3 - 6 are bad :/ I personally have been in these situations at different time periods (full story is more complex so don't fully judge me here) and owe an apology due to poor management. The good news is that there has been enough responsibility to not lead people on but the bad news is that accountability is lacking and the person took the easy way out. That shouldn't have been the case even if the other party did not pursue. Saying "not free" or giving other forms of excuse is also inappropriate although it might have been "nice." All these assume that accountability is required in the first place, but such conditions are hard to specify and only both parties in the relationship ought to know when the conditions are met, unless there has been a lot of assumption going on, which sadly wasn't my case. :/

 The bottom is not in sight, and will never be till you realise where's the exact problem. Learn how to fill the emptiness within yourself. Think of it as an opportunity to improve on yourself. You can NEVER go wrong with that.

Gains summarised:
1. Subjected less to the shifting circumstances (including people) which you can only have limited control over. Only by improving yourself can you be less vulnerable to shifting circumstances and gain more control over your life over the long run. Otherwise, you will just have to run and hide, hoping things won't get hard down the road which is simply foolish. It too means you will be less reliant on other people for support.
2. Have more control over the shifting circumstances you're in (including people) which you still have limited control over. Think about the people that you have and who are important to you at this point in time or who will be important to you in the future. Think about materialising the goals you once had and will have in the future.

P.S. If it's you whom I think you are, you can ALWAYS find me, and please do.

 Just to weigh in on the part where you talk about bringing up old issues from the past. You said don't but at the same time you recognise that if there are times when we have a very strong urge to do it, it's okay to do so in a tactful manner. I may have misconceived your point, so if that's the case, pardon me. Here's my take. I don't think it's only when we have a very strong urge to settle old scores, that we should bring them out. As in any relationship, whether with friends, family or our romantic partners, it's unhealthy to leave any thorns, whether big ones or not, and have them accumulate. To the extent that past experiences with the person leaves thorns, we should seek to remove them and do so as soon as possible before furthering the relationship. There are many ways to do this, so long as they're effective. Conversations can be tactful but only if so doing doesn't compromise the effectiveness. Otherwise, these thorns will show their presence in the relationship sooner or later, in one's attitude or whatsoever.

Does having thorns mean that the person who has them is bad in a way? It depends. Having thorns doesn't necessarily mean that the person has a small heart. It also depends on the how big the blow was in the past. In fact, people with bigger hearts tend to have much bigger thorns. They forgive and forget easily as compared to others and when their kindness has been repeatedly trampled upon causing them to reach their limit, thorns will appear, and when they do so, they will be big ones.

One last point to note would be that bringing up old issues from the past may be a form of defence mechanism, to ensure that the possibility of future hurt is minimal. You can't possibly blame that, especially so if you were the one whom caused the initial damage.

In lights of posts with doubts on the idea of FwBs and sex in general, I would like to share a *rather* unseen opinion and advice.

Having observed posts for a while now, the party of people who chose abstinence (nothing wrong with that) often bash, or rather, have a misconception of people who have casual sex being un-loving of their body and that their future spouses will mind them of their “tainted past”.

What if they just like/want to have sex?
I’m a female, and I love my orgasms, be it self-delivered or having received one. I see them as a form of self love. Orgasm, to me, is like a key that opens to a door of glitter puking rainbow unicorns with unlimited pizza slices (I prefer Hawaiian) and flowing rivers of chocolate. Sometimes they come with sushi. If you haven’t found the key, not enjoying sex or not having the need to explore yet, that’s alright. With the right set of mind and maybe the right person, it will cum. If you have the key, approach future foreign doors with caution. It’s really that simple! 

I love my body and mind enough to take good care of it’s needs in ways I, not my future husband, not the society, deem right. If one were to tell me that the man I will walk down the aisle to in the years to come will be disappointed with how I have taken care of myself all my adult years prior to meeting him, we probably wouldn’t even get past the initial dating stage. Wouldn’t you mind if your husband is the one having slept around then? I’d be curious more than anything, of his past sexcapades. As long as we have similar ethics and morality in regards to this, and he’s had a clean health record, I don’t see how it’s a problem. Full transparency is key.

I’ve seen posts from ladies considering using “it” to make the man stay, and men wanting to cheat on their lady because of their choice in abstinence from sex, it’s not gonna work out in the end. Sex is a two-way street after all. For the ladies, sex is not a treat and your man is not a dog.

As long as you or yours friends around whom are in a sexual relationship make precautions to not put anyone in harm both physically and mentally, they shouldn’t garner any form of judgement or reaction (such as gossiping about or isolating them from friendships purely due to this) in return for their sexual release, casual or not.

I’ll leave my own set of “rules” and precautions I make to keep myself in check and stories for another time if anyone’s still interested! 

Go get that big O y’all

“Bro, do you want to fetch me back to hall?”

Really? Do I WANT to fetch you back to hall? Is that a favour you’re asking of me, or a favour you’re offering me? The opportunity to fetch you back to hall, eh?

What’s up with people asking for help in a manner as though they’re the ones letting us help? Sure, I’m more than willing to help you out, but if you’re going to ask me like that, no, thanks, suddenly I don’t feel like helping you out anymore, and besides, it’s not just one or two rare instances where people “ask” for favours that way, it’s happening more and more every day.

“Hey, I can’t make it that day, but you guys can do it for me.”

Oh wow. We can? Are you sure it shouldn’t be, “but please do it for me, guys.”? Now you’re telling us that we CAN do something for you, instead of you asking us to help you. REALLY?

“Bro, do you want to collect the stuff for me?”

Why?? Why would I WANT to do that? Of course, I would LOVE to collect it for you, if only you’d ask properly. You don’t even need to say “please”, but, JUST.ASK.PROPERLY.
How do people confuse “can you” with “do you want to”?

“Bro, do you want to take out the trash?”

Thanks for offering me that opportunity man, but, how about no? I really can’t accept your kind offer.

To  I've been with my partner for about 5 months now, and I'm in somewhat the same situation as you. My parents know of him as a friend, but discourages very strongly about anything beyond platonic friendship between us. For most people you're looking at long term goals with your partner, and most of those goals will include family. Furthermore, I do believe marriage is not just between two partners, but a marriage between two families. It is ultimately your choice and you might argue that it is too early to start thinking about such things, but it'll be worse when you get too deep in the relationship and you know your parents won't ever approve. So either be prepared to fight your damnedest for it, or rethink it before you get more involved in it. Personally, I'm looking to introduce my partner in 1-2 months and I'm prepared to fight for him. But I must say fighting against your parents trying to convince them is incredibly tough, so do think about your choice!

I wish that ministers in Singapore would have their salary amount decided by the votes given by their citizens. So that for once they would learn to take their citizens seriously.
Appointing MPs who can't manage. Give speech like reading from dictionary non-stop like hat. Anyhow make decisions, then don't reply when citizens ask. "Sir can I ask why --" "I told liao u never listen" "Apparently my mouth can only open during election time unfortunately no more time for your questions now excuse me while i drive my Mercedes to istana to hae a cup of kopi peng.

Cause? Because they get paid regardless of how they teach. And also some of them are too old to try to go all tiko on young citizens. Bloody hell your age can tell them how you survive WW2 liao, still try to post selfies on fb.

Not going to pinpoint but I think most of the ministers has at least one of the traits mentioned. One of them fits all the descriptions above not going to mention any name - cough lee cough cough -

If you have a friend who decides to first come out to you, know that you probably mean a lot to them, for them to choose you over all other people to tell first. 

Even if their identity conflicts with your beliefs, try to hear them out and understand them. Rejecting them will probably harm them a lot more than you can imagine.

If my gf refused to satisfy my sexual desires. Why should I even listen to her problems? Love is all about sacrificing for each other. She sacrifice her body and I sacrifice my time. 

I won't pester her for sex nor blowjobs anymore. I would rather go for dirty massage services.

Do most Singaporean guys want to date Chinese as well? Or are you open to dating other race as well? I'm a foreigner and have a huge crush on a local guy friend. Were pretty close. But I don't know if he's open to dating other races as his ex is Chinese. I'm just curious, nothing racist.

Dear OP of ,

I can totally empathise with you. Undergraduate from a single-parent, only-child family here. I have a very strong sense of protection and responsibility towards my mother. I love her a lot and can never imagine us living separate lives from one another.

Yet, it gets tiring. 

There, I've said it. Unlike you, dear OP, I'm a wretched daughter who is sick of my one and only immediate family member, the one who brought me into this world. If there was ever a good reason for the Heavens to strike me with lightning and for my soul to burn in Hell, here it is. I've let the unspeakable pass my lips, and what's more, published it on the Interwebz for the world to witness, albeit anonymously. 

I've actually typed a long ass self-pitying, self-victimising, defeatist rant, but to be honest it's such an ugly side that even posting it anonymously still brings the burn of shame to my face. To summarise, I'm tired of my circumstances and I'm jealous of other's seemingly better, happier, more carefree lives. But the point of me writing this confession is not so much to rant, nor to seek advice on how to be rid of such unhealthy thoughts. I'm slowly beginning to shed this negative attitude and to see things in a better light. 

I'm here to seek some serious advice from the NUS community. 

My mum doesn't work, doesn't have an active social life, doesn't have many friends. She spends her days mostly alone at home surfing the Internet. Her degree of reliance on me (financial, social, day-to-day needs) is stressing me out. I worry for her and for the (her? our?) future. I want to take a breather and hope to see my mother engage in something purposeful, something that doesn't have to include me in the picture. In short, I want her to be more... self-reliant? As much as I love her, I recognise that I cannot be with her 24/7. I need to know that she will be fine without me. 

How can I encourage my mother to take the initiative to live a healthier, more fulfilling life, without being overly-dependent on me? She's in her early 50s.

Thanks in advance.

I'm quite shocked at the number of people having FwBs and they're like early twenties??? I'm probably the only unicorn who has a traditional mindset of waiting till after marriage and stay away from people who are attached. Plus, boyfriend and I are still virgins, and we are very faithful to each other. So we're the only unicorns in this world? Surprises me how the dating/social scene changes so much. Btw, I'm only 24 years old, though some people think I'm too traditional for my age.

I think the most dangerous thing in our country is the presence of people who are closet racists. On the public discourse, they pretend to be tolerant to other races. But you can see they are discriminating other races through their actions.

What to do, an uncircumsised dick is so much easier for handjobs but a circumsised one is simply beautiful in all its glory from the very start to end (as opposed to the other which looks like a turtleneck)

Before anyone flames me, yes I know the sex feels as good, all else held constant. Just an external observation here.

  I have FwBs too and I absolutely love the feeling and the sensations.

I know singapore is a multiracial country. But when I see the ad for 'you think you know:food in sg'. I really roll my eyes. Since young I only know sg has 4 races. Chinese malay indian eurasian. And the only sg food  I know, like prata, mee goreng, char kway yeow and some drinks like kopi siew dai. I didn't know sg food includes vietnam, Thai, Turkish and other countries leh. The name of the show should change to 'you think you know: international cuisine'.

Talking about ns females. My unit has a few of them and I really look up to them. To us males, we sometimes see the conscription as a burden and do things chapalang. Or even chaokeng. But not ns females. They knew what they signed up for and they give their all. VOC some do faster than guys. Ippt do better than guys. And they still have to adapt to an environment that to them may be strenuous and unfamiliar. So thumbs up to female ns people. But just maintain your feminine side ok? Don't transform into muscular people.

to  you might be trolling, but I wanna be an armschair general for a while.

The only remaining role in mordern armed force where pure physical strength is important is light infantry (an ironic statement). Light infantry is the bunch that have to carry absolutely everything they need on their backs. Imaging some 50 kilos of gear. Armored infantry has their shit carried by the nearest armored vehicle. Most of other roles do not require you to haul that much stuff.

Women do excel in lots of combat role, compared to men; also precisely because of the average physiology of women. Sniping, for example. Precision sniping is part art, part math, but one advantage women have in generally slower heart rate. Snipers aim to squeeze the trigger between 2 heartbeats, so with slower heart rate, women have a longer plateau to take aim and fire. One doping for competitive shooters is beta-blocker, which slows down heart rate.

The second field is high-performance fight jet pilots. Modern jets are capable of making 9 plus Gs transient turns. At this high-G people lose consciousness due to lack of blood to the brain. Training and equipment helps, but so does the inherent physiology of the pilot. Who has the advantage you ask? People with high blood pressue: short people, fat people, beef eaters, beer drinkers, and women.

Combat vehicle crews is also a field which women has a bit of advantage. Armored vehicles are very very cramped. Old Soviet vehicles used to have a height restriction. With the average shorter height, women make good candidates. Vehicle crews don't have to carry a lot of weight (except for the poor tank loader), so they'll do fine. But please no bad women driver jokes here, m'kay.

Then there are the military police. They have a lot of duties, but mostly to maintain order and guard prisoners. They make fantastic interrogators. A good (non-violent) interrogator is all about reading your prisoners. Women excel at this, way better than men. Even if it's the torturing type of interrogator, women also make excellent ones. Imagine the shame of being tied down and beaten the shit up by a girl. Example include: Irma Ida Ilse Grese, or the Hyena of Auschwitz. Imagine a jackbooted, beautiful, blonde, Aryan girl holding a plaited whip, commanding an army of half-starved dogs ready to tear up anyone at her command. She was especially brutal towards other beautiful women prisoners, and take physical and psychological pleasure in torturing others. 

Lastly, the majority of personnels in an armed force are not combatants. A division might have some 20 000 authorized soldiers. Of those, perhaps 9000 or so are front line trigger pullers. Perhaps 2000 or so in divisional artillery. The rest are support staff. People who drive the truck, deliver food, weapon, ammo, fuel, water so that the 9000 can actually fight. People who cook the food, order the food, use computers, try to use computers, order replacements when computer break down, etc ... The higher organization you go, the higher the support-to-combat ratio. There are ample of employment opportunities for women in armed forces.

But its not like there's no downsides. In the US Armed Forces, women are typically expected to provide sexual favors to advance up the ranks. Rape is a big issue. As would STD, unplanned pregnancy, and so on (they will have to pass out condoms, pills; morning after and daily variants like candies). Existing equipment like body armors are molded for the male physique, but if I can buy a T-shirt, so can manufacturers make body armor from XS to XXL. Male prisoner of war might be shot, but at least they are more likely to be spared the indignity of being raped, then shot.

You are wrong. Fwbs are not common at all. You just here about them more due to recall bias. Definitely not uncommon, but not common. And so many people sleep around as if stds don't exist. At least just stick to 1 fwb long term. I know a few people who got hepatitis or even hiv due to their sexual escapades. Use your brains always. And protection too.

 Since females are physically weaker, they should not be conscripted. Equality means, if appropriate, equal rights should be given to them.

There's been plenty of talk on Facebook about feminism. My 'feminist' friends claims that it's about gender EQUALITY and not merely just 'more rights for women'.

So, to SG feminists: how does female conscription in SG gel with gender equality?

To the OP of ,

I read your story as it was very well liked
So I hope the admin will let me comment about your plight.
As a well-to-do kid who holds a scholarship
I want to tell you something so you'll get a grip.
Though a scholarship gets you out of poverty
A scholarship to me is a necessity.
I aspire to be a civil servant
Where grades are very important.
It doesn't matter if my parents are rich or poor
What the civil service expects from me is very clear
Where the difference between a shepherd and sheep
is the very distinction of a scholarship.
Such is the way our country is run
So just go back and blame your aunt.

I am just kidding
You must be flipping.

While fools speak of you as a malignant form of self-entitlement
Your message to me is nothing short of pure enlightenment.
Here's my story
I hope you are ready:

A group of people throws two dogs a piece of meat
And asking them to fight for it.
As the sizes of the dogs fail to meet,
And only the bigger dog gets to eat.
The group simply stand aside and see,
While claiming this is all part of meritocracy.

On another land
A little girl took her puppies in hand.
Every day she taught them to share
And taught them to care.
Although the puppies are born different
The little girl believed each is equally significant. 
But she never gave her puppies any food
As she wanted them to find their own livelihood.
Instead of yearning for a given piece of meat
The puppies began searching for different food to eat.
Some found vegetable
Because that was all they were capable.
Some found meat
But they were not puffed with conceit.
The puppies then came together
And shared their meat and vegetable with each other.
After all, nothing prevents a riot
More than a balance diet.
The happiness and prosperity they brought
is possible because of what the little girl had taught.

This is the end of my story
I hope you don't find it too dreary.

Although I am a scholar
But I want to holler
I am not one of the believers
in the glorification of early overachievers!!!
I do not worship the wealthy and powerful
I worship the kind and merciful.
Compassion is difficult to quantify,
But it would be folly to say it doesn't qualify.
Our world needs more sympathy
To let everyone live with dignity.
Every day we compete
But at the end of day what have we actually complete?

So I hope you are well my friend
And one day you may put apathy to an end.
If you are girl
I will be here.
If you are a guy
I guess it is goodbye!
-
 
I do admit that somedays i wake up feeling like i'm not smart. That i'm too dumb to compete with all the people out there.

Those days i pay a visit to the "we are against pinkdot in Singapore" facebook page and erupt in happiness looking at all the (for the lack of a better word) stupid arguments people raise there.

Come on. If you want to argue with logic stop contradicting yourself every other post.

OP of , there are a bunch of commenters here who show almost no interest in understanding other people's point of view. They seem to me to be doing their best to ignore the main point of the writers and instead nitpick at the most irrelevant stuff the can find in a post. Whether the topic is on psychological distress, personal problems, poor standards of NUS, NS, atheism, opposition, human rights, etc.

You very well know who you are. The ones who are telling us that these are first world problems, that we should to be satisfied with inequality, that we should suck it up or leave the country. Excuse me for believing in progress, but I've never thought a university could harbor individuals with such backward sentiments

And so what if these are first world problems? So what if the world is unfair? That doesn't make it right to tell people to just live with it. 

And before you say why don't I speak out, because everyone has freedom of speech. You have poisoned the comments section with your toxicity. No one wants to pick a fight with you because you are just going to drag others down to your level while spreading negativity. Every time I see a like on a comment saying Stop Complaining or The World Doesn't Revolve Round You or Just Unfriend Them, I shed a tear. It makes me loose hope in a world where people take the effort to understand each other.

By the way, problems in society aren't solved by silencing other views. If you only have negativity or cynicism to contribute to the topic, please don't poison the atmosphere for those who genuinely want to understand other people in the hopes of improving their lives.

It is a sad show of how much our society has degenerated when someone who brings up legitimate worries about immigration and foreigner assimilation into local society gets shouted down as being a) xenophobic, b) racist, or c) fascist/a Nazi. 

The same left-wing people who preach acceptance, freedom for all and love for all mankind are just as quick to throw vitriol against those who disagree with them. How ironic is that?

I find it funny how some people, who clearly do not serve NS bacause they are not from this country, can comment with such pseudo expertise on NS issues. But it's ok, because online, everyone suddenly becomes an expert, right?

OP of  here.

Thank you to the commenter, and to  for sharing your thoughts. Sorry this is going to be long and incoherent…I wouldn’t suffer anyone to read it; just suddenly felt like clearing my own head.

He/she is family. I think the ‘friends’ support’ part may be impossible… I’ve promised the rest of my family I wouldn’t tell anyone about it. My close friends may never guess as well; as much as I’ve known many of them for a very long time, to be honest the very first indication that something was unusual only presented itself in recent years.

There’s another issue-- I don’t think I’ve ever been the main target of one of his/her rages? It has been my other family members; reasons I can think of include that I have never been one to say potentially provocative things, or perhaps I was just coincidentally never placed in a situation in which that could happen, or that he/she just doesn’t feel as strongly about his/her relationship with me as with the rest of the family. Because the people you tend to hurt are those you love the most? Or so the saying goes

It’s not that I wish to be targeted, because I understand I wouldn’t be good at handling the conflict. But every time something happens, it’s like (however clichéd this sounds) witnessing an accident but being unable to stop it? To me the triggers are not exactly unpredictable. Yet somehow the wrong things are always said, although it may be true that the converse does not exist: there is no one thing that can be said to make it all better. But I suppose it’s not their fault as well! The rest of my family, I mean…they have it a lot harder than I do, and everyone has their own limit of tolerance; theirs have surely been stretched.. 

Google says that people with BPD have generally been abused somehow as children. I don't know what to think of that..? >< it sounds as if something was wrong with our upbringing. Sure it wasn’t perfect but I don’t think my parents’ behaviour was anything close to what constitutes abuse..? (I think) they have tried to be good parents. I’m just confused… I feel guilty about sort of being on the sidelines in all this…was there anything I could have done to improve things? 

“i'm almost certain after their outbursts, they know more than anyone else they're in the wrong too.” I think you’re right, but sometimes I still can’t help feeling resentful…and then I know I’m a terrible person for even feeling that way, because I’m sure they themselves would not do the things they do if they could control it. I feel bad about posting this too.. :’( have I broken the vow of secrecy?? I hope they won’t see this

Sometimes during the lull periods I get lured into a false sense of security. And following the ‘incidents’ I fear that things would just keep getting worse. Or never get better. Or if it eventually does…but takes a long time to reach that point—what would have become of us all by then?

p.s. is it that every family has their own unspoken set of difficulties though?

I am a (non-practicing) Muslim dating a Chinese guy. My parents had never been in favor of this relationship and kept pestering me to convert him to Islam, or I would have to break up with him. I had a falling out with my parents because of this and I'm now living with my grandmother. He is in his early thirties with a stable, well-paying job and we are planning to get married regardless of any opposition from my family and buy an apartment to move in together. As much as I do not want to sour relations with my own family, I am unwilling to let go of the one person I truly love.

@  :

Sorry to hear of your plight, I think it is extremely inappropriate for any parents to impose their own set of belief system on their kids like that. The greatest lie that is ever told, in my opinion, (quoting the dialogue between Richard Dawkins and Mohamad Mukadam) is the apparent acceptance of any alternate practices of the faith upon the coming of age of the child.

Parents who absolutely cannot accept any deviation whatsoever of their children, away from their idealized concept of the "perfect child", such as remaining in a particular religious faith, really should not have any children at all. It hurts me to see families being driven apart due to the lack of tolerance of such differences. It is, to me, a twisted form of emotional child abuse, stemming from the selfishness of parents.

Personally, I grew really sick of the societal obligations imposed on me and actually formally renounced the faith in MUIS earlier this year and have also since cut my family off. I certainly hope it does get better for you.. if not, there are some local support groups that may offer support and advice on this issue! 

-
 
Just a thought about the ongoing issue with the Cross-Island Line construction. The LTA hasn't made a final decision yet, but I certainly hope the line does not cut through the nature reserve, even if it means forcing some landed property residents to move out.

I'm just disappointed that our opposition parties have been totally silent at a time we need their input the most! So are they (generally) pro-residents or pro-environment? Both choices have their repercussions, and it seems to me that they're trying to avoid being responsible for any repercussions from either side by keeping quiet, hence letting the establishment bear the brunt of potential backlash. Or perhaps they will await a final decision by the LTA and then (obviously) oppose that decision, hence merely being a voice for the marginalised.

I really want a more balanced parliament, but to do so our opposition parties have to start having a firm stance on issues, just like the various parties in other developed countries. (conservative/liberal, pro-this/pro-that). Serving simply as a check-and-balance does not justify them having that many seats.

Op of  and wants to respond to a commentor. 

Tbh, i am not implying that it's only man who needs to provide security nor was i implying that it's only guys who should do their part in a r/s. All i was saying is that i finally found the reason why i was not able to get into a proper r/s. Just wanted to share my experience and tell girls out who are not able to have a bf despite dating guys that there's nothing wrong with them! They just need to figure out what they are looking for in a guy! (For me it would be that i realise i value maturity) so for you to get so defensive and even conduct personal attack on the basis of assumptions is such a low blow.. 

The hatred between man and woman in this century due to (i believe) the uprising of feminism have caused everyone to magnify every single comment/statement and turn it into a gender war. 

Seriously, just take a chill pill.

I've read a few confessions about Singapreans lack of willingness to fight or die for Singapore. I'm writing this as a foreigner. Would I fight for my country? No. But my objection was not because of a lack of patriotism or zeal. My main concern in the lack of professionalism and competence across the ranks. If it were a better army, I would join. If it were in an ongoing conflict, at an appropriate intensity, I would join. The best conflicts to fight in are low intensity conflicts of a first world army against a third world bunch of insurgents. High intensity conflict the level of tank on tank combat and I might perhaps consider joining as colonel and above.

First, the idea that you should sacrifice yourself for your country is a new one. Conscription, that is to drill people into regiments against their will; was also a new one. Nationalism was also new. And thus the idea of a national army was new. Out of thousands of wars in human history, perhaps a handful was fought by conscripts. The rest were volunteers and professionals. Aside from traditional salary, slave, land, and booty were the additional pay. War is fun, for the professionals and people who enjoy it. War is not fun for people who don't enjoy it.

In East Asia, the idea of nationalism was imported around the second half of the 19th century. After the Meiji restoration, lots of Western political philosophy ideologies were translated into Japanese. From Japan, it diffuse over the rest of East Asia. For such a young idea in human history, nationalism, it's even younger in East Asia, and it arose not organically. Is it really surprising that East Asians just don't possess the zeal of Americans or Europeans? 

So, let's recap. War was always the business of the professionals, and the volunteers. The majority of states today employ a volunteer only army. In East Asia, nationalism is both young and inorganically grown. So, is it so strange that people don't have the same enthusiasm for fighting?

Thought of the day: Would you want to end up marrying a closeted-homosexual? Would you want your child to end up marrying a closeted-homosexual? There's nothing wrong with this right? Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice right? What's wrong with homosexuals choosing to lead the "normal" lifestyle despite not feeling anything for their spouses? That's the moral thing to do, isn't it?

No? Then stop trying to impose your notions of natural/unnatural unto others. 
-
 
In lieu of all the SAF confession posts here, I would just like to point out one fundamental flaw that plague these posts: Generalisation.

Note that each of these personal recounts is an account of NS by one person and statistically speaking, one out of millions of men who had served or are serving. They generalise their own experience to the rest of the millions on three aspects.

1) The circumstances are similar.

"I had a very bad officer in-charge of me so somehow the officer in-charge of you must be better than mine."

2) The reactions are similar.

"Despite facing shits, I had the resolute of not giving in, if you are facing shits as well, you ought to summon enough strength to overcome  them."

A problem of if I can do it, why can't you? If Obama can become the president, so why can't you?

3) All men are created equal.

"If you have a penis, it means you ought to have a well functioning family with a great deal of financial and social resources to deal with other problems out of camp. You ought to be well-positioned emotionally to handle failures, needing no external help. You should also see NS as a source of happiness like all other things that shine brightly in your world."

Family has history of mental illness. My sis is schizophrenic and on medication for quite a while. Even though theres threats of suicide now and then, but we got used to handling it. However, now my dad is starting to show signs of mental illness which is causing a huge brunt on the family esp my mum and i, on top of other problems most sg faced (not well to do family, finance issue etc). Also the fear of this subconsciously made me reluctant to actively date (already in my 30s) as i fear that i may carry genes that may affect my offsprings. Furthermore, it is also unfair for my future partner. 
Life is tiring at times...

There are some organizations abroad which help people with disabilities to have sex i.e. hire male/female prostitutes on their behalf. I wonder if there are similar groups in S'pore too. I'd think disabled people are too embarrassed to voice out their sexual requests here. I'm thinking of doing a project for the disabled during summer. Should we carry out a needs analysis, and see what we can do about it? What are the potential pitfalls and benefits? Constructive comments are welcomed.

My thoughts on why Singapore lacks its spirit (such that few would actually sacrifice themselves for it)
1. Use of too much western models in our local advertisments/magazine/newspaper spreads. I thought it was common until I realized other asian countries use models of their own ethnic groups proudly and commonly. I seriously would rather be bombarded with Malay/Indian models who actually belong to Singapore racial makeup. These stuff indirectly contribute to the unconscious mentality "Do this place belong to me?"
2.Stuff like "Enouia JC" (can't spell it, lazy to check). I am sure there are many similar words of such grand meaning in Malay(Our national language)/Tamil/Hindi/Chinese dictionary. Perhaps when a college in Greece name themselve "Sangat Baik School", it is then okay that we look to Greece for name-inspiration.
3.Many males, including me, don't appreciate the need for NS since it is quite improbable any countries have anything to gain by invading us now that the world's economy is tightly intertwined and we don have any natural resources for anyone to seize. 
4.Very competitive and weather is very hot and humid, high population density-->despair and rage

 It's not about whether it was in public or in private, it's about your consent - or should I say, the lack thereof. Think about that instead.

Directed at the commenter on   :

Calling everyone who commits suicide "selfish" is kind of judgemental don't you think? What gave you the supreme authority to pass judgement on another person's decision based on the short 30 seconds you spend reading about him while you're scratching your balls?

In fact, if this scenario were to be turned around, aren't you selfish yourself for expecting someone to wade through living hell just to circumvent the potential anguish that is going to be brought upon the living? So is the value of human life cheapened, where we are bound to exist unconditionally to be the playthings and companions for the sake of happiness of the living? Aren't you a little selfish yourself to be expecting that on everyone regardless of the circumstances of their lives? 

It is already a tragedy that one has to resort to such means, the proper course of action is definitely NOT to insult the dead as they are no longer around to defend themselves, and especially since you haven't personally experienced life through his eyes.

Should Lottery be banned? I think so because it is not productive to give huge sums  of money to random people who have done nothing to deserve that money. 

There is no special reason to assume they have the ability, judgment and intention to do anything useful or good with it. 

Therefore the value represented by the money is wasted and lotteries are undesirable.

To the commenters of . The first reaction of any normal person who sees this post is to understand the point of view of the OP, to see where he is coming from. Your first reactions are, however, to treat the OP as someone to demonstrate your supposed intellectual superiority on and proceed to insult and ridicule him. Your tone and your eagerness to shoot the OP down is revealing of how little you even bothered to understand another person's point of view. (With some even calling out his logic, when your own logic was so much worse)

You speak of irony, yet isn't the greater irony that the vile comments you had spew just proved the OP right in saying that NS has led to the breeding of cynicism and unconcern among NSmen? (Considering that all of the vile comments had been made by what appears to be guys)

You speak of the OP setting an example, yet what the OP had specially called out was army culture. So shouldn't you have at the very least countered by saying that you personally had made improvements to the system to eliminate indifference? (Considering that some of you are officers during NS) Instead of flaming an OP who might not have the power and authority.

You speak ill of the OP being anonymous. Yet you only have to look into a mirror to understand why anyone would want to hide their identity. I, for one, appreciate the need for anonymity in the face of online bullies.

You speak as if you have the moral high ground. Yet you don't even bother to show compassion about the emotional troubles that normal people experience as they go through the army.

And then blind to your own vitriol. You wonder why Singaporeans are so unwilling to speak up, and instead choose to secretly do something you proclaim as unreasonable.

Let me offer you a round of slow applause

As some of you might have heard. A National Serviceman had committed suicide recently, just a few days after entering camp. 

Now I'm very irritated by a bunch of people in our society who would just run off their mouth about how soft kids are these days. I don't know about you but I don't see NS being as meaningful as it was like 30 years ago. When I entered NS, I felt like something inside of me just died.

The Singapore military is a thankless place, where every single person in the chain of command is just out there to cover their own backside. There is no grand idea to fight for, I was there for no worthy purpose, except to be a cog in the machine. So I acted my part, whenever I could I would push responsibilities to someone else, anyone else. During team work, I would show moral support, while standing there and providing eye power. As sorry as I may feel for my unit mates who gets arrowed the work, I was dead enough inside that I just didn't give a darn.

This isn't something that I felt alone. The entire system was like that, it is so ingrained in the army culture. It makes people uncaring and cynical, it dehumanises everyone within it, it is demotivating, depressing and uninspiring. For many, it even saps away at their intelligence and logic abilities, to the extent that it produces the type of people you'll find commenting on NUSWhisphers that only know how to put down others.

So when I heard about the news that someone died I wasn't entirely surprised. I consider myself to be not as strongly influenced by my NS days to still retain some semblance of sanity. I could easily see how a more emotional person may be dehumanised to the extent that he starts questioning his value to society. Combined with personal problems, this could lead a person to suicide.

To the people who keep chanting, "Why he jump, but others who face the same problem never jump?" I have this to say to you, you have not live through the problems these people have faced, you have no idea how easily it pushes such people to entertain the thoughts of ending their lives. For those who managed to come back from the edge, they are lucky to have something left in the world that pulls them back. If you never had such experiences, frankly, you don't have the right to shout out to everyone as if it is something easy to do.

Being an arts (non-economics) student, we are forced to read quickly. Every week we need to read around 100-200 pages. But then because of the speed, I am uncertain about whether I understand what I am reading and represent the authors accurately. It is pointless to put up strawman and argue against something which the authors did not say. But that's what I observe about many other students.

I know many of you are on the *grab popcorn* category of people whenever politics gets discussed. And seriously, there's nothing wrong with that. It is a healthy position that we should hear out both sides of any discussion.

Many would think that you are unsuitable to participate in political activities or discussion. And that is totally fine too. Politics isn't everyone's cup of tea,

But what I want to call out against are the people who are saying that you choose not to support a particular side due to the persistence or vehemence or attitude of the people on that side.

This is complete nonsense. In university, and maybe very vaguely during compulsory education, you are taught to evaluate claims based on the strength of the arguments, and not by the tone in which it is spoken us. After all the tone of a person can easily change with his mood on that day, or with how irritating and dishonest the opponent is.

Anyway, if you're truly going to evaluate political positions just by tone alone, there is there is that one side whose standard bearers often demand your support for reasons that have nothing at all to do with the issues the country faces (And no, I'm not referring to Donald Trump)

My mum wants me to teach my younger bro who is just plain lazy. So she wants me to ask my brother to revise and in other words act like his tutor. I have no problems if he has the heart to study and wants to ask me questions but the thing is he is just plain rude to me all the time and when i lose my temper, she would accuse me of being unwilling to teach him. What can I do to resolve this situation?

 I have my own views with regards to the issue that you’re referring to or on relationships in general from my past experience and personal reflection. I think that I’m right but I can’t hope that you or everyone else see things the way that I do and agree with them. But I hope that this is useful as least for consideration or at least as an alternate viewpoint since you asked for advice.

In relation to , I think that it’s true that in some sense, no one is perfect and that no one is perfect for one another. What we need then is actually someone who we love and who love us back in return because love is in some sense irrational, selfless and non-calculative. With love, we can accept the flaws of others, love people for who they are despite them being flawed in some sense according to our expectations of people in general or expectations of our ideal partner (whether they actually can be attainable in reality is a separate matter). Love makes us love people not just despite of their seeming flaws but also want to go through with them life, to want to be there with them in their low points as well as their high points. To want them to be with you in your own low points as well as high ones. To be more exact, sometimes it’s just wanting to be there for them at their low points while hoping to share your happiness with them while you are at your high points. Especially at the initial stages, we somehow even come to see them as perfect, blinding ourselves to their imperfections. Many people might disagree on what I’ve just said, but are they right or is it that what they’re experiencing or have experienced is not love? I can’t say for others, but I know I’m right. I’ve felt it a few times before. It’s real and it exists.

Thus, given what I’ve said, and assuming you are talking about love as I understand it, it’s clear to me that you guys can’t be more perfect for each other and are in this sense, truly perfect for one another. I would say the same with regards to similarities and differences. Some complain that their partners are too similar to complement one another, while others complain that their partners are too different. Is that really the problem? There will always be similarities and differences unless you date yourself.

Persons are right. What then is lacking? I think things just have to be worked out. If you are unable to achieve an objective, is the issue with the objective or is it due to lack of effort, employing the wrong strategies etc.? In this case, given what I’ve said above, I think it’s the latter. I wouldn’t go so far as to assert that it will definitely work out, but I think you guys are both willing and would find it worthwhile to put in the time and effort to try to make things work.

Last few points to note here. No one here knows the exact details and there’s limited help anyone here can give. Here’s what I think I see. From “…very different interests, very different values, and very different goals in life” and “We have tried communicating extensively but we still cannot find a middle ground in all three aspects…”, I don’t think the communication is effective or that you don’t have the full grasp of the situation. There ought to be at least some compromise (two-way) somewhere given what I said above (the understanding of my love that is). And you need to know that through compromise or whatever means, as time passes and as contact time increases, people actually converge. The extent of which is debatable. It’s the same for friendships and group associations etc. Unless you are talking about a woman or man who strictly lives in isolation in the woods.

In general though, I think the following should apply universally: have an honest and open conversation with him and not NUSWhispers (he may be seeing a lot of things that you're not seeing), reflect on what exactly went wrong, and work on the problem together (that too means reflecting together).

With so much conflict (may be unnecessary ones), you guys seem very committed. If things work out, then I think you guys will go very far after this. If not, then at least you guys treasured the times you had with one another and there ought not to be any future regrets.

Hi, I have a question to ask. My boyfriend and I are planning to get married this year. My family is Muslim but I have been an atheist for almost ten years. I am wondering if I need either of my parents (especially my father) present when I register my (civil) marriage. I am not close to him and he does not know I am an atheist. My mother knows. I am afraid of my father and plan to marry quietly and move out quickly. If anyone knows whether my parents need to approve my marriage in the register, please let me know. Asking my boyfriend to pretend to be Muslim and registering under the Muslim register is out of the question for me.

"Go confess!" Do you know how hard is it to confess? It is so much easier to confess on NUSWhispers.

Moreover, I'm fat and unattractive so the chances of me succeeding is far less. I am always being friend zoned.

I wish the matchmaking scheme by parents can restart so I would not have so much issues trying to find a partner. I worry that my genes would become extinct at my hands. Oh and also for not having someone for support for everything in life.

Sad romantic life.

 Have you ever been in a thankless job?

Sure, being a politician seems to be a glamorous job. After all, look at all those benefits! And it seems to be such an easy job too! And that pay!  Totally disproportionate to how much engineers earn after all their hard work, right?

But look at it at another perspective.

Being a politician ain't the cushy life the media makes it out to be, unless you're really just in it for the money. You're not only gonna have to think about your own personal problems, but the problems of your country as a whole as well, and put your own problems aside for the sake of your country when the need arises. You're gonna need to figure out a way to convince your fellow ministers that the reforms you're pushing for is what the country really needs. At the same time, you're gonna have to push for those policies even though your countrymen may not see the benefits yet and complain and gripe everywhere about it.

The situation is pretty similar among student leadership organizations. People may think they're just all that - organizing group meetings, holding events not everyone may be interested in, and in the end they're probably just doing it to get something nice on their resume. If that were really the case, why is it that it's so hard to recruit people to get in in the first place? Why is it so hard to keep people committed? And why do student leaders still get the label "saikang warriors" if their job is so easy?

Yes, passion plays a huge role in enticing people and making them stay committed to the job. But when the cons may seem to outweigh the pros to a certain occupation, maybe it's time you start incentivizing it.

I'm not saying engineering is not a thankless job. But we have a huge supply of competent engineers and an even bigger supply of people who want to be engineers. Would you really need to give people a huge incentive to be an engineer? In contrast, politicians in Singapore tend to be relatively few - competent ones even fewer.

Let me end this post with another example close to my heart. Southeast Asian politicians don't really get paid a lot compared to Singaporean politicians. They don't get shit done. Democracy may still be in play in these countries, and let's assume the people of the country are rational and vote wisely. And yet, you see politicians who would've been potentially great end up being corrupt, money-grubbing scum. Would you really rather have that?

I'd love to post more on this matter, but maybe another time. I've a midterm to study for :)

 It is absurd at how almost every thread in NUSWhispers that remotely deals with jobs becomes a routine government whacking exercise. It is as if some people on the thread are actual members of political parties defending their stances without any compromise.

I laugh, seeing how five or six people trade all sorts of barbs with little substance, pure rhetoric, and others just treat it as entertainment.

Exciting, exciting.

I was surfing YouTube for those videos that expalins science (I'm procrastinating, might as well learn something new) when I stumbled across videos supporting Flat Earth and Creationism. I was reminded of an event quite some time ago featuring a prof from a top research institute arguing for Creationism. Goodness, I just don't understand, how can ppl in spite of more and more evidence wiggling it's dingdong in their faces, can still take ideas from an ancient book so literally. I mean, it's one thing someone living in the bible belt watching only fox news that believe in such stuff, but Singapore? I don't get it at all.

To the author of  I was in a situation like yours. I met a great person who happened to be a christian. (I'm an atheist) I was very scared about the conflict that would arise from that when we got together, but after being married for more than 2 years, we're still happy together.

There will be conflicts, and I think the most important thing is to talk it out. Don't just assume things will work out. This is going to be a hell of an awkward talk and probably involve you getting angry at each other, but you need to make sure you settle this before getting married. 

Will he/she want you to convert? Do you want him/her to convert? Or are you both okay with having different religions? Will you want him/her to come with you to the temple/church or vice-versa? What about the kids? What religion will they be brought up with? All these things need to be settled first, before even thinking about marriage. You will have to make compromises, as will he/she. Be sure those are sacrificies you are willing to make and make sure it's a fair deal, if not it's going to blow up at some point.

It's an uphill struggle and it is very likely going to be tough. If neither of you is willing to convert to the other's religion (and I am not saying you should), then this will mean that you have to accept the other person's religion. This might well be the toughest of all. This means no harbouring of hopes that 'he/she will eventually come around to see the truth', no constant nagging on 'this thing he/she does every day that his/her religion prescribes' and it also means actively standing up for him/her if your family or friends talk badly about their beliefs (that one is much harder than it sounds). In short it means coming to terms with your partner having beliefs which are different from yours and not trying to change anything about it. 

If you both can get to that point, then congratulations you've made it! Give it a try and make an effort, if it works it will be worth it. It definitely was for me.

To the guy in , maybe you should build up some self-esteem and make some real friends. Instead of being a keyboard warrior in the "secret lab", you might just want to be a man and go out to make some friends, who are probably inexistent at the moment. P.S. You probably can't "converge" to any success in future if you remain like this. Just my 2 cents.

Any other Westerners here very scared of the conversations about racial  identity and stereotypes that seem to permeate this page?

You're all human, stop hating on each other

My family found out of my dad's affair a few years ago and since then, the relationship between my parents is filled with tension. My mum has on many occasions moved out of the house and stayed elsewhere just to avoid conflict with my dad. My siblings and I have mostly treated my dad as invisible. 

Just a BG: My dad has been retrenched for many many years and does not contribute to my family's income at all. In fact, he wastes money by  spending frivolously on objects of his interest.

I'm in a conflict because at times I feel terrible for treating my dad as invisible but mostly I think I'm behaving this way because I still cannot come to terms with things (like how my family is now broken), that I'm angry at my dad for doing what he did and he deserves whatever treatment he receives from us. 

My internal conflict affects me quite a bit emotionally and I don't think it's healthy to have this conflict within me. Just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar situation.
-
 
To  I have the similar situation too. My dad had a serious conflict with my mother since I was 12. It wasn't an affair but a compilation of built up issues from money to family. They argued and argued for a long time and my mother health was affected to the long term fights. In short, my father lived in a separate room, do anything he likes and my mother would just treat him invisible. Everything my father did was just a sore to my mother and my mother would just complain to me all the time.

The complicated part was all my father relatives are on the same side with my mother. Eventually I need to "take sides". I took the my mother side even though I claimed that I will not take part on the fight. Hence, it was bitter and awkward during the festive seasons especially the Chinese New Year.

Even though the frequency of fights reduced since they split rooms, but whenever a fight breaks out, it is a lot more intense than the previous. It was like living with a ticking time bomb. I am an international student and I have to leave my country to study in NUS. That's when my mother made a huge move: my mother urged my father to move out so that they can avoid the fight once and for all. Since my mom does not want to engage another fight with him, I have to become the spokesmen to discuss with my father. It was hurtful to kick your father out of the house and my father is one of the low-income earners. But it had to be done somehow...

My father agreed to move out and it was a good decision. Both parties are happier. I just have to be the middle man every time I went back home(somehow have a moment with my father and not let down my mother at the same time).

What advice I can give to you is that you should take your own actions towards your family since you are already an undergraduate. Treating your father invisible is your mother's choice, not yours. You just have to make both parties satisfied(even if it is just a little).

 Well, doesn't that depend on each individual? Some people just want to be themselves. This doesn't mean that they do whatever they want disregarding everyone else, but that they take the aforementioned into account only insofar as it's consistent with their own way of doing things, the life they want to lead and so forth. I reckon it's hard for people nowadays to understand this but for some individuals, being themselves is extremely important to them. That's of course assuming the individual just wants to be himself or herself. Even if that's not the case, if you or anyone else doesn't like what he or she is saying or offering, then so be it? Someone else may very well like his or her personality, some even though they disagree with his or her comments. It happens all the time and that's life. You can't get everyone to agree with everything about you, in terms of your speech and behaviour and so forth. Perhaps then the issue lies somewhere else. The issue I think is simply this: you are blaming people for not conforming to your expectations of them. Is that fair? Perhaps the rightful resolution simply lies in you adjusting your attitude. Just my two cents.

1 - Our entire family has suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts.

2 - He blames family members for anything that goes wrong, the first target being his children. For example if the coffee maker is not working, we're to blame. Reason being, we use it too. Therefore, we damaged it.

3 - If we cry in an argument, he will scold us for being weak and emotional. The berating will intensify. Once, my younger brother had a panic attack because he wouldn't stop scolding him while he cried. He tried to run away. I had to convince him to come home. He was very young and I didn't want him to get mixed up in the wrong crowd.

4 - He verbally abuses service staff and other road users when we go out.

5 - He's always right.

6 - He thinks he is extremely intelligent and that his adult children who have been to university (he hasn't) are more idiotic than him. Yup! Said it straight to our faces.

Through it all, mother is his number one supporter. Deep in my heart, I resent how she allowed him to emotionally abuse his family, members of the public and even her. Every child of his has grown up immersed in fear. We fear being in his presence. We fear getting scolded.

I don't know how to continue living with him. When I told mother how I felt about the situation, she instructed me to love him. I have tried and failed repeatedly, so many times that I lost count. I don't know how to love him when I suspect he regrets ever having children.

Many times, I lie in bed and cry, asking myself why I was born and feeling very sorry for existing. Why are f-ed up people allowed to have children? The only logical outcome of f-ed up people having children, is f-ed up individuals. It's a vicious cycle. The world is overpopulated, yet we beg the cruel to spread their seed. I wish my father loved me and cared about my well-being. I'm never going to have children, because this broken individual is unable to raise emotionally-stable offspring.

Why are guys so desperate to lose their virginity? Now, i am not generalizing all guys, but most of them seems to put losing their virginity up a pedestal. I have a multiple friends telling me if one do not lose his virginity by 25, he is deemed as a loser. And in order to achieve that "goal", they club, they go through ways and means, making use of girls as a mean to reach their end goal and then waiting to dump them in the end. Heck, it is not even with the one they love. Just wondering why would they have such a mentality. Thank yo!

To the OPs of  and , I'm a Chinese male Singaporean with the opportunity of exposure to many different cultures when I was younger, and I'd just like to share a personal experience.

My first crush was Indian, the girl I loved hanging out with in a drama class was African-American, and the girl I had a thing for (the feeling was mutual) in an English tuition class was Eurasian. Growing up in an SAP primary school and entering a certain prestigious all-boys' Chinese high school, I thought I could only be attracted by Chinese (or at most, White) girls. But I was proven wrong in secondary 4, when I attended a peer tutoring session at the Discovery Centre and met an African-French girl on vacation. And OH BOY was she hot AF. We stole loads of glances at each other and made some small talk. Till today I still wonder if I should've found out more about her. Recently in NS I've discovered I'm also smitten by some Malay girls - a racial group I'd never imagine myself dating in the past.

The point of this post? I think there are attractive people of all races wherever you are. To simply generalise some and put others down is demeaning to their dignity and self-worth in society. You can rationalise all you want and say that you're making a general observation. But it doesn't detract from the fact that your biases exert themselves onto your perceptions of the world around you and frame your attitudes in social situations (read: Daniel Kahneman). It's no different from racism when you belittle the identity of a certain group and suppress their potential to find success in dating or whatever. The Chinese guys who mock 'minahs' are no better than whitewashed SPGs.

I'd urge the OPs and everyone else to reexamine your biases and remain open to whoever you meet. There are attractive people everywhere from various cultures that potentially interest you. There may be someone that suits your goals, values and ideals from a race you've never considered before. Stop restricting your own dating pool from finding that special someone!!! Oh and for the Chinese dudes, while the attitudes of SPGs might be the bane of our existence, you can focus on working out and eating clean - they help towards getting the chiseled look so many speak of. Also, be self-assured (Not arrogant) of your culture, values and their place in the world. This helps with your confidence; who'd fancy someone who isn't at least comfortable in his own skin? Last but not least, you don't just need to ONLY date Chinese girls. There are girls of other cultures that potentially suit you, if only you smiled more and opened up. Why not learn about each other's background, worldviews and customs as a starting point?

Good luck!
Your brother from another mother
P.S. I think the whole SPG saga is a result of the largely disgusting sociocultural phenomenon (mainly in the States) of Asian women forfeiting any semblance of self-respect for their culture when they simply 'throw' themselves at white guys. Usually they'd refuse to acknowledge their identity and in some cases even condemn it. 
-
 
 Wait, you can stereotype guys who don't support your actions as "not hot", "insecure" etc but you can't take it when someone calls you an SPG for having a preference for dating white. Pot, kettle, black, yeah? 

Yes, it's your life, and you are free to do whatever you want, however you want. Your body, your right. Similarly, don't fault others when they view you as cheap, especially when your value plummets after 30. It's just pathetic because many of the caucasian males who are here are second tier, don't truly respect Asian girls, yet still have SPGs like you line up to offer yourself. If you disagree with whatever I have said, you can try withholding sex with your white bf and see how fast he bolts.

And yes, you can say "have more confidence", "don't be bitter". But let's see how confident and happy you are when your wonderful caucasian boyfriend cheats on you for a younger, hotter, sluttier SPG. Look at all the famous SPGs we have in mediacorp such as Fiona, Jamie and Joanne. Happily ever after? 

The pattern is quite obvious to everyone in this country. White guy comes, SPGs suddenly behaves super liberal and proclaims equality and freedom to date whoever she wants, White guy gets want he wants and leaves soon after. SPG, having gone through a divorce/ditched, then sings another tune.

The only reason why you are so disillusioned right now is because you are young, and have an abundance of male attention. That will be gone when your looks fade and your shallow, vapid personality is what people focus on instead. At that point, the guys who you thought were "on your side" will have no qualms of telling you the cold hard truth. I guarantee this 100%. Maybe you can post on confessions then?

I recently watched a show on celebrities giving speeches to the public. What one of the celebrity said was really true. Don't force your own beliefs and values onto others. This is so true. You may think that you are right, or your attitude is right, but that may not be the case for other people. Stop forcing them to be like you and let them have their own beliefs. Even for close friends. Try to understand them, understand why they choose not to say something or do something, and not force them to show what they don't want to reveal. It may not seem like a big thing to you, but to them, it can be life changing and hurtful. 

So stop forcing others and put yourself in their shoes. It's hard to do, since many of us are advocates of being true to ourselves and doing what we want to do. If so, keep quiet and let them have some personal space.

Is it okay for my to visit my ex's parent's funeral to pay my respect? I have a feeling that my ex doesn't want to see me again but.... these are different matter right?

@ I find it very interesting that no one is picking a fight with your post. It seems that, as usual, it is politically correct to bash on guys. Lets take your inflammatory last post and make a few changes.

It seems like it's only certain people from minority races who appear to vehemently judge and hate Chinese Singaporeans. I've never come across a capable person from a minority race who ever had a problem with Chinese privilege perhaps because he/she doesn't have such fragile self-confidence nor an inferiority complex. Just saying. 

It seems like it's only feminists who appear to vehemently judge and hate men in general. I've never come across a strong independent female who ever had a problem with gender privilege perhaps because she doesn't have such fragile self-confidence nor an inferiority complex. Just saying. 

Now all the SJWs will come out of the woodwork to claim that these things are not the same, in the other cases a group of people are hurt by being marginalized, whereas those Chinese guys could have avoided the issue by improving themselves!

Hi SQ fanboy. I disagree.

I am EK. I do things my way. Unlike SQ, I don't belong in an alliance, but when certain airlines like Delta keep on complaining about me having subsidies when I don't, I just do things my way and dominate entire markets. Look at QF and MH; they're smart to tag team with me. But others who don't, such as AF and LH, should know that all EK does is to connect the world better than them.

If consumers vote for us with their wallets, why should others complain? That includes SQ.

I honestly think Gentle Bones is underappreciated as an artist, more so  by his fellow Singaporeans.

His early work was a little too 'indie' for my taste, but when his self-titled EP came out in 2014, I think he really came into his own - both commercially and artistically. The EP has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Ed Sheeran, but I think Joel has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour. In 2015, Joel released Sixty Five, his most accomplished single; a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics - but they should! Because it's not just about the struggles of independence, and the importance of perseverance, it's also a personal statement about the artist himself.

 I am a chinese guy who find chinese girls to be more attractive than ang moh. Generally, they aged better (less wrinkles) than ang moh. When I look at those ang moh girls, some of them like Xena the warrior princess.

I'm mixed-raced and grew up with a very indifferent attitude towards 'race' as a category. Like I really can't care what the colour of your skin or your affinity with your ethnicity is. I'm not going to pretend to be one of those saints and say looks doesn't matter. It matters insofar as it determines if I get attracted enough to even learn more about your personality. That being said, I've dated people from various races whom I found attractive. Now that my current boyfriend is White, I get totalised as being an SPG. Whatever guys. Oh and one more observation, it seems like it's only certain single Chinese boys who appear to vehemently judge and hate whosoever dates a white guy. I've never come across a hot Asian dude who ever had a problem with "SPG" perhaps because he doesn't have such fragile self-confidence nor an inferiority complex. Just saying.

I'm really curious to hear what everyone thinks (hope this gets posted!):
1. If a girl gets a caucasian boyfriend she's labelled SPG. But on the other hand, other interracial couples (e.g. chinese and indian/chinese and muslim) or even couples like (singaporean chinese and japanese/hongkong chinese) don't get judged the same way. Why so? I think it's not so nice.
2. If the tables were turned, a guy is dating a caucasian girl, no one gives him degrading labels like "SPG". Why not?
3. If a girl takes many photos with her caucasian friends (girls and guys), she's trying too hard and people starts teasing. If a guy takes many photos with his caucasian friends, he's popular and blending in well with people of other nationalities.

Sometimes, we really need to reflect on our own intrinsic bias. Why do we judge and call someone "SPG" when we do not know their story? Also, there are more critical problems to worry about than a stranger's decision on who to date. Maybe it will be nicer if we start taking things less personally (e.g. a Singaporean guy concludes that Singaporean girls who date caucasians are just going after wealth/physique and you hate all of them). I think it is extremely shallow to mass judge people and it's a lot of unnecessary hate. Furthermore, an asian-caucasian couple does not mean that their love story is based on purely physical attraction. It does not mean their story is superficial and any less worthy than a sg-sg couple. We are all educated and wise, let's not jump to nasty name calling with a sour attitude. We should know the full story before we criticise. (e.g. being really mean to a guy just because he dates a pretty girl without finding out their full story) Let them be. Whatever choices you make, we're not judging you as well. Let everyone live the life they want! The world will be a much happier place if our thoughts are kind.

Have any social scientists consider the hypothesis: Because Singaporeans are generally not good-looking, that is why the total fertility rate is low.

Hello, OP of  here, but I didn't write .

To the commenters:

I'm a Singaporean Chinese female, and I'm proud of my own race. Of course there are good-looking Asians. Perhaps I was merely considering the cream of the crop of white people. But as I said, I PERSONALLY feel white people GENERALLY look better, because of their facial features like their eyes and jawlines. I'm sure you each have your own preferences of the appearance of your potential other half - what's wrong with having mine? Of course I can't help it, my brain is wired in such a way that I like the facial features of white people. It's my own preference; it's me and all me, and I take ownership of it. Did I mention that this preference is mine? Wtf I didn't say only white people look good; there are good-looking people from all races.

I was not trying to justify why white people are superior. I didn't even say that they are. Perhaps you would like to re-read my original post. I was merely postulating why some people, including some of our ancestors, perceived them to be superior to Asians. I do not share the same mindset. If you'd read clearly, you would realise I wrote exactly that.

No one can deny that appearances are very important, especially when we have some people posting pictures in their sports bras and hot pants. Some prefer taller people; some prefer shorter people. And for me, I prefer white people because to me, they look better due to their facial features. 

And to the OP of  I don't understand why you had to post that anonymously, since you already gave yourself away when you commented on  using your FB account and mentioned about your hopes and dreams to succeed in life just so you can hunt SPGs down and discriminate against them. Whoa we've got a badass over here. Ps love that you had to remind us that SPG isn't a race so you aren't a racist.

 There is no meaning in wanting to die for your country. All wars are caused by old men who want young men to die for their ideologies.

Whether we are the belligerents in a war, you get out; you fight for no one but yourself, because the leadership certainly isn't fighting for you, but for themselves. Why would they? You are but a faceless number on a list; if your death will let them achieve their goals, then you shall die.

If you are truly a patriot, there are much better ways of showing this. Carve your name into history books. But never choose death, because lives are cheap and loyalties are worthless.

I read somewhere that some people said that it's because 70% of Sinkies are descendants of coolies, and coolies are basically poor people who are generally not good-looking.

While there are more yandaos in the current generation due to our increased affluence, a significant portion are still ugly and continue to get married with a fellow ugly Sinkie female.

So, there will still be short-haired four-eyed specky pasty-skinned guys in abundance who will depress the TFR while Sinkie females go for other races and AMDKs.

Serious question: Is it ethical or even legal to poison my own food and put it in the fridge? I am not planning to do so, just curious.

Sure a person who steals food may get poisoned and die, but what is his business eating food that is not his anyway? I could argue that my intention is only to poison my food, and I should be allowed to do whatever I want with my property.

Let us recap what is an SPG. She is an asian woman that 1.  Exclusively dates white men. 2. Looks down on her own race and thinks that caucasians are superior, especially with her white boyfriend and 3. Applies double standards to caucasians and asians (e.g. acting super virginal in front of asian community, completely slutting it out in front of caucasian men). If you are any one of the three, yes, you're an SPG.

I'm from a European city that's pretty racially diverse while still having Caucasians being the main demographic. In juxtaposition to white men, I honestly never found Asian men to be that physically attractive. When I moved to Singapore, this all changed. Perhaps it was because there was no longer much competition from "angmohs" or because I learned to appreciate different standards of beauty more. Whatever the reason, I found my head turning more for Asian men than Caucasians. It was a very gradual shift in preference and I didn't notice it until I moved back to my home country and experienced a significantly lower sexual attraction than normal. After some introspection, I concluded that the reason for this was because I was no longer physically attracted to most men. The same small demographic of Asian men that I had previously looked over were now huge on my radar (or maybe people just got hot while I was away). And upon shifting back to Singapore, I find myself much more eager to meet guys and go on dates. It's not that I chose to prefer one race over the other. I don't know why I do. It's just a trend in my personal preference that I've noticed. 

Tl;Dr. It ain't all about the angmoh men.

How many of you people would ever consider selling out one's own body for material gains? 

I have a friend who is studying overseas on her parents' monies. However she is also a sugarbaby on the side to multiple clients and gets sponsored holidays to exotic locations, fine dining, lavish gifts and offers for sponsored cosmetic surgery for herself. Quite clearly she is earning a lot of money for herself, in fact way more than what her total tuition and living expenses will incur for her entire university education. 

Usually I won't judge people who see sugarbabying/prostitution as a means that is justified by their ends. If their motivation is to live the high life and it is way over their income level all well and good. What grates my sense of propriety here about this friend of mine is that despite earning so much to support her university education and more she is still letting her parents bankroll her university education and keeping them in the dark about the huge amount of money she is salting away in secret. And just to give you an idea, she is doing Law which is one of the most expensive degrees around. If she were a working adult supporting herself I'd have no issues about it, but there is a special place in hell I believe for children who exploit their families financially and yet still find the gall to turn to societally questionable options like sugarbabying and escorting to bankroll her ideal lifestyle. 

Any opinions here?

 I'm not sure what the "certain circumstances" are but it may very well be that he's just uncertain of his feelings for you etc. And please do not say that he deserves someone more gorgeous, smarter, wiser, more bright and cheery, and less dark and twisted because the fact is that there are seemingly (from one's perspective) pros and cons in everyone including himself or herself. And love doesn't work that way. If you can look through his own share of issues or shortcomings, what makes you think he can't look through yours. There are also times where we may be shortchanging ourselves and we are actually a lot better than we think we are. And he may think of you a lot better than you think of yourself right now. Best wishes :)

Hi, I'd just like to weigh in on the Singaporean vs ang moh males issue.

But first! Disclaimer: Don't bash me ok - to each his own. So this is just my preference, I'm not speaking up for anyone else.

I'm really not sure if this mindset (how some Singaporeans prefer ang mohs, both males and females) stems from the time when European countries had built themselves large empires, but you have to admit that they appeared to be powerful and authoritative to our ancestors, so much so that other races in their colonies began to see them as superior. (Does being able to invade and colonise your nation equate to being superior? In a sense, yes, right?? Can any bio students weigh in on whether mindsets may be hereditary?)

Today, I'm sure that most people, including me, no longer retain the mindset that white people are overall, superior compared to Asians. However, we are genetically inclined to be more attracted to physically appealing people. And GENERALLY, many white people, both males and females, are better-looking. Just look at them intense coloured eyes (we Singaporeans have to use coloured contact lenses) and sharp jawlines!

And regarding white males, most are taller - it's in their genes - than Asians. Some females prefer taller males because they appear to provide a greater sense of protection (being physically bigger). Can't say the same for white females as some males feel inferior to taller females...

I used to like kPop and even idolised some male stars cos they have a pretty face and were good singers/dancers. But gradually, I started feeling put off the more I saw how they were, many times, forced to do the Korean aegyo for their fans. I know that was all for humour and to tease them, but that is just decreasing their manliness, right? I know how kPop fans are very unforgiving, please don't wage a fanwar on me...

All in all,  I would be more attracted to an ang moh over a Singaporean male anyday. That being said, no, I don't purposely create opportunities to speak to ang mohs or change my accent when talking to them. It is possible for a Singaporean to be thoroughly ok with my race but prefer ang mohs right?

TL;DR - personally I would be more attracted to an ang moh not because I view them as superior to us, but because generally they look better.

Why is it more generally more acceptable to chase someone for her pretty face than for her hot body? Too often I hear a friend going after a specific girl because she's pretty, she's cute, she's an eyecandy, it was love at first sight etc... But if I were to say that I'm chasing a girl because her body is hot, I'll be frowned on as a pervert.
Let's put it this way. Faces are born with, bodies are built upon. Thus, the body is a way better representation of a partner's physical and mental health than the few features of a face. She has a small waist and toned legs? Must have been working out quite a lot, showing that she has put some form of dedication into improving herself. She'll most probably produce healthy off springs too. 10/10 would wife.
Well then, what can you say about  someone with a sharp nose? Or a girl with a v jawline? 
I believe this is the result of the over-sexualisation of the human body and society's negative view on sexual interests as a whole.
The next time someone tells you he is chasing someone because of her pretty face, please tell him he's more superficial than someone who looks for a fit body.

Why do some singapore girls choose ang mo guys over singaporean guys? What is so good about ang mo guys? Don't you find their excessive body hair unhygenic, weird beards and moustaches, and most of them being bald? Besides having a bigger tool, what's so great of them? Most of them probably don't understand our native singlish, chinese and dialact. 
-
 
I have to agree that guys focus on looks. I am a guy and I do that as well. (May be it is genetically wired in guys) However, looks are not my first criteria. Usually, I look at their location as my first criteria ( I only look to date girls living in Singapore and preferably nearby ), followed by their religion then looks. And of course it don't just stop at looks, I will then have to find out more about the personality of the girl.

@15889
Blue eyes, blonde hair? Shit I'm a singaporean guy and hands down I can say that those white dudes got waaaay more game than us.
I mean what's so great about our Singlish or our culture? The Caucasians I've met are friendly and they have a more polished set of mannerisms and heck, I find them more charming than most local guys.

It's also not just the guys. I've got a weakness for Caucasian girls as well.

This is a rather outsider view on why Singapore birthrates is low; and it's quite hard to get people to actually getting married. Take it as you will. 

If you want to get the birthrates up, you need to get people to hitchup young, and married young. Why? The longer you live as a lonely single, the more likely you will get used to it. Also, the longer you live childless (getting married late), the more likely you will contend with your lots in life.

Before you can actually get married, you need to date someone. Surprised. And Singapore is not a very conductive place to do it. Now, let's forget the how to meet, how to confess, etc .... Those things takes minutes, or days. The harder part is the months and years. Now, here's the problem: if you are a fairly modern-minded 20-something, physical intimacy is likely to come in at some point. I had my share of dating (and hopefully will get married in a few months, as a late 20-something), and let me tell you this: physical intimacy change the game very quickly. Why the focus on physical intimacy? Well, without it, two dating people are just really good friends in a short period of time.

Don't believe the "friend first, then date, then blah blah ..." Problem is: if you want to date your friend, be prepared to burn that bridge when you break up. So many people will avoid doing that altogether. Besides, on the girl's POV, you make friends with her, then say "I've loved you for a long time, blah, blah", she will think of your friendship together just as a mean to an ultimate end. I know that most guys will bone their female friend given the chance, but I digress. Declare your sexual interest early, and get intimate early changes everything.

It does run the risk of both of you getting carried away in a blissful wave of hormones, oxytocin, dopamine, orgasms, and the like, before long you will be too attached to this addiction drug dealer-like relationship with this person of interest. Too attached before you can consciously make the decision that this is actually the person I would want to be with for the rest of your life. I believe that the usual way of "friend then date" don't work; but for a long-term relationship to work, you two need to be able to be friends and enjoy each others' company when you are NOT fucking. It turns out in marriages and long term relationship, there's a lot more "who's gonna do the dish" than "how about I give you a t***** m****** and make you c** s** times". 

Oh well, back to the question why Singapore is unconductive to dating (at least how I see it). Well, most 20-something lives with their parents. You can't buy new flats as a single, unless you are over 35. In Japan, there's a word for over 25 years old women: "Christmas cake" (who's gonna buy Christmas cake after 25th Dec?). HDB flats cost 3 arm and 4 leg; condo plus two pair of lungs and kidney. The only way is, well, if you stay in hostels while in universities. Unfortunately, local institutes are still wayy to prude to allow heterosexual boning in dorms.

Or you can rent. But most landlords are meddlesome, paranoid middle-ages old folks who just don't keep up with the time (no visitor rules). Excuse me, what's the fucking issue? The girl I invited to have a netflix and chill session stand a much greater chance of getting murdered by me in a dark alleyway than anything I would want to do with your property. What are you afraid of mate? Me staining your mattress?

You can rent a whole flat, but that's quite expensive, and unnecessary. Let's be real, you are not going to cook. You don't need three bedrooms. You can share with others to lessen the rent (as apt for a large number of young Americans), but if I remember my RE laws lesson right, technically, when you rent a HDB, you are NOT a tenant. The owner is HDB, the "owner" is the tenant, and you are the subtenant. Subtenants are not allowed to sublet; though it doesn't really stop people from doing it informally.

Lastly, there's hotel. But I think most girls think of "going to hotel" = "she's cheap". There's not no culture of going to a hotel specifically to bone in Singapore. In other places, hotels might be a refresher, a change of scenery for long-term attached couples. After all, people tend to have sex a lot more violently in hotel rooms, for some reasons.

So, if you want to raise the birthrate and marriage rate, make it easy for young people to live alone. Living with your parents does fuck with your confidence, your male sexual prowess aura a wee bit.

hey . i'm female and i like how you think. since it gives girls like me a better chance. i may not have the prettiest face, but i do have a good figure. small waist, toned legs, etc. some of this comes naturally too. however, to some guys, it is precisely because such aspects can be worked upon. so they prefer a pretty face, which isn't so readily attainable (unless you argue for plastic surgery). but i am glad there are guys out there who think like you! 
-
 
 As a somewhat self declared :P decent person on dating apps, I don't think most men judge primarily on looks, even if there are some who does this out there. Heck, let's not gender divide this notion, there are ladies out there who does this too. My point here is that, people's expectations doesn't change just because they have online profiles, and you'll be betrayed by that ideal if you expect people you meet in real life to not habour such perspectives (aren't people on dating apps real people too?). 

Hey, if these guys self-filter themselves out because they're looks only, all the better / easier in finding the more decent folks :D !

Sometimes I wonder why people use all their energy to divide others instead of fixing their OWN problems of fear and anger ?

"You never hear feminists talk about the fact that woman will get a lesser sentence for the same type of crimes a man committed.
You never hear them talk about that in the event of some sort of disaster they will be saved first the men can die. "Women and children first" anyone? "

Now, now. Just because you never hear of them doesnt mean they dont exist ;) im sure youll believe in "not all men rape" but now youre suggesting "all feminists.." Like food critiques, religions etc there are always people with their own diverse views and i for one believe that both genders should be treated equally in terms of crime and punishment, including caning, as well as in determining who gets to live. Id say kill the children, save the adults. Still more women then men bc you can continue a population with 1 man and 4 women, but not 4 men and 1 woman. Purely instrumental thinking. 

"If war broke out woman don't have worry about being drafted to fight."
Sg's context. From what i know aware has pushed for the idea of female conscription but i think they got shot down. 

"It is already statistically proven that men are more likely to die at work and more likely to commit suicide than women." 
Are men more likely to die at work, because more men work? Or are they more likely to die at work, because theyre more likely to engage in risky behaviour? Are they more likey to die at work because their job scope is more risky than that of "traditional" "womens" jobs? If they are risky jobs, do these jobs hire women to even out the "risk of dying" statistics? 

Statistics are never what they seem to be. Tragic as it is, and i wouldnt deny that, there may be underlying reasons that are may be correlated to equality, but not caused by inequality. 

"In western societies men are less likely to graduate college and university while women's education rates keeps improving over the years.
Feminists say men are privileged......... "
Why is this? Are western men simply not taking their education seriously by partying and kegging weekends away? Or are they more likely to leave school to pursue interests? Economic or not. Is the statistic of less men graduating enough to substantiate why (white middle class) men are paid significantly higher than their female counterparts for the same job? 

"Yeah right. Using SG as an example, draft females into NS and make them serve reservist as well, if you want to pride yourself on copying the Israeli defence system"
Im gonna get a lot of shit from females because of this but i agree with it too. It doesnt necessarily have to be combat positions, it could be one of admin, clerks, store. Or heck, even combat positions. the slowest female would probably be as burdensome as the slowest male anyway.  

"Reform the Women's Charter and close alimony loopholes that are frequently exploited by divorcing females." "Furthermore, reform the judiciary and the media to cease condemning accused males of sexual harassment or rape cases when he has not been found guilty by trial." 

Agreed. The womens charter has, for too long, put men to a disadvantage especially to cunning females. Thankfully the laws are changing and the recent implementation of maintenance of husbands has been erected (no pun intended). The social nature of singapores family ideal used to be one of that the solo breadwinner male and the domesticated female who relied entirely on the savings of the male. But not-so-recent shifts in the industry has necessitated the dual income family and with that, alimony pleas should be reconsidered and looked upon strictly. 

The nature of the judicial system here is that of "guilty until proven innocent" unlike its blissful counterparts. Many laws such as the ISA enables the detainment of suspects without trail. This name and shame though has got to stop, whether on informal platforms such as STOMP, or on tabloid newspapers like the new paper or the straits times (oh burn). Basically our media and the censorship boards are shit. Most forms of media are and its a global issue. For example, the sharia law for islam bans unlawful sexual activities between men and women and the parties who are found to have contravened these laws would be pubically punished, caned and perhaps stoned. Yet, majority of articles covering these "criminalities" often depicts the women being caned but not the men. Honour killings, done because an unmarried couple were found, or rumored, to have done unlawful sexual acts are often performed on the women involved, but rarely the men. You cant give the excuse "at least it doesnt occur in our society" because it would then be a global excuse. "Be thankful you were only lashed, at least you werent sold as a sex slave". "Be thankful youre still alive as a sex slave, at least youre not disfigured by acid". See the trend here? 

"True gender equality is egalitarianism. Not any -ism that panders only to one gender like feminism or meninism"
A-men. But what if this problem only arises because there is no one definition of "feminism" or "meninism"? 
For example, the basis of feminism was largely egalitarian in nature, before what you'd call "feminazis" adopted a more superficial idea of what the movement was intended to be. Of course there are advantages and disadvantages to being both male and female, yet on a global scale, it seems as though the disadvantage and consequence of being born female is larger than that of if you were being born male. We are not belittling your struggles and problems that you face. A person who lives on $100 is considered poor, so is a person living on $70. Of course we need to help both parties. But giving them both an extra $1000 would still result in inequality of $30. 
I guess what im trying to say is that each sex faces their own problems and that each "belief" of feminism or meninism or whatever ism isnt trying to undermine the struggles of the other. Ultimately, we believe in what we believe in, even though there are really stupid people out there who believe that "yes i want equality but ew i dont want to serve ns". Or something more stupid, god forbid, like "but can men give birth?" Sex is biological, but constructed in the social. You only see what you want yourself to see. You only see the side of aware that pushes for whatever you think it pushes for (bra burning penis slicing?) but you neglect the times where they fight for the right for paternal leave. You pick up on the "i want to free my tits in new york city" but ignore the little girls in a foreign city who have just been allowed to get an education. You only see the times when chelsea wins a game, but neglect the fact that they are nowhere near the top of the table. 

Sorry for the long post, heres a potato.

I once told someone about my self harm and they began questioning why I would do this to myself, in an almost hostile manner. I get that they were worried for me, so i didnt want to provoke them more or make them feel even more upset and gave a random excuse for it. The truth is i have to punish myself because i am a worthless human being. I used to be proud of the smooth skin on my arms, but now... when i see my scars and bruises, I'm reminded that i am broken and don't deserve any happiness. Otherwise I'd just get carried away and continue thinking that there's nothing wrong with me. I don't think I'm worth fixing. This world is better off without me.

Please don't filter! Sometimes I feel quite dumb when I read the comments left on some of the posts. Let me just get straight to the point. I feel like I am not fit to be a uni student when I can't even understand the words used in some of the comments. Does everyone in Uni have this level of intellect? Or should I be reading more articles to brush up on my vocabulary? Please help.

 " If she decides to have sex with other guys, it is because of my fault?" Sad to say, yes. I've a gf who didn't want to have sex before marriage, and I had my own "fun" without her knowing. Granted, guys and girls may be different. However, what you can do is to ask yourself: what's yr principles or values behind choosing to have sex only after marriage. If these cannot be compromised, then you've to tell yr gf, and hopefully she can respect yr  choice. If not, then I'm afraid it's difficult to reconcile fundamental values. Unless you're OK with you remaining virgin while she has sex with others.

It's interesting to see on some mechie shirts,the symbol of a hammer and a spanner. 

It's an interpretation, but these 2 tools actually represent the very different aspects of a mechanical system: form and mechanism. 

For a system to exist, you muse give it a form. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of gears that lay there without framework,material,etc.. This is where welding equipment, hammers,nails, saws,drills, etc. come in.

For the system to work, and perform a function, it must have a mechanism to perform said function. This is where the spanner comes in, along with screwdrivers, wrenches, bolts,nuts etc. Otherwise,it is simply a sculpture that serves no purpose other than as an aesthetic.

It may not be apparent,nor might it matter to a mechie now, but the difference will become more apparent when you do more hands-on work (other than as a pencil pusher).

Yesterday in parliament, PM Lee mooted a series of changes in the political system, including changes to the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament scheme, the Group Representation Constituencies system, and the Elected Presidency. These are Singapore's innovations which are derivatives from the modification of the Westminster parliamentary system. They were initially created to ensure any dissent will have limited power against PAP. 

The NCMP system was to have the "best loser during elections" in parliament to please the opposing electorate, but nonetheless an NCMP has weak voting power in parliament. PM Lee preached for the empowerment of the NCMP.

The GRC system brought about an unnecessarily sizable number of people per constituency. This means the electorate is unable to cast its vote for a particular candidate and has no choice but to accept all the candidates in the GRC, or reject them all entirely. This causes "free-riding." Thus politicians, especially the ones from PAP, who are incompetent, are given a free ticket into parliament if they belong to a GRC with members who are popular. I am happy to hear that PM Lee urged for more SMCs instead of GRCs during the next election. It allows us to distinguish between those who loaf or labor.

And finally the Elected Presidency is caused by the need to have a PAP "Yes Man" to safeguard its vast national reserves in case an irresponsible government comes into power. However the role of President always has limited discretionary power and is mostly a ceremonial role for those loyal to PAP. PM Lee wishes to revise the qualifying criteria for Presidency, perhaps qualifying candidates who are not linked in one way or another to PAP, and one who may represent the minority. This may open doors for the President to have a more active role to exercise his authority to keep the government in check, and ensure the President earns his keep.

PM Lee sees the importance of an alternative voice and a society which plays a more inclusive role in politics. Perhaps this may be the result of a post LKY era. While LKY certainly deserves credit for his contribution, different times call for different types of leaders. When it's time pass the baton, do it. Yep, I am also referring to my group project mate, the self-proclaimed leader who wants to make all the decisions. Hope you are reading this :P

Top 5 uncommon myths debunked:

1) The average number of bacteria in a serving of human faeces is less than the average number of bacteria on the surface of a human lower lip.

2) Drinking 8 glasses of water a day will not lead to kidney failure, but will only increase the frequency of you visiting the toilet.

3) The reason why most babies are born in August is not because November is a good mating season but because couples believe that it increase the chances of them giving birth to virgins (plural for virgo)

4) Breaking down a bigger problem does not lead to smaller and easier problems but a bloody mess.

5) Posting your confessions on NUSwhispers will not lead to you being forgiven or accepted in anyway, go seek a pastor instead.

My personal rules for confronting the allegation of sexist, racist, previleged-ist, whatever ..., and coming out of it with your sanity intact:

Step 1: you being offended is not the ground for me to stop whatever I was doing. Yes the law occasionally prevent me from doing what I want, but that's me submitting to a stronger power; not your petty being offended. "The strong take what they want, the weak suffer what they must". Everyone remember the first half but the second half means that there is no shame in submitting to a stronger power, because I am weaker.

Step 2: Never apologize. You are just showing weakness. They will not accept that apology and instead jump all over you "YOUR APOLOGIES ARE NOT SINCERE! APOLOGIZE SOME MORE!". So no, do not apologize.

Step 3: Never get angry. In fact any emotional response is just giving them ammunition. They will just jump all over you too.

Step 4: remember that in this day and age, increase social media and communication did not lead to understanding and harmony. It instead created even deeper divisions. I remember reading somewhere that say, in the 80s, there were considerable overlap of political attitudes among the Left and Right of most political parties. These days, the left-most of the right-wingers are still right of the right-most of the left-wingers. What happen today is the creation of echo chambers that keep bouncing the same idea over and over again among like-minded people. One camp should not hope to change the minds of the other camp and vice versa. In fact, the biggest outrages and witch hunts are more likely to happen among people who nominally should be in the same camp.

Step 5: make farting noises. Just keep making it until they shut up.

There you got out with your sanity intact. Well, that's kinda rich coming off from a complete psychopath. But really with age catching up, I found myself increasingly incapable to mustering enough energy to give half a toss.

@15643, well you can also move to a country where your race is the majority then.  There are a wealth of countries in SEA where the Chinese do not form a majority. It's not expensive to move there as well. Take your pick.

“FASS privilege”, as an anonymous NUS Whisperer has named it, functions very similarly to white privilege in the United States and Europe, and Chinese privilege on NUS Whispers.

As a FASS undergraduate, I never need to think twice about whether I have the chance of getting a <5 day work week and <5 finals per semester, whether I have enough G points to bid for coveted electives, whether I need to take the BTC bus and shuttle between campuses, whether I'll spend most of my time stuck in labs, whether I'll get project mates who can speak English, or whether I'll be able to interact with enough classmates of the opposite gender to find a mate.

All these things are little aspects of FASS privilege which is very similar to how white privilege functions.

/s <-- just in case

These people are complaining about privileges when in fact they are simply inconvenienced. 
Actual disadvantaged groups are those living in poverty, regardless of race and religion. Those are the people who have less privileges than all the "privileges" raised here.
Social Justice Warriors just want to be seen as the victim of "oppression" when their standards of living are far above those who need financial assistance.
To those out there "fighting oppression", step outside your comfort zone and stop complaining about minor inconveniences. Stop being such a special snowflake. Help those really in need instead of complaining on social media to make yourself feel good.
-
 
Wrt  you can choose to be an FASS student to get those privileges. Nobody is born an engineer out of the womb. I won't deny that fass privilege might exist. Sadly for other forms of privelege(race, parents' income, connections etc.), one cannot access them because they are just not born to the right set of parents. Hope this helps :)

All the privilege threads here indicate that Singapore is slowly being transformed into a Politically Correct culture.
Let’s drop the very useless term of “politically correct,” and give it the term it properly deserves, “value-ideology correctness,” because that is what this is really all about. It’s all about insulating oneself from differing worldviews, as well as a liberal anti-intellectualism. Being offended is a natural part of existence; criticism of your art, age, race, gender, sexuality, or simply your favorite sports team can be a source of offense. It’s our ability to cope with these offenses that defines part of our identity. Do we scream and curse, do we silence and suppress, do we come to blows, or do we defend ourselves with reason and logic? When we hear other opinions on subjects, as varied as music and human rights, that differ from our own, we are forced to assess our own views and defend them. Shouting down, silencing, or even intimidating or assaulting isn’t reasoned and mature. It certainly isn’t how societies are formed, especially ones that are pluralistic in race, beliefs, and values.

To  I don't want to appear callous, but your post stinks. This is NUSWhispers, where among other things, we are free to rant whatever the hell we want related to NUS. Telling us to stop with the childish posts is like going to a rural part of China and telling the people there not to shit on the streets.

Usually the point of people ranting is to let off some steam with regard to some personal affair, so a response is optional since no one really gives two shits. However, you sir included a call to action, telling us to be more mature and appreciate and not to complain. When I saw it, I felt an overwhelming need to be in an argumentative mood and spite you for it.

There are plenty of people who are worse off than you. Does that mean that you shouldn't complain at all because you have to consider their feelings? For example, a Syrian citizen might be feeling terribly anxious right now as he tries to find a country that will accept him as a refugee. You would have no idea what he would do just to be in a safe haven away from ISIS. If he hears of your worries of not getting into uni, which seem trivial compared to his own worries, are feelings of anger and jealousy justified? Of course not, he would probably blame the circumstances which led to this mess in the middle east in the first place; he wouldn't think that a Singaporean had anything to do with his current predicament.

If you think we are being childish, try reflecting on your own thoughts. Are your feelings of resentment justified or are they equally as childish? In the grander scheme of things, isn't any personal worry insignificant?

Tl;dr Rant all you want but don't tell us what to do

I think it's so sad that so many people are getting offended by the 'Chinese privileges' posts, it has never been about minorities versus Chinese, it's has always been about the issues that minorities face in Singapore - or any kind of society where there is a majority population. Sangeetha Thanapal may come off as loud, frustrated and rude, but that's because she comes from a place of frustration. Just because an argument may seem emotionally charged or tactless, does not make an argument any less valid. I am not a Chinese person and I am not angry with Singapore or the majority of the Chinese population. But denying the privileges that EVERY society with a majority ethnicity has is by itself a form of marginalisation. This is not an issue that is of the fault of only the Chinese, this is an issue that occurs in all types of societies. Stop making this an attack on the Chinese people, I love my Chinese people and my CNY songs and I even spent a good amount of time studying Mandarin. This issue is about understanding where minorities come from and the struggles (that may not be intentionally created a population with a majority, but are still struggles nonetheless) that they face. 

And yes I will use this platform to discuss these issues, because this page has got close to 9000 likes, of which many are university students who have the power and potential to make social changes be it now, or the future.
-
 
Yes, technically it is "Chinese privilege" which is an instance of "majority privilege" here. I just feel that the former term emphasises the races, and discussions about it could increase feelings of duality - Chinese vs non-Chinese: Malay, Indian, Eurasian or Others, leading to race-based (verbal/comment) attacks, as opposed to viewing the issue as one which probably has more to do with human nature.

That said, I do not think it's practical to suggest all should  discuss this issue without mentioning the specific races.  Rather, we should strive to be more aware of the underlying causes (of the privilege), the effect of words on our thinking, the measures put in place etc... (I will not say we should focus on our commonalities or I'll sound like a minister. Lol)
-
 
Broaching this topic of Chinese privilege, perhaps we should broaden the issue to problematise the notion of 'race' in Singapore. Perhaps our CMIO racial categories does not help in forming a more Singaporean identity. The disciplining effects of thinking in terms of race (over nationality) begs the question if we would be better off just being identified solely as Singaporean. Afterall the concept of multiracialism is a very different from the concept of multiculturalism. What do you think?
-
 
To whoever the OP is that first asked the question about "Chinese Privilege" here on NUSWhispers, I hope you like the shitstorm you've started here, bringing all the SJWs out of the woodwork. Trolling at its finest, making an incendiary questioning post anonymously and then having real-life commentators duke it out in the open over something that you could have easily read up on Google. 
-
 
I agree that the minority races in Singapore have it much harder in certain respects. However, identifying and defining "Chinese privilege" does little to solve the problem. Thus far, none of the commentators and confessors have given a concrete solution.

The likely reason is: there may not any feasible solution. The easiest solution is affirmative action, especially for education and employment, but affirmative action has its pitfalls too. Take the example of China, where minorities need a lower gaokao (equivalent to the A-levels) score to enter any Chinese university because the minorities were lagging behind in education and employment prospects. While this policy has allowed many minorities to receive tertiary education, this policy equally caused the Chinese to view the minorities as less capable and intelligent. A new stereotype was thus born. 

Another solution is to educate the majority about their privilege. However, this potentially can give rise to another pitfall. Instead of being race blind, a person of the majority race may end up making a decision in favour of a minority out of pity or fear of being labelled as privileged. 
-
 
For those who insist on continually attacking the Singaporean Chinese population for "Chinese Privilege" because of our majority in numbers, I invite you to take a read of this article written in 2014 by Michael Heng. Titled "NO Chinese Privilege in Singapore", this is the best article I can find to rebut the multitudes of horrifically uninformed SJWs who can still profess to be university students with intelligent minds. 

http://miko-wisdom.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/no-chinese-privilege-in-singapore.html

And I find it ironic that the ethnic minorities are kicking up so much fuss about "Chinese Privilege" now that someone has brought up the topic in NUSWhispers when all of us Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion are being screwed over by our own government in favour of cheap foreigners coming here to supplant our positions in the local job industry. Why worry about what privilege your race should be able to entitle you, when your own leaders discriminate against local citizens in terms of labour policies and immigration because they are so eager to lick the balls of foreigners for FDIs? 
-
 
Do all the people posting about Chinese privilege know about what an awful person the person who came up with the concept is? No ad hominem, but her sickening character makes me question whether she was genuine about it or she's just trying to use it to justify her bullying other people.

I find it quite amusing that university students can't tell the difference between race and religion and often conflate the two, even in a secular society such as Singapore. The label "Malay" is not synonymous with "Muslim". It is just as absurd as saying there's a lack of Chinese privileges in X or Y Country because they don't have Buddhist temples, just on the basis of a large majority of Chinese coming from a certain religious domination. The former is the state of one's ancestry and the latter is the state of one's mind.. 

Even being generous to grant you the silly notion that religious issues are racial issues, another thing that I find troubling is the fact that people would belittle this issue by even raising the issue of FOOD (of all things??) Are your perspectives of life really that narrow that you absolutely cannot think of other less-trivial points? 

Not really expecting many to be enlightened enough to understand or debate properly on these topics anyway, but posting this anyhow. Also, P.S. Hari Raya isn't a Malay holiday, it is a religious holiday and stems from Arabia. 
-
 
Hate to break it to you guys but minorities will always be treated worse compared to the majority. This is the rule. At least in Singapore they try their best to put in hard laws to stop racial discrimination as it is. In some countries like Malaysia they even put up blatantly racist laws! Singapore is the closest you'll come to equality of opportunity. This DOES NOT MEAN EQUALITY OF OUTCOME. 

I find it strange that one commentor stated that one shouldn't "count your blessings" when confronted with "Chinese privilege" in Singapore. As far as I know all criticisms toward Singapore are rebutted with a "count your blessings or gtfo" retort. If finding Halal food stalls are so much of a concern, maybe some muslims should consider setting up more stalls to cater to this demand. Or maybe, just maybe, they are all *gasp* setting their sights on more profitable lines of work in Singapore! But how could it bee chinese privilegeeeee waaaaah! Waaaaaah!

-
 
I don't blame people who can't see past "Chinese privilege" or "systematic discrimination". Our Social Studies and National Education drill into us that S'pore is a meritocratic nation, and as compared to M'sia, we're the superior society because we treat everyone equally, regardless of race, lang, religion. To be honest, I didn't question these until I came to uni and attended classes in SSA1202 Singapore Society. Ppl who are more reflective and critical can help society mature, and to correct wrongs. Perhaps we should have compulsory modules for ppl to think and discuss critically abt socio-political issues. I propose mods like:

SSA1202 Singapore Society (so we understand ideology and culture)
SSA2204 Nation Building in Singapore (hist of Sg which is more balanced than our SS/NE shit)
SSA2209 Govt & Politics of Singapore (so we know about our politics properly)
SSS1207 Natural Heritage of Singapore (so we know about our great biodiversity)

Bill does not discriminate based on gender, religion, ideology, creed, skin colour, nationality, race, ethinicity, or language.
Bill just assume everyone is a self-centered, egoistical tosser unless proven otherwise. Bill just hates everyone.
Bill is an asshole.
Be like Bill.
-
 
LOL! I don't get some of you. Chinese privilege clearly exists. And sadly it is what it is. You think we minorities have nothing better to do than do address something like this? We hate it as much as you do. But if there's a problem, then there is a need for awareness in order to bring it to light right? So what are some of you grumbling about? Face it. You will never be able to experience what minorities go through. So instead of telling us that we don't have as bad ( which is probably the most stupidest thing I've heard) it would be best to actually look at our point of view in OUR shoes. Or at least try to, to gain a better understanding. And if you still think that something like Chinese privilege doesn't need to be addressed or it isn't a 'big' deal like we make it out to be, it just says a lot about you. Not me.

I was from a Chinese school and I kinda learnt about the value of service and how I'm not as important as the majority yada yada. There were a few cases of sexual misconduct (like girls getting molested and whatnot) and the girls were always forced to transfer to other schools. Our ex-principal also just got sent to prison. 

Now that I'm in university I have self-esteem and self-confidence issues and I can't talk to guys, which is a serious issue cause I'm in engineering.

Also, one of the seniors from my school who stalked other female seniors from his year frequently posts on NUS confessions and from his posts I feel he's really really weird. He doesn't argue really well and his comments are generally about how liberal he is or on sexual topics. Creep level 9999, 11/10 would stay away. 

Welp, I'm glad I didn't make too many friends while in JC.

Stop with the Chinese privilege or whatever privilege posts. The page is becoming more like Tumblr with so many Social Justice Warriors. If you have so much issues to raise about privileges just go back to Tumblr. I bet most of you are from middle income families who can afford education so stop with the ranting.

I'm a Chinese female. Shedding some light that Chinese too can face racism (although I must admit it's FAR LESSER than what our other counterparts face)
 I was on a public bus alone and got called out by an Indian family. Pretty young parents, 2 kids who looked like they were in lower primary. And it wasn't because I was sitting on the elderly reserved seat or anything..... The parents said somethings hurtful in English (regarding my race, and specifically about me and not other Chinese on the bus(?!!!)) then continued their sentence in Tamil.

There are bad apples everywhere, let's just live and let live :-) happy Sunday! 

(I was really offended but I didn't do anything not because I was scared, but I don't see the need to pick up a fight)
-
 
In response to  and some of the comments that were made...

Discrimination and privilege can be either explicit or subtle. Just because there is no explicit discrimination/privilege that you can see doesn't mean that NO discrimination happens at all, even in the most subtle ways. In fact, it is actually the subtle cases of privilege and discrimination that are the most powerful. Because it is masked by official declarations of equality. Because nobody realises it and everyone thinks it's o.k. When people start assuming that certain things are natural, and stop questioning, that's where the danger lies.

Secondly, if you are Chinese, please don't say that there is no Chinese privilege over the other races. The ones who can see the privilege the clearest are the ones who don't have that privilege and can actually feel the effects of that inequality. Privileged people don't realise it. It's what privilege is.

A Chinese saying there is no privilege is like a white person saying there is no white privilege to a black person. Which is like a female saying that females don't have any privilege over males their age who have to serve NS. And that if an NSman feels disadvantaged in employment or something, maybe it's a problem with his competence because Singapore is a fair and equal society where the law states that there should be no discrimination. How about that? 

I'm Chinese and didn't serve NS. *Even if* I don't know whether I'm really privileged or not, rational thinking would tell me that I shouldn't make sweeping assumptions that other people are in no way disadvantaged, or that their problems are not so bad. Because I'm not them. Keep an open mind and listen to other people's views.

Han nah han nah, everytime a path is perceived to be harder for non-Chinese to traverse, yall say "Chinese privilege". Give yall too much then yall say "reverse discrimination". No matter what also wrong. Cina babi la hor.

To the philosophy student, or religious person, or whoever OP  claims himself to be. I hope you are aware that atheists do not appreciate our stance to be wilfully distorted. Or for our statements to be taken out of context.

It is clear that between a choice regarding faith vs reason (which was what was being argued), an atheist would choose pure reason. But that does not mean you can cherry-pick this statement to take it to mean that atheism is based solely on reason.

In your attempt to discredit atheism, please try not to make a fool of yourself

To  

Kierkegaard probably wouldn't think that knowledge through the divine, as in Abraham's case, would be what is considered as a justified true belief. He does mention at various points the need to abandon the universal/rational in order for one to make that figurative "leap of faith". So Kierkegaard does in fact think that religion is purely irrational. He would deny that religion should be or is rational at all. To him, a religion that is rational would no longer be rational at all. 

Also, just because a philosopher says something doesn't mean he is correct. Just by pointing out and asking people to "read Kierkegaard" does not in any way support your argument/opinion. In that case, I can refute by asking you to read Nietzsche. 
-
 
The first commenter on  struck me as disturbed. Are we now living in the age of callously belittling or even justifying racial attacks on sole the basis that the victim is of a race that allegedly enjoys a racial privilege?

I believed we could do better, that reducing discrimination suffered by the minority races is superior to condoning violence inflicted on the oblivious majority. It is harrowing that many are choosing the latter.

Ive learnt boxing, tae kwon do, wu shu, judo and wing chun.

For those of you wondering which is better for practical uses, my answer is, all of them are.

Each form of martial arts have very different fundamentals behind it's applications. so if you apply them correctly and in the right situations, any form of martial arts are viable and practical. Only difference is, how effective is it given the fight scenario that has been presented to you. 

And to one of the writers who mentioned that in a fight, its a messy situation and you lose your cool. You are totally right if you are an amateur. If you have been fighting for as long as i am, you'll eventually learn how to keep your cool, focus on your opponent(s) and take them down effectively and efficiently. 

But for the general population who are thrown into a fight situation, most people will fear getting hit and instinctively try to avoid hits completely by moving back. And as far as im concerned, there is not one martial arts whose foundations lie in retreating back wards consistently. So just keep your cool, and face your opponent, and apply what you have learnt from your martial arts class.

 Please, we all know that Chinese privilege is present in Singapore. Regardless of how much better the minority races are treated in singapore compares to our neighbouring countries, we should always aim to continue to make Singapore a fairer place, a place where each race feel more equal than the day before instead of telling them to go back, to leave.. It's kind of like the rich having the responsibility to contribute back to society to ensure that the poor have enough using the tax framework. 

FYI I'm a Chinese and I'm sorry that my fellow Chinese Singaporeans have said all the mean stuff to the minority without having to experience a life as a minority in Singapore. Im sure that the silent majority of the chinese would mot agree to these mean comments. If given the opportunity, I would try my utmost to equalize all opportunities in Singapore.

 Read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Also read Kierkegaard as well. Apparently the NUS Atheist don't know that pure reason cannot justify our knowing.

Time and time again, people have fed me the myth. It goes something like, "all it takes is a few weeks/months of hard work, and then you can do anything you want after your exams". I'm most definitely not the only one out there who has lived like this.

But there came a day when I realised how wrong that was. With every of your latest accomplishments, there is an associated rise in society's expectations of you. Using your superior grades/GPAs/external involvements that you only planned to work on for a brief period of time for your portfolio, you apply for something exclusive and coveted. And like all deserving candidates, you get it. 

But it is only then, in the midst of your champagne and celebrations that you realise that the organisation/company/boss now benchmarks you against the toughest few months you spent wrecking your health and sanity to get through. What's worse is if you had bottled all of it up like I did and your friends assumed you had taken it in your stride. And now the torture you thought was to be confined to those few months becomes the torture you need to endure for a lifetime or at least, for the duration of your career, unless you're willing to chart a new career course.

So nowadays, I ask myself. Am I going to be able to work as hard as I am currently doing, and not just for a month or 2, but for years on end, or perhaps even for as long as I plan to work? If no, then I wouldn't be as inclined to burn myself out for it. Sure, all the glamour and glory won't follow, and my growth (yes, I did learn much from my experiences) wouldn't be as rapid, but I can put down my work and listen to my friends. I can stop on my trip home to give a stranger a helping hand. I can finally appreciate the world around me.

People say the only easy day was yesterday. I say, today is only tougher because you spoilt your own market yesterday and people want more from you now.

Why do you need to care whose fault the "chinese privilege" is. Bottom line is that it exists. It's just not blatant like Malaysian policies but if you are a minority you know its there. 

And even as a minority I agree it is inevitable and it is human nature. Look at the past few centuries and there have been many such minority-majority animosities. 

I believe tolerance is not the answer. Tolerance still has that "ok i dont like it but i will just live with it" vibe. The answer is acceptance, which is I guess very much an ideal rather than something that is achievable.

This is rather off, I know, but I just want to share a TED video why you should never ever donate to charity that goes to help in war zones.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gWdTQ84IEM

In short, the richest, the people who perpetuated the war benefited the most from the aid money. If that money did not help the war continued in the first place.
That is why I am such a cynical person.
-
 
Yes, it's most definitely not the fault of the Chinese that they are the majority race here. And yes, some decisions would be made to cater to the majority. But people or Singaporeans rather need to remember that there are 4 MAJOR races here as well, regardless of the composition. We all need to be treated equally and Chinese privilege has gotten in the way of that. Sometimes I feel we didn't have to learn our respective mother tongues...
-
 
 I think its strange that people try so hard to call out against Chinese in Singapore. Yes, Chinese interests do seem to take a bigger slice of the pie in Singapore society. But its natural since Chinese are the majority. Too bad. But don't act as if you have it so bad. In Singapore the minority races are treated better compared to their counterparts in other nearby countries.  If you want privilege tied to your race you should look overseas to those said countries. What's stopping you from leaving?

To , I am a Christian but I have similar experience. I had some doubts with some doctrines of the Church a few years ago, but my parents' answers were never satisfactory. It doesn't help that my parish priest's answers were dogmatic. I stopped going to mass and even went to a church of other Christian denomination.

A chain of events led me back to the Church and I decided to learn more about the faith. This time, I was more open and willing to listen to the explanations of the teachings that I questioned before. I also tried to practice my religion more seriously. With God's grace, I met some new friends that helped me to re-discover my faith. In this period of time, through the Church and its sacraments, I truly experienced God's tender love and mercy. I clarified most (if not all) of my doubts and I dare to say that my faith has matured over the past few years.

I believe it is perfectly fine to question one's faith. There is a Latin saying which basically means: faith seeks understanding. It is natural for any thinking person to question his/her faith. Without reason, faith is a blind faith. One must, however, be open to compelling arguments. Sometimes, the truth is not something that we like and we might be tempted to deny it. Don't be afraid to ask questions and ask the right people (someone who knows the faith well and is willing to help you and walk together with you in the journey of faith). And lastly, try to do the commandments of your religion. There is more to faith than pure reason. It is experiential and therefore unless one is willing to practice it, one can never fully understand it. Hope this may inspire you to re-discover your faith. I wish you all the best :)

In response to 
Hi, yes I do share the same sentiments as you. There are times when I have questions about the religion but I do ask them to my family members. However, they won't respond negatively and instead just brush it off since they themselves aren't too sure. If you really do want proper answers, approach the more knowledgeable people such as the ustaz and ustazah from any mosque. You could try read Islamic books or go for religious classes, there's one which is free of charge! The people there are super friendly and you could even WhatsApp the ustaz your questions, he will not judge you nor criticise you. This ustaz do handle  some delinquents who are supposedly Muslims but were never brought up as one. If you really want to find answers to your questions and doubts, you have to put in the effort! If there's a will there's a way! I wish to apologise in behalf of the other Muslims who have wrongfully judged you. We definitely do not have the right to do so.  These doubts that you have regarding the religion now could be just a phase. If you need more information, I can gladly help you :)

Regarding to Chinese Martial Arts, I personally think it is worthless in combating. All the fancy movements are only for on-stage performances which cannot use in practical fight. So when I see a Shifu teaching his disciples how to kick and punch in Taolu, deep inside my heart, I think he is a liar and cheater, and the students are fools.
 
Don't tell me practice Martial Arts build up your body and your mind. All other practical fighting Martial Arts, like Muai Thai etc and even CCA sports can do the same. 

SO what is the point of having Chinese Martial Arts when it can be substituted by others easily?

I am looking for insightful opinions from Wushu seniors or Jiao lian.

To an increasing number of posts about sex coming from girls: 

Recently there have been quite a few girls(or posts) talking about sexuality and their sex life. While I am completely ok with anyone's personal choice regarding his/her body, I just want to share a bit of the other side of the debate. 

I am personally an advocate for abstinence before marriage. And I guess for me the most important reason for that is not some Asian conservative view or consideration for guys'-possible-obsession-with-virgins crap. What I do think is important, though, is that the various kinds of risk that come with sex almost certainly lie on the girls. For example, although the burden of having protection lies on the guy (normally), the possible consequence of failure of protection 1) STDs can have more adverse impacts/greater susceptibility on girls due to their biological vulnerability (thinner lining of vagina etc), such as deterioration of one's reproductive system 2) unwanted pregnancy, which, for obvious reasons, is detrimental in every way to girls. Of course one would say that all these exist even after marriage, but I think that sex before marriage is just much more uncertain due to the low level of commitment in general. 

I mean these may all sound cliche (and that I sound like some gender education teacher), but they are just so real and for girls there is so much at stake. Judgments from others as compared to all these real risks can just go screw themselves. Take care everyone!

To  'Alternative' opinions on issues also has its limits. You wouldn't give any attention to a flat-earther or a young earth creationist because they are just categorically wrong. You can be out-of-the-box but not out-of-your-mind. If you have a differing opinion that's a good thing, but be prepared to defend it. Alternative explanations or opinions are only as good as they can be defended.

I was raised as a muslim, but gradually grew disillusioned with my faith, long story short. Questions I raised about my faith were always brushed aside by parents and frowned upon by my more religious muslim friends, who were quick to admonish me for being disrespectful / questioning the will of Allah. It gradually grew to a point where I really wanted to renounce islam, but lack of knowledge on the proper procedures, and (especially) worry of the backlash from friends and family alike has stopped me from doing so. Anyone here has had the same experience, and how have you managed to cope with it?

Some people like to say that unmarried people (in particular women in their late thirties) will end up with some "odd" psychology/behaviour. Not sure how many of you all heard about this already. How true is this statement? Why do some people pass this kind of judgement, which i think is kinda unfair? What makes them come to such conclusion?

Regarding post , i would like to say something. I am a girl and i was told by my mum that i should not let any of my friends know that i have the intention to do a phD, if i could. She said reason being that i never had a boyfriend before (and never intended to have anyway) and society will still frown upon ladies who are highly educated but yet are single, for instance by calling them old hag etc (labelling these women i would say). 

I must say i get very annoyed when i hear this. Is it because my mum was still in the traditional mindet? Or is it really true that society in general DOES label highly educated women in a nasty way? Eg does society still don't really approve women not marrying? Please be honest with me, i really wish to know what exactly people nowadays think...

Why is there a forest in the middle of singapore? why does Bukit Timah nature reserve have to lie in the heart of singapore? who designed it this way? why must it lie in the middle so that everyone have to go one big round to get to the other side? why can't they place it in one corner of singapore of all places? why must it bring about so much inconvenience when traveling when they could have set aside a piece of land at the corner of singapore from the beginning? whose idea is this anyway?

Anyone approached by people claiming to be ex-convicts who part of a charity organization @ Kent Ridge MRT?

Not sure if they're legitimate but their "sorry hope you don't mind that I'm an ex-convict" phrase seems like a red flag to me. 

I was approached by them months ago and now there are three of them today.

In response to 

I wish I has been born a boy. They have so much more privileges in so many respects.

They can joke about anything, and people always dismiss it as boys being boys. They can be vulgar and that's deemed acceptable; while vulgar girls are frowned upon, and told to "be a lady". If a guy cries about a situation, he's sensitive. If a woman cries, she's being emotional, overreacting or it's her "time of the month".

A woman must be careful who she marries. Within this current set of societal expectations, she may very likely and easily meet someone who expects her to maintain the household and do her chores, maybe even bring up the children full-time. Otherwise, she's not a dutiful wife and a bad mother. If she wants to be a career woman, that's fine too, but she'll be expected to do more than an equal share of the housework and child-rearing, or perhaps almost all of it. But a man who leaves the working world and opts to manage a household is said to be noble and exemplary, when there are women doing that everyday.

Women can have close, intimate relationships with their female friends, but bystanders will be waiting for the drama associated with a fallout. If 2 men share a close relationship with each other, people respect the brotherhood and loyalty between them without doubting the genuineness of their friendship.

Women are basically treated on the same level as children. People are quick to question their autonomy and independence. Men are allowed to be forward with women, and if the woman in question feels harassed or threatened, she just doesn't know better or is being overly sensitive. Men who drink at a party won't have to worry much, since the worst that they can expect would be having someone steal their wallet, rather than being physically and mentally taken advantaged of in a most intimate and terrifying manner. At work, men are paid for their share of work and are judged more for their ability than their appearance. Their marital status or whether they have children are not issues that would hinder their career prospects. Aggressive men are not "bossy"; rude men are just rude, not compared to an animal.

Men can easily do physically demanding tasks without having to ask for help, simply because biology favours them in terms of physical strength, so they don't have to feel dependent on others even for straightforward tasks.

Women can wear jeans and a shirt - and get judged for not making the effort. Or they can wear a skirt with lacy frills, and get judged for trying too hard, or simply be judged based on the length of her skirt. Men can walk with small children, or sit alone on a park bench at any time of the day and night, with lesser worry for their personal safety or that of their male companions. They don't get asked to travel in groups "because you're a girl".

Violence against women never seem to stop, domestically or in the private sphere. People get away with treating women unequally, at work or basically from the moment they are born. (Fun fact: the quota for female medical students at NUS was only abolished in 2003) Women often work the same jobs, with lesser pay and sometimes, lesser recognition for their work. (Luckily, there are people who, in your words, "give a shit" about this)

Men or women with an obscure hobby today don't have to die alone, since the internet can help connect many people with the same interest anyway, no matter how obscure. 

I wish I had been born a boy. 
(Okay but not really, I'm happy with who I am as a person - just making a point)

In short, no one should enjoy sexism. There's always 2 sides to a coin. We're all victims and no one wins. Sexism and stereotypes hurts us all. With them, we can never freely be the person we want to be.

P.S. I'm aware of the many stereotypes and sweeping statements made, and I apologise for them, but omitting these would lose the point of the parody.

 true. Everyone else who travels alone mus the lonely, depressed and who deserved your companion praises, and you acting as a wingman protecting your darling from any comebacks :))). People who travel alone must have real low self confidence, they need more healthy support to join the rest of the society. Oh god, I fear for their future because of the inability to even find a companion.

I wish I had been born a girl. They get so much leniency in so many respects.

They can cry about anything, and people always just accept it. If a man cries about a situation, nobody feels sorry for him; they just make fun of him for showing weakness, and then they tell him to "man up".

A woman can marry a man with money, and basically skate by his income. If she wants to be a housewife, it's fine. If she wants to be a career woman, that's fine too. But a man who leaves the working world and opts to manage a household is said to be "abandoning his responsibilities" or some shit.

Women can have close, intimate relationships with their female friends without homosexual connotations. If two men spend a lot of time together and talk about their feelings, people call them faggots. When two women do the same thing, they literally call each other "girlfriends" and there's no homosexual connotations whatsoever.

Women are basically treated on the same level as children, until it's inconvenient for them. An irate woman slaps a man multiple times and he is expected to take it, because slapping a woman is forbidden no matter how stupid she acts, which implies that women do not have the same control over their impulses as men. The same can be said of children. Women who drink at a party suddenly lose legal responsibility for themselves, and it becomes up to the man to assume temporary custody of her personhood. A man who tries to shirk responsibility in the same manner is told to "man up". Of course, we forget those strange implications when a woman wants to manage a department, or start a small business. In short, women enjoy sexism when it is convenient for them, and rant about it when it isn't, and they get away with it constantly.

If a woman cannot do something that is physically demanding, nobody berates her for it. If a man cannot, say, open a pickle jar, the world mocks his very identity as a man.

Women can wear jeans and a shirt, or they can wear a skirt with lacy frills. They can teach small children, or sit on a park bench in the middle of the day, without looking like a suspicious pedophile to the rest of the world.

Civil rights violations against men go completely ignored, save a few groups that are already stigmatized. Men often work harder jobs, in worse conditions, with less time off, and for those reasons they die earlier than women, but nobody gives a shit. When girls have their genitals mutilated, we call it barbaric; when boys have their genitals mutilated, we call it religion.

A woman can have a laundry list of issues, and still have men knocking on her door; a man with an obscure hobby dies alone.

I wish I had been born a girl.

Why is it that so many Chinese women love to act like bananas these days. They worship ang mohs. I guess pinkerton syndrome still exists among the women. Once they hang out with ang mohs, they think its a big deal and they are so arrogant. Do you see Chinese men behaving like this? No what, so why can't you just be yourself? While staying on topic, what's this obsession with wanting to look like a Korean or a Jap? You guys look awful with that much of make up and ridiculous attire! Do you see Koreans and Japanese wanting to be Chinese? No! So why can't you appreciate your own culture?? and be YOURSELF!  I've seen so many women in NUS behaving like this and its just so sad to see. In short you're embarrassed of your culture

There are 16 Muslim countries that have officially banned anyone holding an Israeli passport from entering not only for security reasons but for reasons of hatred of the Jewish nation. There has never ever been an international outcry about this bigotry. Donald Trump makes a comment saying Muslims should be banned from the USA until the government works out what the hell is going on and the world is outraged.

Political correctness gone nuts.

I've read a lot on guys and gals doing very technical, very statistical analysis of situations of their life: like how never getting married and only have ONS and paid sex is technically more economical than marrying a wife and starting a family. Or having a 10k/month earning bf/husband is technically better than a 3k/month earning one. Or guys assigning score from 1 to 10 for a girl's worth. Now, first, whatever float your boats, mates. But just my two cents:

a) are you sure that your numbers are worthy to begin with. this can be interpreted as a sideways snide at the "drive for efficiency" so prevalent in Singapore today, but numbers are deceptive for many reasons. Say the very commonly used GDP. GDP is deceptive because every time money changes hands, it contribute towards GDP. So a person gorging himself on food, then pay expensive trainers and gym, then suffer a cardiac attack, then undergo 3 bypass surgeries is technically a GDP-hero while a frugal living, but healthy person is not. A stay-at-home mom wrecks GDP because she is not employed, has less need for childcare, FnB services than a working mother. 

b) market efficiency is not everything. From my favourite author Edward Luttwak (you really should check this guy out, there are a bunch of videos on youtube. He can be a very polarizing figure. To start, just google this "Give war a chance, Edward Luttwak): "I believe that one ought to have only as much market efficiency as one needs, because everything that we value in human life is within the realm of inefficiency—love, family, attachment, community, culture, old habits, comfortable old shoes."

I read XiaoMei's posts (and other similar ones) and I could already imagine all the flames and keyboard warriors furiously typing against her views (oh dear all the "conservatives" be fainting). 

I have no qualms as to how she lead her life or her sexual pursuits, for the fact that I am atheistic. If she does not inflict harm on anybody, including herself, there is really nothing wrong with that. In fact, I would support her independent and liberal views since she is happy about it.

Some people have to really stop bashing her and many other liberal thinkers. There is neither a need to slut-shame with your own "religious" or conservative views, nor should she have an immense urgency to get herself checked. Due STD protection and regular check-ups (if there are many sexual partners) should be already on her mind IF she is responsible.

And those who bash her hard, please you guys are major nerds lol, let others live their own colorful lives and bother about yourself. With such a closed mentality, and a fervent abhorrence about sexual issues and what-nots, good luck finding a mate. Having sexual desires and fantasies and fulfilling it are probably some lifetime enjoyment that you couldn't get.

From a man who discovered his wondrous junk at age 6, has been very responsible getting laid, has been critically thinking about romantic pursuits and women's feelings and desires, has been observing and applauding the various wonders of women with different sexual vibes, has been supporting women who get double standards from the 1.29 low birthrate population and lol-ing hard at awkward, self-centred people (probably couldn't get laid) who writes harsh comments online to make others feel bad on themselves.

TLDR: Supporting XiaoMei for her early sexual discovery and being very adventurous about it, and calling those who vehemently cry out loud online
NERDSSSS

I've been reading lots of things of people complaining whether something is "right", or "wrong", "the rights to do this or that", etc ... I have a fundamentally different view. Perhaps it's because I am a very cynical, opportunistic, and dictator aspiring that I hold these views. But in short, I believe people have fundamentally forgot what it really means in those discussions: what matter isn't whether you are right, but rather whether you have power.

Let me take a simple example: some time early last year, there was a historical decision in US where same-sex marriage was ruled to be legal. I just want to talk about the reactions of some Singaporeans here: they disapproved of the decision, not because they were fundamentally against same-sex marriage, but rather because the decision is proof that "advocate groups being loud enough to affect society, and this can potentially allow and embolden other groups to do the same, creating change". Seriously mates? Let me put it this way: the same-sex marriage advocacy groups put in the effort to fight and change public opinion. Their victory is just because they had power, they used their power skillfully enough to impose their will on the rest of us. You did not win because either a) you had less power, b) you did not use your power skillfully enough, c) the people's opinion of you lot are waning, thus even reduce your power further, and d) perhaps you are the dying breed, best to go quietly. If you disagree, feel free to fight back however you want; but beware of the opposition. The proof that they can change history should be viewed not as a threat, but rather the opportunity to act and use your own. If you do nothing, and lose, you deserve it. But in any case, you should remember this line "The strong take, the weak suffer what they must". The second part in that saying means there is no shame in surrendering and submitting to a stronger power.

All your "rights" and "justice" in the world is just another manifestation of power: you need force to enforce that. You can have all the rights and entitlement in the world on your land, but you still need a police force, and a court to protect that. Without the former, I might just roll over to your house with a shotgun to take what's yours. If you also have a shotgun, what stop me from bringing 10?  Oh and you are forming your own militia group? Well, you are exercising power.

One last thing that irks me: people whine because something they did in their past come back and bit them in the ass. Typically in the forms of because others know what you do, you have a lower standing and it ruins your relationship. They whine because "I have the rights to do such and such, so need to accept it, blah blah". No. One's own demise is always one's own making. You are correct, you have the rights to do a or b; but others also have the rights to judge you. And their judgement can totally make others judge them in turns. It's a free-for-all exchange of power and influences. You have the rights to hide your past, but also the responsibility to face the music when it is exposed; people have the right to be doubly pissed because of what you did, and the fact that you hide it.

Friedrich Nietzsche's work basically expressed the same sentiments: all the morality, rights, and justice are just human values created by humans. Where we differ is our conclusion. Nietzsche concluded that we need to be ruled by our betters, "ubermensch" or "superman". My conclusion is the world should be a free-for-all contest for power. That does not mean it has to be chaotic, destruction, and despair. You can use power to impose peace, shoot the dissidents, and bring order to the world.

Dear NUS Students, I would like to remind you that the world is full of assholes. Some are bleached. Some are waxed. Some wear Yale-NUS t-shirts. Some also wear NUS t-shirts. That doesn't mean that all Yale-NUS and NUS students are assholes (as some people from both parties have given us enough reason believe). I would also remind you that people like to bitch about anything and everything, and sometimes they'll bitch about things that you hold dear, like Singapore. Anyone who has ever bitched knows that most of the time you don't REALLY mean what you say, it's just a way to vent. Singapore is a very difficult place for some people to adapt to, and no amount of warnings on blogs will let you know how difficult until you get here. People are going to bitch, get over it. It's not a personal insult on you, nor your family nor your cow. If it IS too much, they WILL leave, but if not then they get used to it eventually. And for the love of sanity, whenever an asshole happens to come from Yale-NUS, don't put us all into that box. Furthermore, I would like to address this "Ivory Tower" thing once and for all: the world runs on money. If you pay more money you get more things. NUS Business fees: $9 000 (local) $18 000 (international). Yale-NUS fees: $18 000 (local) $36 000 (international). And be mindful that we're not some prissy rich trust fund kids who can easily pay this. Many of us have astonishingly high loans, or wouldn't have been able to go to ANY uni without a scholarship (like myself). If you came to uni to be coddled into believing that money doesn't separate people, then you'll be sorely disappointed for the remainder of your years.

@ 'Even in today's society, just because a woman has multiple fwbs doesn't mean that she is loose! Girls like me have a strict set of standards/criteria when accepting fwbs'

Even in today's society, just because i discriminate against others doesn't mean i am a racist and bigot. People like me have a strict set of standards/criteria when discriminating.

Even in today's society, just because i murder some people doesn't mean i am a bad person. People like me have a strict set of standards/criteria when choosing targets.

^may be a bad example, but the purpose is to show how ridiculous your logic is. Have you ever tried googling the definition of loose? Google says it means promiscuous, which is exactly who you are. I have no problem with what you do with yourself(it is your body and you have free will after all), but i have a problem when you start blaming the consequences of your actions on your 'perceived patriarchy'

I conducted a simple social experiment with local girls.

To one group, I spoke in singlish 

To another, I spoke proper English but with a Singaporean accent

And to the last, I spoke with an AMDK accent

I had never met any of these girls before and the content of my conversation was more or less the same and I dressed the same too. 

When I spoke in singlish, only a small minority were friendly. 

Proper English with Singaporean accent, an even larger number of girls were friendly. 

AMDK accent, an overwhelming majority were shy and seemed attracted. They tried to keep the conversation going and most tried to fake an AMDK accent as well

 Both do not preach God.

Taoism is concern with living with the unspoken Tao to attain Te. There is no saviour. You need to practice living with the natural flow of things. Most of the taoist lived like a hermit.

Buddha's teaching seek the middle path between asceticism and indulgence. He also goes around teaching the Dharma. But it is not about evangelizing. He was trying to teach people what he learned about suffering and how people can escape the samsara. Meister Eckhart is close to Mahāyāna Buddhism (another branch).

There is so much to learn from History. Atheists who refuse to read and learn about religion is missing out on the richness of thoughts from the past.

It's people like you who are ruining the efforts of feminists like emma watson, by burning bridges, instead of getting males to help achieve meaningful progress.

On a recent trip to Vietnam, I noticed that the people there also said "aiyah!" when they tripped over something, or when they are in mild distress. I always thought it was a local/Chinese thing to do，saying "aiyoh" (哎哟) or "aiyah" (哎呀). So I started to wonder how international this form of exclamation is. Is it just a Chinese thing, or an Asian thing? I vaguely heard a westerner say something like "aieshyoyo" when he tripped over something, although I'm unsure if it was just his personal idiosyncrasy or part of an established culture. Could friends from around the world comment please

 I would like to ask how would you date someone? (i mean be in a relationship with)

Would you:

1) Choose someone whom you know is a Christian (may be from church, or a friend whom you know is a believer)
2) Confess and if it works out, take the person to church (i've heard several incidences like this) and what if it doesn't work out? End the relationship? I believe that would be quite selfish
3) Ask the person to church to be a believer first. That sounds rather awkward though, unless one had no intention and the attraction came later.  

I don't have a problem with 1, but I believe some problems can arise in 2. What about possible family conflicts? I had a friend who is a believer and confessed to a non-believer (accepted). His family who were believers, were firmly against it unless his girlfriend began a relationship with God. He resisted for several months, before it broke down (he relented to his parents). I do such things as particularly sad though

There are many guys who go to church to chase girls (mentioned jokingly by a pastor whose service I was invited to). Although it was more for a joke (guys go church to chase long hair, and they find long hair, in Jesus). But what would you think of the intentions, etc?

What is your take on 1 Corinthians 7:13-16? 

That being said, I think it's a matter of choice to each individual under conditions of 1. It's far more messy that it can be. I believe some would deem a interfaith-relationship or a believer-nonbeliever relationship to be sinful. Again this is a large concern considering the application of "moralization". I left church when i was 15 because of the incessant preaching of "morals" and poor relations with others.

 I totally agree with what OP has said about accepting the other party's past, but just to add, I think it's equally important that the other party be honest as well. Once in a while, I see posts asking if they should be honest  to their partner/SO/date about some of the "not so nice" things and responses have been mixed. I hope you guys realise that honesty is still and always the best policy for the following reasons.
(1) How far do you seriously expect any r/s to subsist without honesty and hence trust? If you can't understand this, perhaps you aren't ready for a r/s.
(2) People always say it's best that we be honest today than when they find things out for themselves in the future. That way, hurt is minimised. Isn't that true? If you seriously think that people are never ever going to find out and chances are zero, that is extremely stupid.
(3) Honesty isn't just about practical implications like (1) and (2). It's also about respect that ought to be given to others, especially more so if he or she respects you in the same way. It says a lot about how about much you care or value other people, sometimes in contrast to yourself. Does the other party not deserve something as simple as your respect?

Trust isn't easily regained once lost and every single time you decide to lie or more generally not be genuine in the course of the r/s, you are further endangering the r/s. To a certain extent, they apply to friendships as well. If the people in question do really matter to you, think twice.

 hey I'm the OP for . Have you considered taking exams alone? Might help a little. For the medicines, I can't advice much, it's rather dependent on individuals in terms of the effectiveness. I had Prozac but I began to be very alert (can't fall asleep). As a person who doesn't get to sleep before 3-4 a.m, it simply means I don't need to sleep.

Been reading the stories on difficulties faced by couples with different religions, and I just find it ridiculous whenever a christian (or muslim for that matter) bf/gf requests his or her partner to convert. No offense, but this is really a legit question from me: what has your spiritual beliefs got to do with a relationship? It's like saying I like truffle fries, so if we get together you also must like truffle fries (even though I agree it's hard to NOT like truffle fries LOL). Shouldn't it suffice as long as both parties truly love each other? Need to be so hardline meh, cannot just close one eye ah? And besides, it is not really a core requirement for a relationship to work what, so why place such emphasis on it? Shouldn't one be more concerned about more important things to have, such as communication and trust? So why place religion on a pedestal? Once again, these are really just questions from someone who wants to hear the other side of the story, sorry if anyone feels offended.

TLDR: IMO got religion is ok, but why must bring it into an r/s when it is not relevant?

 I noticed that there are alot of PAP supporters in NUS. All of my friends voted for PAP except for me. But I didn't tell them who I voted for opposition because I want them to believe that I am a PAP supporter so that I can observe their thinking like in 无间道. They still think that I am a PAP supporter.

In response to , I was in the same boat as you 2 years ago... My ex-boyfriend was the son of a pastor, and he kept me as a secret from his parents for the entire 6 years we were together, because he didn't want to disappoint them. Throughout the relationship, he kept persuading me to convert, getting disgusted and irritated whenever I go to the temple during Vesak Day, and kept inviting me to church. Most Christians believe that marriage has to be between two Christians, and I believe in the Bible, it's encouraged too. This is to prevent conflict between spouses, as well as to ensure that followers do not leave the religion due to pressure from the non-Christian spouse. God's love comes first and foremost, love for your partner always comes second. It's like that. So I urge you to find someone who isn't so religious. Because to Christians, God is always number 1. You aren't as important as his brothers and sisters of Christ, you aren't as important as Christ himself, you aren't as important as God. You'll always feel lesser when you're with a Christian. God will always be the lightbulb/cockblocker in your relationship with him when obviously a relationship should be between 2 people. Unless he loves you enough to accept your beliefs entirely and forsake his own, just leave him. You deserve better.

Y'all NUS students need use the words 'little', 'less', 'lesser' and 'fewer' correctly. There have been too many grammatical mistakes occurring in the confessions and comments and I find this situation shameful to say the least.

We use the word 'few' when the number of things is countable:
"Fewer seniors will be getting their GEMs this semester compared to the last."
"There will be few General Education modules left for seniors to bid."

We use the words 'less' and 'little' for uncountable things. 'Less' is the comparative form of 'little':
"We have little time for these silly games"
"The NUS admin treat the seniors less fairly than they do with the freshies."

When you say "there are little people in the queue" you are literally saying that the people in the queue are small.

The word 'lesser' means of a lower strength, quality or importance. You may have encountered it in the phrases "a lesser man" (a person who is not as moral as someone else) or  perhaps "a lesser demon" (lv70 creature in RuneScape, not as good as a greater demon).

OK I hope we have all learnt some useful grammar. Peace.

I have accumulated a sum of money from my part time jobs during the course of my studies and I want to make it count by making some sort of donation. I am more inclined towards donating to an animal shelter but my friend (he volunteers helping old people clean their homes etc) advised me to donate to the old folks instead as there are a lot of them neglected by society. He also added that animal shelters are better off because many peopel are swayed by the idea helping a cute dog/puppy/kitten/cat. 

Helping humans? Or aiding animals? Any thoughts?

University students (and many other Singapore students) are actually very very capable.

We're expected, by our parents and the government, to do well for studies so that Singapore can have her knowledge based workforce and our parents can stop worrying for our future.

We're expected to handle our relationships well (mostly) so that we can find a good partner and get married and Singapore can boost her birth rate (blahblahblah) and our parents can stop worrying for our future.

We're expected to do community service, which is not a bad thing, and clock in hours (which is a very bad thing) to show that we are, indeed, a society-oriented generation. Or are we?

We're expected to develop ourselves in our areas of interests too, although this might be the one thing we enjoy. That's not enough though, we need to excel in it. We're expected to hold leadership positions and face politics within our friends and peers. Are there that many leadership positions in the first place?

We're young, but the expectations are piled up high.

 “Since procrastination is a message from our natural willpower via low motivation, the cure is changing the environment, or one’s profession, by selecting one in which one does not have to fight one’s impulses. Few can grasp the logical consequence that, instead, one should lead a life in which procrastination is good, as a naturalistic-risk-based form of decision making….Using my ecological reasoning, someone who procrastinates is not irrational; it is his environment that is irrational. And the psychologist or economist calling him irrational is the one who is beyond irrational….In fact we humans are very bad at filtering information, particularly short-term information, and procrastination can be a way for us to filter better, to resist the consequences of jumping on information…”

This is the best understanding of procrastination that I have seen.

 According to "David and Goliath" by Malcom Gladwell, you were previously a big fish in a small pond that has transitioned to being a small fish in a big pond. Do check this out.

http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwells-david-and-goliath-2013-10?IR=T&r=US&IR=T

It's natural and there will always be someone better. But being in NUS, you really already are in the top few percentages compared to others? I suggest you try to transition your mindset. Otherwise, you'll continue to lose confidence in yourself and affect your performance in your studies. Rationally speaking, there really are various reasons why you ought not to question your intelligence. For instance, not everyone thrives under the same environment; doing "well" doesn't always equate to being intelligent; some students might already have had a head start unknown to you; work hard and trust the hard work you've put in etc.

If you really want it badly enough, the last point will carry you very far including confidence wise because you can tell yourself "It doesn't matter if I'm not as good as others today for I will be in time to come" or "If five hours isn't enough, I'll do six."

Gladwell himself suggests that people position themselves in a less competitive environment to prevent losing one's own confidence etc. and hence obtain better results but I beg to differ. Personally, I also wouldn't encourage not comparing oneself to others. I think in general, overcoming challenges will reap the greatest rewards attainable though you might fail to do so. But if you want it badly, I don't see why you should settle for anything less. If you want it badly that is. For some, it's the only option available.

Hey NUS, this is not a confession per se but I was wondering what the general consensus was about Sexual Marketplace Values. I saw this video in a comment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7v04muGzJI&app=desktop ). I was thinking of how shallow the entire thing was. Sure, some of our actions are controlled by our instincts but the video seemed to suggest that we are nothing more than our instinctual urges. What do you all think?

As OP of , I fail to see why all of you are so worked up. I'm stating facts. Put it this way, an average woman can go anywhere and can easily get any desperate guy of her choosing to buy us drinks or satisfy our needs. Most of you men, just go back to your hands every night.

I come from quite a sheltered background. Upper-upper-middle class, top school background, Chinese, English-speaking family. No vices, don't club, don't smoke. Female, so never had to do NS. But I always knew that I am very fortunate to be born in a comfortable environment though I never did anything to deserve it. And I also know that being so comfortable also restricts my worldview and ability to be street smart.

I am doing an internship with a certain organisation now and the people here are from very different backgrounds. I really want to get to know them, but once I open my mouth, they can already sense a barrier because they are mostly Chinese/dialect-speaking. And even when I speak Singlish, my pronunciation of English words gives away my English-speaking, university-educated kind of background. 

I try to interact with people but I find it a bit difficult to relate to the topics they like talking about (this group talks a lot about dirty jokes or relationships). 

But these people know how the organisation works, and they are extremely experienced and street-smart. They know how to get things done, and work around the system while working IN the system. This is something that you cannot acquire no matter how many degrees you have or how highly ranked your school was. I keep an open mind to learn from them, but I feel like they don't really like having me around because I'm not really a fun person to be with because I don't find the same things funny or don't talk about the topics they find entertaining. 

I am quite sad, and everyday after work I try to remember everything I did, wondering if I did something wrong, like if I came across as snobbish or arrogant. I sincerely don't want to be an arrogant person, because I'm a newbie here and I seriously don't know how things work.  

I was thinking maybe I should be a bit more slack in the way I speak Singlish so I fit in, but is that hypocritical? What should I do? 

Some of my guy friends (similar background) said that they felt like that when they did NS, like how our privileged bubble made us sheltered and ignorant. Would you guys have any advice? 

(I'm not complaining about being born in a privileged circle, I am very thankful. I'm just trying to learn what I don't know because of my background!)

Look, you still have at least a semester to go. It is not too late to make new friends, or re-make old ones. Just open up, be confident and be positive. Also, be yourself.

It takes a bit of shamelessness, and foolhardiness, to make new friends. But hey, I call it courage, and confidence. You can say hi to every familiar face you see, and at the very most, if you don’t know a familiar face’s name… “Hi, I see you around very often, but I didn’t catch your name.” There, you have an acquaintance, who can become a friend.

I actually see every person, whom I have said hi to, at least once, as a friend.

Treat others nicely, as you would yourself. Respect them, because, like yourself, they are living, breathing people, who can think, who each have a personality, dislikes and likes. 

This includes the fact that some of us don’t like textbook methods in being a friend – we aren’t commodities, nor are we common rocks by the roadside. Make us count, not count us. Also, look at yourself, drop that “holier than thou, us vs them” attitude.

If you’re a friend for work reasons (this happens a lot in NUS), aside from work, we really have nothing to talk about. If you’re a friend from work reasons, well, that changes things now, doesn’t it?

Friends come and go. You have to accept that. That being said, you should not be so clingy onto friends, nor should you be too much of a downer. No one likes a downer, who would, every single moment, berate his/her fate. “If you’re like that, what does that make me?” is the underlying thought that comes to mind when this happens.

The next part will be a bit harsh.

Define ugly. I cannot define it. You define it. If it’s the looks you have, I will look at your character. If your character is not there, and if you refuse to get up on your own 2 feet, even after we push you, you’re on your own. Trust me on this.

Define beauty. I can define it. Cute, considerate, kind. Etc., but my definition may not be the same as yours. Still, if you’re cute, you have to show that you’re not just a pretty face in the crowd, because things will not work out, even as friends, if you’re just a pretty face. You having a pretty face just makes you more likely a target, and it actually makes people like me extremely nervous around you.

What if… You’re naturally a downer? *Gasp* Nope, it doesn’t work that way. Being positive or negative does not define your character, it is what you do, how you react, that defines it. So do something else other than be a downer.

I'm not expert on friendships, but at the very least, I can tell you what I've learnt.

The amount of time spent lamenting over something, is time wasted that could have been better spent somewhere else, to improve yourself.

All this talk about asking women to make the first move and so on, are just excuses by men who can't get gfs. If you don't even have the balls to approach women, you don't deserve one.

Dear girls/boys,

Pls stop accepting crap from people in the name of love and relationships. Stop making it seem ok for someone to emotionally/physically cheat on you or belittle you. Don't just settle for something  just coz you're afraid of ending up alone. You are beautiful/handsome and you stand for something. You ought to be with someone who knows, loves and respects you for the things that make you you. The more crap you accept from people, the more it's gonna become a norm. So scratch that..it's NOT a guy's thing to act like an ass and it's NOT a girl's thing to be bitchy. Up your standards.

There are many categories of atheists around.
On the left we have those who would insist that other atheists have to live in "harmony" with religion by keeping their heads down.
On the right we have those who fight for the political rights of atheists and the spread of rationality in public
There are those who don't agree with the first group because they have no beef at all with the second group.
And finally there are those who long for the benefits the 2nd group are fighting for but are too lazy to do anything to help. In other words, the Singaporean eye-powered atheists.

Speaking with many of my atheists friends, even recent acquaintances, many would break into laughter when they hear each other's experiences being confronted with missionaries. They are willing to share their disdain for being made to attend church when young. And the only reason why they prefer not to mention religion in daily conversation is because they don't know who exactly is religious.

This leads me to believe that the first group of atheists are not too large in number. Although no actual study among atheists have actually been conducted.

So to , this is what I have to say. The only thing that logically follows from "I'm an atheist" is not "shut up and follow my way of thinking". The only thing that is true is:
I'm an atheist and I don't believe in gods.

Because you don't speak for all of us.

Besides, your claim of ruining the reputation of atheism is ridiculous. To begin with, atheism never had any positive reputation since the dawn of history. Even today it's hard to be elected to political office and to receive the same level of human rights as religions in many countries. Singapore inclusive.

Hi , I just want you to know that you are not alone. My circumstances cannot compare to yours, but I know what it feels like to be surrounded by well-off friends who don't understand what it's like to struggle with money and family problems. Because for them, their normal is your heaven. 

I don't think you are inadequate or missing out on anything. Why? Because the idea of being inadequate, or that you are missing out, assumes that there is this standard that applies to everyone. It's like saying, only the rich life is meaningful. Only those who have gone overseas are capable. Only those who go for extravagant parties are great people. 

This seems to be what society thinks, but I don't think so. Because tenacity, inner strength, empathy and compassion can never be acquired in comfort and wealth. And these are qualities that will enable us to make a difference in the world with the 99%. The rich are at the top, and they are a minority. It seems like a majority to me, because well, university, and the whole education system, tend to privilege the more well-off. The rest of us are struggling and it takes one to know one. It takes one who has gone down that path and lived that life, to be able to lead someone else out of the darkness.

So don't ever think that you are worthless. Because I think it's people like you that can be the voice of those who don't have a voice, who can walk alongside others who are struggling. 

Don't live in the shadow of your parents' mistake, give yourself a fighting chance.

 Yeah I think Eunoia JC is much too complicated a name and too hard to pronounce. Maybe MOE should have given it a simpler name. Something like 1 Sengkang JC might do.

Eunoia JC? What a pretentious name. It might be fine for the name of a house or class, but for a school? The school should have a Singaporean- rooted name to reflect our local culture. Ditto to many schools with names which make no sense here e.g. Horizon Primary, Innova JC etc. After 50 years of nation building we still suffer from an inferiority complex that we are not as good as our colonial masters, even in naming our schools. 

At least NUS named its UTown colleges after indigenous tree species, like Cinnamon and Tembusu. They might not sound as Western as "St Catherine College" or "Churchill College" but they reflect our Singaporean and Southeast Asian culture.

FASS is a dumping ground? Seriously, roll that opinion of yours up into a tight roll and stuff it up where the sun don't shine. 

Wanna know why the world is so fucked nowadays? Because generations upon generations neglected to study FASS subjects, particularly History. And like the saying goes, those who neglect to learn from the past will be doomed to repeat it. 

Furthermore, there is every likelihood that a future leader of your society will come out of a FASS-background tertiary education. Demeaning FASS the way you do is just ironic considering that your very adult life and much of the important things in it (like who represents your interests in government, who collects and uses your taxes etc) is dependent on such people. 

Seriously, go take a hike. No faculty is a dumping ground for anybody. It's alright if you don't have the same interests and academic passion as I do in what I study, but don't you dare demean us to being mere second-fiddle to people like you who aren't in FASS.

 Most Atheists have inconsistencies in their beliefs. On one hand, they claim there is no god. But most of them naively believe in what the scientists say, not realizing that the scientists are paid by corporations to misinform the general public. Science is not FREE from politics.
-
 
In light of the recent debate on religions and atheism, we should think of what kind of society do we want. Karl Popper ("Open Society and its enemies" - a fantastic holiday read) made two distinctions to describe a society. A "closed" society forces everyone to believe in the same thing (one religion; or believe in Science only). An "open" society allows people to formulate their own beliefs, be a contrarian and free from national boundaries. Singapore is still a closed society but I can see the younger generation wants an open society. Science should not be viewed as the only RIGHT view. As long as the religion does not harm others, there is no strong reason why religion should be banned. Some people just need religion. It's like how people are addicted to opium.

Now that christmas is over, let me get some facts straight for some (not all mind you, just some) of my dear christian friends, whose somewhat overly zealous posts have been showing up periodically on my facebook feed for the past few days:

1) Spelling Christmas as Xmas does not, to quote you guys, take out the all important "Christ" from "Christmas". Fun fact: Did you know that the "X" in "Xmas" comes from the Greek letter Chi, which is the first letter of the Greek word Χριστός? In English, that simply translates to "Christ". In fact, its use dates back to the 16th century, and in those times you would probably be more likely to be called an  "Xtian" rather than a "Christian".

2) Sorry to disappoint you guys, but Xmas (or "Christmas", as the hardliners would say) isn't really the day Jesus was born you know. In fact, your New Testament does not even give a specific date of the birth of Jesus, although some sources put it to be the 25th of March rather than December. So then, perhaps you would be interested to know that what you're celebrating is really just a repackaged Pagan holiday known as the winter solstice. Which in a nutshell is just... sun worship. *gasps* 

Anyway just to set the record straight, I'm not out to spoil your fun on this wonderful holiday. In fact, I think the idea behind christmas is great - a season of love and charity, so let's just keep it that way. It's just that whenever I see some people using such holidays as a chance to show off to the world how awesomely devoted they are as compared to other "less devoted christians" or non-believers, it gets on my nerves and I can't help taking a few potshots back at them. Or to put it simply, limpeh guailan.

OP of  here. Glad that know many of us don't buy into stereotypical gender expectations! I know these stereotypes are jokes, and if people are laughing because the jokes are ridiculous, then it's great. The scarier part is the insidious effect of these jokes perpetuating certain ideas in people's subconscious. Jokes draw upon existing discourses, and people laugh because they can relate to those ideas. There's also a fine line between being funny and offensive. But anyway, not trying to be so picky about this because I do (want) to have a sense of humour, haha.

I am posting again because a commenter made an interesting point, and I'm bored and like to discuss issues like this with a community out there. I won't do this again so sorry if you totally hate this!

The commenter said that I'm only saying all that because I'm evergreen /single and implied that I may change once I get attached. If he meant it as a joke, sure! But well.. my kind of over-active brain likes to make connections and explore different thoughts, so after a while I was thinking... yeah I really don't know how I'd act after I get into a r/s, when the novelty and romance has worn off. I may act in the very same way that I said I wouldn't. This happened some couples I know, after they starting getting used to and comfortable with each other.

We don't really know how we'd become in hypothetical situations. But one way that may be a useful indicator is to see how you act around people that you are familiar with, e.g. family, relatives, friends, or around people that you don't really like. Do you take it for granted that the people around you have to serve your interests? Do you expect them to? Or are you thankful when people do stuff for you. I have friends who make their parents bring stuff for them to campus, and they don't feel bad about it or aren't thankful about it. Or like they ask their parents "eh mum can you faster wash my clothes cos I want to wear them later".

I'm always a bit cynical about love and romance because when the novelty wears off, then we show our true colours and then you realise that you got yourself into something you didn't expect or imagine initially. A true indicator of the person's character is how he/she acts around people they are used to or don't really like, not how he/she acts around you in the most romantic and novel stage of the relationship. Just a point of reflection for myself.

I get incredibly jealous when I see people being close with their parents. When it shows they're a family that love and trust one another.

I didn't ask for this.  I didn't ask my mother to leave me behind when I was less than a year old while she went off to chase richer men. I didn't ask to have a father who could barely hold himself together with drink when he wasn't off trying to drown his deficiencies in work. I didn't ask my mother to come back to harass my stepmother throughout my childhood, and I didn't ask for my stepmother to have come from a failed marriage, over the years slowly turning her into a manic wreck. I didn't ask for her to have come from another failed marriage, leaving a daughter who was more of a wreck than she was, who took my father's hospitality and repaid it by making my home a high-tension mess for years. I didn't ask for my otherwise-lovely grandfather's weakness to be a mistress, whose infidelity killed the grandmother who raised me and now continues to leech off him and us. 

I have no one to cry to. Not a mother who only wants me back as a retirement fund, not a father who cannot understand what I'm missing, not a stepmother whose mental health cannot take any more. People envy me because I have a big house, because I get to eat at expensive restaurants, because I can buy almost anything I want. I never asked for it. Just seeing people holding hands with their parents, talking candidly, trusting them to confide, it makes me jealous. So fucking jealous.  All the way back to my childhood, I never knew what to say when I was asked about my parents or family. No one else had to worry about them. And as I grew up, I started to have to care for them. 

It's not fair. Why do I have to worry about and care for my parents, instead of the other way round? Why am I the only one who has to mediate parents when they argue again and again and start threatening to leave? They vent to me, either they rant to me, or take out their anger on me in other ways. And when other children go to their parents to do the same, I have no one. I never asked for any of this. 

Why me? I guess, it'd make me feel a lot better knowing if other people have similar situations.

I've seen many Christians/Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists/Taoists who try to live life the best they can, guided by their religious principles. And though they sometimes let negativity take over, they're all learning and trying to spread nothing but positivity to everyone they meet.

I've also seen many Agnostics and Atheists who try to live life the best they can. Guided by a personal or universal set of moral codes, they too are learning and trying to spread nothing but positivity to everyone they meet.

I consider myself to be an optimistic Deist. I believe in all beliefs/non-beliefs. As long as they help their believers/non-believers, they're all valid in their own way. I don't care that I just contradicted myself, because it doesn't matter. I do believe in God, because the beginning of everything is too untouchable/unknown for me to outrightly reject the fact that there is beginning of everything. So God, in my view, is the beginning of everything, the substance that fills this void of doubt. I follow a universal set of moral codes, and am also learning and trying to spread nothing but positivity to everyone I meet.

It is not up to me to decide how others see/not see God. If their beliefs help them to get through with life, I don't see why we should tear them down. And if someone tries to tear my God down, I will respond by telling them that I believe in what they believe, and subtly encourage them to spread positivity. I do not fight fire with fire. And hopefully by doing so I can encourage people to not start any fires, one person at a time.

Religious labels serve little purpose except to make conversations easier, so let's not let labels divide us. And I am glad that only a minority are very vocal in speaking out against other beliefs/non-beliefs and letting labels divide us.

Speaking from the point of view of a foreigner, Singaporean males carry a burden of not 2 years of NS, it's about 3.5-4 years. Singaporeans starts Primary school at 7 instead of the more common 6. Also, in pre-University schools, academic year starts in Spring while University starts in Autumn. That means JC grads sitting around doing nothing for half a year. Potentially, it allows University to receive applications from High School graduates instead of to-be-graduates. But it's for naught because I went to NUS 3 months after my graduation from high school.

There are real consequences for this. For eg, if you have a sweetheart from JC, chances are you guys won't be sweethearts by the time the freshman year is over. Why? Picture this: your sweetheart is in University, surrounding herself with peers with equal educational level and intellect in a intellectually stimulating environment. And you are a smelly dude locked away in some forsaken camps occasionally go on dates with her. It's also an advice people give to potential post-grad students: if you have a sweetheart, get married before going to grad school, if you guys want to stay sweethearts.

Before you start going on and on and on about NS fostering such and such. Mostly, it's patriotism and nationalism. Your sweetheart will learn about how nationalism is a "imagined community" (By Benedict Anderson). Also, as a lowly private, you are drilled to follow instructions while University foster independence. University is the anti-thesis of the values of National Service. I don't mean that the armed forces are inherently anti-independence or intellectualism; just that to be able to do so, you need to be an officer. I'm not sure about Singapore armed forces, but for eg, in US's armed forces, you are an enlist or at most, NCO if you only have a high school diploma. Officers are reserved for Bachelors and up. Still institutionally, most armed forces are conservative and Right leaning (US politics speaking) while Universities are liberal and Left leaning.

Second, no matter you are in NS, University or employed, your biological urges stay the same. You will have the same urge to have sex, enter a relationship, or get married. The heart (or to be absolutely scientifically correct, your brain and genitals under the influence of the hypothalamus's hormones) wants what it wants. Let's be honest here, the most serious dating that can lead to long term relationship or marriage occur after you graduated and/or when you are working. There are many reasons, but the most important being you are financially independent (and can afford to pay for your dates). For the ladies, they can have a better understanding of who you are, how you can get along with strangers and co-workers, or your future. All of which is best AFTER you graduated. I'm 26, and as a foreigner, I've already been working for 4 years, already in one 3 years long relationship (which ended), in another for the last year and next year will probably be our marriage. An average Singaporean male has just graduated or the one that I'm training at work today. In the dating market, you are competing with people of the same age and 4 more years of experience than you do.

I've also noticed that despite being only 26, my ability to form new memories have deteriorated compared to just 2 years ago. I won't be able to learn languages as fast as before. If Singaporean males want to go to grad school, that's also a big factor.

You can eliminate the 2 non-NS year burden by making students start school at 6 instead of 7, and Autumn school years instead of Spring. But that still leave 2 years of burden for males not females. The way out is the Israeli way (upon which Singaporean armed forces based their organization on, at least initially): conscript the women as well. Having a professional, volunteer-only army won't work for a small state. I know I know, women have a different physique, which many think that is unsuitable for armed forces work. However, this is a fact, in most modern armies, the number of "trigger-pullers" are only 10-20% the strength of a full division or brigade. The rest are logistics to make sure that 10-20% can pull the triggers without starving, being thirsty, or running out of ammunition. If you count the non-divisional, and second echelon personnel, that % is even smaller; perhaps 5 or smaller. You need people to drive the trucks, cook the meals, treat the wounded, bury the dead, use computers, try to use computers, ordering computers when the computers break, drive the computer to the station, do paperwork, etc ... So many things which anyone of any gender can do. Even as trigger-pullers, women aren't worse at it.  Singapore armed forces use the tiny 5.56mm, and a short, light rifle; which even teenagers can use (just search youtube). Sure hauling 120 pounds of gear is not easy, but women have a slower heart rate, which make precision shooting better.

A couple of problems for having women conscripts. let's not make menstruation jokes, but well, it might be an issue. I'm not a women so I don't know. But other real issues: rape is one. It can be done by the power of ranks and non-physical threats. Or physical threat with a knife. Rape and poor conviction rate is a real problem in all-volunteer forces. The third problem, and potentially more common, is rampant consensual sex between men and women (or men and men, women and women, I'm not judging) being locked up in close proximity. The armed force can't be gender-segregated: everyone needs to learn how to work with each other. With that is a bunch of issues, for eg: pregnancy. I can't imagine the supply store for recruits selling condoms (but that can be a nice contraband to sell, for enterprising smugglers); and the brass will initially insist on a retarded policy of frequent personal belongings inspection which mandates "no birth controls". But hey, that can only be good for falling birthrates, if you look at another angle. Also, being locked up in close proximity do wonders to form relationship; which is a common complaints of people going to University: the personal distance University instead of the "locked-up-in-a-room" model of pre-University days decrease the number of friends and relationships.

Which on another note, NUS, and NUS's halls and residences official policy are surprisingly prude: keep that door ajar if you are an opposite sex person in your room. First, that's homophobic and heterophobic, depend on how you view it. If the implication is no sexual relation allowed on campus, the policy implies that there is not homosexual relationship. But if the implication is no heterosexual sexual acts, that's discrimination against heterosexual people. Second, these students are all adults, they can decide on their own. Third, what's wrong with a little humping on campus? Fourth, PGP has apartments for married graduate students. Which implies that it's NOT OK to get married when you are undergraduates. Which is stupid. Why do the age and consent and marriage is set at 18 then? Fifth, the role of University is scholarly and academic education, not policing its student personal lives. Sixth, it's useless to police these stuff. You can't even stop people smoking at FASS dungeon, which is the unofficial, official smoking spot on campus.

Just a few food for thoughts. Personally, I support the "conscript everyone" way.

Dear OP of  &  , and the person behind the newfangled "NUS" society............

You must have hit a new low. (More like how low can you go? See  )

After being called out for talking and replying to yourself in the comments on your then pet topic "Effective altruism" a few months back, you're now back at it with this militant/evangelist atheist gospel. New flavour of the month/semester break? You must be super free and bored now that you have even created a page and new persona so that you can better interact with yourself!

Maybe you wanted to set up a satirical page but like one of the commenters already pointed out, you are really BAD at satire. Utterly rubbish at it, might I add. The only thing you have achieved in your short existence now is to add further distaste to atheism and tarnish any good standing it has with your confrontational tactics. Great move slapping "NUS" in front of it. Now all those nice well meaning atheists who are truly passionate to the cause will no longer be able to officially and legitimately register under OSA. With this kind of track record, do you think they will want to risk it? Own goal....

Then again, maybe this page/persona is the real you. While you are busy putting up a manicured facade of a do gooder and racking up credentials on your CV for whatever big shot financial career you want so that you can show the world how to do real "effective altruism", this persona let's you be YOU. The one that is full of bullshit that people have already poked holes at. Do you seriously think you are the protagonist of that mummy porn trilogy? If they knew the real you, they will not let you work with children. Little innocent pawns in your conniving scheme.

Maybe it's so that all your tawdry misdeeds don't fall out one by one for the world to see... A post dated apology does not cover up a crime, neither did coerced consent then. Stop hurting people and stay far away from the ones you have hurt. You are a terrible excuse of a man/atheist/whatever new persona you create. You disgust me.

"Many kids these days have been drinking the kool aid too much. 'Get a degree, it's your passport to a stable, well-paid job'. Well, sorry guys, that's just a patent bare-faced lie. All jobs are just a form of capitalist slavery. That is NOT the purpose of going to uni, unless you like to/want to be a slave forever. 

In fact, all these kids will just get smacked down when they get into the working world (speaking from personal experience). You will realise it is not what it is made out to be, no matter how prestigious your job/academic background may be. You're still a mother****ing slave, and nothing will hit you harder than when you have to take orders from a P6 educated towkay who lords it over your over-educated ass with his millions of dollars.

So get out of the well. University is not even a means to an end, it is a BRIDGE to the means, which MAY lead you to your end, whatever that is."

A very good advice.

Just say no and walk away if u do not want to listen to evangelizing Christians. If you feel bad then listen lor. U all talk so much about standing up against Christianity evangelists but atheist evangelist is ok? Grow up lah. Quarrel so much. If u as an Aetheist can be so affected because some random Christian tell u that u will go to hell if u don't believe in Christianity, then u sure ur annoyance is not stemmed from ur own insecurities? If u as a Christian can be convinced into giving up ur religion by a random Aetheist, then u sure u truly believe in what u believe in? 
Stop arguing and just accept that we all have our own beliefs. No one should force anyone to listen to anything if they don't want to. Basic human rights yo. Also, If there is a foolproof religion then no need for beliefs or faith. It will be a fact. Move on now for more laoniang stories pls. So much more entertaining.

I was watching a Chinese drama and felt very much for what a character has said in a scenario, and I'd like to share it with the NUSWhispers community; hence I have translated it below:

"Everyone makes choices. You took what you think was important to you and gave me up, and this is purely a choice of yours. If I grow to hate you just because I wasn't chosen, then there would be too many unforgivable things existing in this world. No one has the responsibility to put me as a priority, so no matter how much I wish for it, I cannot force it to happen. I treat you the way I treat you because I am willing, and if you can reciprocate, that is the best; but if you can't, then there is no regret for me as well." 

This has made me reflect a lot on my life recently. Hope it would help someone as well.

My friends think I am a nerd with few interests in the finer aspects in life.

Fact is, I tell them I have other interests too, but they all dao me.

Who has interests in understanding how people think and watching people? I think some people are so very fascinating.

I know this guy - he makes me smile, he makes me laugh. He makes me feel I am better than I could ever have, and he makes me believe I deserve more than I have ever felt I could. He's like no one I have ever met.

But he's Christian and I'm not. Quite a devout one too, I believe. It doesn't bother me too much but I think it's the reason why he doesn't want us to become official. What should I do? Are differences in religion really so insurmountable?

Sometimes I question as to why can't universities be like polytechnic, having a class, and so on? This gives us a stronger bonding between people from my perspective. Since both are tertiary education, RIGHT?

I think most people in NUS know that we have 4 Christian societies. And I'm sure you have seen their evangelism at work in NUS. Basically their members approaches people and ask if they have some time for an activity that sound innocent enough. Say card reading. And then they start interpreting the cards based on Christianity.

Well, I'm an atheist. And I feel that I have some responsibility in undoing this kind of missionary work. So I'm wondering, is it possible to set up an atheist evangelical society in NUS that does the same thing? Except that instead of making people believe in stuff, we walk up to people and try convincing them to give up their beliefs?

I was a victim of cyber bullying. Back then cyber bullying was unheard of because Internet usage was in its early stages. In school, things looked so normal, so the teachers didn't know what was going on. My classmates knew, but it probably never occurred to them that it was cyber bullying. 
They say that time heals all wounds. But who knew how long it would take? The impact it had on my self-esteem, that I would never match up to be good enough. I tried but failed to turn to my family for support, who was constantly comparing me to others in the hope I'll achieve more but were blind to my esteem issues.
Fast forward to 2015 and I'm glad there is much more support now. People who're facing such issues should not bottle things up and not be afraid to seek professional support.

Really super bored at work now,since I got time I shall contribute a bit uh....if Heng,y'all shall see my post,not Heng then is y'all suay lor (Cos Admin is su ka su then post Ur post one)...I got inspired by the laoliang posts on nuswhispers and wanna try to be jiao (bird in hokkein, in singlish means nonsensical) here and write story also. Maybe I can do a diary (until school starts, results out next week le ,good luck to all). After all, My childhood dream was always to be an otter (author luh dey, don't think of the animal, he sleeping)...time is passing so slow,so you guys just bear with me.

I shall start a story on gege and jiji. Gege is a boy, born in taltal. Jiji is gege best friend. They both adore the same female, lele, in secondary school,but hor,the girl fan Jian go choose a male named Baba, that don't like her...now she hoseh le,she pregnant with 56 babies. She now stress over the names of her offsprings,then she jin Sian, like me liddat now. But the thing is she started eating a lot a lot  (must feed 56 babies leh!), baba buay tahan and become gay with gege. 

Then gege become gay with Baba and make Baba really gay. then after that gege abandon Baba and go and attack lele. Lele all alone and all, so she chose Baba. Then baba make her pregnant also (128 babies sia) the point is not about the numbers of babies but is about the fact that Lele is a goldfish,so is Baba,so is gege. 

But the thing is this is still a better love story than mine uh.mine like prata liddat --> kosong

Thanks for reading. I have managed to reach the start of the queue to order my food le. All the best for results guys!!!

I feel like many of the commenters on NUSwhispers are so judgemental sometimes. I will see crazy mean comments that spring out of nowhere. Those comments just ooze bitterness and it seems like they type those kind of comments just so they can vent their feelings of insecurity or worthlessness on strangers. They try to attack the OP but they just come off like a giant douchebag themselves. Who are you to call someone who didn't harm you a prick without being a prick yourself. Right, WesleySlayer Wong? It takes a prick to know another prick. Kudos to all the nice folks who can stay objective.

Is it wrong to root for Russia bombing terrorists Syria? I know Russia is helping Assad stay in power. I know there are many of my friends who look favorably on the rebels in Syria. But terrorists are taking over the world, and let's face it, rebels taking over Syria isn't going to make the situation any better,

By the way, ISIS isn't taking over Singapore. So the whole argument doesn't work for us.

Please be mindful that

Recently there has been a lot of posts on religion. I feel compelled to share my thoughts and is open for discussion. Christianity itself has no bad intentions, same goes for Islam. Keep in mind that both are based on books written and compiled by people over the years.
Reality is how people choose to interpret various verses of the 'holy' books.
On some occasions, we blamed religion based on some negative actions taken by some extremists.
Look deeper into that and open your heart.
Look at the first letter of every sentence!!

I walked into ding Tai feng and at a lot of tables, there were ang mohs that were dining. The rest of the diners were happily chit chatting. I'm still amazed at how singapore has transformed into a place that is so accepting of different cultures, different people with different skin colours. This is unlike my experience in the western countries where once an Asian enters a restaurant, all eyes turn to look at you. That made me very uncomfortable. Their looks, I'm not sure if they are condescending or not, but I'm sure they aren't friendly. 

I said to my friend, eh why ang mohs can dine so casually in singapore while Asians cannot in western countries. He replied that firstly, singapore is used to so many different people that we are already accepting it. Also, English is the main language in singapore, so long as you know English, you will feel that you belong.

When i comes to getting into a relationship i tend to think a lot and consider a lot of factors before going into one, such as weighing the cost and benefit when getting into one, pondering deeply whether my partner is suitable and whether that person is suitable , and analyzing my prospective partner and the cost of getting into such relationship as having lost time with my other friends etc. Also i believe in natural selection and i want to ensure that i dont propagate my genes to the wrong person so in a way im contributing to evolution.I dont really rely on my gut instincts and I feel that i tend to overthink and over analyse situations. Is that healthy?

 I sincerely wonder who you are. There are many people out there who can't be more eager to start a family. Few like me, have thoughts of just having a life partner and period. No children to burden us, no spoilt brats running around. Frankly speaking, I can't even tolerate children screaming and crying. Suffering exist. Few people have their life easy, almost everyone struggle to achieve their goals. And then, most goals also die with you as you die, serving no further purpose (unless your goal impacts another being). Life is even harder if you are not born with a silver spoon. Not privileged to have tuition or classes to nurture your talents/passion, often we find ourselves putting in twice the effort to achieve the same outcome. I am glad that someone finally agrees with my opinion. It may be pessimistic but no doubt realistic. No babies, period.

I find that the non-religion version of Buddhism provide more thought-provoking insight about reality than Christianity. Most of the pastors preach about God and their sermons. Furthermore many of the clergy are non-believers (see https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/Preachers_who_are_not_believers.pdf). On the other hand, Buddha did not preach about God.

I was once part of Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC).

I was a christian for several years of my life prior to that and I was trying to deal with my personal struggles with the religion itself. So I thought it will be a good idea to immerse myself in the religion within church but also outside of church. Hence, I joined CCC with the hope of being able to come to terms with this dissonance within me. 

Was I ever so wrong.

After a few meetings, we were actually paired up with more senior members to go about evangelizing. Cutting the long story short, the senior tried to evangelize a Muslim lady and made several "questionable" statements towards her religion. 

My jaw dropped in horror.

Time passed and as I interacted with more people from CCC, the more uncomfortable I felt with their tactics of evangelism and judgemental statements (but I must say, there are a few kind souls inside). From encouraging members to abandon their parent's last wish for a taoist/buddhist rites at their funerals to proclaiming out loud that they will feel sad for me as my parents will be burning in hellfire. I ever once confided something personal to the leader of the cell group. Only to be met with judgement and shunning. 

So much for acceptance and sensitivity.

The last straw came when they applied peer pressure to attend a conference that I could not make it for. Part of the reasons they gave was that it will be good for my path i Christianity and if I go, they will achieve a 100% attendance rate (I was the only one that has yet to sign up). They even got the whole CCC to pray for me every single session. So I granted their wish of a 100% attendance.

I quit CCC that very day.

To this date, I have not only left CCC, I have abandoned the whole faith. I wouldn't place the blame on CCC for my apostacy. That "sin" is mine to bear and the reasons for leaving are personal. But I would say they have helped harden my resolve to denounce the religion.

And for that, I don't regret joining CCC.

To the OP of . I'm sorry that you had to 'learn' about Christ through this manner.  What they speak and how they behave is not Christ-like at all. In fact, its the total opposite. Them judging you constantly or trying to evangelise people when they have no lawful right to do so should tell you that they aren't true Christians. They sound terribly fake and if I, a baptised Catholic were in that group, I would be really uncomfortable as well. How could you stand them for so long?!  Those poor souls have been brain washed by misinformed leaders as well and it's sad that there are so many similar Christian groups here in Singapore. 

I just hope that not everyone thinks all Christians are like that. Honestly these people are so blinded, its horrifying. And OP I'm sorry again that they weren't able to strengthen your relationship with God. I know how it feels like and I've been there before. Their job wasn't to judge you and I feel extremely disgusted with their behaviour. If you ever feel like re-connecting with God again, please don't think it's too late to do so. Those people have no right to call themselves Christians. And to be completely honest, you sounded like a true Christian through out the entire post. But if religion is not what you're looking for right now, I hope you have someone to talk about your struggles with. It's better to share them with someone whom you can trust then to go through them alone. God bless!

Flame this post if you want. I don't get why it becomes alright to make fun of or put down any religion just because they stepped on your toes. So many many posts putting down Christians just because they are sharing their faith? So many many people in the world putting down Muslims because of a small group of terrorist? Wake up. U putting down their religion in the guise of standing up for equal respect for all religions does not make u any better than what they did. Come on man, it's the 21st century, stop flaming each other's religion and learn to respect each and everyone's choice.

Imagine NUSwhispers but bigger, city wide where you go to every location and you can not only post confessions and opinions but ask questions to people around that location?

We are a couple of NUS alumni who decided to give it a go and we would launch it in NUS first because we love our university.

Would you use it ? What more would you like...would you want to be a beta tester ?

Imagine a future where you do not need to be worried about asking a question in class incase someone thinks your not smart enough, imagine selling your old stuff within campus using the app. Imagine doing a confession not only inside campus but where  you are connected with the rest of the world. Let us know what you think about it.

I absolutely abhor it when I see friends and acquaintances on Facebook posting things like "oh I think I may be suffering from depression"/"do you think I'm depressed?" status after status - just to attract attention. I'm not dismissing the possibility that they might REALLY be having a mental illness (since it affects 1 in 7 adults), but the fact that they're trying to use mental illness as an attention seeking tool is just annoying.

I was diagnosed with a mental illness a few years back, and it haven't been easy. I literally took years to open up to anyone. It was no fun being constantly plagued by disturbing thoughts and voices, having your social functionality severely impaired, and needing to rely on medication every night to ensure your safety for the next day.

Here we are trying to fight a battle and live normally, and there people are using our illness as a ploy to pull sympathy to themelves. If you would like to suffer from a mental illness so desperately, I would gladly transfer my "ownership" to you.

Honestly why would people want to have babies? I do agree that having a baby may bring joy to the family, but that's done at the price of the baby undergoing sufferings on this world. He is born to this world, starting with cries and followed by all sorts of sufferings, and finally dies, as all human beings do. For me I would rather stay alone for my life, i.e. no wife no baby.

Something that I have been wanting to say... I dont know if many of you readers realise this or not but still... Here goes.

This has become quite a common phenomenon for hawkers in Singapore, not just in NUS. 

For those who are regular customers of noodle stalls in food centres, have you ever realised that whenever these hawkers serve you the noodles, they tend to hold the bowl with the tendency of their fingers 'dipping' into the soup? 

The problem is no matter how many times you remind them, still, the next time you buy from them, they have the tendency to repeat this unhygienic act again.

As such, is there really nothing we can do about this? They really need some basic hygiene education, but the problem is how do we convey this message to the society as a whole?

Thank you for reading... Not that I want to rant about this. Just that I am simply disgusted by this grotesque way of hawkers holding the bowls. In fact it is rather applicable to some stalls in NUS food outlets which is one of the reasons why I am posting here.

Since we are at the topic of evangelism on campus, allow me to share my take on this. I recalled that when I was studying in JC, there was a scandal circulating in the social media. Please take a look at the link below.

http://alvinology.com/2012/02/16/insensitive-nus-campus-crusade-for-christ/

Google search the keywords and it will tell you that the members from the student society "nus campus crusade for christ" dissolved and regrouped as "nus cru". 

I can't believe that nus osa allows them to operate so blatantly under a new banner after such a distasteful act! Only when I came across the previous NUSWhisper posts about NUS student society practicing evangelism on campus did I realise that they are still operating! 

As a NUS student, I do not want to be misrepresented by these extremists in the media. We are not bigots who despise others for their different beliefs. Maybe you brush me off and claim that the above scandal is a mere accident, but this scandal truly reflects how these fanatics think about non-believers. 

I think this is dangerous. It is the first step towards religious extremism. If we don't take care of this problem now, it might grow into a menace to our society!

This may seem irrelevant at first, but please read on.

My best friend only eats chocolate ice-cream. From young, his parents only bought chocolate ice-cream for him and (because chocolate ice-cream is great!) he loves it. Even after he started going out on his own, or after he began to earn his own money by teaching tuition, he never saw a need to try other ice-cream flavours. 

Well I guess its okay that he refuses to try strawberry ice-cream, vanilla ice-cream, durian ice-cream or anything other than chocolate ice-cream whenever we go out. I mean, we like hanging out with him. He is a smart, funny and kind guy. Besides, most ice-cream shops have some form of chocolate ice-cream.

Recently, though, it has been a little annoying to go out with him. He not only eats chocolate ice-cream himself, but also insists that we eat it too. Last week, we went to our regular ice-cream place and I really wanted to have the durian ice-cream. However, he insisted that all of us eat the chocolate ice-cream. He kept on saying something about how chocolate ice-cream is the best, and that no other ice-cream can ever be as good as chocolate. 

I really think he went a little too far. I like chocolate ice-cream, but I like durian ice-cream more. I didn't only eat chocolate ice-cream growing up only eating chocolate ice-cream. While I admire his love for and devotion to chocolate ice-cream, I hope he can understand that because I was not raised the same way, I do not share the same passion. He should also be mindful that there was another friend in our group who grew up only eating strawberry ice-cream. I am quite sure that her devotion to strawberry ice-cream is as strong as my best friend's devotion to chocolate ice-cream. My best friend really should not have forced her to eat chocolate ice-cream.

Before you start judging my best friend, or stop reading because you think this post is just a stupid troll to waste your time, please continue reading...

At risk of sounding extreme, I think that my experience with my best friend is similar to what some of you experience with religion, as seen from some of the previous posts.

Very few of us have carefully studied the teachings of all the different religions before deciding which one we believe in. The religion that most of us believe in (if we do believe in a religion) is closely linked to our experiences. Perhaps we are Christian because we were raised in a deeply Christian household, and perhaps we are Buddhist because we were raised in a deeply Buddhist household. 

Because of our upbringing, and the people we hang out with, we might have never seen a need to explore the teachings of other religions. Just as my best friend believes that chocolate ice-cream is the best, and refuses to try other flavours, so some of us might believe that the teachings of our religion are right and that the teachings of all other religions are wrong. 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion and, while some of you might disagree with me, I think there is nothing wrong in believing privately that all other religions are wrong. So long as we are nice to people, and loyal, we can still build meaningful relationships.
 
We will be wrong, however, if we try to impose this private belief on other people, just like how my friend made all of us eat chocolate ice-cream. We should remember that our beliefs are shaped by our experiences, and while we grew up eating (and really love) chocolate ice-cream, there will be others who grew up eating (and really love) strawberry or durian ice-cream too.

Since we are taking about a serious issue as practise vs propagation of religion, I would like to add my personal experience. So, first a little background; I am hindu. Now I am always bewildered by how some people can't understand the simple idea that religions don't follow same pattern. For example while most of the abrahmic religions (religion of book) have strong guidelines/rules/requirements, the indic religions are mere prescriptions/amusing/wonderings of the sages/saints/enlighten ones. So it would be nice if people can stop the fucking saviour kind of question down other people's throat. Now the personal experience, so do you remember the recent earthquake in Nepal. This happened few weeks after that. I was walking to flavours to have dinner. This young sweet guy approached me and asked me to fill an "academic" survey on his tablet. So questions started on polite note asking regions views and in the end escalated suddenly, skyrocketing both is stupidity and propagandism. So the question (as i faintly remember) "Do you think that the recent earthquakes of Nepal is sign from Jesus", "Why'' and "Do you think Jesus can save people of Nepal". Well I honestly answered how illogical and stupid his question was. But it didn't stop there, now this guy engaged me into a mind numbing illogical talk which can be summarised as *Everything is predicted in Bible and only Bible can save you please join us at XYZ church*. I just asked him one thing well it does predict a regular earthquake in one of the countries, what does it say about human travelling to Mars? Anyways international media did criticised the churches pouring in money for conversions at the times when food was scarce. Finally I am sorry if anyone feels offended but truth is truth and you can imagine how other people get offended when some stupid people ask questions not even relevant to the religious framework followed by someone.

This is going to sound a bit essay-y, but for all the post about Christians trying to convert others, I think this is a good explanation. Out of all the 3 Abrahamic religions, Christianity and Islam are the twos in which many adherents, particularly the most devoted ones, believe that their version of the faith; not just their entire religion, but the particular denomination, is the only right one that will lead them to heaven instead of fire and brimstone. Thus, it is their duty on Earth to convert as many as possible to their version to avoid Hell. In periods of extremely high religiosity, it sometimes mean violence: use force to convert others to let them avoid Hell. It can lead to ridiculous measures like during the Spanish Inquisition, heretics (read: people who don't believe in the version that the Inquisitors used) were asked to convert. If they agreed, they would be converted, then strangled to death; but that's OK for being good Christians, they will go to Heaven nonetheless. If they refused, they would be burned at the stake. Currently, Dawlat al-Islamiyyah are able to recruit loads of people simply because they represent such fervor to the extreme that other versions of the faith lack.

Other faiths lack this kind of belief. The first Abrahamic religion believed themselves to be God chosen people, but whether you end up in Heaven or Hell depends on how you behave. Others have an air of exclusivity to them.

Here's a story, not by me personally, but someone I know. She's a Buddhist, and paid a visit to her friend's family, who are Christians. The friend's father ask the girl in a completely serious way: "if the ceiling collapse on us, where do you think we would be?". She answered "Well, I hope it's the hospital, or I walk away from this unscathed". 

Sarcasm, it works.

All the posts about religion and aggressive evangelisation. 

I pray for myself, to myself. 

And even if there was a God, the only thing I'd care about is whether He is the God of Tits and Wine! :P

I recently got diagnosed with an illness which gets in the way of my ability to move in general, and as such exercise. I have always been overweight and it's becoming increasingly crippling especially in university. How do I lose weight? ):

I really think we shouldn't compare our daily lives with that of the westerners. Why care so much if they sleep with one another or drink till they'r pissed drunk every other day in school or whatsoever? Their culture is not superior in any way and if there're things we should learn, it should be better things than these.

Just asking, are there any proper means/channels to have certain proselytizing student groups in NUS, er, for the lack of a better word, removed? I mean it's a win-win situation isn't it - students don't get harassed unnecessarily, and the secular environment of NUS is maintained. If you blatantly stretch the OSA rules on proselytizing over and over again, something's bound to give in the end, and hopefully it'd be these groups. #justsaying

To  and  Hey. I'm "VH" once again. Thank you to the whisperer for speaking to me directly. It was much-appreciated.

It seems that we had misunderstandings that should not have boiled over to this extent. I realised the whisperer had listened to gossip from another friend of mine and exaggerated that I watched gay porn, among other weird hobbies.

To the whisperer, as we have mentioned, I forgive you for your whisper. While what you said was indeed quite laughable and categorically false, I am not going to take any more further action against you. I understood where you were coming from, and we can agree to disagree about CM2142.

To my so-called friends who gossip about me: you have probably issues with my character or the way I say things. Perhaps it just appeals to my sense of humor to mock, poke fun or even crack suggestive innuendo. However, I don't think it is right to spread unverified comments about me and my habits. While I enjoy self-deprecating humor, please kindly do not quote what I said to other friends only to be quoted out of context.

I think my some of my so-called friends should kindly reflect on the course of their actions as it has caused me some distress. If you think you have got out of line, I suggest you speak to me privately instead of spreading baseless comments about me or comments taken out of context. Thanks,
Shawn

The posts about Christians aren't surprising. I'm a Catholic and to my knowledge, we don't practice this. This being, going around and educating people about your religion. But can you blame the people who have formed a form of hatred towards these Christians? These Chrisitian groups need to place themselves in other people's shoes. This in my opinion is a form of empathy, something which the bible has covered multiple times. So why are you guys ignoring it? I personally would hate it if someone came up to me to share about Christianity, if I were already a Buddhist or Hindu. I get that  as Christians, we need to share the Word of God with everyone. But going around and preaching about it, especially when you aren't even that informed about the religion is not the way to go. Instead of talking about the Word of God, show it through your actions. Be kind, be humble. Doesn't the bible teach you that? You are not a pastor and neither are you a priest. In short, you aren't qualified. So quit the preaching. It turns people off and you're pushing people away from God. Can't you guys already get that by now? If someone would like to know about your religion, they will ask you about it. 

I apologize to anyone who had to have experience this. This is not what our religion is about. It doesn't teach us to force our religion upon people. Some Christians are just misinformed themselves. But I certaintly hope they change for the better. Peace!

Usually when I sit alone in the canteen, these people from NUS Cru will approach me. Typically, they come in pairs with one eloquent guy and a loserish shy boy who is possibly the apprentice of the former. 

And oh boy! Their smile is the fakest smile I have ever seen in my life. Even Pamela Anderson's breasts look real after seeing those smiles. 

Coming back to the point. This have to stop! They should just have a hotline like the civil defence. Whoever wants to be saved call 995! Don't go around saving people who are perfectly fine! This is getting annoying!

Peace out!

An alternative reaction to . I usually dismiss the evangelists who approach me. But on days when I'm in a particularly bad mood, I would politely accept their request to sit down and chat. I'd listen patiently to a couple of verses before responding, in as calm a manner as possible, rebuttals and questions that Christians cannot reply to (not gonna elaborate. I don't want to start a flame war here). Its... amusing to see some of them squirm and sweat under pressure to respond coherently, especially those who had not given any critical thought to their faith. The more they struggle, the more holes I poke into their arguments.

As they realise the futility of their attempt and stand up to walk away, I always smile politely and wish them good luck in their other attempts with other people, secretly hoping I have planted the seeds of doubt in their minds. (I'm agnostic)

I totally agree with 13726 about how we shouldn't view westerners as superior in their culture to us. 

I say this as someone who used to really admire westerners. Perhaps when I was young, they may have been. But now I'm older and have dated a fairly significant number of westerners, they're really not that great.

Let's bust some myths: 
1. Date Ang Moh very rich. 
Fantasy: Go on high class dates. Have guy pay for everything. 
Reality: I think it's the type of angmohs sg attracts. They like the whole rustic shit. At most bring you to bars but none of the fancy stuff. Also, dates with westerners don't even fucking comprise of eating. I don't fucking know why. And if you do eat, it's not date setting & you go dutch. Fml. 
Asian plus point: The guys who do take you to posh restaurants are Chinese guys! Or if you were lucky as me to date one of the elite Malays in SG who are fkg rich(ya super rare but got), also treats you damn nice. Some days hawker food, some days hotel food, some days restaurant food. I think fairly reasonable. OH! And Asian guys will always pay, willingly. Once, we didn't go out much b/c he was broke. I offered to pay for dates cos I rly wanted to go out but he refused. 

2. Date Ang Moh can talk under the sun about intellectual shit
Fantasy: You think that because our education is based off british system & all the good universities are in Europe/US that westerners would want to hold intellectual conversations when in romantic relationships. That you'd read shakespeare together & talk about A Streetcar Named Desire. 
Reality: okay, no doubt they're very smart. So too are singaporeans in general. But somehow angmohs just don't talk about intellectual stuff during a romantic r/s. 
Asian plus point: on the other hand, the singaporeans I've dated & guy friends I have platonic r/s with talk about current affairs, fave lit books, social issues etc. and they like hearing my opinion on things. Heck, my boyf & I got into a rly heated argument abt freedom of choice which started out as a qn, turned into a debate and then an argument and then we fought so much, we broke up so that's the end of it. But wow! The intellectual rigour was amazing! 

3. Date Ang Moh can get married & have cute half-angmoh, half-asian baby
Fantasy: Mixed babies are just so adorably cute and they grow up to be the most handsome/beautiful people around. Asian gene pool can use a little more in the height department and blue/green/hazel eyes-yes please! 
Reality: Forget marriage with an Ang Moh. I don't understand what it is in their values but how they roll is basically, you're his forever girlfriend but he will never marry you. Perhaps you'll have kids together and it may or may not be deliberate. But marriage is of little importance to them. I went to IUSSP 2013 and the plenary session was about marriage profiles in different parts of the world. In 50 years, the trend in europe is that people won't be getting married anymore. They're likely to live together for a long time but not formally register the union. Think Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt except minus the glamour. My problem is... WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO BE A SINGLE PARENT? 
Asian plus point: In this regard, I'm pretty glad we're still traditional in a sense that getting married is a common objective in life here. I've broken up before because we both agreed we like each other but don't want to marry each other because we have different ideas of what our future spouse would be like. It's like a happy separation. Angmohs on the other hand, just want to keep you so they can still fuck you. 

Subjects are mainly aged 27-37. By Western, I mean European. By Asian, I mean local Singaporean. Western doesn't extend to include Australian & American. Never dated an Australian and only dated 1 american who wasn't white. He was black. Not African, but like Pacific Islander who liked Spanish food & dance a lot. Sample too small to generalize entire American population but I'd group him with Asian guys in terms of dating culture. 

The point of this post is that the world is changing. White guys ain't as strong as they used to be. Asian guys as as weak as they used to be. The power balance is shifting in favour of Asians and I think we should take stock of how our culture has grown and how we have things in our culture which should be maintained and appreciated such as respect for women. (As in like...we're not just some fuck toy you know? Pft.)

I'm wondering how many numbers of sexual partners is considered promiscuous, in Asian/Singaporean context. I heard in the West, apparently 10+ partners is still pretty normal.

The number of people who screw up and think its not their fault is ridiculous... how can they still blame other people when they are at fault?!? of course people will be pissed off when you do something wrong and yet they still dare to have expectations from others...

I'm not sure whether I'm being a prude here, but I don't want to have sex because I'm afraid of the consequences. I mean, condoms are not 100% effective and I don't want to risk anything. I really want to try it once with my boyfriend though...

I am the OP of . Firstly, I am a female, not his boyfriend... haha.
He is not marrying her out of social norms, nor did he reject me due to religion issues. In fact, both of us have the same religion, while his wife is from another... She wanted him to convert but was rejected before. 

I believe that he loves me... he says that he loves her. but i'm not sure whether he is saying this to force me to leave him. everything that he does just points to the fact that he indeed has feelings for me. 

but i know him. he is the responsible man that lives for everybody except for himself. once he made a promise, he will not take it back. i know that there are many reasons why he cannot cancel the wedding... the BTO flat, the deposits for the wedding that were already paid, her age (she's almost 10 years older than him, while I'm 2 years younger than him...), her citizenship that she gave up to be singaporean (although I would disagree that converting to singaporean can be considered as 'giving up' something), their parents' 面子, etc etc... 

even up till 2 weeks before the wedding, he was hesitant in proceeding with it. he didn't distribute the wedding invitation cards until 2 weeks before the day... 

In terms of age, family, religion, friends, living habits, occupation, interests etc, we fit so well.  But why did he say that I'm not suitable to marry him? We have fun together, and we work hard together... Even our mutual friend told me that he seems happier and more carefree when he is with me... The only thing is that I met him 2 years later than her... and I just don't earn as much as her that's all... 

Why can't he be selfish and fight for himself (and for us) for once?

I agree that NUSWhispers admin should stop filtering confession. 

Once, I posted a confession about something that happened during NS. Luckily that confession had been posted out because someone commented in that post and I was able to PM him about what happened during my NS day and that finally resolved a problem that had been bugging me for years.

It's 2015, why are people still choosing majors based on delusions of differential job prospects rather than simply by personal interest? Isn't this one of the least important lines in one's resume, assuming it isn't filled with tons of irrelevant details?
-
 
In response to  It's unfortunate that your experiences with psych majors have not been very positive. There are black sheep in every major, people who become presumptuous and full of themselves upon gaining some knowledge. I think flashing out fancy terms while conversing with people outside one’s major is not particular to psych majors. That said, I suppose psychology particularly lends itself to such "rude and condescending" behaviour since popular psychology is often about reading your personality, your relationships, your dreams, your past, your future. Some people might thus assume that studying psychology would give them the entitlement to do the same. 

But rest assured, psychology is much more than that. People study psychology for various reasons, and those black sheep are (hopefully) the minority. For me, while studying psychology has indeed allowed me to gain insights into human behaviour and the human mind, the myriad of theories and explanations out there remind me that there is no single clear reason for everything we see. Humans are complex beings; making fast, unwarranted assumptions about anyone’s thoughts/ personality/ behaviour etc., in my opinion, undermines the beauty of the human mind, and tarnishes the name of the field of study as a whole. I don’t think many psych majors would want to do that (or at least I hope not hahaha).

I have this good friend who recently started doling out more judgments about what I should or should not post on social media. She tells me that she's coming from a position as a friend and that certain things i post may come across as being boastful, etc. Can understand where she's coming from... but what i can't stand is that she asks incendiary questions like "why you want to post this?" (asked tauntingly) 1) stop being such an over-righteous and hypocritical prick cos you also post stuff like that on social media 2) If you truly care for me as a friend, why not tell me directly what you find wrong about it rather than asking questions? seriously annoying the hell out of me gtfo
-
 
I have a friend studying psychology, and he never fails to pass judgmental remarks based on his psychoanalysis of me and the theories from his course. And there is this other guy also from psychology who does that. Psych majors, I do hope you guys do not all behave like that. It's rude and condescending especially when you are not qualified yet to dish out diagnosis on people. I get that perhaps you are trained to think deeply about the question why, but sometimes you got to keep your opinions to yourself. Very sick of hearing stuff like "cognitive dissonance" shot at me when I am giving my honest opinion about something. Doing that just burns bridges.

If you're talking about societal norms. It's not normal. At all. At. All. Read about the abortion posts? Even safe sex can lead to pregnancy. And a lot more. Sure sex may be just another activity for you without much meaning but there are consequences. And you must be fucking stupid to not think about the consequences it might have on your relationship with her and the rest of your family. If it's a troll, it's a disgusting one. If it's true, get your horny sister some help.

To  "只有我們自己才可以決定自己的樣子"

Don't let the words of others hurt you emotionally as only you can define who you chose to be. Those are just mere judgements and does not neccessarily translate to the truth for it is all up to your own perception.

You may think that you are shy, introvert or socially awkward but i believe that irregardless of it, being able to portray yourself to others with your most confident self will be the breakthrough for the (psychological) barrier in those situations.

People get killed in Paris, Syria and other countries, and nobody bats an eye. A random OP posts about abortion, and everyone loses their minds.
-
 
To all the commenters, stop telling the OP not to judge, etc. She went through all the pain and suffering, and simply wanted to share her story  and some advice. I'm definitely pro-life, but I'm not against those who are pro-choice as I believe they have made the best decision for themselves at the point of time. 
But just to share that my mother suffered a miscarriage a few years after I was born, and till now, she still think of her unborn child once in a long while and even pray for him. Even though it was an accident, she felt the sadness and guilt for unable to protect her own child. Every child is a gift to parents. Perhaps once you become a mother of your child, you would understand.
Just think carefully and thoroughly before you go for abortion, and once you've made the decision, NEVER regret it. I believe your child would understand.

Those people who claim that they are defending "Asian Values" by doing stuff like petitioning against AdamLambert, petitioning for lgbt-friendly children books to be banned, wearing white during pink dot should stop hijacking "Asian" for their agenda which is more than often Christian. It is telling that none of the major Asian religions (Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism) are against LGBT. In Buddhism, lust is material attachment and both heterosexual and homosexual love are not welcomed. In Taoism, it is all a matter of yin-yang and different people have different elements. In Confucianism all is fine if you are filial and produce a heir, nobody cares what you do in your spare time. For Hinduism I am not familiar but the Hindu Council of UK had issued statement that Hinduism is not against LGBT. Especially to the ethnic chinese defending their "values", note that the first time gay sex is criminalized in China was during the era close to modern times and was due to western pressure. Attached is a Chinese painting.

Not choosing abortion is selfish? Having to carry a living thing in me for 9 months is selfish? Giving up my child to a couple that have been childless for years is selfish? You don't even make sense. I chose to bear the causes of my actions. Yes I do feel guilty that I am unable to look after her financially and emotionally. But this guilt is way better than killing your own blood. Me sharing my experience here is not for you to judge. I get that OP told us not to share any pro-life comments. But she needs to weigh in on the options available. Like I said, the decision is up to her. I don't want to her to regret this. Oh and OP, maybe you should learn the definition of quick fix before commenting. Giving your child away is not as easy as you claim it to be. With abortion, you're killing something you can't see or choose not to see. Holding your child and giving it away is the hardest thing I had to do. So to the OP of post  please think before you speak.  Agreeing to her decision doesn't make you a good person. Being  pro-abortion doesn't make you 'cool' and progressive as you think.

Quick question to you pro-life dickheads.

If a woman was brutally raped and impregnated. Is it justified for her to have an abortion?

If yes, does that go against the "scientific fact that life begins at conception"? Why does something that played no part in the initial attack have to pay with its life? 
If no, then why must a woman go through with 9 more months of suffering and emotional trauma? Would you still be a heartless twat and label her a murderer?

Yes, its taken a little out of context. But the main point is that the main issue with abortions is not whether its a "Living thing" or not, but the conditions of which the foetus is conceived. 

To the OP: I'm totally on your side. Don't bother listening to pro-life retards. As of now, its just a lump of flesh, like a cancerous growth. So chillaxxx, as far as anyone is concerned, your haters are just some fuck-ups with bastard children. Much like Cersei Lannister and you know what? Fuck the lannisters.
-
 
So many posts about abortion, can we just leave it to those with relevant experiences to share their accounts and advice? Those with pro-life or whatever agendas but no experience just shut up and take your arguments elsewhere. 
-
 
No duh, of course life begins at conception. But is it a life that -matters- ? If you want to argue that a fertilised egg cell is a life, then so is any other living cell. Single-cell organisms, plant cells etc are all living things.

If you decide to defend the life of one cell on the basis that it is "alive" then you are committed to defending the lives of all cells. If you don't, it makes you either a hypocrite or a logical failure. You might at this point of time say that a fertilised egg has a 'potential' to be a human and thus has more rights to live than a plant cell. But if you want to look at it that way, the plant cell still outweighs the egg. Humans are terrible, we kill animals and consume more plants. Whereas the plant cell will live its life not endangering any other living thing. Raising a human would cause more deaths if you consider all cells as living. 

Lastly, if I hold in my hand a Petri dish with a fertilised egg and an actual month old baby in my other hand and drop both at the same time, which would you be more inclined to save? 
-
 
What's with all this posts on abortion? I mean seriously you would take a person's life so lightly? Not to mention your own kids life! If you aren't responsible for safe sex then stop having it. Having sex before marriage isn't ethical anyway. And if you somehow get pregnant because of your own incompetence in using proper protection, deal with it the right way! Be a mother. Things like oh I am not ready to become one, or oh I want to enjoy life first before being a mother, are NOT decent human being excuses and reasons for wanting an abortion. If you have done that, no matter how many justifications you give yourself when you and your boyfriend sleep together at night, you are still a murderer. Not just that, a kin murderer. How could anyone ever kill their own spawn just over their own selfish desires and mistakes is so beyond me. It is so infuriating to read some of these justifications on whispers. Like what the hell really? Seriously? There is a special place in hell for you.
-
 
Life does begin at conception. Its's a scientific fact. Clearly you're in denial right now. You don't want to carry the emotional baggage that comes along with having this abortion. I get where you're coming from as I was in your position about two years ago. 

I was completely devastated when I found out I was pregnant. We were so safe! But it just had to happen. I was in shock and I had no idea how to tell my boyfriend about it. My parents were very conservative too. They had no idea I even had a partner. However, I too thought that I could go through this alone. You really can't. Trust me. So I ended up telling my parents first. Yes they were extremely disappointed. There's no way of avoiding that. But they were supportive too.They wanted me to have the child and give it up for adoption. Just like you, I didn't want to go through pregnancy. School was so important to me. I thought long and hard. I searched about giving up your child for adoption in Singapore. I was very surprised. Apparently, very few Singaporean babies are given up for adoption. These couples would then have to spend $20,000 just to 'adopt' a child online. It's awful. So I had the child. I took LOA. My parents took good care of me and I'm sure yours will too. We decided to go through MCYS. My daughter is now 2 and a half years old and she's with a wonderful couple that takes good care of her. You should have seen the joy on their faces when they met her. They were childless for 6 years. So me giving up my child meant the world to them. Please have this child. Having an abortion is just a quick fix. But after reading all the abortion stories online, you'll be scarred for life, both physically and mentally. You need to bear the consequences of your actions like I did. Going for an abortion is really selfish so I hope you think about it.

But if you really decide to go with abortion, you shouldn't be doing this alone. Your boyfriend has every right to know. He is equally responsible as well. Him going overseas should not be an excuse at all. This is major! Plus, his reaction would tell you where you stand in his life and ultimately where this relationship is heading to. My partner was extremely supportive through out my entire pregnancy and I hope yours would be too regardless of you decision. Take care.

Saw a lot of posts regarding abortions and the OP themselves stated they have used protections

Can the original OPs tell us what kind of protections did they use and what brand?
It is critical information that is helpful to all of us

I'm the OP of . I'd like to thank every commenter and subsequent OPs who wished me well and/or offered their help, know that I read every one of them and am greatly surprised and grateful for the support. However, as of now, I'm still leaning towards keeping my anonymity and am also just steeling myself mentally to go through it on my own, the way I know many young women have as well. 

However, to the OP of  - thank you so much for sharing your personal experience. May I know the breakdown of the timeframe it took you, from first screening appt, to the mandatory counselling, to the eventual abortion itself? Parkway, the one you went to, is a private hospital, so it's definitely much faster than the public route I'm likely to go through. 

I'm in a dilemma, because the poly + referral to a public hospital + appt for counselling + finally the appt for the abortion itself is known to take up to a whopping 4 weeks; which is why I mentioned "weeks". However, this route will "only" cost about $500-800. However, I would absolutely hate to go through pregnancy and the nausea for another month more, and it will be increasingly difficult to hide the nausea from my family, of all things. A more advanced pregnancy will also complicate the procedure further and also drive the price up even higher. Going to a private clinic would swiftly settle everything within a few days, but it will cost up to an insane $1.5-8k, which I can barely afford. I'm so stressed out.

So I kinda get mixed comments about my handwriting- some say it's horrible and unreadable (some teachers in JC said this), while some lecturers and other JC teachers commented that it was neat/funny. My friends have also commented on it too-they found it really unusual/special. Of course, some said it was unreadable. 

Just wondering if you all felt so? :O

Sigh OP, I know how you feel. My mum has stereotypical views on other races too. I am Indian and my girlfriend is Chinese. She was extremely angry when she found out about it. 'If you marry her, my grandchildren will not have nice facial features!' or 'She's probably very unhygienic. Your house will always be dirty!' Similar to your mum, she always ignores questions when relatives ask about my partner. She feels this isn't going to last. But it is. We've been together for two years now and I love her. Ultimately it's going to be our decision, not theirs. All the best in your relationship :)

I'm an NUS undergrad and I will be arranging for an abortion in a few weeks time - alone. My family can never know about it (they don't even know I'm sexually active and are very conservative) and neither can any of my friends, and my boyfriend, though supportive, is going to be overseas for months for official reasons that he cannot cancel. We have been using condoms 99% of the time, and yes...it just had to happen, in spite of the odds. It frustrates me to no end because we tried so hard to be responsible and all it took was one gone awry. 

I am so, so scared of going for the procedure alone. I will have no ride home and no one to accompany me throughout. Will I be safe? I know there are risks and pain involved, or even drowsiness post-abortion, what with the painkillers and sedation. I'm at a loss. I'm sure there are girls out there in NUS who've had an abortion before, maybe you could anonymously share your experience with me. 

Note: 
I do not want any judgmental pro-life comments now about "just keep the baby/you're a murderer" etc. I am in no position, physically, mentally, financially at this point in my life, to raise a child nor even to carry it to term (hobbling around NUS, no less - and even you moralistic pro-lifers would judge and shame); and besides, I do not believe that life starts at conception. 

The sole point of this post is to reach out to people who've had similar experiences and to seek some company and personal stories and real advice. This is not, I repeat NOT, the post to start an abortion debate or a self-righteous provocation. Do that elsewhere instead - there are plenty of forums dedicated to this. In light of my intent and situation, please be considerate to everything - physical and emotional - that people like me had to go through.

Trust me, I feel awful too. Perhaps I wasn't clear in my previous confession, but my main point wasn't that my dad was causing me extra stress, it was the frustration I felt in being told such a news YET not being allowed/able to go visit my relative. There were also other underlying circumstances that I did not bother to mention as it was just meant to be a rant to vent my frustrations. So please don't say such horrible things like "why don't you blame your relative for being sick at this point in time then huh?" when you have not grasped the whole situation.

But anyway I admit I did not consider it from my dad's point of view previously so thanks for making me aware of that, I guess.

Finding a partner is like finding food in the fridge at midnight. When you can't seem to find any, you lower your expectations and try again

To  , why don't you blame your relative for being sick at this point in time then huh? So insensitive right? Seriously, OP, your dad probably feels shittier than u over your relative's condition. The least u could do was say a word of comfort instead of blaming him for "causing u stress during exam period" when he probably didn't mean to.

This is for the girl who probably did not know the guy she’s in love with; is my boyfriend.

Dear Replacement,

There are a few things I think you should know, as you are now the object of his affection.

Don’t let it surprise you, how quickly you fall for him, and don’t be apprehensive in letting yourself fall. He’ll be there to catch you. Don’t let my Instagram and Twitter account intimidate you. There aren’t many pictures of us I posted, but those I posted did have very deep and meaningful yet sincere captions. And while I hate to admit it, the pictures are a thing of the past. He’s never posted any photos of us. He didn’t have the chance to. 

He may not talk about me to you; since you didn’t even know that he was with me. Anyway, he didn’t talk to his friends about it when it ended, so I don’t know if they will know either. It was a beautiful, one-sided love story of the past, but you are his future now.
We don’t know each other, and I am sure you already don’t like me. I resented you slightly when I first found out, but we do have something very wonderful in common, and it connects us whether we like to admit it or not.

I’m sorry that I can’t say I won’t text him or like his posts on social media because he is still my best friend. I can’t tell you every secret because it took me time to figure that out myself. But just trust that there are reasons he doesn’t say what you want him to, and there are reasons he doesn’t do what you want.

He will spoil you from time to time, but he is wise with his expenses; he spends money only when he needs to. He doesn’t like it when you spend your money on him. It makes him feel small. So, spoil him only when you really need to. You are going to notice how he gets excited like a child when it comes to certain things and learn to hear giggle in his laugh. Sometimes when he’s out with his mates, you will see him drunk. With me, he gets mad easily but that’s because I have a very negative mindset and he hates that. So, do your level best to be as positive as you can be. 

When he falls in love with you, you’ll notice you sleep better at night. When that happens, you’ll almost look forward to simple things, such as walks or taking a drive because he’ll reach for your hand and you’ll blush because no glove has ever fit it so well. He’ll do whatever you ask of him and you’ll rarely fight. He doesn’t like advertising things like relationships and feelings, so don’t expect that of him and don’t take it personally, just know he does love you and he’s just made to be that way. He may not think of you at every moment, but you’ll cross his mind often enough.

He has bigger dreams than he is confident enough to believe in, so it’s your job to tell him every day how handsome he is and how smart he is and that he is capable of it all. He won’t believe you, but don’t stop saying it! He’ll make you see the world in a new light, and you’ll start questioning things you never knew. He’s a great cook and you’ll have a hard time trying to lose weight. You’ll find yourself laughing at his little catchphrases, and if you do something he doesn’t like, he’ll never voice it out but you can see it in his expressions and by the tone of his voice. When you ask him about it, often enough he’ll say nothing but if your guts tell you he doesn’t like it.. trust your instinct.

When you two are out, he’ll watch you the whole time and it’ll seem like you are the only one in the room. He’ll twirl you as you walk and for that split second, you’ll feel like a princess. When you dance, it’ll seem perfect. Let none of this scare you and love him the way he deserves. He’ll tell you about the past and his mistakes, so it’s your job to take his hand and let him know you’re not judging him.

After all, he is a better person because of all of that and he’s found you because of failed relationships in the past. I hope you love him the way he deserves and I hope he loves you as deeply as I thought he did me. I hope he’s honest with you in a way he never was with me, but most of all, I hope he gives you the fairytale I thought would once be my life.

Also: Remember that I don’t dislike you, but if I’m being honest, I am jealous of you. I have found acceptance, but I’m also happy someone else gets a chance to experience what I did. I hope one day I can properly meet you. Like I said before, we have a connection that no one else can say they have and I’m sure you are a wonderful person. He looks at who a girl is first before falling in love with her appearance. It’s a rare quality in a man.

I only ask one thing of you: Please don’t hurt him the way his ex hurt him and also the way he hurt me. I believe in karma and I believe people get what they send out to the world, but I never wish that pain upon anyone, especially him. You are dating the man of our dreams and I truly mean it when I say I hope it all works out for you.

Sincerely, The Other Girl

To 

I know exactly what you mean! I had a similar experience at a public library last week.

The library apparently had some multiracial-themed events happening throughout the day - Chinese poetry, Malay story telling, Indian dance performances etc. So there were periodic messages made in all 4 languages. There was a girl, Chinese but not Singaporean, sharing my table and what got my hackles raised was that every time a message was made that was not in English or Chinese, she'd give very audible derisive sniggers which really pissed me off. I mean come on, if you want to live here, at least respect our multiracial make up. I'm Singaporean Chinese and I see no distinction whether Chinese, Malay, Indian or Eurasian, we're Singaporeans. I love my country and am proud of our multiracial makeup! It's this diversity that makes us distinctively Singaporean and I really hate anyone undermining it. Where does that sense of superiority come from?

This really makes me so angry.

I find it disgusting when people who claim to be christians treat others with no respect and empathy. Do you even know what Jesus stood for? I used to be a christian but lost faith in christians when I consistently came across people who don't practice what they preach.

To ,

Parents have a big influence on their children, for better or for worse yet sometimes the best judgement can only come from yourself. I was on the receiving end of a situation similar to yours; my ex's mom disliked me, straight from the start without even meeting me. There were various reasons, all of which I felt were uncalled for, some steeped in superstition and my build came into question as well. Unlike you, she did tell me about these comments from her mom, but refused to let me do anything about it to placate her mom or do anything about it herself. While there were various other reasons why we split, her mom's influence on her definitely played a big part. 

I'm not sure at this point why I'm even writing this, maybe I just wanted to let it out. I'll pass this on from my friend; just think rationally. If you know yourself that he's right for you, and that whatever "flaws" he has aren't rationally sound from what you know yourself, then don't doubt what you have with him. Relationships go both ways, and I think it's at times like this that you need to support him the most. Tell him about it, and work it out together. Hope it works out for you, and all the best for your remaining exams.

This morning, I went to a convenient store at NUH to get some stuff. I spoke to the counter staff in English and he threw me this weird and paranoid look. He then replied in Chinese. With a very strong China accent, he proclaimed "can you speak Chinese? You are Chinese,  can't you speak Chinese!" Shocked by this statement, I replied in Chinese "sure, I can speak in Chinese, but this is Singapore". He went on to say "Singapore means Chinese. Chinese is Singapore". I was so annoyed and told him "Singapore is Singapore. Not Chinese". I paid for my stuff and left. I walked to Kent ridge station and was welcomed by all the friendly Malay staffs at the station.... At promenade station, a malay lady at the platform hurried me into the train cabin with patience and a warm wide smile. On the train, I made a call to a customer service center and an Indian lady picked up. She was so nice, so helpful and understanding. I really love my country and the nonsense by that  staff really angers me. I grew up in a multi-racial environment. It's made up of 4 different ethnic groups and it doesn't belong to any single one but everyone. The soldiers spent 2 years of their life protecting this country regardless of language, race and religion. I wonder how this foreign friend of ours got the idea that this country belongs to a certain community only. I'm a singaporean, who happens to be of Chinese ethnicity and even I'm pissed off.

Response to 

It's true that some Christians have no respect and empathy for others - I'm saddened that you have lost faith because of such people. But religion doesn't necessarily determine morality or behaviour. After all, people are not morally infallible. Sometimes we let the behaviour of other Christians dominate our views of this religion. Just because some Christians behave this way doesn't mean that all Christians behave this way. 

I'm a Christian myself but I recognise that people who are compassionate and genuine come from all religious backgrounds, and not all Christians behave the way we expect them to. I'm glad you have referred to Jesus - no matter how cruel the world was to him, he didn't turn his back on us but instead he remained firm in his beliefs. Even Jesus's disciples did things that were inconsistent with his teachings. 

I really hope this doesn't turn you away from Christianity because the Christians that you mentioned may not truly reflect what Christianity is about. Praying for you

Reading about pre-marital sex, the ongoing debate. I believe to conclude, we should just live by our own value system and go by it. If we feel that pre-marital sex is ok then go by it. If we feel that pre-marital sex is not ok then don. Whatever we do today, we need to be answerable one day.

To know whether having premarital sex matters, follow the studies. If you want to marry your partner and stay that way, it matters.

Is there any guy out there who:
1. Uses English as his first language
2. Not religious
3. Does not have any dietary restriction & can eat spicy food
4. 24 years old and above

Because most guys I know are either English-speaking and hardcore Christians or non-religious but more comfortable speaking in their mother-tongue. If there's a guy out there who fits the 4 descriptions and is single, please leave a like on this post or comment! At least it'll give me a peace of mind that there's somebody out there who fits my requirements.

Thanks for sharing. 

As much I would like to believe in true love.. it's really rare for people to find the one person that they love and for both of them to stick with each other for the rest of their lives.

Listen, you shouldn't regret that you kissed your ex. It doesn't make you any less of a woman (i assume) or a person. That is actually what I was trying to say. 

I don't claim to understand love fully, but surely heat-of-the-moment, passionate love is also a form of true love. Furthermore, nobody loves perfectly from the beginning. It's only through failed experiences that you learn to love your final partner properly.

I certainly can't change how you personally feel about sex or intimacy. However, my point is that as a whole, this social construct that virginity is important is detrimental to how society values girls and how girls value themselves. And, like I said, it's really just a circular argument. A needlessly demeaning circular argument.

why am i doing this i have 2 papers tomorrow -.-

Confession: I do not really care about the environment. I do see a point in making an effort to preserve the environment personally. For example, when I see a recycle bin, I would throw my recyclables into the normal dustbin because it is nearer. :D

And also that fact that I would like to try the meat of those endangered animals before they go extinct. I feel sad that I could not eat dodo bird and dugong meat since they went extinct before my time and their meat are said to be delicious.
PS: I wonder how panda meat taste like

'The Bill states unlawful stalking as engaging in a course of conduct which causes harassment, alarm or distress to a victim; and the accused intends or ought to reasonably know that it would do so.' If I don’t even want to speak to you through message, it is apparent that I would not want to speak to you even in person. Showing up unannounced at my lecture twice when I didn’t even know you knew my location (and which you have never done before) is both scary and unwelcome. Your faculty is nowhere even near mine for goodness' sake. Harassment includes 'speaking or acting in a threatening, abusive or insulting way such that a person becomes harassed, alarmed or distressed’. You’re so emotionally unstable that you launch vulgarities and abusive messages repeatedly at a person you claim to be attracted to when you don’t get what you want. If you cannot even respect personal space and are so deranged in your language, how would I know how far will you go in your creepy pursuits? My friends have followed me to every single class and exam and my parents have picked me up from school every weekend after that incident because of your horrifying sociopathic behaviour. There was always the fear that you would attack me savagely as in the case of Annie Siow Lee Khoon who was slashed and mutilated by her admirer. Examples of acts which are associated with stalking in the Bill include following a victim or a related person, attempting to make any communication by any means to the victim and giving or sending material to the victim. Can you still say your behaviour does not constitute harassment? 

Your compulsive need to twist stories to portray yourself in a positive light even on an anonymous platform is so telling of the very sort of person you are. Trying to justify your sociopathic behaviour with what happened in the past does not make it any more acceptable for you to repeatedly send me vulgar messages or stalk me. Ignoring and telling one directly not to look for me and contact me anymore is obvious enough for most - I don’t know how much clearer it takes for the message to get through. I don’t have to explain or justify to you my decision to keep our acquaintanceship at the superficial level it was always at. Partly why I didn't tell you directly why I did not wish to remain friends is because of your emotional and psychological instability which I did not want to antagonise and put myself in peril. I hardly see how I can be responsible for your wishful thinking nor obligated to talk to you as and when you please. Despite what you said about another guy being involved, I chose to relinquish this bare shell of a friendship because of your moral and social inadequacies - your lack of respect for personal space, inflated ego that you think you're so great that those who refuse to patronise you are inferior and male chauvinist pig tendencies that you refuse to see how a female can make decisions independently. In any case, the involvement of another guy is completely irrelevant given that you were a mere acquaintance. Relegating the cause of our failed friendship on me or 'another guy' is a mere symptom of your self conceit and refusal to reflect upon yourself and your own flaws. Stop trying to ennoble yourself by claiming you were hurt by the loss of our friendship when you didn’t contact me for a few peaceful months. It’s your super inflated ego that hurts because you cannot see how anyone could possibly not want a friendship with you. You’re so in love with yourself that in order to protect your pride you tell even someone who wants to minimise contact with you to f*** off ironically when you should be doing so. It’s pretty clear that your self-esteem matters the most to you and you’re so self-absorbed that you cannot even accord others the minimum basic respect, much less have the capacity to like someone. You only like someone in as far as that person fuels your ego so just stop taking incidents out of context to make yourself look like the victim. 

Rest assured that my friends are not disposable because unlike you, they have the decency to respect personal space.

As for the victim blaming comments, do recognise that a person has the right to live peacefully without being stalked or harassed irrespective of whether the person chooses to be friends with a person or not.

I know that I'm fortunate. Born into a family that would never have to worry about finances, having the opportunities that many don't.. etc.
However, I really hate it when friends mock it? Sometimes I might complain about something being expensive (Like hello, my family may be well to do but not me), and they'll say "Aiya you how rich? Confirm can buy". Sometimes I might come across a deal that seems good to me and they'll say stuff like "Eh sorry people not as rich as you!"

I REALLY HATE IT ARGH.

I think the phrase "He will accept you if he truly loves you" is abused by people who trivialize whatever issue is in contention between a couple. It is a thoughtless passing remark that does not add any value. Commentators who have the urge the say this should perhaps remain silent instead.

Since we're on the sex before marriage issue, allow me to play devil's advocate and offer my extreme opinion:

I think the idea of saving your virginity until marriage is misguided. In fact, I'll even go as far as to say that it is unhealthy.

Mainly I feel that a girl should not be valued based on her virginity or her sex life. You never see guys worrying about saving their virginity until marriage (well actually you do, but much less), so why must girls be restricted to the same standards? This just perpetuates gender stereotypes in society and contributes to inequality. 

To take things further, think about girls who have suffered sexual assault or rape. Does that mean they are of any less worth? I hope not. But such a societal attitude can only worsen the trauma experienced by these girls. Now, I am not saying that a change in opinion will make it any less painful for these victims, but it will certainly help in the recovery process to understand that there are things in life that matter more than virginity or sex.

Now. Let's take a look at your view. The main argument in the other side of the debate is that virginity is something you should save for the person you love/marry (hopefully the same person). And if not, you will be haunted by all the times you did "it" with other people..

Frankly.. it's just a circular argument, isn't it? 
"Virginity is impt cos if u lose it u will regret it cos virginity is impt."

I know I've probably trampled on the staunch beliefs and values of many out there. But think about it: where did these beliefs about premarital sex come from? Aren't these just social constructs passed down from generation to generation?

Reading NUSWhispers on FB everyday is akin to reading The Quibbler. Occasionally, some people wrote as if Luna Lovegood became a muggle and wrote her own page.

This whole sex thing ah, think about it this way. If you buy a car, you need to test drive right? If you buy a house also need to go for open house right? Same for marriage, if you don't fuck your significant other before you get married how can you be so sure that he was not a she or that he doesn't have a puny dick. Say what you want but sex is an important part of marriage, not the most important, but certainly an important aspect. 

And for those people who remain abstinent, well, your loss. Guess you'll never find out if your boyfriend prematurely ejaculates. Whoops.

Response to comments 

I'm not the author of this confession but I personally think your views are prejudiced. The author didn't want to have any contact with the guy, and not responding is clearly an expression of this intention. In fact, I personally think this act (of omission) speaks louder than telling the guy. 

It's more worrying that this guy would continue harassing the author in such a situation. Shouldn't he have enough common sense to get the drift? A normal person wouldn't keep pestering someone he/she hasn't spoken to for ages like that. The author's refusal to reply the guy doesn't give him the right to call her names and stalking her. Given the facts, it looks like the guy has a very misguided impression of this relationship, acting like the author is obliged to speak to him after months of absence. 

Blaming the author for this guy's harassment looks like victim-shaming. I don't think the author has done anything to warrant such behaviour from that guy.

D.U.F.F.: "An abbreviation for 'Designated Ugly Fat Friend'. Often in many large groups of women there will be a D.U.F.F. as a means to look better by comparison."

No matter how far away from labels we try to get, there exists an unspoken social hierarchy. This is just one of the many examples of such. There's one in every group no matter our age, gender or scene.

 I think self-confidence is similar to any other character trait and cultivating it consciously takes effort and time. You can start by deliberately putting yourself in situations which you feel uncomfortable in, or avoiding running away from such situations, e.g. studying or eating alone in school etc. And be persistent to follow these rules that you've laid down for yourself. As time passes, hopefully things will change for the better.

Mentally wise, you also need to constantly remind yourself that you're awesome and it doesn't matter how others look at you, but only how you look at yourself. That so long as you are working towards to be the person whom you aspire to be, or towards your dreams, that is all that matters. Role-models whom you really respect will come in handy here, especially one whom has told you that you're great or that you'll will be great.

Seeking change in yourself is part of personal growth and doesn't come easy. Wanting this change already shows a brilliant part of your character and I would think you're off to a great start, since you've already embraced and acknowledged your own flaws. While seeking this change and improvement, remember too to revel in your past accomplishments and to accept credit when it's due. :)

Till now I'm still apprehensive about going to western countries for exchange or just for a vacation. It's mainly because I've hear many stories of how they discriminate against chinese and Asians. True, now the world talks about equality and all, but deep inside us, we are still judgemental. I once had a friend who went to London for exchange, and when she was queuing up for her coffee, a group of ang mohs just jeered at her in English. My friend rebutted and said her native tongue is English and she understood them. 

You tell me. Even in London, such a modernised and cultured place. You have these people booing at Asians just because we look different. Ang mohs can come here immerse themselves in our culture. Why can't we do so in their country? Seriously why the disparate treatment? That's why I hesitate to go to these places. I would rather go to places that respect us than to go to places that look down on us.

I don't know who you think you are but just because someone does not reply you (nor want to talk to you) doesn't give you the right to swear at her and call her crude names. It's disgusting how you act like we are extremely close and have a 'thing' going on when we haven't spoken for months. Friendship or any relationship, for that matter, is not something at your beck and call - you can choose to neglect when you don't feel like maintaining it and converse again when it's convenient.  Your presence in my life is unwelcome given that your intrusion, both physical and verbal, verges on harassment. I can't be bothered telling you this to your face if you can't even show the slightest respect for personal space and privacy. Not wanting to be friends does not constitute a 'problem' for me despite how you keep shamelessly and senselessly insisting it is because it's not bothering me at all. The same cannot be said for you and your stalking habits. If you think spouting idiocies at me because I won't talk to you derogates me, it's actually a mere reflection of your social ineptitude and utter lack of civility.

To  Yes, it’s definitely a lot more common than you think, and it’s fine to not know whether you’re compatible in bed before marriage. I don't know about you, but to me that’s not the most important thing to look for in a life partner. So think about what’s most important to you. You’ve been with this girl for over a year; how’s your compatibility like in terms of character, values, outlook on life, etc? Are you saying that if she was perfect for you in all these areas but wasn’t perfect in the sex department, or if she looked hideous naked (I would think most people look similar and just fine naked), you’d actually leave her? 

Like others have mentioned, it’s impossible for most couples to be 100% sexually compatible from the get go. Have a read of accounts of people having sex for the first time after marriage (there are plenty on the net, just google) - couples who have been abstinent all the way until marriage are not going to be sex gods the first few times. I’m sure exceptions are out there, but we’re talking the majority. Most of the time it starts out awkward. It then gets better over time as you communicate and slowly “learn” how to have sex with each other. It sounds silly, but it’s really something most couples work through in a mutually loving and caring relationship. And it doesn’t have to start off as BAD sex; it can still be fun, because you’re exploring it for the first time with the person you love. It’s definitely still exciting and intimate. My point is - it’s a learning process, and that’s what relationships are about in the first place. You learn and adapt to each other’s preferences and needs in bed, just as you learn and adapt to all of each other’s non-sexual preferences and needs in life. 

I say good on you for respecting your girlfriend’s choice to not have sex before marriage. Don’t be one of those guys who force their girls into doing it for their own gain - trust me, that’s not love. Love is respect, trust and communication. Definitely talk to your girlfriend, but understand that you’re not doing it to pressurise her into changing her mind if she’s firm in her values and beliefs. Talk to her because she’s your closest confidante, and because you’d like her to understand the struggles you’re going through, so that she can support you through it. Please seek proper help if you need to, or post anonymously on forums (and I mean legit forums dedicated to sexual health and things like that. NUSWhispers may not be the best place because some of the people here have given downright ridiculous advice) for advice on how to deal with sexual urges in an abstinent relationship, google for ideas, etc etc. There are more likeminded people out there than you think. It’s hard, but it can be done, and I speak from experience.

If you’re thinking about hooking up with girls or engaging “professional services” from the bad advice that someone else has posted, please for the love of god, DON’T. I cannot emphasise this enough. I don’t want to belittle your feelings for your girlfriend, but if you’re considering sleeping with other girls to satisfy your own needs and you’re actually prioritising that above the relationship with your girlfriend that has been built on trust and respect so far, then maybe you don’t love her enough. Please REALLY think about it long and hard. Yes, she may never find out. But what if she does? You’re about to destroy the girl you love with your own bare hands in the most brutal way ever. You’re about to take the trust that she’s given so wholly to you and trample all over it, because you selfishly love your own needs more than the relationship that you’ve been working so hard to protect over the past one year. Even if she never finds out, are you ready to live with the guilt for the rest of your life? Because this is cheating, period. You may think it won’t hurt her if you go behind her back and if she never finds out. But no, that does not make it any less wrong, hurtful or unethical. Your relationship (and subsequent marriage) would be one built on lies and deceit, not love and trust. Believe me OP, you’re better than that. Guard your relationship with your life. Don’t take chances, don’t take risks, and don’t underestimate your ability to hurt her as well as your relationship. One wrong step is enough to set off a lifetime of regrets. In short: If you love her, don’t do it. If you do it, leave her because she deserves better.

Lastly, it’s not embarrassing to be a virgin. Like someone else rightly said, it’s only as embarrassing as you choose it to be. And you most certainly do not need to keep your friends updated about your sex life. If you’re really embarrassed about being a virgin (I don’t know how your friends are like, but I understand that some less mature minds may deem it uncool/whatever), no one else has to know about it other than your girlfriend and yourself. You don’t need to confess to anyone about something so private and personal. Yes some guys brag about their sexual escapades, but you don’t have to be that kind of guy. I personally feel that those who don’t actually command a lot more respect.

I wish you the best of luck, OP. I’m sure she’s an amazing girl and I’m sure you love her. I understand that this is something very hard to deal with, but trust me, there are many success stories of abstinent relationships out there. Again, I speak from experience. I sincerely hope you make the right decision for yourself. Treasure your relationship, fight hard to protect it. Remember that she loves you and trusts you. Don’t, don’t, don’t break her heart.

People need to learn (and fast) that grades awarded under a bell curve are not a reflection of the absolute amount of effort and hard work they put in, or their absolute intelligence or competence. B or C grades should therefore NOT be interpreted as 'you are not good' or 'you did not work hard'. It only means 'the rest did better'. Likewise, it is possible for an entire class to fall a bit short of the expected learning outcomes, but good grades still awarded to the top performers despite low absolute scores across the board. What then?

Out in the real world, the prospective employer does not care if you're 'quite good' at something if all the other candidates do it better.

We always lament that what we learn in uni is poorly representative of the real world, but this is one important thing it does get right. Evidently though, some people are still resistant to accepting it.

I think all humans are to be tracked in every way such that they will be nice people throughout their lives. When they lie, they will be exposed immediately. When they critise others for some action, they will be found to be doing the same thing. 
Beware! For it will soon be a reality! Good luck to all evilness! Justice shall be served!

 There are many projects you can do on your own outside school if it bores u. There are many books u can read to gain practical knowledge. Don't limit your life to grades.

"When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. 

Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.

That's a very limited life. 

Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. 

Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."

I'm sure not every girl thinks like me, and not many guys would accept a girl like me. But for me personally, I cannot marry someone knowing that I have to live under the same roof with his parents or even with my own parents. I know how much friction there can be when living with the in-laws after marriage (whether they are my own parents or his parents). So for me, that is an immediate deal-breaker. 

I would much rather live in a place within walking distance to the parent's house than actually living under the same roof. 

I wonder how many people, men and women, feels that having to live with the in-laws is a deal-breaker? I suspect there will be a significant number of people who wants to live with their own parents and not with their in-laws after they are married, something which I find hypocritical. But I doubt anyone would admit it in the comments.

Regarding the Letterbox app, amidst all the petty complaints about people not replying and ghosting, people neglect that their personal information is being eaten like a buffet by online predators.

After a intense discussion with my brahs, we ended up with one conclusion. Girls should never confess to guys. 7/7 of us believed that girls who confessed to us must be slightly deformed or mentally retarded to like us. Or either that they have terminal illnesses and would want us to take care of them. Our offsprings would probably not be healthy as well.

So if you are thinking of confessing, don't do it girls. Unless you can show us your health booklet to prove that y'all are perfectly healthy physically and mentally.

 Were you direct? I’m a guy and sometimes it’s really hard to understand what girls are thinking especially when they aren’t direct, or any other person for that matter. In any case, please do be patient with him. If anyone is willing to spare their time to lend his/her listening ear to you despite their commitments, you must be part of his/her priority. Priority here meaning high priority? This is of course not to say that if one doesn’t lend his/her listening ear to you despite their commitments, you are not of high priority to him/her, as he/she may have other high priorities as well. For analogy, its like all three pokemon, charmander, squirtle and bulbasaur are very and equally important. If given a choice, any pokemon master would bag all three if not for professor oak’s stinginess, or at least attempt to achieve a satisfiable compromise. But then, if one can only choose one out of the three, it will be a mind-splitting decision to make. Does that help and is that satisfactory?

In short, just be patient with your friend as he might be just like the spinda below, can’t understand you but tries to, and is extremely cute and lovable. :)

Recently, a life changing thought came from one of the most basic activities I had rushed past blindly in my busy life in pursuits. As my family ate out at a hawker centre, I watched as people, young and old, came and left in such a leisurely pace, a stark contrast to the mad rush that turned me into a scatter brain every day. And we entered a short discussion, where someone remarked, "yeah, that's just the life of a heartlander. Come back from work at 6+, go for dinner, maybe if you're up for it catch a movie. My favourite is the midnight ones especially on Friday nights. Otherwise just go home, watch some TV with kids. Then when there is 4D or Toto they will tune in to the radio and listen, then 'waaaaaa win already ah! Must buy me a drink tonight!'"

The simplicity of such a life irked me initially. It was living by the day, without any thought of future consequences, or how the time could have been spent to take some courses, etc, something that translates to real value in terms of material standard of living in future.

For as many years as I could remember, I have been a fortunate person. I still am now, in fact. Being born into a family with good finances and a healthy environment that supports and even pushes me to greater and better achievements and aspirations. Everything had aligned themselves in my favour, or so it seems. Studying in good classes with stellar grades for most of my life, I was insulated in an environment of individuals with similar family backgrounds: wealthy enough to afford year after year of tuition, expensive CCAs that they continue to learn in their parents/relatives condo facilities, etc. Nothing changed as I progressed on to secondary school, JC and now uni, where I was always conveniently surrounded by individuals from well to do families, who were high achievers in their respective fields.

As such, my only view on life was that I should always strive and aspire towards excellence - which had been the norm perpetuated by the lack of exposure to other circles - to the point that I felt that to steer away from that endless pursuit of self improvement wasn't just an aspiration, but a duty for all who wish to call themselves "responsible adults".

But on further thinking, I realised, isn't life so much more enjoyable that way? To fully immerse in the moment, to experience the joy in that instant, untainted by future preoccupants. To know that tomorrow will be the same, that making a wrong decision will simply be a small difference between spending on unnecessary goods or saving that $100-$200, instead of the disappointment of hundreds to a thousand people at my inadequacy (yes, I do work on things on that scale). 

The life of a heartlander, of being average, or seeing yourself as potentially being that in the future... why should people "withdraw" in a conversation by saying, "no la, no as upz as ______/you" or "no la, people like us can only...". There is no sin in wanting only to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. 

Just as Gandalf said, "Saruman believes it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? I don't know. Perhaps because I am afraid, and he gives me courage." 

Finding meaning in the everyday, that is the wisdom of the heartlander.

TL;DR - sometimes, the greatest contributors to our happiness aren't the occasional groundbreaking achievements, but the little things that happen in our everyday.

I hate getting wedding invitations.
After attending countless weddings, the event itself has lost its significance. Flooded with wedding invitations that I don't even feel joy or find meaning in the ceremony anymore.
Why are weddings such a big affair? Shouldn't it be personal? Why must people invite the entire social network? Is it for money? Glory? To fulfil social obligations of what a wedding should be like in today's day and age?
The modern wedding has become an expensive affair and a chore.
1. What are your thoughts on weddings?
2. What do you do when someone invites you to their wedding?

Should I reconsider marrying my fiance if his mother plans on staying together with us, and I do not see eye-to-eye with her on many household issues? My fiance dislikes conflict and is likely to side with his mother. I do not wish to force him to take sides, or distance him from their strong mother-son bond. She is widowed and I wouldn't want her to live alone either. To prevent future clashes and arguments in the future, should I call off the engagement? Any input would be wonderful.

I don't understand how Sun Ho got away scot free in the whole CHC saga. I mean, the funds were used for HER career in the US, and she apparently lived in a mansion while promoting there. Her albums made significant financial losses. How is it that she has managed to avoid prosecution and is now able to return to life as per normal, even being "promoted" to pastor in place of her husband?

Personally, I feel that there are too many people over the years bashing City Harvest Church (CHC) for the methodology that they employed in order to  welcome new members of the faith or collate funds for the church; which I personally feel is uncalled for. I attended CHC before with a few of my friends and personally feel the atmosphere of the auditorium was overwhelming and I had a few experiences where I was pushed onto the stage to be "welcomed" or what many would say "forced" to convert. When there were offerings to be given, they would pass around an envelope where you could either tick on the giro option to transfer cash or donate using hard cash. All these were ways the cell groups would employ in order to collate funds for the church and make them have a greater sense of achievement or feel that they have served their duty as God's servant. Also some of my CHC friends were also ambassadors of the church and had to spread the good news of the Lord by convincing non-believers and let them have a chance to be in the presence of the Lord. All these methods to bring in more people and raise funds for the church may seem plain to most Singaporeans as a facade or scam now; but what most of us have to understand is these are how megachurches operate. It is how most churches around the world operate in order to bring in new members of the faith. This to me is not a facade or scam but instead it is just a method to expand the church so more will be able to recognise and cross paths with God. Also all these are a not a result of the religion but instead it is the action of individuals of the various cell groups that result in all the fanciful recruiting and donation ideas. Hence, people should not lose faith in the religion but instead figure your personal connection with God and never lose hope in your faith. However, regarding the verdict of Kong Hee, it is a fact that he misappropriated the funds of CHC and resulted in the "meltdown" of the larger conglomerate. But still, we must still have faith that God has other plans for him and him going to jail may just be another challenge God wants him to face by himself. This may seem like bullshit to the non-believers of God. However, I personally feel as much as you think he is guily, but everyone deserves a second chance and trying to stone a man while he's down is just an unkind gesture.
P.S Not a CHC member. I know there are many flaws in my arguments but hey confessions after a vodka shot aint never gonna be that fantastic
-
 
I don't mean to be offensive, but I seriously don't understand how CHC members can still be so loyal to Hong Kee and gang despite their shenanigans, and even lament that their sentences were too harsh. Personally, I would have preferred that they rot in a jail cell for all of eternity. Taking advantage of religion to pilfer money from the masses is just a screwed up thing to do, no matter what religion.

I was reading  and I feel exactly the same.
I cannot disclose my feelings nor my real status, and I know that I can never be in a real relationship.
My friends and family will never understand why - why I choose honour over my own interests and how I am in a situation which is different from the common or rich folk.
All this because of my one promise, my pledge to the people, whom I have chosen to protect.
Because of this, I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.  I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come. 
Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death

Saw a question here regarding nipple piercing. Hope you've been doing your research on the safety aspects (instead of just whether guys will like it ><)
Just for more info,
The piercing will have different effects on different bodies. If you're larger breasted, might be a little more painful. But the healing process is about 3-6 months. There is less likelihood of infections here but still be careful, wash with saline solution. You could get discharge even several months or years after your piercing but it's usually nothing serious. There is a possibility of loss of sensitivity or gain in sensitivity or possibly no change at all. There are other possible side effects like cysts, nerve damage, or surrounding tissue becoming hardened. While there is a risk, It doesn't mean you will experience these things. So it's up to you to make an informed choice whether you want one or not. Do go to a certified one though, they will charge more but that's cos they sterilize their equipment and are the only safe ones around, really. 
P.S. It wasn't as painful as it is made out to be. Can handle.

I am sick of hearing the notion of ' violence doesn't solve problem'. Please, can those of you living in the fairy tale wake up your idea? let me put it this way, if Violence doesn't solve problem, we would not have police, army and etc. All we need is priests, judges... Can you guys understand the fact that Violence DOES play a big part in solving problems? Well, that being said, it is true that VIOLENCE ALONE does not solve problem. You have to come up with others in order to look at the root of the problems, whether its poverty or other sorts of unfairness. But to those of you thinking by using pure love to eliminate extremism and terrorism, history has shown and will continue to show, without counter violence, more and more innocent lives will be lost. So please stop advocating the fact that let's use love against violence , if they understand love, they would not ave killed innocent lives. Please stay united and show some responsibility to our next generation and stop giving them the impression that violence is useless.

 Perhaps the issue isn't that he's too busy but rather the problem is with the means of communication? This may be unlikely depending on the circumstances, but may be the case especially if you guys are in different geographic locations. Even if he/she is too busy, the means of communication is problematic, or for whatever other reasons, I'm sure you are still constantly running in his/her mind; everyone's mind frequently wanders, including mine whether or not we choose to, and he/she will think of you. After all, you guys are under the same blue sky. :) Aside thinking, he/she may be looking at past messages you sent him/her and smiling to himself/herself, stalking you on social media etc., so stop lying on the floor! :)

Once someone judged me for my handwriting. Could see the disdain in his eyes. He said that once, a teacher reprimanded him for his bad handwriting and ever since he had practiced and is now able to write nicely. Indeed his prints were very legible.

I was put off because it is not as if no one told me before and as if I never tried to improve my handwriting. There are so many benefits to better handwriting. He seems to assume that all people can achieve good handwriting just because they will it. But that's not the case in reality because everyone's hand is differently shaped with different muscle tone. 

Some people scoff at my handwriting but at least an equal number appreciate it's elegant cursive quality. So folks who have bad handwriting how do you feel about your own handwriting and have you/could you do anything about it?

 To the people trying to accuse this OP of stirring social conflict, i think if OP wanted to do that, it could have been done in a more effective manner, but that was probably not the intention. But i guess you've missed the point.

I dont think most Singaporeans are completely against SPRs/New citizens, Singaporeans understand the need for them and try our best to tolerate and integrate them. And many of us actually do, we have many good friends within our community, Malaysians, Indonesians, Vietnamese etc etc.

But a common general consensus seem to be somewhat against THAT particular country. True they may not make up the majority of SPRs/New citizens, but they sure as hell make up the majority of Ugly incidences occuring in Singapore.

Just a random improbable suggestion: From now, lets take up SPRs/New citizens from every other country except that country!! Whee~

 I feel that the most depressing reminder of the Paris attacks, beyond the cruelty that humans are capable of showing to their own kind, is that sympathy is a finite resource and humans have a limited attention span for tragedy. 

Why pray for Paris and not Syria? Why save the panda and not the pig-nosed frog? Why donate to breast cancer research and not literally any other type of cancer research? The answer is as obvious as it is discouraging: there are so many bad things happening in the world that people only have the attention to focus on those with the most simplistic, straightforward, good-versus-evil storylines.

And yet, can we really blame the world for not giving more, when they are already giving? Can we blame people for donating to the SPCA instead of the Red Cross or Community Chest? How justified are we in saying that people's kind intentions are misplaced or insufficient, when kind intentions are by definition going beyond what is obligated? Perhaps one day, in the hopefully near future, we will develop the capacity to pray for all who need prayer in equal amount. But for now, this might be all the blood we can draw from this stone revolving around the sun.

PS: if you're going to ask "does anyone else feel this way" on the internet, the answer is almost certainly going to be "yes".

 I really doubt whether your coworkers, despite being from the-country-that-should-not-be-named-explicitly-for-the-sake-of-being-politically-correct, would have done things like littering given that they have received university education. I do agree that a lot of people from that country don't behave properly overseas, but I guess your post is more to create social conflicts than to rant. And yes, I'm from that country as well.

For the sake of sensitivity and not having this post blocked I shall not name specifics.

I'm a recent engineering graduate whom join an engineering company largely dominated by foreigners, also graduates either from local unis or their respective countries. Most of them are from this particular country, i was surprised that a SG based company could hire so many foreign workers only to find out that they actually hold PR or Citizenship status(mostly citizenship if they are from this country).

I've had to adapt to a new environment and overcome a culture shock even within my own country but i guess its something we all need to get used to in time to come. But one very sad incident made me feel like i am no longer Singaporean.

On the way back from lunch with colleagues i saw two of them throwing canned litter on the ground after they've finished their drinks. I picked it up and told them in their native language that they should not litter and walk a few more steps to the bin instead. They laughed at me saying im a goody good shoes Singaporean and that they don't care because this is not "their country" anyway and it doesn't matter if they litter or not as long as they don't get caught.

I was not upset but rather very puzzled and told them, aren't you holding Singapore Pink IC? Isn't this your country now? They said they that the rectangular piece of plastic is only for the privileges they can get, and they only regard their "motherland" to be their own country. I said ok, I understand, and walked to the bin to throw their litter instead.

I felt helpless, hopeless and sad. Not because of a few such individuals but because i know they represent the majority, I'm sure there are few kind and responsible ones but I've yet to see many. I completely understand the political and demographic needs to import foreigners especially from this country but i can't help but feel that I am less of a Singaporean now after that incident, the reality is that nothing can be done about it.

Anyone can related and provide some thought?

On the attacks in Paris on the Friday the 13th

Just want to know how many of us really have had emotions of disgust, hatred, anger and repulsion (or any other emotion in this domain) being elicited upon hearing about the attacks? I see my feeds being flooded with #prayforparis and I am extremely cynical about the significance of us using this hashtag. Why is it only when an attack on civilians in a Western democratic country will then there be such a massive response?

I'm not apathetic to what has happened; I am blessed enough to understand and propose several theories on why this attack occurred. Rather, it is more of ambivalence that I feel. Does anyone else feel this way?

There's something I really wanted to say, but I never got the opportunity to. I've been really fortunate to have worked with manageable group members, but I believe this is a problem that most people face in group assignments.
_
I've heard my peers (even from other institutions) complain that sometimes their group members don't given an ounce of concern over their progress, and sometimes, they justify their absence on their commitment to other activities, and I strongly believe that it is valid justification.
_
I do. But I just don't deem it acceptable. I believe that it is perfectly acceptable only when it boils down to your individual assignments and homework. I know people might assume that I'm salty about it but if you think calmly about the state of affairs, you'll need to understand that it's an assignment done by the full group and not by a few individuals in the group. So it requires a collective effort.
_
You need to understand that whatever you do implicates your innocent group members as well, and if the assignment carries a large percentage, then you need to understand that you'll be affecting their grade as well. (Take note: LARGE percentage).
_
But even if it's a small percentage, it wouldn't be nice if everyone puts in a different amount of effort. For all you may know, someone might be genuinely trying to excel at that particular module or course, and it wouldn't be nice to realize that you're the reason why his plan never came to fruition.
_
I think what I'm trying to say here that when you're involved in a group assignment, you're not only accountable to your external activities that you've involved yourself in, but to your group members as well. So using these activities as a justification to exclude yourself from any responsibilities that is assigned to you as a group member is unacceptable, because you're implicating other members and weighing them down. I don't think they deserve to be implicated by your activities, when they have never pledged any involvement in these activities. (If you really think about it, I find this highly fair and reasonable).
_
You have a right to handle your affairs, but don't mix them together, it's unfair to both parties. If you need more time since you're organizing something, get more manpower. If its non-important, then maybe you should prioritize your time and learn to postpone.
_
You're not the only one in this universe, empathize a little.
_
Let's do this together.

Have a nice weekend everyone.

Due to various circumstances, I have resolved to go overseas only after graduation, with my own money. And all these talks of going for exchange, NOC, holiday getaways... I'm turning green with envy and red with frustration. I'm sure there're some people out there like me. It's something we have to endure, but how do you make yourself feel better when people around you can't stop talking about holidays??

I'm currently taking a human geography module and I find it really hard to swallow down what is mentioned in the suggested text. Not because my memory is bad (though that is kind of true and that I hate memorising things) but because I came to an idea that geographers seem to always put themselves onto moral high ground and judge things for there are based on what they think? Like how they seem to perceive issues regarding gender, etc. I can't help but question the text every time something like this come up and feel like it's rather bias at times. Or sometimes, seem to think that these geographers are challenging the norms for the sake of writing papers.

It's like they have nothing better to do/argue/discuss about and hence act like they know what's best. Then again, they seem to have everything to complain about but not seem to have the best recommended solution. It's my first encounter with human geography in all my years of education and as compared to my experience as a history student in my JC years, this feels a lot different and I feel that it is a lot less objective/balanced.

As a whole, it's affecting me because I don't agree a lot with what it discussed and said on certain topics. And so, it's really rather painful to follow the discussion. Someone advised me that I should just go on since it's sort of for the grade? But then in my mind I want to rebut to the points as much as I can. Possibly even during the exams at the risk of going against what is sort of "preached"/taught. Don't think there should be an issue on that right?

Well, the point of this post is to find out if I'm the only one who feels/thinks this way about human geography and if I'm actually right about this perception at all.

Thanks!

Do you guys notice in our local society we have this incessant need to blame someone?

Jony Ive reply about Xiaomi:

When a member of the audience came up to ask a question about Xiaomi and their unofficial tagline of “the Apple of China,” Ive was very straightforward with his response: “I’ll stand a little bit harsh, I don’t see it as flattery. When you’re doing something for the first time, you don’t know it’s gonna work, you spend 7 or 8 years working on something, and then it’s copied. I think it is really straightforward. It is theft and it is lazy. I don’t think it is ok at all.”

Hello. I am the one who wrote post . I wish to add something which I missed out completely as I was getting too emotional while typing that post out.

While we may have our own ideas and judgments of what is right and wrong for us, we have only so much experience in our lives at such a young age. I think I learnt that the hard way, by hating Pa for so many things when I was young, and that hatred festered as I grew up, I only started to fully appreciate it all when I hit the age of 29/30. 

I wish that nobody would have to live with this pain of regret that I've experienced for always being stubborn and selfish. I had never bothered seeing things from Pa's point of view, never considered that his wealth of experience trumped my selfish thoughts and desires any day.

While this story may not reach the impressionable youths of age 7 or 10, I hope it reaches out to my fellow young adult friends who plan to have or are already raising children. Communication is key; an authoritative approach may just lead to unhappiness and misunderstandings, just like I stupidly did when I was young and had my head up my own arse - which happens commonly enough to all of us. 

And of course, for those who still have your parents around, please take time out and time off to appreciate them and make them feel appreciated every now and then. I'm quite sure that at some point in life, we harbour thoughts of leaving our nest homes and coming back just occasionally. But please don't forget that your parents who painstakingly raised you from young; who were once used to seeing you for hours every day, now get reduced to seeing you for only hours every month/year.

As for me, Ma still wants to stay in the same flat that we grew up/old in. Although I have plans for us to live together, if something can be worked out with my fiancée and I..

 Contrary to what most commentators think, I kinda agree with . If you don't really want to start, then don't. Rather than wishing the feelings you have go away, perhaps a different perspective/mentality should be adopted and may help you for a long way to come. As Bruce Lee once said,

"Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one."

The happy truck reality show on channel 8. Not saying that it's not good, cos it brings our attention to the less fortunate in the local context. But on the other hand, the way the funds are being garnered and  collected defeats the purpose of charity. The part where celebrities go to their homes to visit and understand their conditions really makes me tear. But the part that requires the public to play games so that the points can be converted to cash and donated, I don't really get it.

If we genuinely want to help ppl, why can't we do it without the extra step? Why do they wait for us to play games then donate when they can donate directly?

@ You seem concerned with people not giving doctors enough pay or respect. Do you think that sounds silly? Doctors are pretty much the highest in terms of prestige, and I don't think I've ever seen a doctor who's struggling to make ends meet. With these sort of benefits it only makes sense that a corresponding amount of effort is needed. Complainers smack of people who want to have their cake and eat it.  

If you want to worry about your doctor bf, worry about him having affairs once he climbs the ladder.

So I stumbled across an interview of a local activist who champions (often crudely) for the end of racism in Singapore. In the interview, she accuses Indian men who date Chinese women of hypergamy  - trying to climb the social ladder by being more Chinese and thus having Chinese Privileges. 

Am I the only one who finds it weird that a activist who calls for the end of racism in Singapore is incredibly racist her/himself?

To everyone verbally amusing the med people who are voicing out their struggles: 

You know, we should all be finding ways to improve society, the pressures it has on its people and all. 

Whining = signal that something may not be right. (Yeah some whining is just simply whining but you gotta think twice if a large number of people are discontent) Maybe instead of raging at them doctors, we should think about how we can make life better. Not just for them, but for everyone too. 

For all you know, one day your career may be really tough for you too and you may have thought you were prepared for it. But man, reality is pretty different from what your imagination conjures. 

And no, I'm no med student. Just an ordinary arts kid with a bf who's going to be a doctor in the future. I worry for him all the time too. Especially when people like you guys give doctors shit for wanting an improvement in work-life balance. 

Doesn't mean they help people save lives means they should not complain about less pay and that their struggles should just be written off by the "feel good" aspect. In reality, their skills and importance to society (esp with the growing number of illnesses, possible outbreaks of epidemics, accidents, aging, cancer, etc) would actually make their skills rare and valuable. Don't know if that warrants better pay, but maybe a bit more respect and understanding would go a long way. 

Just want to say thank you to all the doctors and nurses and the other healthcare workers who spend so much of their time serving people while neglecting your own needs.

I have a feeling 50% of the self declared bisexuals are actually gay, because bisexuals are generally more accepted in our society so many gays declare themselves as bisexuals.

And that if I were to be bisexual with no preference of either sex, I'd just say I'm straight and go for a partner of the opposite sex because

1) Marriage laws
2) Social acceptance
3) BABIES
4) Family opposition

Of course, I would then fap to gay porn secretly if I felt straight sex was boring...

That being said, if you're gay, please do not force yourself to "straighten up" as that would lead to sufferings on both sides of a couple :))))))

 Just want to point out, Xi's claim that "mainland China and Taiwan are one family" is not solely based the fact that both are of the same race. If you know history, Taiwan was separated from mainland China only after 1949 as a result of the civil war. In the long history, Taiwan has always been part of China (Like Hong Kong and Macau). So it's not a matter of race and blood. The majority of Singaporean are also Chinese, but China has never said any "one family" stuff about it. I think many people do not see the whole picture of the issue.

I think NUSWhispers is an excellent platform for everyone to see how cruel society is. Just look at the comments for some really sad confessions.

There’s this guy I’ve been wanting to make friends with. We’ve spoken a few times during lessons, but it’s difficult to find anything to talk about other than lessons. He has a number of friends so it’s difficult to get him alone to ask for his contact number. I’ll probably be fine if I didn’t get to be friends with him but this might be my only chance to do so, as it’s almost too late since it’s the last week. The problem is, I’m female and not pretty so I don't think people usually bother approaching me. Also, he’s a guy so I don’t want to give the wrong idea that I want to ask him out, causing him to avoid me. How should I ask someone to be friends with me?
-
 
OP of  here! I want to explain why I asked. President Xi talked about how the Taiwanese and Chinese are one family as they have the same blood, and are descendants of the same land, so I was curious if that was a cultural view that Chinese in general have (some type of collectivist view) or merely political (because of Taiwan's independence) or both. I'm sorry if I offended anyone! 
-
 
 It's not that difficult to see that the local Chinese here are quite different from the mainland Chinese. 

One of the only few things that links us to them is pretty much the fact that we are just of the same race.

The way we speak, the food we eat, the way we behave etc., they are all extremely different. We converse more in English than them, they eat more Chinese food than us... And the list goes on. 

One simple thing that distinguishes us from them is the fact that the older generation burns offerings during the 7th lunar month. They don't do that.

In general, this is what I see, though you'll need actual substantiation to find out the truth.

This is in response to a previous post on China-Taiwan (history major here).

There is a major error, "Taiwan as an island has been part of the historical China ( especially occupied legally by Ming dynasty-loyalists (eg Zheng Cheng Gong, regarded culturally a Han Hero) and subsequently Qing dynasty)".

On the contrary, Taiwan was never part of the Chinese empire until the 1600s. It was a backwater island for pirates and fishermen, and it was mostly populated by Aborigines. The Spanish (hence the old name "Formasa"), followed by the Dutch, actually occupied parts of the island to build ports for their maritime trade. The Dutch East India Company actively encouraged Han Chinese migration to Taiwan to open up land for agriculture and commerce. So, Han Chinese settlement began because of Dutch rule!

After the fall of the Ming, Zheng Chenggong expelled the Dutch from Taiwan and used the island as a base to invade Fujian. The Qing empire eventually retook the island and made it into a province. But until the rise of the Japanese in the late 19th century, the Qing largely ignored Taiwan and saw it as a peripheral part of the empire. The Qing empire ceded Taiwan to the Japanese after the Sino-Japanese War of 1895. Thus, the loss of Taiwan (although insignificant) became a rallying point for nationalism and anti-imperial/Japanese sentiments in the early 20th century. Indeed, until today, many Chinese believe that China is not complete until Taiwan is under unified Chinese rule again. 

Hence the controversy over reunification, because many Taiwanese, especially those whose ancestors had settled on the island long before the KMT came, do not see themselves as part of China. Although Taiwan was under repressive Japanese rule, many Taiwanese benefited from colonial rule, and did not see the KMT as liberators when the Japanese withdrew. In fact they saw the KMT as a worse oppressor. In contrast, the KMT and its followers who moved over to Taiwan after their defeat in the Civil War, still believed in eventual reunification. For example, Ma Ying-jeou was born in a family which fled to Taiwan with the KMT, hence his pro-unification stance. This legacy still lives on till today.

But many Taiwanese are moderate and pragmatic enough to know that outright independence of a "Republic of Taiwan" result in war. Hence, most are satisfied with the status quo, the Xi-Ma meeting in Singapore will hopefully lead to an institutionalized mechanism to alleviate tensions between both sides. 
-
 
with the MaXi meeting being facilitated in Singapore and the opening of the China Cultural Centre here, I wanted to ask you guys. How much do the Chinese here identify with the Taiwanese or Chinese?

With regards to  and all the comments, I would like to give a slightly more indepth perspective about what OP has briefly touched upon.

As a doctor working in a hospital, you have these things called being "on call" where you are on duty until the next morning. This essentially means that you are on your feet and running about from 7am that day until (if you're lucky) 11 am the next day. This however is unlikely as aside from their patients in their own wards, they have to care for the ones they are in charge of during their call so they often leave past 4pm, sometimes without sleep at all, lacking meals/toilet breaks/water.

And think about what happens if your doctor is Malay, and it's during Ramadan. They can't take in anything during the day and still have to be on their toes their whole shift. And mind you on call isn't just once a month, it's at least once every 2 weeks as a junior doctor.

And as a senior doctor, it does not necessarily mean that you'll be filthy rich. There are many who live humbly and I know some who are struggling to keep their clinic in the black, not because of bad practices but due to them sticking with their principles and having an open and giving heart. Many doctors choose to stay in the public sector because there is where the real need is, for the patients who can't afford to pay their bills. Our public hospitals are packed to the brim nowadays, which shows how dire the situation is.

In this profession, there are many things you sacrifice for your patients. You have little chances to meet with friends or even your family; your time is all dedicated to the lives of your patients. All I ask is for a little more understanding of what doctors do, and for some empathy for the doctor who is treating you. They are people too. Who knows what they've given up; being unable to care for their own aged parents, or missing out so much on their children's lives.

Ever since coming to uni, my grammar has gone out of the window. The concepts are so hard to understand that I can't decide on the correct grammar to represent them most accurately.
-
 
I like reading the confessions on NUSWhispers, but seriously some of the commenters are such assholes. I can kind of get it if you're snarky because the confession itself is prejudiced/mean, but for some confessions (like ) I honestly don't see why every single comment is judging the OP's language and bashing the fact that she's from Law. Sorry but it just shows what a small person you are. Do you guys really feel happy tearing other people down for no good reason? Does it make you feel big to correct others? Guess so.

Anyway I'm not the OP of , just somebody who's been observing that some commenters on nuswhispers are getting really bitchy and judgmental sometimes for no reason at all. Some people are genuinely looking for advice, and maybe your comments just push them over the edge.

To the OP of 
People who use the "men aren't meant to be monogamous" argument are just finding excuses to make themselves feel better about being shitty boyfriends. If you truly believe in that argument, you'd have no problems actually having sex with all of those girls without having to hide it from your girlfriend since that argument is based on the idea that "males are biologically wired to spread their seeds as much as possible". Also, animals which are not monogamous don't have the idea of someone being "the one" for them, an idea which you seem to subscribe to.

I'm not saying you can't/it's wrong for you to fantasise about other girls while you're attached, but please stop using the "men aren't monogamous" argument to justify your thoughts or actions.

Exactly what kind of image do we Singaporeans have? 

I was out of town and got totally wasted on a night out. People I met that day asked if I was fine when they saw me leaning on the guy who brought me home. And in response, he simply said, "of course she's fine. She's Singaporean".

To  Andro, haircut, binder, blahblahblah...I think you already know that experimentation is a good avenue for self-discovery. What I'd like to talk about is gender dysphoria.

Dysphoria isn't always an intense hatred of one's body. Mild discomfort counts too. Sometimes, due to any of a myriad reasons, it doesn't feel like active dislike towards one's body or social gender, but a sort of dullness in one's life and a sense that things would be better on the other side. A fairly popular description of the feeling is "homesick for a place you've never been". AND, of course, you do NOT have to be extremely masculine to transition. Transitioning to become a masculine woman or feminine man is perfectly valid.

(Since you brought up lack of interest in having a penis I'll also say that a significant proportion of transgender people opt not to have any genital surgery, which ideally ought to be acceptable since only your partner or doctor will even look there, but unfortunately not in Singapore's documentation system.)

More likely than not, you're just very curious about experiencing being a man, or possibly a bit gender-fluid. Standard disclaimers to all to not rush into anything, consult a mental health professional if co-morbid conditions may be the root cause, and stay safe and healthy. But who knows, this post just might bring this issue into consciousness for someone who is repressed, in denial or grossly misinformed due to how society misrepresents us.

The response/comments to the post about the OP considering going to NOC Israel is rather disappointing. I was hoping for more attention to this post, hoping a discussion on the israel/palestinian nightmare going on would start. Yes it has been going on for a long time and to us its probably not new news. But children are dying and getting badly hurt, the situation has gotten much worse than before. I really think its worth at least talking about. 

Anyway. 

OP i hope you do not only think of your safety when considering if you should go or not. 

You would definitely be safe. You'd be on the side with more deadly weapons and "defence". 

But like a commenter said, you probably have to leave your conscience behind. Are you comfortable going to a place knowing that just some KM away, the people of the country youre at are mercilessly killing and torturing people? And as another commenter said, are you going to be okay knowing that youre in a country that is violating so many international laws? 

I hope you read up on not just how safe Israel is, but also on the entire situation as a whole, if not especially on the dire situation of the Palestinians.

"I'm surprised that some commenters can't even infer such simple things. "

To 
Actually, from your language and the fact about how you inaccurately described the rooms and their respective levels at UTown, I'm really inferring that you're not a legitimate student. 
 
But then again, the OPs to NUSWhispers are promised anonymity. With the inconsistencies and the run-on sentences, what do you expect us to infer?
 
 
Inferring what you think you infer from what we infer?
Inferring what we infer from what you infer?
Inferring what infer infers?
 
Wait... It can't be.... 
 
YOUR I.P ADDRESS?
 
...and come on.... "Simple things?" That's a rather amateur way of saying things. Don't blame anyone for being doubtful.
 
But let's give you the benefit of doubt here. Perhaps you really are a student here, and not someone who's just crafting a ridiculous story to see the comments and responses. After all, no one would want to be someone like that. That'd be synonymous to deceiving oneself, tearing a fraction of your own soul and marring it and putting it back again, eventually realizing that it no longer fits.
 
It is something that happens when you deceive the audience and yourself for amusement. You let the admins of the page down, you let the readers down and most of all, you let yourself down. You tear away at your own soul as you construct more lies to reinforce the previous ones you made.
 
But that's nothing compared to the guilt of deceiving and being responsible for whatever happens as a result of that lie. It is a guilt that remains shackled to your ankles that you drag along with each step till your very last breath, occasionally causing you to cringe when you recall the flow of events with absolute remorse. It is something you carry with you to your grave.
 
But of course, you're not such a person. So you have absolutely nothing to worry about, right?
 
Cheers.

To the OP of 

I'm facing a similar scenario too. Except that my 2nd guy doesn't mind being my weekday boyfriend. He did not pressure me to choose him immediately and he will disappear on the weekends, so that I can accompany my bf when he booked out. I suggest that you can follow my approach, which is to enjoy the best of both worlds and take your time to evaluate who is more worthy.

Nothing to do with NUS life but I really hope this get posted up as I really wanted to see others' opinion

Let say you employee did something wrong but your boss scolded you instead of your employee, should you scold your employee?

Personally, I don't think we should.

1) If I scold my employee, I am scolding them because I wanted to vet my anger on them, not because I really want them to improve.
2) It not like my employee told my boss to scold me. 
3) What really make me angry is my boss scolding me, not because my employee did something wrong. Scolding them will not solve the root cause of the problem because ymy boss can scold me for some other problem in the future

What do you all think?

I'm a guy and I don't understand how getting laid often means the guy is lucky. True that its in our nature to spread our genes as much as possible, but isn't that the same as animals? The only difference is that humans can commit. If you can't, you are no different than an animal. I feel disgusted whenever a guy posts about getting laid often or any comments supporting it. You may say I am jealous, but at least I'm different from the common strays.

During a casual meetup, some of my lady friends honestly said they will only accept a tall, handsome and rich dude. I understand the idea of a tall and handsome man based on their description of some Korean pop idols who stand above 175cm. But I do not understand what's the meaning of rich. Does rich mean a guy must have a net worth of millions or billions? Or do they actually mean richer? In a sense that they will settle for a guy as long as the guy has more financial power than them. Please advise. I'm a guy btw. I like one of the girls, but I'm afraid she'll reject me if I don't meet those criteria. Thanks much.

Live and let live. 

Often times the rat race system we have makes us compare with one another. 

But how often do you stop and ask yourself; do I understand what I am doing? am I able to learn from my mistakes? what can I take away from this experience? am I benefiting the people around me?

Life is short and we all have the same destination, the grave. Make it worth the experience for everything tangible; money grades rank; they all turn to dust while our souls live on.

To the male student in a red marathon finisher tee who kept opening the door at LT7 on Friday, 30th October 2015, 10:40AM. I seriously believe that there are serious issues with you.
Firstly, I think you might need to revisit primary school math for on the topic of time because even as a university student, you seriously have difficulty determining the time.
Secondly, I believed it to be highly curious for you to open the front lecture theatre doors for 3 times at approximately 3 minute intervals till the end of the lecture at 10:50AM. I’m not sure if too much marathon has resulted in some deficiency to have some decent respect for the lecturer, but not everyone of us enjoy diverting our attention to you as much as you love opening doors so much. More importantly, I believe that you were probably waiting outside the lecture theatre, and noticed that no one emerged from the lecture theatre. I was profoundly confused on what you were expecting. Were you perhaps expecting all students in the lecture theatre to emerge from the back of the lecture theatre so that they could conduct a mass troll on you? You might be rather disillusioned to believe so. Perhaps the next thing you should do after mastering your stamina, is to master some fundamental level of patience.
Thirdly, perhaps we could give you the benefit of the doubt that you had some important business in the lecture theatre. But all you did when you first sat down was to unlock your phone and reply to Whatsapp messages, and nobody besides you (with a dark expression) and the lecturer entered the lecture theatre from the front. So we could basically conclude that there really wasn’t a big rush before the lecture began.

If you don’t find anything wrong with your actions, then I implore you to reconsider. This is not simply about the expression of displeasure towards your action, but rather the troubling issues of your flawed and selfish personality.

TLDR: Stop disrupting people’s lecture. Get a life.

FASS Year 1 here. I'm grateful to be given the opportunity to study both Sociology and Psychology this semester. It has been my dream to study thought and behavior after reading books by Gladwell, De botton, Goleman etc.

I'm in a dilemma now. Whilst moral boundaries are often vaguely established in the various fields, there is a tendency for my mind to wonder beyond them. I'm considering taking up Philosophy for next semester. But I'm concerned with my mental health. I've an obsession to explore questions I do not have answers to. But with the beginning of exploration marks a sense of expectation, one that may or may not be met. I'm not sure if I'm ready to face the answers with all the subjectivity in introspection methods. Would this journey be purposeful without an end? Or would the journey be an end in itself?

On one hand, we're (insert negative emotions) with being on polarizing ends, driven by having nothing to lose, or losing our edge.
On the other, we seek comfort knowing that the first step of greater discovery begins with understanding the boundaries of those ends. 

Should I follow my dreams? Or follow our dreams?

 Smarten up. Here's a guy's perspective. He just wants to get you on a bed. He's continuously testing the water to see your reaction. At each stage, if he can get away with it, he will be bolder. To him right now, you are an easy target because either (1) he senses that you like him and he can take advantage of that or (2) you are meek and he can get away with taking advantage of you, or both. If you don't want what's to come, you better stand up for yourself, stay strictly away from him and make sure he gets the message. If he doesn't heed your warning, make sure you REPORT to the school authorities or the police. Or else, he will only get bolder. And make sure you understand what's to come because we can't erase our past. I believe you don't need real life stories to understand the severity.

Even if he's interested in you for a long term relationship, what sort of guy whom is an acquaintance would behave the way he did, which is utter disrespect?

You seem muddled so here's summarising what he did today: sexual assault. Most Singaporeans I believe don't have a clear understanding of sexual assault especially since it's pretty safe/hidden in our country and don't tend to associate the guy's behaviour to sexual assault, but that was basically what he did.

Another note is that regardless of whether he's European or not, and whatever their culture is, when you don't like what people are doing to you, you resist and say 'No.' Get that in your head.

Admins please do post this and I implore OP to please take my advice seriously.

Pls don't filter as I need advice! 

Hey guys who look girly, what is your approach to this issue? Embrace your feminine appearance or actively change it? How and why?

While not effeminate in behavior or outlook, being a guy with feminine features inadvertently makes me judge girls for trying so hard acting feminine when I pull it off so easily. But as a result, I have not been able to get into relationships because I always think most girls can't meet my standards of femininity. (Hence no point in searching for and appreciating the femininity of another person when I have so much femininity already)

What should I do or how can I rethink the issue?

Does anyone here feel like you're an old soul trapped in a young body? It's strange when I feel like I can resonate and empathize better with the professors, who share their opinions and insights into life based from their many years of experience, as compared to my own peers. I guess this is because I have experienced significant upheavals and hardship despite my young age. 

Sometimes I feel like it's difficult to connect with others my age because when I speak to them, I just get a sense of false optimism and naivety about life since the cards they've been dealt with are pretty good so far. The issues they struggle with and deem important now seem trivial to me, though I myself once considered them important. 

I think this has been affecting me in terms of my efforts to look out for a potential boyfriend.. I often feel like I'm always in the position giving advice, encouraging them, consoling and comforting etc like a one-way street instead of exchanging and sharing emotional support even though we are in the same age group. I don't blame them for it, since they probably have not yet met with certain obstacles and experiences to help them mature more, and I was also the same before I encountered the major roadblocks in my life. 

There's a conflict because definitely in the physical aspect I'm attracted to guys of my age group but in terms of emotional and mental strength and depth, older charismatic guys certainly make me swoon hahaha. Sigh, can't get the best of both worlds can I? It would be like finding a needle in a haystack.. Guess I've just got to leave it up to fate instead of holding on to false hopes and expectations.

 I like Peter Thiel's idea about competition.

"PETER THIEL: I think competition can make people stronger at whatever it is they’re competing on. If we’re competing in some athletic event for competitive swimmers, really intensely competing, it’s likely that both of us will become better, but it’s also quite possible we’ll lose sight of what’s truly valuable. 

So in competition you always end up focusing on other people, the people you’re competing with. You lose sight of the far more important question, whether what you’re doing actually makes any sense at all. There are all sorts of business contexts where competition occurs and I do think it pushes people to work much harder, to get better at specific parameters at which they’re competing. 

But it’s an open question whether they end up building really valuable sorts of businesses. The paradigm example of competitive business is the restaurant industry. It’s intensely competitive. People do actually get really good at producing food or restaurant experiences, but it’s not clear it’s what you should be doing.

It’s definitely worth thinking really hard as to how to go about avoiding competition. In technology, one of the classic ways you avoid it is you’re working on something other people don’t have, some specific technology or intellectual property other people don’t have. If you have a business idea that’s extremely easy to copy, that can often become something of a challenge or problem."

To all the "innocent" and conservative readers out there, don't let the dirty posts here change your convictions just because such happenings are more common than you think. Having had lots of sex doesn't make you a stud and being a virgin does not mean that you're a loser. When people tease you for being "innocent" and conservative, there's no reason to feel that you have to change. You can stand for and promote what you think a good lifestyle is without forcing it on other people, no problems with that at all. Be more confident. It takes discipline to commit yourself to restraint, and I respect people who do. But you don't actually need my respect, because you're doing it for yourself. Get what I'm saying? Plus all the hedonism you see here isn't truly representative of Singaporean society, especially if you choose to do something about it.

I'm not a Christian but regarding the CHC incident, I'm 100% sure that the 6 convicted parties were possessed by the DEVIL when they committed the crime. Never on earth would holy christians do such a thing...

God is almighty and God is great!!!
-
 
Now that the CHC drama is over; I've got a legit burning question I've always been curious about but don't wanna be labeled a sceptic by my friends:

Why does Christianity dictate that you have to contribute x% of your salary to the church every month as "donations"? As a non- Christian,  I see other religions managing their temples/mosques etc very well with just willing donations, some even being able to manage hospices, provide free medical care & food for the needy as well. I understand that some churches don't actually dictate that, but majority do.

Actually, I have loads more questions about why they operate so differently from other religions, almost like a franchise system, but that's for another day.

*This post might come across as offensive, proceed with caution*
All this talk about 'true friends' and 'being a good girlfriend/boyfriend'. I just want to say, why do you care? Just because so and so doesn't fit into your ideal image of what a relationship should be, it makes that relationship somehow, less valuable? I sincerely doubt that whilst keeping such consideration at hand, that you'll be able to find someone that fits your bill through and through. Having someone to spend time with you (which you probably enjoyed, for a certain time anyway), isn't that good enough by itself? 
On the flip side, if you really don't enjoy relationship, why continue maintaining it? For whom are you putting that act on? Sunken/opportunity cost? For those who are doing it for the sake of the other party, I respect that, but honestly it will eventually break, imo. If you're keeping the relationship for sake of future prospects, deal with it.

This Quora feed bit.ly/1GRVRRS will enlighten you about being a programmer in Singapore.
It is the norm only in Singapore, it is completely different from Europe and the US. They understand that a good programmer can earn the company much more money in a long-term perspective, that they deserve more than just a worker status. 

In Singapore, business guys create startups and hire remote programmers from SEA. In the rest of the world, tech guys create the companies.

As specified in this Medium post, http://bit.ly/1Pz0Oam, 
"We are the nerds. We are important. We are not fungible.

We built this internet.
...
Actually, we are in charge now. You just haven’t realized it yet. Automate or be automated. If you don’t know how to map out complex systems. If you never got grounded as a kid for taking things apart. If you are too lazy or unwilling to learn our ways. If you don’t work for us yet, you soon will. Because software is eating the world.
"

Have you considered interning or working outside of Singapore? It can be a good experience to see how things work there.
And too bad for your boss if he loses one of his best elements.

regarding Christians dating non-Christians, I'm an atheist and I understand my Christian friends place greater emphasis on their relationship with God than anything else. Thus it is understandable that they would only want to be in a relationship with someone of the same faith. However I do not approve of Christians asking their partners to convert for them. I think that as a Christian, if you are really set on only dating Christians, don't go date a non-christian and die die try to convert them. either they will find God on their own, or it just wasn't meant to be.

Hi All, I hope to hear your advice. and i hope, it will be a constructive advice please...

My GF is pregnant. 
We are still in the midst of studying. 

We are poor and our parents are very poor as well, and supporting the child is really tough. We do not have a stable job yet. 

We both want to keep the child, but realistically speaking, how?!

Please, if you have any wise opinions, let us know if we should abort or keep the child?
should we choose to subject the child to the cruelty of a life full of financial hardships or to bypass a chance to go at life?
should we even let our parents know about this?

Hi. The B77W is here, once again. :)

First of all, apologies for being one commentator on many posts. My direct nature may not be that pleasing to some.

Anyway, there has been a lot of unprotected sexual confessions that penetrated the natural defences of NUSWhispers.

B77W would like to remind you that self-inflicted diseases is NOT covered by insurance and can have consequences that go far beyond... that of what you folks may imagine.

Please exercise utmost safety in whatever you do.

It is OK to let Durex earn some money. :)

Attitudes towards exchange students at NUS are borderline infuriating. Whilst I would wholeheartedly agree that there is a certain extent to which many party and travel - there's also a significant number of us who take our studies more seriously.  

The very fact that people don't like being stereotyped culturally should point to the fact that you also shouldn't be stereotyping others. 

Comments such as 'Oh you're on exchange, it doesn't matter', 'this isn't important for you', 'why did you try so hard?' etc are frustrating to hear. Who are you to tell someone what matters to them? What gives you the right to dictate how much effort a person puts in? Why is it shocking that I got an A+? People do try. 

Have you ever bothered to consider the fact that maybe this year counts towards some people's degrees? That perhaps even those for whom this year doesn't count, some people can't put in minimum effort to 'just get by'? Or that they don't want to? You should recognise that people also have ambitions, wish to succeed and gain something both culturally and educationally out of this experience. 

Equally, if you lag behind academically and don't apply pressure in your penultimate year, the final year will be even harder. It would be counterproductive for many of us to apply minimal effort. Whilst there are plenty of great local students I've engaged with who do not discriminate in this way, there's also an equally significant number who really need to change their perspective. 

Moving abroad isn't a snap decision for a lot of people, especially for a year. People leave their families and friends for the pursuit of this educational experience. They invest a lot of time and money, sometimes even an extra academic year. Don't be so narrow-minded as to assume that this experience is merely a trivial pursuit for all exchangers. Have you ever thought how much we could genuinely learn from each other, if you allowed for the exchanging of ideas and didn't see yourself as superior?

This is not an assertion towards every Singaporean student, please don't think that. But for the significant number of you who regard us this way, please broaden your horizons. 

Unless someone gives you a reason to lose faith or characterise them in a certain way, you shouldn't be so close-minded as to assert a stereotype to a whole international community. Everybody who is putting in effort deserves mutual respect in this environment.

Regarding what  said on the Personal Data Protection Act, please note that the OP is wrong on that count. Having worked with OSA to set up the PDPA framework for the Do-Not-Call Registry and compliance procedures on marketing messages, we were specifically advised that SMS and Whatsapp messages are NOT to be sent to telephone numbers before checking whether they are on the DNC Registry. This is because such messages are deemed sent to a specific telephone number (unlike email). As such, they are covered under Part IX of the PDPA. Read the PDPA or consult OSA if you are unclear.

Please get this message (no pun intended) out to all. It is highly possible that by mass-messaging students on committee recruitment, Science club could have infringed on the PDPA provisions on not sending messages without checking whether the telephone numbers are on the DNC Registry. Each infringement (i.e. each message) could be punished with a fine not exceeding $10000.

As for the OP's tone and tenor on the other parts of his/her post, I have no comments.

Over the past few weeks I have been getting more and more frustrated with the students of NUS. As the number one university in Asia I was expecting intelligent students who are engaged with the world, have opinions and who are open to discussion. But I haven’t seen any evidence of this. All I have seen are students who regurgitate what the texts books or lectures say, have no opinions of their own. The students I have witnessed at NUS have the maturity level of thirteen year olds, who know big words but have no original thoughts inside their heads. 

The students here just want to get good marks, I understand that. It is extremely competitive in Singapore and I get it, there just aren’t enough jobs for everyone. But you don't care about learning, improving yourselves or even understanding. It is all about getting good marks. This learning environment is doing more harm than good. 

When professors ask you questions and there is an awkward silence it’s not enjoyable for anyone.  Why do you think they are asking? They want us to learn and broaden our minds. But you just sit in silence and wait of the ‘“right” answer. When are you going to learn that there is no right answer? Every thing is subjective.

I want to get the most out of my classes, so in tutorials I engage with the content. I try to discuss and get involved, gaining a greater understanding of the topic at hand. But when I question anything or ask for an explanation my classmates look at me like I am Judas or something. Why is encouraging discourse looked down upon? 

I am not going to sit in class like an empty headed idiot, who only does work when it is being marked. What is the benefit of that? I have a right to voice my opinions and question things. But in Singapore this comes at the price of becoming a pariah.

I know not every student in NUS is like this but the scales need to shift. When is this going to change NUS? This really isn’t helping anyone

My dad is proof that when someone has nothing of value left in him, he would hang on to his fragile ego for dear life.

His track record is not exactly great. He crashed the family car in a drunk driving accident on his birthday and has made my mom cry dozens of time (which often triggers an urge to stab his disgustingly huge paunch).

Despite earning less than my mom, whose financial literacy is a lot better, he insists on making the major financial decisions in the family. Despite blatantly ignoring my NS life, that PR still has the gall to claim that NS has become a lot easier from "his era", while showing off a picture of my ORD parade on his Facebook wall.

Despite losing the respect of his wife and kids, he continues to hang on to the notion that since he's the supposed head of the family, he should enjoy unquestioning obedience, especially in the face of his peers.

I've tried to talk to him, expending my patience and shedding a few tears in the process. All I got in return was "I should be respected" and "it's no use". 

The next time he does anything stupid, I will give him respect all right. Hopefully it's in the form of a swift beating.

Welcome to the harsh reality of the working world where programmers are sometimes undervalued and condescending remarks like "even a ten-year-old kid can write an iPhone app or do up a website". 

As programmers, other than writing code, your job is to also communicate what you have achieved in an easily understood manner to non-programmer folks. That is why we have communication modules like CS2101 and Critical Thinking and Writing for people in Engineering.

Guys out there, I'm not sure about all of you, but I'd love to have a wife willing to be a tai-tai. Having her look after the house and its maintenance, not to mention educating the kids and bringing them up right, already seems the equivalent (if not even more stressful than) a full time job. I'd gladly let buy her however many clothes and shoes as "payment" for a well-maintained house. In my opinion, you cannot put a price on returning from a tiring day at work to a warm home and happy kids. Of course, I'm assuming that my future wife has the same definition of tai-tai as I do. I'm confident that my income is sufficient to sustain an entire family, and will remain stable for as long as we live (I've already done the calculations for a family of 5 living in a private property with 2 cars, and I'm pretty satisfied with the results). Also, I wouldn't expect my future wife to give up her opinions, even though I'd be the sole breadwinner. I value intellectual conversations, and will expect her to entertain her own opinions about all the issues that possibly would affect the family. 

Now, if only I could find a lady who's as crazy as me...

As a business student, I don't see what is all the fuss about with IB. I know a number of the people who aspire to it, or are in the profession, and they are some of the most disgusting, selfish people I have ever met. Please don't tell me they're an exception, and not the rule because I frankly can't find a good, moral soul amongst them.

I hear of the stories they tell me at their parties, how female interns drink simply to entertain their male (mostly white) bosses, and even willingly let them get touchy even if they have bfs. And wow, let's not even talk about the guys who are too busy being complete sycophants with no backbone. 

Believe it or not, I am writing this as someone who has the grades and caliber to enter IB but vehemently will not because of the toxic culture.

How are you going to work with people from other races next time if you have so much prejudice now? It is not funny. It's not a laughing matter.

@ You said "Please do not blast me as I genuinely wish to hear about what guys honestly think because I am not a guy and it's very difficult for me to understand why many guys cannot seems to resist the temptations of girls they think are attractive."

Well I would say that guys do it because what you call "disturbing the girl" is seen as flirting when you are desirable. I am considered very good-looking, and more importantly am extremely good in a sport and am quite rich. Though what I say is certainly more smooth, the principle is essentially the same. This only works for guys like me though. 

Anecdote: This only occurred to me when one of my hookups was complaining to me about how a friend of mine was creeping her out (yes I failed at being a wingman). That friend was using lines and moves that I scripted for him beforehand, I use pretty much the same lines :/

im a fresh graduate who just started work at this private company. This one fresh grad starts doing many things to belittle me. Such as saying things that imply that my degree is less worthy, purposely doing things when she knows I don't like it and gossiping about me to make others dislike me. Lately, she has been saying a lot of bad things about me to everyone in the department and some people are actually gullible enough to take her side. She always victimize herself and suck up to seniors. I refuse to suck up to anyone or be fake so i come across as a independent but somewhat aggressive person. Maybe that's why people tend to like me less. The thing is people in the office have started isolating me, by not talking to me, asking everyone out for lunch except for me, they talk to everyone else except me. I do not want to bring this up to my superiors as they may find me petty/immature or I exaggerate things. I just wish bitchy people like this don't exist or that other rational people can see through them. Why can't we just work in peace. It's already tough enough working, I don't have the time to deal with immature adults who should know how to act their age.

I am a biz undergrad with above average looks and figure ( C cup).

I feel that SG guys are generally hopeless. Many are without any direction or goal in life. And since they live with their parents for much of their growing-up years and even adult lives, they're not independent. Even NS, which is supposed to make them more independent, only teaches them to follow orders and the status quo.

A good hubby/boyfriend is one with not just a career-minded goal in life, he must also be a strong leader. That's why I only go for Western men. Since they usually leave their homes at an early age to stake out a bright future for themselves, many have the qualities I look for in men, and many have the will and resolve to attain success, which is rarely seen here.

I used to have friends who would worry for me, look out for me each time I overworked or fell sick or simply just went a little out of the ordinary. Or just say hi.

I realised that there's no point in putting hopes on my friends returning to the same level of care and concern. I know I must carve my own future. I cannot rely on merely the friendship of others to ensure my survival in a community.

I must build up my own capabilities to succeed. I must be able to offer something no one else can offer. Only then will other people who need what I have speak to me about it.

If I don't fight for my own relevance among people who I consider some to be friends, who'd ever care about me? True friendship is but a dream, but I think I am able to carve out meaningful partnerships.

Overseas CIP. The overrated,  do for the sake of resume CIP.  Yes you can argue that oh overseas got a lot of other ppl who don't have access to water, sanitation, education blah blah blah. But let me tell you. You haven't seen this side of singapore. There are homeless people in singapore who don't have enough to eat, living conditions bad, and do not have enough money to continue education. Why are you targeting the outside world when your own country is in need of your help? 

I'm not saying you shouldn't go overseas to help. Instead, take time to understand the situation locally first before you branch out. Don't do it for the sake of the resume.

In recent months, I have been going out with various local girls/women on dates. I meet them either via Tinder/OKC or through friends introductions. Time after time I feel extremely bored at how 2-dimensional their personalities are, despite coming across as interesting people in their profiles or outward appearances. 

The profile of the women I have met range a bit:
- ages ranging mid-20s
- appearance wise all above average, none overweight
- educational level mostly university graduates
- wealth level varied

In my interactions with some female friends, and also hearing comments from my male friends as to their interactions with better educated local females, I feel quite turned-off by these local women in general. Not to come across as overly stereotypical, but the majority of local women seem to have a truly "GCP mentality": That of an overly inflated sense of self-worth and a very large sense of entitlement. 

Specific examples would be that during the dating process, they will only consider guys that are good looking, in good shape / not fat, and have a high paying and stable job. During dates, guy has to pay for everything, cannot eat at hawker centre, need to be sent back after every date. In a relationship, need the guy to come up with new and fun activities often, and cannot always just nua at home and spend time together, need to travel every few months. Further down the line, they will require a certain sized diamond engagement ring and a lavish and thoughtful wedding ceremony to even consider accepting the marriage proposal.

Did such expectations arise over time because Singaporean guys well trained dogs, or just suckers that pander to every single local woman whim and fancy? Why do a good majority of Singaporean women think that they have the right to expect everything (money and effort wise) at no expense to themselves? It is no wonder that there are now so many 30+ local single women, and that over 40% of marriages involving a Singaporean are to a foreigner (Source). I have no doubt this figure is so high mostly because Singaporean men are sick and tired of such "GCP mentality" and are marrying foreign women instead.

I really hope Singaporean women will wake up their ideas, if not they will all be left on the shelf, with Singaporean men marrying more foreigners.

I always watch out for traffic when I cross the road. If I get hit by a driver who ran the red light, of course the blame falls on the driver and not me. But for the sake of my own safety, I watch out for traffic so I at least have a chance to avoid the car if they run a red light. Yes, we should teach drivers not to run red light instead of telling pedestrians to avoid the cars, but this is an imperfect world, and ultimately no matter whom the blame falls on, I'll still be suffering physical and emotional trauma if I get hit. And while accidents can happen regardless of whether you watch out for traffic or not, I don't see it as a big loss to have to be careful all the time.

All you people getting your panties in a twist over 'policing' how girls should dress are pretty stupid. Can you not differentiate between assignation of fault and mere acknowledgement of consequences? Can you not differentiate between what we would like to happen in an ideal world, and what actually happens in the shitty world we live in? Is it so difficult to understand that walking naked in the street is likely to increase your probability of getting raped, issues of blame and fault notwithstanding? No one is trying to 'police how women dress', but there are sensible people trying to acknowledge a causal link between skimpy dressing and the unfortunate consequence of getting raped. I don't think anyone seriously thinks that anyone dressing skimpily should take any measure of blame for any ill consequence that befalls her. It's simply intellectual and linguistic imprecision in the use of phrases like 'she had it coming' or 'what else did you expect' or 'she deserved it' (the idea being that if you foresee a consequence with virtual certainty, you intend that consequence) that may make it seem like people think this way. If they do, they are certainly wrong, but I (really) hope they don't. To take offence at the mere statement that 'covering up reduces the likelihood of getting raped' is plainly retarded. I hope no commentor comes along with a 'we should be teaching guys not to rape!' comment, because it would then be clear that the point of this post was happily ignored.

As regards rapists and murderers and the like, dressing conservatively, getting home late at night, are indeed ways you might (stress on the might) help to reduce the likelihood of rape/murder occurring. But the brutal fact that remains is that these things will still occur. 

The solution is simple: arm every legal adult. This ensures lasting peace alot more effectively than making even more punitive laws that ultimately lead to greater costs for the country. 

The mass shootings in the USA only occur because their gun laws are half-hearted, with guns offered only to citizens that meet regulations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state). This is not to say that guns should not be registered with the local law enforcement, but they should be permitted to any legal adult, who also must bear the responsibility of keeping it out of the hands of minors. It is easy to say that guns should be banned because deaths by firearms kill many people at one go, but statistics prove once again, that in a large country that has banned firearms to its citizenry (http://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/violent-crime-us-abroad/), violence is undoubtedly not sky high in the USA. 

Logically, consider this: would you pull out a gun and begin shooting at random strangers if you knew that there was a very likely possibility that one of them would pull out a gun and shoot back? Would you rob a store if you knew that any customer in there could shoot you in the back while you were holding up the cashier? Would you hold up a bank if you knew that all the clients in the bank were armed? 

Always remember: guns don't kill people. People kill people. In order to have a peaceful society, sometimes unorthodox methods must be pursued, but this doesn't make them any less valid.

 This thread is getting out of hand. I agree with both what you and the commenters have said. There is definitely a relationship between rape victims and how they dress. However, how the victims dress is only a small fraction accounting for the number of causes of rape. Since there's no way of determining who are potential rapists, I think the best course of action for ladies is to take up self defense classes. 
-
 
Why do we tell girls to dress more conservatively in order to prevent rape? Why don't we tell rapists to control their urges? Dogs, when trained, are able to inhibit their urges and not eat food placed in front of them if told not to do so. For the guys that insist seeing a girl scantily clad gives them urges they cannot control, all you're saying is "my dick controls me more than I control my dick".

Hi. I've been disturbed by some of posts that I've read on discrimination of minority races here in Singapore. There is, in my belief, an increase in the number of minorities voicing out their displeasure with the amount of discriminatory remarks and hurtful actions they have suffered, whether unintentionally in the form of "microagressions" or out of malice. You can read some of these posts here:

https://www.facebook.com/Im-Not-Racist-But-702683709862602

There were some really heartbreaking stories and the discrimination is very real and it is indeed very sad. A few of my non-chinese friends have shared their own experiences in on their facebook wall, the tones of their messages range from sadness to EXTREME RAGE. While I cannot possibly understand what they have gone through, I cannot help but be reminded of the radical feminists, the men's rights movement, the social justice warriors and certain tumblr users and certain other communities where their existence feeds on hatred and the putting down of the other party.

As humans we have a need to air our grievances sometimes. But how do we go about correcting our collective behaviour? Obviously just posting these injustices is not enough, and may even unwittingly make the problem worse (in my humble opinion). I dunno, it just seems really nonconstructive. As Chinese are we to be blamed? What can we do about it? Am I being too bigoted?

I have a huge crush on this Chinese Singaporean guy, but I'm not sure if I should confess to him. It's not as simple as him liking me back, because I'm Indian and although he does have other Indian friends, I'm not sure if he'll be open to a relationship with people of other races. Thoughts?

I'm the OP of the clothing and rapist post. My whole intention of posting this was just to sincerely tell gals that clothing does have an effect in arousing men's sexual desire. Since I do get hard when I saw gals with such clothing. The difference between me and rapist is that I stop there, but rapist take actual action. I am sure most of the guys will agree with me on this point. One example will be that most of the porn star in film starts with  erotic dressing. It does play a part in suggesting sex compare to more modest clothing. 
Some of you trying to argue that the cause is not because of clothing, but due to some other reasons. 
I never rule out the possibility of  other causes of rape, however, I merely state that by dressing overly exposed, it does increases the POSSIBILITY of being raped. Let's fix all other variables and just focusing on one at a time. I mean you can argue by adding more and more variables to the reason why rapist commit crime..but let's try to eliminate one at the time. For example, there could be 10 reasons why rapist target you. Having erotic dressing is just one of them, so i'm just saying by dressing more modest, it helps you to DECREASE the chance of being raped, not ELIMINATE the chances altogether. 
Last but not least, I mean it's ok for you not to believing in this, because I am not a scholar or professional who has done extensive research on this topic, BUT as a guy, it's just my humble piece of advice, because I do get hard when I see gals with erotic clothing, so I thought it's good to let the gals know about this. 
I mean, ultimately it's your freedom to choose what you wanna wear. Personal freedom and safety has always been a difficult topic to address, for centuries. These two things has always been in contradiction, we can never maximize our personal freedom while enjoying absolute safety. The only way is to find a fine balance between these two. I am sure most of you get my point.

Ok guys, calm down. Wrt the clothing and rape issue, the onus should never be on victims or people in general to behave or dress a certain way in order to avoid getting raped. Instead of telling women how to dress to "decrease the possibility of rape", we should be telling rapists NOT to rape.

This is by about decreasing chances, or mitigating the risk, because if a rapist wants to rape, the fact that there are more clothes in the way is not going to stop him. We only need to look at the prevalence of rape on college campuses in the US to see that there is no one profile of a rape victim. To imply that rape victims can do something, whatever that is and it is usually dictated by a man who has less experience with living as a woman, is to imply that rape victims have some responsibility for getting raped.

You may mean well, and think you're doing something to help, but you're not. No one can force someone to rape - it's as simple as that.

 Hey Tristan. OP here. 

Yes you are right. We should address the rapist.

I did some research. I must say every case is different. There are different motivations to commit the same crime. (opportunistic rapist, anger rapist, sadistic rapists, sexual rapists etc) 

Some possible causes:

Neurobiological impairment 

Psychiatric disorders 

Paraphilia 

Dysfunctional famiy relations, physical and sexual abuse 

Sociopathic behavior (possible warning flag)

Cognitive distortion of schema.

Its not that simple. There is sadly no panacea to the problem. Every cause has to be addressed separately because rapists cannot be addressed as a group. There are different sicknesses, state of minds and motivations. 

Education is important. (knowledge of the crime, teaching consent in a non sexually biased manner) A more pragmatic approach towards mental health and social behavior from a young age is even more important. 

Rapists can strike anywhere anytime. People you know or you dont know. Just like any other crimes. 

Victims should never blame themselves or be attributed to the cause of such crimes because this gives the perpetrators the power over the victims. 

Do watch if you have the time!

Okay, okay, rape victims are not at fault for their clothing or lack thereof. I get it.

To prove the point, why not walk down a deserted street at night without any clothes on? If *touch wood* something really happens, you can tell everyone it wasn't your fault.

Gosh.

Why can't some of you people absorb the idea that dressing conservatively helps to *minimize* the *probability* of something happening to you? It's a safeguard. From a common sense point of view. I don't get how, if at all, the well-intentioned posters giving this advice are "blaming" the victims in any way.

A BBC article recently reported that Singaporean students are spending their lunch times to attend weekly lecture on Managing Diversity in Asia at SMU. The course is said to help prepare the Singaporean student population for work.

The article revealed that Singapore graduates are amongst the most ambitious in Asia when it comes to job and salary prospects although their expectations are not met in reality.

Graduates in Singapore earn around S$2,000 and there is a downward trend on the graduate employment rate. The weakening economy is adding to the woes of these graduates. Young Singaporeans are now under pressure to become more competitive, or start looking at other ways to make a living.

For some graduates, starting a business has become an option but Singapore’s education system has been criticized for not being well-rounded to create entrepreneurs. Roshni Mahtani, CEO of Tickled Media, a content and community company for parents in Asia, said, “As a Singaporean who has gone through the education system here, I definitely do not believe that we get the skills we need to become entrepreneurs. You need to be a risk taker to be an entrepreneur, and our schools didn’t prioritize that.”

The government cannot control external factors that impact our economy. What happens when the government runs out of ideas to tackle the fast changing face of the economy in a globalized world? What happens when the measures they have put in place are “maxed out”? 

Perhaps the government needs to boldly change the course of the Singapore education system to equip the student population with critical thinking, analytical skills, creativity, a risk-taking mindset, and adaptability so that the population is equipped to stay afloat in changing environments. Or is our education system good enough as it is?

If clothing really affected whether or not a rapist would commit the crime, then why do women who cover up still get raped? See–

"If women covering up their bodies worked, Afghanistan would have a lower rate of sexual assault than Polynesia. It doesn’t. 

If not drinking alcohol worked, children would not be raped. They are. 

If your advice to a woman to avoid rape is to be the most modestly dressed, soberest and first to go home, you may as well add “so the rapist will choose someone else”. "

 (rapist thingy)

I am the OP and id like to say yes I was wrong in using the analogy of putting myself in his or her shoes. 

All I was saying is that looks are a factor in the decisions of a rapist. I never said it was the cause. There are of course other factors like environment and circumstance. 

Also you people need to understand that there are many kinds of rape, that could happen for example during dates, or after a night of drinking. It can happen strangers or friends or acquaintances, with or without force. Just that there is no consent.

So there is this girl being raped at night, and some one was accusing her of wearing too sexy for causing the mishap. Most of the girls defended whoever made this controversial statement and caused public fury. 
Well, gals, of cuz the rapist was in the wrong. I am not trying to defend the rapist in any way, he deserved to be punished and put behind the bar. However, my point is, in order to protect yourself, pls do try to avoid walking alone at night with sexy or even erotic clothing. It's ultimately to protect yourself. 
Let me give you a simple analogy. If you withdraw 500k cash from the bank and put inside a transplant plastic bag, it will naturally attracts the attention of the robbers right? Am I right to say you increase the probability of being robbed compare to the same guy carrying 500k with a cheque and hide inside his wallet? Of cause the the robber will get punished and your money might be fully recovered. But that's not the point, its the prevention that matters. 
Money can be recovered, Virginity/Dignity can't. So pls do pay some attention of your clothing if you are walking alone at night, especially in some ulu places, never take your own safety for granted just because you believe in "justice".

@

Don't worry about the comments. I agree with you, I do think that there are girls don't look for money and we shouldn't be generalised with the so called 'gold-diggers' just because they get bad rep and are represented more in the media. For instance, I really can't care less how much my future husband earns as long as he is not a house husband. I just think he needs to be hardworking to set a good example for the children. I come from a major that would end up earning enough to support the both of us, so it's perfectly fine for him to earn less than me. 

Money come and goes, so it's values like respect, integrity, compassion, trust etc. that are infinitely more desirable that can't and shouldn't be bought by money. I know it's the same tired old rhetoric etc. but to be honest I'd rather marry a taxi-driver who is positive and upright than a stereotypical crooked business man earning millions but cheating on me with 9082311 other women. Because I honestly do think there is a limit to how much happiness money can bring you beyond a certain point. 

My family's pretty above average but I've never spent more than 50 dollars on clothes, beauty products, accessories etc. because my needs are pretty simple, and I'm sure there are others out there who are the same. What's the point of having so much money if you don't feel the need to spend them? Donate all to charity I guess, since my kids should be raised to be independent and won't get more than 10% of my inheritance. So if that's the case why marry for money and be miserable?

Ultimately don't sweat it what other people think of girls liking money. Just be true to yourself, know that you're not part of that demographic, and that's all you need really. We're only accountable for our own actions in life.  

P.s. I never got girls who have 100+ pairs of shoes because boots don't stack! *Awkward laughs* Oh god I'm going to die rich but alone.

Only act inclusive and open when canvassing for votes during election season. Then the rest of the year so damn exclusive. Every single year, new people, but.... same promise, same pattern lah. You try going to their meeting and see if you feel included or not.

 I used to be in a similar situation. I just went, anyway. Never had anyone looking at me in a weird way. People are generally friendly, since most of them share very common goals: to get in shape, be healthy, improve oneself, etc. Now, if I see someone definitely out of shape at the gym, I either ignore or think, "hey, good for him/her." There is absolutely no malice. Many of us have been there, so we're very understanding.

Just don't be the guy that sits on a machine texting for half hour. As you said, the gym is usually full, so you better be sweating.

I'm born Singaporean but I don't feel at home in Singapore. The culture here doesn't fit me at all. The things that people (in general) appreciate here doesn't fit into my way of thinking. What's worse is that Singaporeans are so unaccepting of others who do not think the same way as them. I wish I could move overseas soon. Am I wrong to think and feel like that?

Okay this is going to be a rant. Not a blind and hate-filled one though.

Disclaimer: I'm well aware that this post might be interpreted as another "hating-on-PRC-foreigners" post, but to be fair I prefer to think of it as a matter of personal character. 

Few days ago, I was sitting on the bench at the CLB bus stop waiting for the ISB to KR. Along came a middle-aged PRC national with his wife and daughter. Said guy stood in front of me and abruptly asked me what buses he could take to get to an MRT station. This is a relatively straightforward question and it would probably take an average person at most 30 seconds to prattle off "A2, 95, 96 etc." But I was 1) tired 2) brain dead 3) unsure -- so naturally it took me a while to process and come up with a satisfactory reply for him. I didn't want to give him the wrong info, but at the same time I wanted to be of help too. 

And this was when a 'communication breakdown' happened. Basically it was a back-and-forth, convoluted and rather painful conversation that went something like this: 

"...地铁?"
"...你可以搭A2去KR..."
 "Subway你懂吗"
"你说的是MRT对吗？
“...Subway, 地铁..."

With lots of mumbling, interjections and confusion on both our parts. What did it for me (in addition to the irritated and condescending tone adopted by him) was this scoffing remark he made before he left "一听就是新加坡人，不会讲华语" Inside I was SEETHING I tell you, but I opted to simply ignore his comment. A few moments after he left (to throw something away) his wife came up to me and asked if I knew where the nearest letter box was -- we conducted the conversation smoothly in Mandarin. 

So, in summary:

1. Although I might not be as fluent as I should be and my Mandarin speaking ability can in no ways match that of yours, I CAN speak conversational Mandarin well enough, thank you very much. 

2. Who on earth uses the term 'SUBWAY' to refer to the MRT in Singapore. Subway = sandwich chain stores here. 

3. Some PRCs are ungracious asshats, while some PRCs are the nicest people that I know. His wife was respectful and courteous to me. 

4. Someone is probably gonna point out that "Singaporeans being effectively bilingual is a joke", and I'm just butthurt, petty and defensive because I can't accept such criticisms/insults. TBH, it is a hard pill to swallow -- I can't help but feel angry and hurt if someone criticizes me or my nation. But I recognise the validity of his point, and he is welcome to hold his own opinion (which I daresay is widely shared). 
What I'm most annoyed about is him making that offending remark in front of me, while asking for help, and leaving without a word of thanks. What a sucky attitude. Why you gotta be so rude, don't you know I'm human too? (Magic!, 2013) 

5. I guess I have to suck it up -- it's not the first (nor will it be the last) time for such nasty encounters. 

Peace out everyone. May there be more love, understanding, tolerance and mutual respect in this world, and less scumbag Steves.

I come frm an abv average family and have been really blessed with a car to drive to sch, frequent holidays, good food and buying things without much thought. However I know I can't keep up this lifestyle on my own once I graduate. However my social circle seems to be similar to me. Abv average Singaporeans and they always ask me out for drinks and food that are quite impractical. I don't like to say no. But I like to be more thrifty.  What I'm saying is that I actually wish for a gf who's family is avg or below avg and would spur me to be more responsible in my spending. Some one who wld suggest we take the train, eat at hawkers and do simple stuff. Sure, cafes and fine dining occasionally is alright. I can afford it. But more often than not. I hope she can keep me grounded. For my own good. I don't want to be in debt in the future and have to ask my parents to bail me out of it.

 This is what I learned about human-beings: don't believe in what they say, observe what they do. Some people say they don't judge the looks of others. Some people say they are not racist. Some people say they don't study for exams. Some people say they don't mug. These are lies people tell when they are in the public. You need to say the politically correct stuffs so as to gain respect from others.

I remember seeing a post, maybe two weeks ago, asking about contraception which didn't really get useful replies. There are more methods than condoms, don't rely purely on condoms. I once had to get a morning after pill from a GP because things got messy, cost us $60. The GP also said female contraceptives should be used in addition to the condoms. If you and your partner are clean, you can choose to use the female contraceptives so the guy can go bare. 

Off the top of my head, there are IUDs, implants, "the pill", and skin patches. The patches are hormonally equivalent to the pill, but only require weekly action. You can get patches from a GP for around $60 (I think?) for three months' worth. Go look up the most effective methods, take care and have fun!

Caution: It's a Rant on Racism. 
I am an Indian Student, Brown with a Stubble look. I dress well and obviously my fashion sense is not a 'Singaporean' style, but it is based on what people wear in India, I can say I dress pretty well. The standard Blue Jeans and T.shirt/Shirt.

Now the problem is, at Public places, say for example when I give up a seat in MRT, Buy food in a local Hawker center or a restaurant, many times it has happened with me that people ask me are you a Bangla? Implying to ask am I a Bangladeshi 'Construction' worker?  and If I happen to sit beside a female, be it young or old or child in Mrt, they make that Awkward move as if an untouchable has just sat beside them ( obviously they assume I am a construction worker)

I always take it as an insult. I don't understand this. Why can't Singaporeans try to understand other cultures of their neighboring countries just like foreigners do ?

Firstly, not all Brown People are Bangla. There are 3 Major countries in the world which has 'Brown' People and that is India, Pakistan and Bangladesh with a combined population close to 2 BILLION.

Secondly, Tamil is not the Official language of India. Less than 6% of India's Population Speak Tamil. I dont understand why People get 'SHELL SHOCKED' when I say I cannot speak tamil and I am from India. 

Third and the most important, These TAMIL hawker center owners are biggest Racist bigot creatures born on the face of the planet and I don't feel like an indian even for a millisecond visiting their store and I can clearly sense their bias and the degrading look in their eyes when they ask me in TAMIL and I cannot respond to them. It has happened at umpteen number of centers in  past 1 year. They basically do a 'TEST' if I am a Tamil, if not I am useless idiot who should not be treated equally, not given the right food, sometimes charging more than one should or not giving the right quantity of ingredients or not giving all the ingredients(say veggie)  to 'trick' me. 

The conclusion is , I cannot eat proper food daily coz I don't feel like going to these places. The TAMILS are the same, The MALAY's also are the same and then there is Chinese food which I don't eat.
7/11 is my best friend and their food Biryani , Nasi Chicken etc always comes in handy. At least they keep their food quantity as well as the prices same and don't change based on the race or color of skin of a person.

"All Hail Capitalism". The People's racist attitude is responsible for the rise of Crony Capitalism.

OP of , the OP of  here. 
1) Call it racial/cultural discrimination/ethnocentrism/racism if you wish then the terminology was not the point of my post
2) I did mention that the wide majority of Singaporeans aren't racist but my point was there exists a small group of people who discriminate against people from other races. 
3) Good that you have realised you are an asshole. That is in YOUR case, I did mention that it depends on the case. There are still many more cases where discrimination and hate stem from racism. 
4) It is true that maybe some are bullied because they were rude/mean as in your case but by telling victims to reflect on themselves does it not strike you as victim-blaming for those who actually were discriminated. Those that I witnessed firsthand certainly didn't do anything wrong
5) "Its always the people who claim to be all-loving and equal who demonstrate and practice the most hate and negativity". This is just ridiculous I can't even. Similarly this also depends on each case e.g. there are a few priest child molestors. I did not have to post that long post and take some time from my busy schedule, I did so because I have long sympathised with discriminated people and was trying to give an alternative point of view and point out that there was a source for his outburst
6) Of course I have distanced myself from those friends. They are just more personal examples of racism that I thought readers would find more relatable. I have many more friends who are not like that. Generally like you said people aren't racist, they are better than that. If you are keeping up with the news however you will realise there are still cases e.g. women wearing the hijab aren't offered certain jobs if they want to continue wearing it

With regards to debates on "genetic lottery at birth", a lot of 'ugly' people feel that they should strive to find their true/inner beauty in order to compensate for their lack of outer beauty. The typical response is to downplay the significance of physical beauty (Discourses on "oh, he/she won't be a good partner anyway if all they cared for was your looks"). Now of course everyone should know their true/inner beauty whether they are physically attractive or not.

But I would like to argue that, it is not helpful to totally dismiss the feelings of attraction towards physical beauty. Although superficial, we are genetically wired to feel attracted towards physically beautiful people based on bodily signifiers as this (superfically) signals a healthy mate to reproduce with. By acting as if their physical beauty did not matter,  ugly looking people are presenting themselves with a strong internal contradiction:  they keep telling themselves outer beauty does not matter, yet it is unlikely that they will biologically cease to themselves be attracted to attractive individuals. 

This is potentially soul-wrenching. I would suggest that the way we approach this issue is not to brush off the reality of feelings of attraction to physically attractive bodies- rather, let everyone's inner beauty speak for themselves and enamour suitable partners/spouses. 

In sum, rather than a physically ugly person downplaying outer looks, the focus should be on letting the inner beauty speak for itself.

why do people not know how to treasure the people in their lives, especially close ones.

too many posts about people cheating on their significant other. is it really that difficult to resist temptation and stay faithful to your significant other? its not uncommon for people - both male and females, to be attracted to another even though they are attached. simply because more than one person can most definitely fit your criteria in finding a partner. but that doesnt mean you have to act on such attractions and question your emotional standing with your current partner. 

people take others for granted so easily. they become oblivious to the things others do for them. people get disappointed in others so easily because others do not deliver in accordance to a person's expectation of them. too many heartbreaks occur because they rather fight each other than to fight against the problem they encountered. too many relationship end up broken and fractured because people spend more effort in keeping their ego and pride unscathed rather than trying to keep their emotional investments in another.

when will people ever learn how to love another fully without holding anything back.

I am from China. 
Both my parents are from China too. We emigrated from China over to SG some 15 years ago. I must say that in the past years I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Singapore. I met many awesome people whom I had the privilege of making friends with, and I just want to say thank you all for the wonderful time and experiences. Don't mistake me, I don't intend to leave the country, I'll probably stay in SG for the rest of my life, and enjoy it. The great food, company, and life in general although it's really getting busy as hell. 

I do want to address some issues that I have noticed though. In Sec 3, there was an influx of scholars into our classes from many countries, including and not limited to Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and China. They are extremely bright, and not to mention really hardworking too. Many of them inspired me to work harder and strive higher. However, in my opinion there is really a gap in communication between the local students and foreign scholars. I do have close friends from both sides but they just don't hang out with each other much. I guess this might be due to firstly the scholars being slightly older, and also the difference in language preference. However, this has sparked quite a bit of miscommunication sometimes. From what I see, both groups are wonderful people, kind at heart and having no ill intentions. I'm sure if they made an effort to know each other better there is the potential of many new budding friendships.

IMO this is also somewhat the case in our society now. There is quite a significant portion of our population from foreign countries, but we tend to stick to our own social groups and the communication between us is quite minimal. We do prefer to stay within our comfort zones and interact with those whom share similar practices and habits, it's only natural. But sometimes I do wonder if we make an effort to know each other better the xenophobia within us would improve. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's inevitable that some of us see foreigners as simply "residing" in SG, adding to the already intense competition and not contributing their fair share (NS). IF we can become friends, would this mindset change? 

It hurts me when people upload videos of foreigners misbehaving, and in the comments people will be saying "get out of SG" or "go back to your country you're not welcome here". I'm not saying that their actions should be condoned or forgiven, my point is that there are definitely black sheep in every community. It's just that the media sensationalize such information and it leads to quite an unfair representation of how the majority of the foreign population in Singapore actually is. Most(if not all I can't think of an exception) of the people I know are delightful, well mannered and kind hearted. 

I'm writing this cause one of my friends casually asked me recently "why are China people so loud". I answered jokingly that cause there's so many of us if we're not loud we can't hear each other. I've been thinking about it, and it struck me that maybe we don't realize that we're loud cause we're so used to speaking in this way, and if no one tells us about it we'll just continue being like that. I do wish locals and foreigners can give themselves the opportunity to know each other better, and maybe then when they understand what's going on in each other's minds there'll be less conflicts and prejudices. Thank you, may you be a local or foreigner, for reading, and also for making Singapore such a beautiful place to live in together :)

In reference to 

I'm a guy and a beneficiary of winning the "genetic lottery" at birth, and I get complements on my looks and appearance - but the shallow idea of superficiality that society imputes such a high value on is somewhat disgusting.

The key idea here is to be confident in your own skin - something most of us, myself included, regardless of external looks ,struggle to do most of the time. Would you fall in love with an emotionally-wrecked good looking individual? Emotional beauty - that is what we can and must focus on. 

To OP and all the "ugly" girls and guys out there - you are beautiful, don't let anyone tell you otherwise, and that extends far beyond your extrinsic appearance, and you are certainly not going to allow your own reflection to tell you otherwise. Take measurable steps to improve your appearance and confidence. I can't emphasise enough that if you allow yourself to be exposed to the negative biases the general society creates upon itself - " the superficial mentality", it will impact you tremendously. No one likes someone who can't be at peace with himself/herself.Be confident of yourself and you will naturally exude confidence and people will notice and like you. 

Love yourself, and smile always (:

Should I stay together with my girlfriend when my family members don't really like her? Or I should ignore my family members opinions and continue to be with her? 
Worst case scenario: if I get married with her, I will not be interacting much with my family (my dad and mum) due to their disapproval with our marriage.

 I would like to point out that your problem comes from engaging in too much (Cartesian) introspection. As a result, you experience 'false' problem such as whether the person is talking to me because he is interested in me. In the social context, people talk to each other without this suspicion that you have. Surely you can't be interested in every person that you talked to.

//Go after her. Fuck, don’t sit there and wait for her to call, go after her because that’s what you should do if you love someone, don’t wait for them to give you a sign cause it might never come, don’t let people happen to you, don’t let me happen to you, or her, she’s not a fucking television show or tornado. There are people I might have loved had they gotten on the airplane or run down the street after me or called me up drunk at four in the morning because they need to tell me right now and because they cannot regret this and I always thought I’d be the only one doing crazy things for people who would never give enough of a fuck to do it back or to act like idiots or be entirely vulnerable and honest and making someone fall in love with you is easy and flying 3000 miles on four days notice because you can’t just sit there and do nothing and breathe into telephones is not everyone’s idea of love but it is the way I can recognize it because that is what I do. Go scream it and be with her in meaningful ways because that is beautiful and that is generous and that is what loving someone is, that is raw and that is unguarded, and that is all that is worth anything, really.//

I'm an Indonesian student in Singapore. My hometown is on the same island, Kalimantan, as the origin of the haze; with this I hope I can express my views on this haze that's been the subject of many talks everywhere.

Firstly I do apologise for the haze, I really do. No country should have to go through living constantly surrounded by haze. However please don't generally hate all of us just because of this. I hope you can understand that at my hometown it's much worse and that it's not that all of us are burning trees down. We all have no idea where the burning is. I live in a town that has no signs of any burning at all yet still blackened with haze. It's not like every backyard here has a bonfire.

I just wanted to bring this out so that hopefully you will not judge all of us as a whole as "forest burners". Plenty of us disapprove of the burning as well but we just can't do aything about it. I guess we just generally don't raise our voice to the government because we're not used to doing that.

This comes from the fact that Indonesia is just so big it's difficult to control everything. I know people are blaming our government about it, but I can see why it's so difficult to control everything in such a large country. It's very different from Singapore where I can get from one end to the other in less than 2 hours. I'm not defending nor attacking anyone here though, this is purely my thought on this.

So I just wanted to say this in the hopes of letting you know the point of view from one of us. Please stay safe and take care!

I think a lot of people on this page easily interpret expressions of personal opinions and experiences (example ) as trying to shove their ideas down other people's throats or trying to criticise other people unfairly. You might disagree or interpret their confession a certain way, but read through it one more time to see if they're really being overbearing or whether we took away more than what the writer actually said

Recently I've seen a few shares purporting to highlight the problem of racism in Singapore. Some have argued that education in the pre-tertiary levels have failed to expose the majority of Singapore's chinese population to the culture/awareness of the minority races, and that this failure leads to an exercise of privilege by the majority where they are unaware of the interests of the minorities. I am proud of these kinds of discussions. They contribute to what our society can consider in moving forward towards racial harmony and integration.

However, apart from the above kind, those that simply tell of outrightly racist acts/comments, do not do much. It's the equivalent of throwing around the names of HHH, Roy and Amos, and generalising their attitudes with the rest of the population, and saying that Singapore has a problem. Apart from the clear leap of logic, I think the best thing to do is simply to ignore them if you disagree with their actions. There is no need to single them and yourself out to make the point. 

What do you guys think?

In response to confession 

In life there are so many things we cannot control, a myriad of possibilities no one can ever fathom . For you in your situation, you may probably feel really trapped, for another ,to be placed in your situation may be a godsend. For everyone to be happy eventually, there may be some compromises, though i believe not entirely for only one party. It's touching that you want your parents to be assured but i believe you don't have to be unhappy to do so. In any case, you can always find a capable partner willing and happy to take over the business while you pursue your dreams.The business doesn't have to go to a complete outsider. No one ever said that life was painted in black and white, with absolute one choice options. But your life is yours to live, and your happiness doesn't have to be at the expense of those you love as well.
I wish you the courage and wisdom to make good choices :)

I've seen many Singaporeans struggle to even hold a proper conversation in proper Chinese, much less read or write them well. Some might say so what, or that English is more important anyway, but it's simply sad. I won't say that my Chinese is impeccable, but I realised the value of being effectively bilingual and take pride in it as well after going on exchange. I wish more people would too.

I want to talk about the statement by the Indonesian VP regarding the haze issue. When I first read about his comments, I thought Indonesians must be crazy to have this kind of illogical joker as their leader. However, after reading more about it, I tried to think of it from another perspective and I want to hear from the community about this.

I quote"In addition, Mr Kalla also reportedly said yesterday that companies from neighbouring countries were paying locals to clear lands using the slash-and-burn technique.

Mr Kalla also claimed that it was foreigners, who needed land between 1960-1970, who initially taught Indonesians how to destroy the forests. “As a result, in the name of development, our forests were cut down,” Mr Kalla said.

The Indonesian Vice President did say that Indonesia must handle the forest fire issue so that the haze will not happen again.

He added that besides preventing forest fires, the government has issued a ban on logging and a moratorium on land use, including opening new land for plantations.

If and only if these were true, I can understand how angry Mr Kalla must have felt about the whole issue of haze. Foreigners come into your land, destroy your land, and yet expect an apology when shit happens, NO ONE will be happy about it. 

I am trying to understand this from an economic perspective and I have to agree with Mr Kalla. Lets assume the Indonesian government burn their own land for profit. The marginal benefit from these activity is actually minimal. Land in Indonesia is already relative cheap compared to most of other ASEAN countries. There isn't much to gain from the government's perspective. Yes you get taxes but where do the bulk of the profit go? The foreigners! Now we talk about the marginal cost of this. 

1. The poor children from areas near the hotspot.
2. Rainforests that can never be recovered lost.
3. Constant blaming from neighbouring countries.

WHY WOULD ANY GOVERNMENT want to do that?!

Hence, I feel that before we point our fingers at Indonesians for the haze, we should really ask WHO is really behind all these? I feel that if Mr Kalla put his argument first before his concluding statement regarding apology, things would have been much better. 

He is just insensitive but if I have been wronged like this.. i would probably be pretty fed up too.. 
-
 

The thing is, the part that we should be grateful for the haze-less months should have been left out. 

However, your argument does really make a strong point.

Nevertheless, his opinion reflects his failure to consider that the world is made up of different people, not just the ones that came into his land and slashed-and-burned. That, and a whole lot of other stuff.

It's like the Internet - you'ld only see things from YOUR Perspective, and have a "me against all of them" mentality; however, that is not the case.  For an issue with various people having strong opinions on, those people will comment on it. Those who do not, or could not be bothered less, fall back.  

As such, the opinions and actions of those you see around the Net, are due to the many who felt strongly enough to comment and take action; NOT representative of the entire Netizen population.

Now, translate this into Mr Kalla's words - he blames Majority of the foreigners for the actions of a few of us. That is not the level of judgement a PM should pass. He should be aware of his position as a politician, and be aware of the fact that his words have quite large repercussions, locally or elsewhere. 

Him saying that, is akin to me saying this: everyone around a homicidal maniac should be thankful towards the homicidal maniac, because he kept himself under control and did not kill them for the many days he's been around. And that's just one point.

Mr Kalla blames us foreigners, and goes on about how the forests in his country are being cut down for the sake of development. Very well, how does he intend to soundly develop is country further? He could have prevented this, and changed the economic direction of his country, to do away with the need for the slash-and-burn. 

Of course, I am not suggesting a one-pill-cures-all solution, but the problem could have been reduced, avoided, and subsequently eliminated, through progressive steps of improvements, taken over the years - the economic infrastructure, etc., could have been improved. This point, of course, will hinge on what he and his government intends to do from now on.

It is not that we did not try to take responsibility for the actions of the some of us who committed the slash-and-burn. 

The SAF extended aid to help put out the forest fires, but it was subtly rejected, for what reasons, I have no idea. I do not bother either. If we look at it from another perspective, the SAF responded to its country's need for fresher air - but the fulfillment of its said work was hindered by barriers. 

We tried providing a direct solution to the problem, but a representative said "no thanks, we've got this", while another proceeded to blame us for the problems with a holier-than-thou attitude after our solution was rejected. It is not right. It's not being noble either. It is not a "taking one for the team", a "making a huge sacrifice for everyone" kind of thing. It is being selfish in the name of pride.

Yes, I point fingers, but I point them at people being jerks. I am not afraid to be one either. I don't expect an apology from the PM regarding the haze (apologise for what?), but even if he is not going to apologise, it is not wise to provide unnecessary comments that rile people up.

Now, before any of you jumps in and says, "It's not that simple to change the country.", I do not study politics, economics, etc.; I am just one of those unsophisticated country bumpkins - I am only concerned with these few things:
1) my masks, who's gonna pay for them, and with whose money?
2) how does the haze affect my work?

If you cannot make things simple and effective enough for people like me to see, what more can you expect from people as a whole?

I was born well-off. My dad owns a local automobile dealership worth hundreds of millions. As he is a traditional Chinese businessman and I am the only son, he plans for me to take over his position one day after I graduate and gain enough experience learning the trade. Everything in life seems to be nicely arranged for me. I don't have to worry much about an uncertain future. However, all these benefits came with a heavy price — freedom.

My parents have always been making decisions for me every since young. Even the type of pencil case I brought to school had to be scanned through by them, and it has to be "presentable" enough based on their standards. It's really that stupid. But what can I do? They paid for most of my cost of living.

In my teens, I wanted more autonomy. I tried to do part-time work during my polytechnic studies so that I can learn how to be more independent, however my mother fiercely opposed it. She was afraid I will start getting new and "crazy" ideas about my future career, instead of focusing on my education then the family business. Whenever I want to earn some extra money by MYSELF, she will ask me to go help daddy's company.

Work in my dad's office is boring. Because the structure is already in place, I didn't do any hands-on work. When I ask employees if I can help them with anything, they'll say it's okay as they can do their task by themselves. Although I am paid well, I felt insignificant, as though I am wasting my time. Although my dad taught me how to plan, manage and network with people during car shows, that's not the type of work I want to do. I aspire to be a teacher instead, I want to do more groundwork where I can actually make a difference in people's lives. 

I brought this up to my dad countless times. I told him I don't want to manage his company after I graduate. I joked that he should liquidate the company after he retires or choose another person to be in charge. The old man got angry and repeated the history of how he started the company and blah blah blah blah.

I am very envious of some other families who can lead such a carefree life. Their parents leave most of the decisions up to their children, and trust them for making the right decision. It's more like a friendship of mutual trust, instead of a rigid family hierarchy where the upper binds the lower.

I really love my parents a lot, and I feel I've got to sacrifice my own freedom to please them. My dad is a very sentimental person and the company means more to him than bread and butter. So I guess I have no choice but to make him happy for now. That is the responsibility I have to fulfill as a son.

Most said that they wanted to be wealthy so that they can have more freedom. However, this is only true if the money comes from an overnight miracle which a lot of my friends dream of. Yet if the money comes with a greater set of responsibilities, your freedom will be shackled, and no matter how money you have, you will feel you're always being watched over and your every decision will be scrutinized and criticized. And at the end of the day, it's the intrinsic value of personal freedom we all desire, not the extrinsic value of material riches.

Here are some reasons I think NUS should have an LGBT club:

First, it recognises that there are LGBT students and that, just like the rest of us, some of these students need help and support. LGBT students will not disappear simply because we pretend they do not exist. They are not widely accepted by Singapore society and, if we do not find ways to support them, we will only alienate them further.

Second, it can be a platform where students can learn more about, and openly debate, LGBT issues. The club can organise forums where we can hear from our LGBT schoolmates. We might not agree with their choices, but at least this disagreement is not because we do not understand them.

Third, in my opinion, NUS should be neutral on controversial issues like abortion, euthanasia, and of course, LGBT. It should recognise that we all have different beliefs and values. Through honest and open discussions, NUS can help us to understand ourselves and our choices better, but it should not make these choices for us. Allowing the forming of an LGBT support club does not mean that NUS supports a certain lifestyle. It suggests that NUS believes we can deal with complicated issues frankly and openly, trusts we are mature enough to form a reasoned opinion, and respects whatever conclusion we arrive at.

  Dear OP, I am a survivor of sexual violence too, so I can understand why you're so upset with the police. If you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, you can email me at you.r.nt.alone@gmail.com. This email account has just been set up just for you. I can reveal my identity to you via that email, or you can create an anonymous email to contact me.

For anyone who has been through sexual violence or simply want to know more about sexual violence, you can email me too. Sexual violence is more common than what many of us think and it is a real pity that people don't talk about it. 

To everyone who has been through some forms of sexual violence, you are not alone. Jiayou！

Looking through the comments in the original post, thank you Iris Zhang for speaking up for the OP. While it is not wrong to ask about OP's attire to find out more about the details of the crime, but certainly not as the FIRST question！The priority of the police should be to ask if the OP knows the rapist or how the rapist looks like. Where and when did it happen? Are you comfortable with sharing the details of the events with us to help with the investigations? etc.

I'm not insinuating that the police or the other commentors are victim-blaming the OP, but so many people are ignorant about the challenges of people who have been through sexual violence. When people are ignorant, they say insensitive (and sometimes stupid) things. There are not enough education and discussion about sexual violence. And sexual violence remains one of the most under-reported crimes.

OP, you are very brave to have gone to the police. I'm sorry that you have to go through this pain, and that the police were not as supportive as you have thought.

Hi, am I the only weird guy in NUS who has been flirted by a lot of gals, basically playing with their hairs, glancing me all the time and checking me out. However, I am not easily understood by others since i hold onto to values that are vastly different from others. I do not know why so many gals are tempting to me and I do not want to waste time or hurt them if I don't think she is a right fit. I am 25 evergreen without having any relationships with girls. As I can't find gal who is both pretty, smart and having a nice heart. If you were a gal, would you like to know this guy? I admitted that I am quite good-looking, nice, polite, understanding, humble and do not think of myself highly than others, helping others, or avoiding conflicts at the expense of myself. Will our culture, especially in this generation, a very sexed-up, material and pleasure driven culture accept a man of integrity, holding onto righteous values at the expense of oneself. I have lost everything I had because of holding tight to my belief. I believe we can be righteous and successful at the same time, however, I failed miserably. If you were a gal, will you still love me?

With all the posts about bullying going on, I just felt that it is perhaps time to provide an alternative perspective to the entire phenomenon of bullying. 

While it is not wrong to say that bullying something that has to be stopped, it is also not entirely correct to put all the blame entirely on the bully. For instance, if the person committing the act comes from an abusive background, or has constantly been exposed to some form of physical/verbal violence in his/her daily life, be it at home or at school, it may be a natural response for him/her to react in social situations according to how he/she has been acculturated to handle them, and therefore, the acts themselves, when they are carried out, may not be occurring on a conscious level.

Moreover, the line between what constitutes bullying and what doesn't isn't exactly very clear at all. A person could play pranks on his friends with regular frequency. And when I say pranks, I'm not specifying anything, but sometimes pranks do get out of hand and someone can be physically or emotionally injured. From the outsider's perspective, this could be considered bullying. However, from the friends' perspectives, perhaps it isn't viewed that way, even if one party is constantly at the mercy of the other. Also, depending on the way the perpetrator presents his/her side of the story, what may to the victim be seen as abuse may be seen by others to be a joke, or something trivial. Like when I was younger I had some things done to me by an adult who was in a position whereby he could in a sense be considered a guardian, things which can be considered to have left scars on my self-esteem, confidence, and ability to trust others (just a caveat, there's nothing sexual involved). The way that person framed it, that it was for my own good, made it seem instead that I should have been grateful to him (which I obviously wasn't). And because of the disparity in power, as well as my ignorance about possible measures for redress, at that time there was nothing I could have done about it but suffer in silence.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that the phenomenon of bullying, like everything else, isn't as black-and-white as it may have been made out to be. And just as much as the victims of bullying incidents do deserve the understanding and emotional support of others in the aftermath of any bullying incident, because they are likely to be the ones to have lost the most out of the incident, so do the bullies deserve to be spared some thought as well. Corrective punishments like expulsion from school do little to reform. It is more important to reach out to the bully to understand the motives behind the bully's actions and give him/her just as much support as one would the victim, so that he/she would realise the error of his/her ways and hopefully take the initiative to make amends. That way, there's a chance that both, understanding each other better, will be more able to move on, maybe even become each other's support. Granted, it's not easy to do so, but there's no harm in trying. And if it can create a better outcome than the bully continuing business as per normal, with the only difference being that the victim actively seeks out revenge, then why not? Just my two cents worth.

And for those who read all the way to the bottom, here's a picture of a cute cat that I found off Google to make up for the torture I put you through. :)

The bullying incident brought back memories of the past. Being made fun of just because of my name. Being called names. Ostracised by the class because I was labelled the weirdo by the few. Crying and weeping over them. Complaining to my teacher in the journal that we had to submit. The teacher couldn't be discrete enough and told the whole class about it, requesting me to change seats on the spot. This in his eyes was a solution. But to the class, it became a topic again. Why don't dare to say out loud? Need to write in journal is it? Complain about us. 

Bullying is bad. It hurts my self esteem. It hurts my character and personality. I was cheery and carefree before primary 2. But afterwards I changed. To top that off, I was molested unintentionally by someone in the toilet while peeing. 

Primary school really wasn't the best place for me. Hurtful and scary memories were made there. I'm glad that now, I've learnt to love myself more and use what the bullies gave me to better improve myself. Though I'm not the buff or clever type, but at least I'm true to myself.

To the bullies that caused me pain and scars that burnt so bad, I quote a sentence from  the Chinese drama 步步惊心. This was spoken by 若兰. '我不恨他。可是我绝不会原谅他.'

I'm looking for a person that I'm not too sure goes to NUS or even exists for that matter. 
My family has a domestic helper who comes over once a week to do the cleaning. Let's call her D. We found her through an agency and she's been working at our place for about a year. The rather odd thing is that D is Singaporean (Chinese) and quite elderly (the agency told us she is about 40 but that is clearly not the case). I say this is rather odd since we have not encountered local aunties who work as cleaning staff at other people's houses (as opposed to shopping malls, offices) 
She works for about 3 hours and clearly gets very tired towards the end. Her rates are quite high and her cleaning isn't very effective to say the least. But it is impossible these days to legally find others who work on such a basis and we sort of feel its OK to be helping out an old lady. Now for the part I am curious about:
D says she has a daughter who is in her final year of Engineering in NUS. Apparently, the daughter was originally in an admin-type position and rose up the ranks and came to study in NUS. From eavesdropping on D talking to my mother, I gathered that the daughter once worked at PUB or NEA and was practically like an assistant to Dr Vivian Balakrishnan. The story seems very muddled up to me for whatever reason. 
So I've got a couple questions:
1) D wasn't really clear what discipline of Engineering her daughter was doing. And something tells me that she may have just thrown that out there because my mum told her that both my cousin and myself are from NUS Engineering. I don't know why, but her description of her daughter struck me as very odd. 
2) If her daughter held such a position in the past, is it not possible for her to support her mother such that she doesn't have to work such a laborious job? I know their circumstances are very different from mine, but with financial aid, her salary, etc can't the daughter manage to pay for school and support D?
3) My mum has said in the past that she sometimes suspects D doesn't even have a daughter. That makes me feel very uncomfortable. Why would D take the trouble to construct such a huge story for a bunch of strangers?

I haven't personally asked D these questions because they are too invasive. So fellow students, try and help me make sense of this situation. And if anyone (in Engineering) can help verify if D's daughter exists, could they anonymously let me know (post a confession) why D undertakes such work at her age? Thanks very much.

“Every fall into love involves the triumph of hope over self-knowledge. We fall in love hoping we won't find in another what we know is in ourselves, all the cowardice, weakness, laziness, dishonesty, compromise, and stupidity. We throw a cordon of love around the chosen one and decide that everything within it will somehow be free of our faults. We locate inside another a perfection that eludes us within ourselves, and through our union with the beloved hope to maintain (against the evidence of all self-knowledge) a precarious faith in our species.” 

― Alain de Botton, On Love

Op of , I was in one of the more notorious neighbourhood schools where ah beng wannabes joined gangs or whatever to prove their masculinity. Being 160+ and weighing in at a mere 48 kg didn't help things either. So I was constantly being picked on when I entered the school in sec 1. What I think is important is to stand up for yourself before things got out of hand. No one is going to be there to protect you forever, not parents, not teachers, not the police, heck not even your friends.
On a particular day when I felt that enough was enough, I jumped onto one of bullies and gave him a serious beating. I obviously got into trouble with the bullies, teachers and their gang. But it died down after a while since they realise I will retaliate. What is done is done and I hope you can teach your kids to stand up for themselves in the future, cause nobody will protect your own interest other than yourself.

Cheers!

Anybody here following the news of the school bullying in Singapore? Reading about the now-nationwide incident has opened up a lot of old wounds from my past of being bullied in school and not receiving any support in return. 

To those who say that bullying whilst one is still a child or teenager should not be taken seriously to the point of punitive punishments meted out, you quite clearly have underestimated the psychological scars that such unthinking behaviour can have on an otherwise balanced and happy individual. I wonder often how much of a better person I would have turned out to be had I not gone through the hellish bullying and ostracisation I was subjected to for the first ten years of my educational life here in Singapore. 

The bullies move on, say they've "matured" and made good on themselves. Whilst the victims are the ones left with lifelong scars that have the potential to ruin their lives for good. What justice is that?

RE: 

Hi, NUS alumni here. I wanted to comment on your post using my Facebook account but chose not to for reasons I will explain soon. Like yours, my younger brother is gay. I know exactly your situation because not too long ago, I was in it. The only difference is that my family and I are Muslims, not Christians. I chose to reply to your submission anonymously for three reasons: 

1. My brother isn't out to our parents; 
2. Our parents condemn homosexuality; and
3. Our parents are our Facebook friends. 

I first suspected my brother was gay some time last year. I had my reasons to suspect he was. My brother didn't talk much about girls. He's never had a girlfriend. He's never dated a girl. This puzzled me because he's had girls confess their feelings for him in his JC days. He was - and still is - a charming young man. I used to joke to my parents that he stole all the good looks. The only gene we had in common was our intelligence.

My brother and I were close since young. We went to the same religious school, handling workload from both madrasah and secular curriculum at the same time. We would encourage and challenge each other academically. We played soccer together as kids and even now as adults. We ate at the same table for every meal with our parents. There was no secret in our household or so I thought.

He had a male best friend that my family and I knew about. A Chinese boy he got to know in army. I didn't think much about their friendship until one late night when I saw from my study, the two of them walking towards our house gate holding hands. Much like you, I knew LGBT people. I'm even friends with some of them. I took a "live and let live" mentality. I thought that as long as they were good people, whom they date is not my business. But when I realised that my own brother was gay, I felt concerned and uncomfortable by that fact. Strange, huh? I was OK with having LGBT friends, but it became a problem when I realised that it was family. 

I remained quiet on the matter for a long time, but believe me, I thought hard about it. I spoke to religious teachers. I read the Qur'an. I looked at Islamic historical records. But I couldn't find any answers I was satisfied with. I struggled internally between religion (what I am taught to believe is right and True) and familial ties (what I am taught to appreciate and love). I chose eventually to look at it from the latter's perspective. I knew I love my brother and I didn't want him to feel unwelcome in his own home. So one day, not long ago, I decided to ask him about the relationship he had with his supposed "best friend". I assured him that he could tell me anything and I wouldn't judge. I saw my younger brother, whom I knew to be a strong person, break down in tears when he came clean. I felt his pain. The kind of pain that comes from having to keep secrets. 

My brother and I have a better relationship now. The respect we've has grown immensely. I've gotten to know his boyfriend. Nice guy, but speaks a little too fast and his pronunciation needs severe work. Not sure if my strong personality is giving him reasons to be afraid of me. I know that they're much in love. I know that my brother will achieve great success in his field and that he will live a fulfilled life. I know that he doesn't intend on coming out to our parents. I won't pressure him to do so but he knows I'll be on his side if and when he crosses that bridge.

When I was reflecting on this matter, what helped most in coming to a place of acceptance was to ask a simple question, "Do I love him?" The answer was obvious. You made a brief mention about gay marriage. Honestly I still struggle with it. Islam is and will always be a big part in my personal life as a Muslim and my professional life as a lawyer. I'm not comfortable by it. I'm unsure that I'd be vocal in my support for gay marriage. My brother is aware of this. At this time, at most, I'm for the repeal of 377A. My stance on gay marriage might evolve over time. I don't know for sure. But I believe I'm capable of change and so I'm leaving it as a possibility to re-visit, talk, think and reflect. As a lawyer, I care deeply about issues relating to minority rights - religion, race, gender and perhaps, not too far in the future, sexual orientation too.

Dear Justice Bao,

I must commend you for not joining in the few frequent commenters who keep bashing Herbert. They are so much more annoying than Herbert himself. 

You're the only one anonymous commenter who doesn't hide behind the mask so you can comment irresponsibly, while the rest are revealing their ugly side by being an ass to Herbert.

Respect you Bro! Enjoy more baos!

My younger brother and I are both in NUS. I suspect he might be gay but I'm not sure. I've seen him often with this other guy. I've met him before for lunch. My brother introduces him to me as his friend. I, however, have my two reasons to believe otherwise:

(1) They are quite uh... chummy? Not in a no homo, bro way either. 

(2) I once saw this guy sweep my brother's hair into place while I was waiting in the car to get all of us home.

I've no problems with LGBT people, but am quite uncomfortable with issues relating to gay marriage for uh, religious reasons. We are Christians if it matters. I have friends who are gay. But I never thought my brother might be. I would still love him if he is, but I'm finding myself in a rather awkward position. 

Help? What do I do? How do I ask him? Brother's not very straightforward sort and I am. Don't wanna come across too direct or not tactful.

I love children! I really do. Adore them to bits. But would I have kids on my own? I don't think so. Having children is so expensive. And living in Singapore doesn't help either. So I've been thinking... Would I rather have kids? Or would I rather spend my money on my parents instead in the future? I choose my parents. I know some people are able to do both. But I don't think my profession later in life would allow for that economically. Plus I really don't want to stinge on my parents and have them work. I don't think they have saved up enough for retirement either. Lately, I've came across a couple of elderly workers. And yes I know, they are contributing to society, staying active, and some do choose to work cause they can't stand the thought of staying at home. But whatever their reason is, I just can't help but feel sorry for them. They are supposed to be relaxing and spending time with family and friends instead! I'm not blaming their children either. Everything is so expensive and we don't know what they might be going through, that they are unable to look after their parents, financially. Not judging at all. But for me,  I wouldn't be able to stand the thought of my parents working, after all they've done for my brother and I. Here's to me hoping and praying that I can find a partner who has the same intention of not having children too...

You're so smart, surely you know whether you are strong willed or stubborn.

By failure I do not mean it's not good (I trust that it's technically solid) -- I mean not successful. Success depends on many factors. Quality, timing, location, originality, other factors.

NUSWhisper is lucky to get the timing right, as NUS Confessions had sorta died a natural death. It also had the support of a computing student base as it was a module project, before organically spreading out to others.

I'm not putting you down. I'm throwing you a challenge. Come back with something different, innovative, helpful, unique, earth-shaking, mind-blowing. I think no one will mind you advertising with a whisper then, especially if it's something that is potentially helpful to them, saving them time, money, making connections etc... in a way that has never been possible easily... until your new app.

Will you pick up the gauntlet or continue to sound like a broken record?

To 
It's great that you respect your parents and their hold over you. But sorry to break it to you, they're doing you more harm than good by sheltering you so much. Are they still going to do that when you are..say 30? You might argue that by then you would be mature enough to judge for yourself what is 'right' and 'wrong' but honestly maturity doesn't come from age alone. You need to experience life and make your own mistakes in order to actually be able to grow and have your own opinion on things instead of not doing something just because you don't think your parents would approve. Do you think if your parents are controlling you so much you'd be able to develop such a character? you need to be clear of your own sets of values and morals and define your own boundaries. Sure we don't agree with her sexual activities but we don't have any rights to. As you said it's her own "v" and it's her own body so she can do whatever as long as she stays safe. She has her own set of values and principles which doesn't have to coincide with that of her parents'. sure parents have a right over their kids but at some point they have to accept that their kids will make their own decisions and they also have a right to make them.

To  I am a girl and I prefer having sex to making love. I can have sex with Fwb without any emotions, it's just satisfying my sexual needs. I like the foreplay and the suspense of not knowing what the guy will do to you... Making love with your boyfriend actually gets predictable at times, no matter how good he is in bed.

To the girl who replies to all the Herbert post: 

Just wondering if u know him personally and if not what feud do you have against him? Yes he may be annoying by advertising his app on NUSWhispers but just live and let live la. He's just proud of his app and maybe has a lower eq in not realizing that people can find his behaviour irritating but he isn't malicious or anything. I do realize your comments on posts can also come across as condescending too. Seriously commenting hi Herbert  on EVERY post? Grow up abit can girl ? Such behaviour should be left behind in primary sch and give the poor boy a break can?

to OP of , I'm sorry for what you went through, because I'm a chronic ogler too. I am looking for an objective discussion here, and I apologise in advance for any offensive or misogynistic remarks; I'm really having a difficult time phrasing this properly. 
This is a tricky topic, even though it ideally should be black and white. And especially since leg-baring outfits (short shorts/skirts) are fashion staples ALL DAY EVERYDAY, like seriously everywhere I go. I admit that a show of legs always snags my attention - so just imagine how haywire my radar goes everyday. I'm sorry if you ever catch my gaze on your legs, but rest assured you won't hear a peep from me (no pun intended). 
While you girls have a right to wear anything you please without feeling threatened or ashamed, I've always wondered why this style is so popular? Doesn't it make you feel a bit too naked, especially in public? I personally would feel rather self-conscious if I had to go out in a singlet or short shorts. I don't claim to speak for all guys, but wearing short shorts is much less common except maybe for runners. 
Those men's actions are definitely unacceptable, but what about silent ogling? After all, clothes and fashion - besides comfort - are for visual purposes right?
Okay end of my post for now, I can't think of a coherent way to say everything on my mind. Admin please don't filter my post, I would really like to hear some objective and intellectual points about this issue.

To , one fwb not enough ar? Why need so many? It's gross and I'm not even religious. You want stds? But anyway, your parents of all people have every right to poke into your business. Telling your aunts and uncle might have been too far, but if you think you did nothing wrong, then br prepared to justify yourself . Why do young people now need so much sex? No wonder so many people getting stds and hiv.

It sucks, to be born into a strict religious family!!! Recently my parents found out about my affairs with multiple FWBs. Instead of confronting me directly, they invited my aunt and uncle over to stick their holy noses into my business. Things got ugly during the "so-called religious counselling" when I could no longer tolerate their "moral high ground" attitude.

I got damn pissed off and I asked my aunt, "Erm.. aunt, you had only tried one dick in your entire life? How do you know that uncle's dick is the right one? There could be longer and better ones out there.. just saying".

After hearing my remarks, my uncle couldn't contained his holy rage and he started yelling at me, constantly highlighting that fact that I'm a freaking sinner. I then, told him to swear to god that he had never watched porn and masturbate in his whole entire life. I could still remember his epic expression afterwards, when his face turned red hot and stumbled over his speeches.

All thanks to my considerate parents, the whole family knew about my sexual life now. However I'm totally fine with being labelled as "the whore of the family". But I'm not gonna tolerate anyone that tries to condemn me using religious verses. Listen up! 本小姐 ain't gonna take that religious dildo up my ass! We are already living in the 21th century please.... I would open up my legs as and when I'm pleased.

Do girls find mixed race guys attractive? I'm 3/4 Japanese and 1/4 white American from New York. I've been told by many girls I'm a smooth talker and often end up sleeping with them. But I don't know if they find my personality appealing, or whether it's just my concoction of ethnicities that they simply cannot resist.

 It is saddening to see the same group of people discouraging Herbert. Most of them will achieve nothing much in life. They stand on the sideline criticizing the entrepreneurial people.

 There is no need to masturbate. Only recent times where we believe that sexual function is essential to life. This mistaken view which is not helped by psychologists like Freud and Maslow who depict sex as a basic needs in the hierarchy of needs. Your sperms contain essential nutrients for your other parts of your body. Hence the purpose of sexual abstinence in the Ancient is to prevent energy loss.

Join the ranks of the celibate geniuses like Pythagoras, Plato, Descartes, Newton, Kant, Tesla......

To the people who are blatantly attacking the guy who is promoting his app, cut it out please!

Why you gotta be so rude?

I'm a Singaporean and while I don't agree with  at Singapore accent is 'lazy', at least the ISB announcements should pronounce the words properly like how they should correctly be pronounced...

The announcements on MRTs are perfect, why are our ISB announcements sounding so... chin cai?

Being isolated from this community that you grew in is a remarkably painful experience.

But let me for once put it on record: I will never be defeated. The knives stabbed in my back, I will remember them. I will keep them there. Pain has been a powerful motivation and it will continue to motivate me.

To my friends in this community: thank you. Thank you very much for remembering my presence. Thank you very much for being a part of my life. If I should succeed, I will repay each of you. If I should fail, I will not be the one to write the history books and I will be forgotten anyway.

To those who have delivered knives behind my back: I thank you too. I will remember those that set out to hurt me without having a valid motivation. If I should succeed, I will merely write the history books, and if I should fail, I would fade into oblivion either way.

But let me tell you one thing. One very important thing. Some of my friends think I'm the Energizer bunny. I will tell you I am a cockroach. Do you know what's so special about the cockroach? PA BUAY DOU! That means, friends, cannot beat down! Even an Energizer bunny will eventually run out of steam. But for as long as I am not dead, I will never be beaten! And that only means that anyone who aims to eliminate me from this game must first be able to take my life. I won't dare you, because I know you dare not.

Isolation ironically provides an extremely powerful position for the isolated. The isolated is unmonitored, free to amass his or her forces. The isolated need not influence through community means, but can work underground. The isolated can connect with similarly disgruntled people. The isolated can eventually be a force of people whom you tried to banish. The isolated does not seek to destroy the community that isolated it. It merely hopes to assimilate this community and rewrite the rules.

Come forth, my friends. Those that have been victimised. Those that have thought they did not get a fair deal. We demand our rights, our say, and our community will eventually be rewritten in our name!

If you want to be FAMOUS, this is for you!

Recently the case on "Ahmed's clock bomb" is clearly exploited by by Obama, Mark Zuckerberg and MIT as a PR strategy, to give the impression they and their organisations welcome "brilliant" minds no matter what their background is. First, Ahmed didn't create anything too outstanding worthy of such recognition (it's just a damn clock which looks like a bomb!). Okay, they rolled the red carpet for Ahmed because of the controversy created in the news where his harmless project was accused as an act of terrorism because of his ethnicity. However, there are a lot of indie tinkerers (just like you!) out there who deserve more credit than him, yet they do not receive such privileges, because they are not part of a media outrage. BOOOOOooo..!!!! The boy is overrated while you are underrated!! You deserve more than this! :D

Introducing the "What-You-Can-Do-To-Acquire-Fame-And- Recognition" guerrilla strategy! Try spreading something controversial, but yet align yourself with the message that powerful institutions wish to bring across to the people, and they may choose you as their ambassador for their PR activity. It's this simple! Try it today! And YOU too can be just as famous and overly overrated! :DDD

Life advice: Read books on war. Military strategy is often essential even in civilian situations.

The most politically wrong advice you can get; putting this on Facebook walls just imply pure perversion of the human soul.

What's the best motivation factor? When your life is on the line. Many a comeback campaign happens when one suddenly puts his or her life on the line; there is no defeat, only victory for defeat means the end of him or her. You'll be amazed at what you can do.

Placement of people: keep friends close, keep enemies closer. Study their habits. Think like them. Defeat them at their own game.

Intelligence and counter-intelligence: obtain information, spread misinformation, conceal capabilities. If people seem to want to have a hand in something you do not want interference, the best way of deterring them is diplomacy. It is not the "sweet-talk" kind but the "real-politik" kind. It is to speak to them with backing. Basically, who knows what you'll do should they not step back? People never fear the known; they can calculate against it. But the unknown is truly something fearsome; how can you plan against someone you don't know?

Removal strategy: Don't commit to the destruction of an enemy if the enemy will kill itself. Often it's much faster removing a group by spreading misinformation, sowing discord and being false samaritans than to call for a direct attack. Calling for a direct attack is war; mediated implosion is suicide.

Logistics and welfare: in war, the most important people are not the fighters. They are the people who make sure fighters can fight. Treat your people well, give them the supplies they need. Welfare is an unbinding agreement. It makes people feel bad if they turn against you. If they do you can cast them as being ungrateful. If they fight for you, it is a common goal.

Human management: it is ok to sack whiners. They are not of much benefit even if they switch sides. But the committed people, the loyal people and capable you must keep. Never be seen as dictatorial, yet have enough power to align people to a common vision. Welfare is false; a common goal is true.

Hey guys, long time lurker of this page and I feel that I need to share this with everyone.

I've been on this page for quite a long time. Probably since the posts were in the 4000 series? I find that the trend of the comments are getting quite unbearable.

It used to be simpler with people commenting directly to the topic of the post, to people typing long long ranty responses, to eventually a lot of pranksters replying with trollish/jokish comments that do not help with the plight of the poster.

I'm really not trying to be a spoilsport and obviously most people have fun with those nature of comments, but I feel that there has to be a distinct line between those comments and the people who are seriously interested in reading advice threads. Obviously not all, but I have gained new insights based on reading some of the replies to advice posts. And it's quite irritating to open a confession only to find that 3/4 of the comments are people poking fun of the situation presented before them.

My suggestion is similar to that of Reddit, a popular thread-based website that allows people to comment in general anything. Add a [Serious] tag option to posts so people who seriously seek advice can do so. And hopefully commenters will also respect the choice of the posters.  

I hope the admins seriously consider this! I'm a fan of this page even though I'm not from this school, due to the activity and nature of posts and comments.

Thanks everybody!

Urban myth: There is a belief that a Male need to clear their pipe or else it will jam up. The belief that the exercise of sex function is necessary to the health of a Male is delusional. This is not helped by the Freudian bullshit. Don't believe in such things. Masturbation or sex is not a necessity. Those who encouraged others to do it are either misinformed or have hidden agenda.

Not sure if I'm the only one who feels that this page is getting increasingly uncomfortable for me to read or even scroll through with the influx of posts related to unorthodox sexual experiences. It seems as though the OP(s) behind all these posts are the same person or people of the same intention to either AA or elicit unnecessary response in an inappropriate platform. I thought the page administrator can do better than filtering contents that spread unethical virtues and the community can be more sensible and civilised than going around to pervade the minds of the readers. Who knows that the ones behind the screen are actually not from NUS but some sickos who are actually vying for attention to their stimulating stories that have failed them in some other mature-themed forums?

To OP who wrote , just wanna put in my two cents since you asked.
Im chinese, my SO is malay. Besides weird stares from people every single time we go out, people have issues with not only the ethnic part but also the religion part. Suddenly, they all feel the need to tell me how I should live my life, like it's gonna be doom's day forever the day I marry.
The first reaction they'd give would be "Oh.", with that look which you know exactly what they are thinking inside. Then they would ask "You gonna convert?", and what follows will be either "you should try looking around first before you decide on this person" or 'subtle' criticisms of the religion they only know from the media. Funny how people think it's ok to "look around" for this specific situation.
No one ever bothers to ask me what kind of person my SO is, to know how sweet and lovingly quirky this person is. I can count with 2 fingers the times I receive a good/neutral response after people know about my relationship.
Anyway, I always tell myself this and I hope you can look at it this way: The more people criticise you, the more you will realise how much you love your SO, how much you cherish this person in your live, and that your love for this lovely human being grows the more criticisms they throw at you. I wish you best of luck and hang on there ok. ^^

Just as it has always been, when our memories of the ancient world fade into twilight, a new era dawns to fill the void. An unfamiliar path with a pulse of its own, a tempo not dictated by the labour of men, but accelerated by the rhythm of machines, launching the world into an age of bold innovation. From this cauldron of steel and sweat, a vision of prosperity emerged. Harnessing the untold power of the elements, turning night into day, creating new designs that brought the world stage to the masses, and providing an experience that many had never imagined. The advent of mechanized warfare brought devastation like none the world had ever seen, providing a window of opportunity to some to dictate conformity, as regimes spread their ideologies with a heavy hand, inciting the world to the brink of war. Yet, some chose a different path, and through their vision brought unique perspectives to the world. Singular proponents of free thinking remained, striving for peace in their endeavours to unlock the secrets of the Universe, some of which would fill our hearts with fear and regret. But as this progress unfolds, the finite nature of our world becomes clear. Our survival, the survival of all the world's peoples depends on our ability to co-exist in peace. But this peace is tenuous. Although Mankind will always look onward, yearning for more, searching for new boundaries only to break through them, with the understanding that this world is one that which we all share, comes the responsibility of knowing that the decisions you make today, will have a lasting impact on the generations of tomorrow.

To ,

The answers you get on this platform will be based on commenters' own moral principles. Some may say you are not wrong, others may say you are. However, this is an issue you must ultimately bear yourself. What are your beliefs and principles, and to what degree do you want to uphold them? A "liberal" person has the same prerogative as a "conservative" person to act as they wish in many matters (at the very least in yours). Social disapproval is also the prerogative of the people around you and you cannot stop people from disapproving though you may feel upset and try to persuade them otherwise. 
Does your guilt originate from the views of your family or from your own views as well?  Do you want to gain your family's approval only to assuage your guilt? Does this mean that your beliefs don't align? What do you really think? Dig deep into yourself and your surroundings, and know that we are each in charge of our own decisions and actions. We should not be sheep in the herd, be it a "liberal" or "conservative" one.

Sinkie girls are growing lousy at both traditional and modern roles, do you agree?

Traditional role: Taking care of kids, family, house stuff, etc.

Modern role: Contributing to income, having a good job,

But now you have girls who earn much less than their husbands, and yet suck at taking care of kids, and household.

So they end up sucking at both instead of being good at one. Compare that to people like viet girls, or ATB, they are average at modern role, and good at traditional roles.

To 

I was going to post this as a comment, but I realized that because this is a public post, and commenting on a public post will appear on your Facebook friends' news feed, it might come back to hurt me and my loved ones.

NUS whispers posts are public posts, so you are probably going to see more of politically-correct comments, especially in a society like this. People like me and perhaps you, who can't express our dissatisfaction with our relatives openly on fb, won't be able to comment. So, unfortunately, you're going to have to find your own stand on your own. You will need to figure out what level of independence and control you're comfortable withand how much you're willing to fight back. It might not be pretty. There will be some wedges driven in permanently. You will have to decide if it's worth it to you. You probably won't find many people who'll be open about this, because saying that family isn't perfect is quite taboo in Singapore, but I'm sure you're definitely not alone. Look elsewhere for people who might be able to support you. Speak to a counselor maybe, one who can understand and not just take your parents' side. PM people that you suspect may be neutral or beneficial that you can trust and who you think won't be as fixated with this stereotype. I have also seen support groups on reddit for children of controlling parents or parents for whom appearances are more important than how their children actually feel.

So take heart, remember you're not alone, and start your own bank account and start saving up for the day that you can get away.  

P.s.- uni is the best time to apply for a HDB if you've found someone you're pretty sure of for the rest of your life

I am the OP of . Just some further information about myself. I am the only child and i wish to stay single. Thus i would not have a wedding which would require the presence of these relatives. Given these scenarios, is it still justificable that because some relatives are people that i am unfamiliar with and had never really met, by right i should be given the choice and not forced to go? And neither do i have to know who the married couple is right?

Semester after semester of stress from school, the toll on my health has reached new peaks. I don't mean mental health (depression etc), but other aspects such as physical health that arose from the chronic stress.

Everyone knows themselves best - the amount of stress they can and cannot tolerate. I anticipate the stress that I face from schoolwork and try my best to manage them. I don't impose strict demands on myself to achieve stellar grades. I think that worked quite well, as I'm not depressed nor have any problems relating to happiness. My grades are not an issue, and in fact I'm in the second class honours (up) range, which I think is rather decent. Like everyone else I strive for better grades, but I don't obsess over them. 

I recognize that globalization will only lead to increased competition. Companies are becoming more selective in hiring good graduates that command "good" salary. I guess that's how meritocracy works - the best gets the best. I try my best to match up too. Often, I end up close to my limits, and will challenge myself to go further. I wasn't demanding success out of the challenge, but I merely wanted to test how far I can stretch myself to achieve greater potential. It is not always the case that the further one pushes himself, the more he will achieve. Sometimes there were failed returns, but that did not upset me.

The constant challenge is, however, extremely exhausting. After a few semesters, I was worn out and it started to affect my physical health. I was falling sick more often and was constantly weak. I developed a lack of appetite and frequently have unexplained pains. To clarify, I've always set aside some time for exercise and tried to eat healthily. This change in my physical health was gradual, but it eventually became what it is now. A doctor I seen told me it's just "stress".

This "challenge", upon reflection, is what I set against the limits that I thought I could handle. However, the extent of it is very much influenced by the competition in the society that I'm referencing. Having experienced all these, I wonder, maybe I am just not up to the demands of today's world. There are definitely a lot of better candidates out there who are more deserving, and I am unable to match up to them. I've tried, but I didn't manage to sustain. At times, I wonder if I'm one of those who fell through the cracks of today's world.

Okay let's get some solid research out about how harmful the current haze is. I am using Dr. Pope's research here. He has done one of the most extensive research on comparing health effects of inhaling polluted air vs cigarette smoke.

Using Dr. Pope's research that an average adult inhales 18m³ of air daily, and a PM2.5 level of 400 in Singapore;

400µg/m³ x 18m³/day = 7200µg/day or 7.2mg/day

An average cigarette contains 12mg of inhaled PM2.5

So a PM2.5 level of 400 over a period of 24 hours is equivalent to smoking 60% of a cigarette per day.

So, if you are a smoker, you really should not be complaining about the health effects of the haze. Yes, we have the right to have clean air, and yes we have the right to demand action by our elected representatives to ensure we have clean air here. But please don't go paranoid about what is going to happen to your health if you are a healthy person, especially if you are a smoker. Just smoke one cigarette less a day.

Of course, the calculation above was simplified quite a bit, but it is about there. Refer to the article link below for more.

@ Not interested in politics of Singapore as a foreigner, but I would like to point out that I find it strange that many Singaporeans don't believe that a government should give preferential treatment to its own citizens. I think there is a balance to be struck in not over-indulging locals, but to insist that citizens are placed on an equal footing in all respects is absurd. Personally one of the reasons why I haven't converted my citizenship is because the benefits of being a Singaporean citizen are frankly quite negligible. 

I also take offense when you imply that Singaporeans should only be kind to foreigners merely because your "survival depends on foreigners". Will you turn on us otherwise? LOL. I am fortunate to have great Singaporean friends who appreciate me for who I am, and I hope that they do not treat me well just cause their economy depends on me. At the same time I understand that the ability of professionals from my country to accept lower wages due to lower financial obligations will lead to tension in the professional lives of my Singaporean friends. You speak of Singaporeans having to shoulder this burden for the sake of idealistic "duties" to "larger communities", but ignore the fact that most of us who come to work here do so for extremely practical reasons. 

In any case, I merely posted because I found your post a little hypocritical.

I see alot of complacency students ignoring the effects of the haze. These polluted air have long term effects like cancer and so on. Just because it doesn't  kill you NOW does not mean that you are safe.

The very loud opposition keeps harping on about how Singapore isn't truly a democracy, Singaporeans are brainwashed, how we need to strive to be a true democracy bla bla bla.... It's so condescending and dismissive of informed/rational voters. Just because someone doesn't buy into your political ideology doesn't mean they are unable to think for themselves. Since when did human societies have to bend over for political agendas and ideologies? When has that ever ended well? Ideas have immense power, but they are still ideas. You cannot import the democratic system from the west wholesale and implement it here because we are completely different societies and nation states. If political ideology is like a pair of jeans, do you force yourself to fit into the pair of jeans, or do you choose the pair of jeans that best fits you ?

I have been seeing a lot of malays ranting on Facebook about burning and tossing of joss paper during the ghost festival. The reason why I mentioned tossing is because there is a type of joss paper that is meant to be tossed in the air. Some people choose to burn it, some follow the tradition of tossing.

Why are we expected to respect the malay culture of void deck weddings but when it comes to chinese customs, they expect us to change? Can't  they respect our culture just like we respect theirs? It's not like we need them to clean it up. If we can tolerate bad singing blasted for the entire two days of celebrations, I'm sure they can also tolerate joss paper burning which happens only 3 days a year. (burning takes place only on the 1st, 15th and 30th of the seventh month)

Some of the things that have unravelled in the NUS Whispers forum are truly disgraceful and embarrassing. Coming from a born and bred Singaporean - I want to say that these opinions are definitely not representative of our population. A case of the vocal minority vs the silent majority. 

When our very survival depends on foreigners, Singaporeans have absolutely no business being xenophobic. I can see how easy it is to succumb to the logical fallacy that just because you are born in Singapore, you are entitled to job positions just because of your citizenship even if your foreign counterparts may be more competitive than you. We're always talking about individual rights, rights, more rights, like we are entitled to something, when have we thought about our duties to our larger community, and our duty to better ourselves? In every society you go to, there will be bigots and people who are afraid of the unknown. We're all struggling to keep our heads above the water and survive in such a highly competitive environment. But xenophobic attitudes adopted by our society not just reflects poorly on the maturity and sophistication of us, but can be very detrimental to ourselves.  

TL;DR Everybody is struggling to survive, we do what we can as a small, highly volatile country entering into an era of uncertainty and exponential change. Close-mindedness and xenophobia are dangerously counter productive.

Just an extension to .

I think it's brilliant, the censorship done by the NUSWhispers admin. I'm quite sure most of the filtering is for rubbish posts.  This is a free platform for literally anyone to input their thoughts and discussions, both scathing and intellectual. 

But while we are having discourse, do note that we have a wide range of audience and contributors. We have EDMW folks, we have foreign students from foreign countries, we have foreign students from Singapore and we have Singaporeans from foreign universities. 

It would be unwise to lump them all together as "ze NUS peepz". 

I actually enjoy reading the discussions, a la "lurking". As do many people, I'm sure. 

Keep whispering, everybody! 
-
 
 "When our very survival depends on foreigners, Singaporeans have absolutely no business being xenophobic." And if I'm gonna be xenophobic, what can you do about it? You have no right to say that if Singaporeans can be xenophobic about it.

And you are wrong. Absolutely wrong. Our very survival does not depend on foreigners. It depends on the Singaporean core which is permanent, and foreigners are of aid to the economy for the short term.

Whatever PSI readings they are showing out on TV now, I don't believe a word of it. Looking out of the window the view is already something straight out of Silent Hill, my eyes are stinging and the smell of burning wood is getting stronger by the minute. The AQICN website says it's 248 PSI in the western part of Singapore. 

This haze is nuts!

 I shall dissect your opinions simply because your tone is so condescending, it pisses me off.

"Some of the things that have unravelled in the NUS Whispers forum are truly disgraceful and embarrassing." Who do you think you are to make such a condescending statement?

"I can see how easy it is to succumb to the logical fallacy that just because you are born in Singapore, you are entitled to job positions just because of your citizenship even if your foreign counterparts may be more competitive than you. We're always talking about individual rights, rights, more rights, like we are entitled to something, when have we thought about our duties to our larger community, and our duty to better ourselves?" That is no logical fallacy. We're talking about building a strong Singaporean core. A nation is built around its people, and the people contribute to their nation. So yes, we have rights, get this into your numb skull! But at the same time, we have a duty to our community, this I agree. There is a give and take here. Don't try to sound so righteous on a moral high horse. Many of us Singaporeans do our dues as Singaporeans, for example NS. I'm one of them by the way.

"In every society you go to, there will be bigots and people who are afraid of the unknown." Yes, there are bigots who refuse to appreciate the efforts of the alternative parties and are afraid of changing the government for various reasons. Just a personal take. People can be bigoted in one way or another, who are we to judge?

"We're all struggling to keep our heads above the water and survive in such a highly competitive environment. But xenophobic attitudes adopted by our society not just reflects poorly on the maturity and sophistication of us, but can be very detrimental to ourselves." So what have you done other than to condemn the "xenophobic bigots"? Have you tried to help others who have a harder time? Have you fulfilled your duties to the community with regards to this issue? I don't see xenophobic as immature or unsophisticated, I see it as simply a knee-jerk reaction and human nature. Not the best reaction to date, but people are worried for their rice bowls, particularly in the sphere of PMETs.

"Close-mindedness and xenophobia are dangerously counter productive." In what way? Explain yourself.

My personal take is that while growth of the nation is good, while immigration is a viable solution for the nation's economy, I disagree with "growth at all costs". Singaporeans can and will work hard to be adequate and relevant, but there is only so much we can do. The nation's policies should, in my opinion, minimize the sacrifice, and to minimize the damage to those who might be left behind.

In light of the argument between the pro-PAP and pro-opposition, I would just like to remind you people to stop wasting your time on it. Truth is PAP had won and there's no point debating the fug out of it. We're still one Singapore at the end of the day, no matter who's the government. Now chill the tits out man. No wonder we kena called "Singaporeans Bodoh". Naw i sort of beeleaf this. 
-
 
 Nobody (at least not me) are saying that the 70% of people that voted for PAP are stupid. They are just making the simple comment that we have to live with the consequences (whether good or bad ) of our choice. So in the occasion IF the PAP comes up with a unpopular policies (perphap gst hikes?) we have no choice but to suck it up and tell ourselves: well, we landed ourselves in this situation and there is no one else to blame but us. The converse is also true. And also, most of opposition supporters KNOW that not everything can be solved if there are oppositions in the cabinet. but we KNOW that at least in the situation where a unpopular polices might be passed, there could be a political debate to offer opposing views because lets face it, group-think in a one party govt is not too preposterous to assume. case in point: population white paper.

Seems like some people just hate everything about this election. This one guy comment on almost every election related post and is unhappy with all the OP.

Dude, just chill man! No need to get hostile. What people choose is their preference. No right or wrong. 70% prefer something and 30% prefer something else. Doesn't make the 70% more right and neither does it make the 30% more right. What is wrong is for you to supersede the mandate of 2.4 million people and pass judgement on what they did. THAT is very wrong!

The recent election had bothered me for the past few weeks. On the news, Facebook and more, each side has been targeting and accusing the other side and the heat has gotten too much. At the end of the day, choosing the PAP or opposition is just like choosing between iPhone or Android. There is no right or wrong and ultimately whatever you choose is up to you. There is no need for name-calling or insults on both sides. Has anyone ever insulted you for choosing an iPhone? I hope not.

Sure, you can raise points on why your choice is better. You can even persuade me to choose the other side. Fine by me. But there's no need to insult or target the candidates of the side that I choose. iPhone or Android, just choose the side you want, vote for it and hope for the best. So please, dear friends on Facebook, I like my Android a lot so please just accept that and move on, no need to target my Android any further. Does anyone feel the same as me?

Hi NUSWhispers! 

I think we need to move away from politics because it's just the same few people posting the same thing over and over again. The arguments don't change because the same few people hold the same stance and nobody learns or benefits.

In light of the recent elections I would like to express some comments. But, first and foremost, I must mention that I am a foreigner in Singapore who is not eligible to vote and likewise I understand if my opinions do not resonate with the general populace, neither do I want to impose them on anybody. However, I have been in Singapore for nearly 10 years and feel very much Singaporean in many aspects to qualify to comment.

1) One among many reasons PAP did much better than expected in my opinion, is the lack of multi-cornered fights which the opposition collaborated on. Of course the passing of Mr. Lee and jubilee celebrations played their part too.

2) In my opinion, all opposition parties in Singapore are not mature enough to be worthy oppositions. Why is it that opposition parties fight and rally to be oppositions? Why don't they fight and rally to form a government? In parliamentary democracies around the world, like the UK, Australia, Japan, India etc, opposition parties fight and rally to form a government. The ruling party and the opposition present their approaches to governance to the people, and the people give their mandate during elections. One party then forms the government, the other forms the opposition. But, the opposition is the second best choice for the government. They didn't fight to be an opposition, just that the people chose that way. And that is why they are worthy oppositions because they are able to propose alternative policies when they oppose the government. They don't oppose just for the sake of opposing.

And that is why I feel all opposition parties except one, in the current state of affairs, are hopeless. People vote to choose their government, not their opposition. The ballot paper has only one choice. You don't get to choose the government and the opposition. And currently, there is only one government forming party.

Now, regarding the one opposition party that has potential, i.e. the Workers' Party, why are they only contesting for a few constituencies? Why don't they contest for at least 50 seats, if not all 89 seats? They definitely have some substance in them. Sure, some of their policies like the minimum wage are debatable. But these are the serious issues that can be debated in the parliament and accordingly implemented. If the Workers' Party contests for all 89 seats, I am sure it will scare the shit out of the PAP and force them to make amends. This will also lead to a good debate and campaigning, ultimately benefiting the public as they truly have a choice in deciding a government.

3) Many people have mentioned that the opposition can form a government through a grand coalition. Obviously, many of these people have not heard of political blackmail, policy paralysis, or how one party can hold the entire government to ransom and stall the entire nation. Coalition governments don't happen by choice but through inevitability when no single party gets a majority. It is a provision put in place when the democratic process fails. Political parties shouldn't start their campaigns with a coalition in mind, they should only think of it towards the end of campaigning when they have a good idea of how many seats they will get and coalition seems inevitable. That's how it works in other parliamentary democracies.

Furthermore, coalition governments can work to a large degree of effectiveness in large countries because there are smaller governments in the provincial and city levels that can carry out the executive functions vested in them even if there is a political crisis at the national level. In the case of Singapore that is such a small country, and with a unicameral parliament, a coalition government with many parties (as opposed to one dominant and a few small parties) can spell disaster in the long term.

4) Keeping up with the tradition of complaining about everything, political parties will not gain much if they only complain. If unsatisfied with a policy, political parties must demonstrate or at least explain workings of an alternative policy that can work without affecting other policies. What is the point of complaining about something, but not suggesting how to change it. It is the people's task to complain when they are dissatisfied, not the political parties' task. They are supposed to affect change.

The electorate generally favours the incumbent. This follows the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' ideology. For the incumbent to change 2 things need to happen. First, the incumbent must have failed on certain aspects that affects people's lives significantly; and second, there must be an alternative party capable of undoing the wrong and taking it even further. People may be very vocal but there is no strong indication that both these conditions exist currently.

5) For everything that Singapore has achieved in 50 years, which the world is amazed at, the nation has made several compromises. Every policy that has benefited people has had its costs. So when the opposition proposes an alternative policy, it must also state at what cost does it come about. Then people can judge whose policy they prefer. There is no policy that comes about without its drawbacks. For every 10 policies that have created problems for the people, there are 90 others that have benefited the people.

Many people take food security, water security, national security, foreign diplomacy for granted. But it is extremely important and extremely difficult to maintain all these for a small country like Singapore. Can opposition parties propose alternative policies without affecting the highest standards for the above?

6) The 10 days that political parties get to campaign is very little in my opinion. There should be at least 1, if not 2 months of campaigning time given. This actually benefits all; the people, the opposition parties, and the ruling party. Everybody has time to engage in dialogue, reflect, make course corrections, and respond. It prevents freak events from affecting the decisions of the electorate. It is actually in the best interests of the ruling party to do that.

7) A good opposition is necessary as some of the government's policies seem to suggest laziness and complacency on their part. Restricting freedom of speech, may have been helpful in speeding up policy implementation in the early years of Singapore when developmental aspects were pretty straightforward. Now, that Singapore is a developed country, these restrictions can slowly be removed, not the other way round. But to affect these, a potent opposition must have the potential to unseat the current government and take over the helm. That is how it can truly benefit Singaporeans.

TL;DR, here's a summary
1) Lack of multi-cornered fights helped PAP
2) Opposition parties should fight to form government, not opposition
3) Coalition government is not in the best interests of Singapore
4) Parties shouldn't complain without suggesting alternatives
5) Parties should state the potential costs and drawbacks of their proposals
6) Campaigning time should be increased from a measly 10 days to about 1-2 months
7) A good opposition with the potential to run a government could check the government's laziness and complacency

Sorry for the long post. Anyway, as I mentioned before, I am a foreigner here who has lived here for 10 years. So I may not be able to truly understand the depths of the political scenario here. Nonetheless, I am very thankful to the government for allowing me to educate myself in one of the top institutions in the world. But more importantly, I would like to thank the people of Singapore for accepting me, for allowing me to stay here, for the wonderful friends I have made here, for the kind support I have had during times of joy and sorrow, and for allowing me to express my opinions without being threatened for my life. Singapore is really a great nation, and despite all the troubles, I am glad that people have chosen a fraud-free democratic way to progress forward.

Majulah Singapura!

With a sub whisper about PGP/residential life, perhaps the RA committees can look into this?

The PGP Residence Unit did speak up when there was some hate talk. Cmon, I think you can do better than just say 'don't hate on us', and come up with some reminder/attitude initiatives? (Posters/guidelines, etc? However useless they may be, I think it may weigh on ppl's conscience, leading to some change?).

I appreciate all your efforts in coming up with residential activities. Maybe the next step to go is to connect with your residents?

(Frankly speaking, the PGP management and RA teams don't seem to be doing anything FOR the residents. Kinda reminds you of GE2015 doesn't it? Luckily they don't need to go through elections)

- Disgruntled resident.

I am quite disappointed with the GE2015 results. The PAP is a reasonably good government, however I was expecting more good opposition to be in the parliament. Due to a large winning margin, I fear this may send a false signal to the government that their policies are all approved by Singaporeans and failproof, hence leading to the lack of the need to improve.

This election reflects the risk averse mentality of Singaporeans. Although it is very hard to say if whether the opposition parties can do a better job than the current government, Singaporeans still support the PAP which methods are tested and proven to keep Singapore afloat. Despite the amount of "Rah Rah" happening during Dr Chee Soon Juan's and the Workers' Party's rally speeches, the results proved otherwise. This is reinforced by the fact the world is chaotic out there, such as the ISIS threat and political instability in Malaysia. Maybe Singaporeans need a stable government with the experience in managing a military force and the economy to deter any external threats.

The branding comes into place as well. Not all Singaporeans are actively involved with current affairs, they do not care about what’s happening around as they’re too indulged with what they’re going to buy next or where they are going on vacation. I know a lot of people who do not bother watching election rallies, reading the news or spending time to find out more about the candidates and whether they can represent the people well in parliament. Instead, they relied on the brand, most notably, the lightning emblem which they see everywhere since childhood. Hence automatically, they will vote for anyone associated with the lightning emblem, regardless of how incompetent some of these candidates could be. I hope the GE result is not because of this group of unwise “autopilots” of citizenry.

I pray that all is well for Singapore and her future. Congrats to the winners and their supporters. And to those who lost and their supporters, work harder and smarter, because we need more alternate voices in parliament to represent the minority whose needs are often overlooked. Majulah Singapura! Time to catch up on some sleep now… Zzzzz..zzzzz…

I'm glad that PAP retained majority and won the swing voters over this time round. Some say that this could be due to the introduction of new voters who didn't qualify in GE 2011.

That's us, that's us! :)

After the results came out yesterday night, people were spamming posts like 'Hope you guys don't regret when when prices go up, or when foreigners take our jobs etc..' or posts like how we complain about PAP, and yet still voted for them. So now the 70% of the singaporeans who voted for PAP are the stupid ones? and you 30% are the smart ones? Or do you really feel when oppositions get voted in all the present problems would be automatically solved? ( I mean, look at LTK and his speech in parliament, clearly he has a very awesome solution to the population white paper issue right? )

I am one of the many who complained about PAP but still voted for them, this is because i am able to make a rationale decision after watching what both parties had to offer. The opposition simply had loads of room to improve on... I mean really?( Roy? HHH?) So for the people who keep complaining and ranting please shut up and move on with life.

I get annoyed when people use the term "asian value" or "traditional asian value" to bolster their stance against gay rights.
Firstly, Asia is too huge with too many different religions, customs and countries for such general and vague term. Secondly, it is invalid to use this term against gays. For example, study the rich and colorful homosexual history of China (an extremely old and large Asian country). In fact, I infer from my research, it was (the/one of the) best place for a gay person to live in during historical times 
-
 
 
I'm one of those, just our perspective and why we really don't mean any harm. Just how we coped.

I was born really gifted in a field. From young, parents, teachers, relatives, friends and basically everyone simply expected top results. It was easy when i was younger, but tests and exams gets harder exponentially, and we, just like anyone else, want to do something else other than studying.
I once scored 97, one wrong question and told i could do better by my teacher. There's no breathing space with all these expectations. We screw up too. The feeling when you fail to meet expectations isn't exactly wonderful. As if all that talent was wasted on you. 

Everyone has different struggles. So here's me now, bit of laziness, bit of self deprecating. Not doing that to make you feel bad, just something we do to lower the expectations about us. So no one says 'you sure get A one lah'. And we prefer not to talk about our grades publicly, no humble brag, no boasting (unless your friends do that), just trying to avoid excessive attention. We'd tell you if you are a close friend though, sucks to keep secrets alone. There's more to life than grades after all isn't it :)

The GE rally has really showed the immaturity of some candidates. I am truly not impressed by those who continuously discredit their opponents for the sake of it. We call that "argumentum ad hominem". It's very childish, petty and arrogant. It doesn't reflect well on them and their party. As it's my first time voting, I vote for those who I think can contribute constructively in parliament, and should not vote for those who happen to belong to a certain party, be it the government or opposition. This GE will set the trajectory of the nation's future. I am excited to be a part of it.

 Reading your confession I have to vent this out. I joined medicine because I was passionate about the career. I wanted to save people's lives. But when I entered med school I was shocked at the culture. 

I would not be too upset if the culture is that of punishing anything less than excellence in medicine. As doctors our responsibility is arguably higher than any other healthcare professional (not saying that they are not important) We have to excel, for our work has literally life-changing consequences. 

However, there is an expectation in the air to excel at EVERYTHING. And you are snobbed if you are seen to put in hard work. So you see people putting in extremely hard work at their studies and at the gym, then trying their best to make everything seem effortless. It's almost like JC, except that its grownups not kids playing this game. Its such a joke, look at the proportion of hot med students, then look at the proportion of hot doctors in real life.  

Why do I post this anonymously? It's because I myself am weak and have succumbed to this culture. However knowing how shallow society is, I feel that my original passion for saving people's lives has pretty much faded.

Spotted in the female's toilet in AS16. Advertisement promotes weight, someone cancelled out "fats" and writes "your self love" in its place. Another person replies "statement assumes losing weight/attempting to = losing self love? Really, now?" 

Thought this was funny. Relevant for the "love yourself" movement going around the internet where fat people say they are beautiful and shame skinny people.

Here are my personal thoughts about the good guy vs bad guy debate.  There was a quote that I heard a long time ago and I think it applies very well to this "Nice guys finish last" concept : Girls want guys to treat them as queens, but the guy is supposed to be in the position of a king, not as a servant. Simply put, girls don't want a guy who agrees and submits to everything she says, or gives in to her every need; they want a guy who can hold his own ground, have his own opinions, and be capable enough to lead when the time comes. So for all you "nice guys" who think becoming bad is the solution, you're wrong - what you need is confidence, and an ability to have your own opinion and lead the girl when the time comes. Bad guys give the illusion of being able to lead since they don't give a shit about what girls think, but if you are able to lead AND respect the girl, then you're on the right track.

 To be honest, you don't need to show resentment towards your family, Yes family support is important but the important factor is you yourself. Your internal efficiacy and drive to succeed as well as your responsibility to bear the consequences. With or without your family support. 

I am also not from the upper income family. My family isn't very supportive in most of the activities that I wanted to do it since I was young. 

I was involved in a CCA when I was young but I gave up halfway. So was being a prefect in school and I quitted halfway through. And this led to my parents mentioning that whatever things I do, I will eventually give up halfway. 

I enrolled into a top JC as my parents had made remarks that I wasn't smart enough to enter a good secondary school. My parents made that remark that I wouldn't make it. True enough, I didn't cope well enough to get into the course I had wanted in university.

However, what they gave me was the freedom to choose what I wanted to do in life. Yes I have made wrong decisions and even realised that I was fickle-minded. But they didn't blame me for those wrong decisions. Just that I have to bear the consequences of my decisions.

I am going to start pursuing my studies overseas soon. Well again, my parents are not fully supportive of my decision as they think that I am not smart enough and I don't perserve to the end with anything. However, this is what I am going to do as I have always wanted to pursue this career. Hence I will be going all out for it. 

It's your life and ultimately what you want to make out of it. Your life does not depend on your family's support or any other people's opinions. It's about you and what you want to make out of it. If you feel that by cooping yourself in the room and hide like an ostrich, then just do it. Or go out into the world and pursue your goals and dreams. The choice is yours. At the end of the day, whether you succeed or not depends a lot on your attitude and perservance. Yes family support really helps but a lot boils down to your tenacity and drive to succeed. Good luck!

So the fans of the PAP alleged that Low Thia Khiang was lying about the Punggol East financial reports that when Punggol East was under PAP, they had a deficit of $280k.

My dear NUS friends, the left page was the main Statement. It takes into account the money from the "Other Receivables" you see on the right. It has already been taken into account.

Alamak!

Thank god I emptied by G points to take ACC1002X, so that I won't be misled by either side. The facts speak for themselves.

I'm still going to vote for the PAP, but that's because I still have hope for my GRC headed by Tharman.

Every family background is different so please do not assume that your beliefs should apply to everyone. Not all parents are good parents and youd realise that if you do social work. It is alright for the kid to feel upset and abandoned. Our parents dont owe us a living, but they shouldnt be there to abuse us either, whether physically or emotionally

 Chill! Life can be rather troublesome so please do try to look at the bright side of things. I have a similar personality to yours, and defined some rules for myself which I hope you can take back (some are similar to what commenters have said): 

1. Life is never fair - someone has to do the grudge work. To me, doing more means you are in fuller control of the situation. If your entire team is really unhappy with 1 member, time to peer review the person. I've done it once before - I had evidence and I just sent it to the prof. Take it as a learning experience, as this will happen at work as well. 
P.s. If every member is pissing you off, time to do some inwards thinking to consider whether your expectations of them is fair. 

2. It seems like your rant also has the assumption that hard work = reward. Note that this is not always true, and is a serious issue, even in companies. To me, it depends on the boss. But you will definitely see people who might be smarter, do less, and rise faster or get better grades (see back to rule 1). 

3. You have to find a sustainable way to vent, and not rage on everyone. Please treat your BF nicely, or at least explain or apologies to him after this whole thing is over. As a guy, I understand that girls can be emotional, but if I were your BF/Husband, I would be worried next time when we have kids. I can take your abuse but I certainly do not want you screaming at our kids. 
P.s. Try finding a couple of days to disconnect from school. Similar to you, I also have this urge to finish all projects early, so this might be a tall order, but it work surprisingly well for me. 

With that, I conclude by saying that you are not alone :) We all have such problems. Take it with a pinch of salt (or make lemonade), learn and grow from it! Honestly, school is still not such a bad place, wait till you start working, and some of these problems can be amplified as well. Jiayou!

There seems to be a confusion on what is racism. Racism is not calling someone of a different race out when they use your race as a factor for bullying (looks pointedly at commenter for  with the chinese FB name). No, guys, this is what we minorities go through:

I was working at a polytechnic during my long break before uni. I was initally rejected for the job because I am unable to converse in Mandarin. I was absolutely devastated when I got the news, and the lady heard the change in my voice - she called back after 2 hours to say they could 'accommodate me'.

On my first day, I was stationed next to a man in his early 50s and 2 young girls next to him, when the aircon suddenly went bust. Some Indian foreign workers came in to fix it, and that's when all he broke loose. 

Basically, the old man, sitting 5cm away from me (an Indian myself) just went 'Hey look Indians!!' And went on to just unleash the most hurtful, terrible things you can imagine about us. It was awful, but he was laughingh because it was all a joke to him, and to the 2 girls who were loving it. He then turned around to me and said 'girl, I'm not racist ar!! Just joke only!!'

I don't know why I was rejected from the job as everyone spoke English to me. But thinking of how I angrily stormed out after his comment, I wish I didn't get that second phone call. Don't say we are us racist for calling out people like that. Please.

In my opinion, students from prestigious unis that aren't very high-ranking in the world  (example Peking/Tsinghua/Fudan) are smarter (in the book/exam-smart sense) than those in second-tier UK unis like Warwick/ICL/UCL/LSE. I mean, surely a native Chinese that made it to Beida is smarter right? Getting into Beida means emerging as the top 0.x% for the Gaokao. Whereas to get into those second-tier UK unis, all one needs is decent grades (probably ABB/AAB) and MONEY. Yes, this is about one's socio-economic status. 

Hahahaha I'm just ranting. Just wondering if there are people who think like me. I'm an NUS student and I feel that we need to humble ourselves and know that there are people out there who are way smarter than us but are simply doing worse-off than us due to the not-so-fortunate circumstances that they are in. That Bangla worker operating that noisy jackhammer that woke you at 10am on a Saturday morning probably could've been in Oxbridge/Ivies if his parents were the directors of say, Singtel and Sembcorp.  

Of course, we should also stop putting other prestigious uni students on a pedestal. We are not less smart than them. 

TLDR; OP is just saying that uni ranking should be taken with a pinch of salt. 

P.S. Sorry if I went about in circles.

Regarding , i definitely do not agree with the generalisation that the entire chinese race is racist. However, as a minority , that op's post did touch my heart. Since primary school, I have encountered a multitude of racist jokes from singaporean chinese. Never from other minority groups. I for one have never made a racist comment in my life. Somehow, the chinese think it's okay for them to be racist and ignorant if they put up a facade of a joke. But if an indian or malay says something even jokingly, they get angry and offended. This is total rubbish. I do have many chinese friends, but the older I grow, the more I find myself hating this and I find myself wanting to leave Singapore in the future because there isn't true racial harmony here anyway, just racial tolerance. Only when the majority race learns to be sensitive and less ignorant  will Singapore have true harmony. Till then, one day somebody is going to tip me over the edge, and the result is not going to be pleasant.

 Be a little grateful to your parents. They might not know how to bring up a kid well, but I believe no parents will not want the best for their children. They might not give you a lot, but they probably gave you their everything.

It is NOT NICE to shut yourself in your room at home despite still surviving off your parents at this age. What do you treat your home as. A hotel? You don't even pay rent.

I too came from a poor family. My parents tried to put me through tuition several times when I was young but I told them not to waste the money. I don't believe in tuition, but that doesn't mean I don't believe in learning. I always wanted to learn piano too but I never dared to mentioned it to them because I knew they can't afford to put me through piano lessons. Try to put yourself in their shoes instead of whining about how unsupportive they are.

Your parents don't owe you anything.

I have to quote this every time people mention about starving African child.

“When we are shown scenes of starving children in Africa, with a call for us to do something to help them, the underlying ideological message is something like: "Don't think, don't politicize, forget about the true causes of their poverty, just act, contribute money, so that you will not have to think!”

Dear OP of ,
Rewind 8-10 years ago, and I was in exactly the same boat as your tutee. Dark-skinned (or different than most others in the class), best class. 

I was bullied to the extent that I cried every night, and every other chance I got when I was alone. All my belogings were either stolen or broken. The other girls would torment me by teaching me the wrong dance moves (as something similar happened to your tutee as well), calling me 'dirty'... The list goes on and on.  Your tutee has opened up to you about something her parents may or may not know, and that means something. It means she trusts you on an issue that deeply and emotionally affects her, and wants a listening ear. 

Whether you do anything or not is ultimately your decision. But I IMPLORE you, please bring this up to the girl's parents, or the level head of the prinary 4 level in her school. This is not a simple problem. Racism-borne bullying tears young children apart and the feeling of inadequacy stays for a much longer time after that. Your tutee has done nothing wrong to deserve such vile, cruel remarks (I realise they are children, but they are learning these from somewhere read: parents, or other students). 

Like how people would defend themselves against such people, I hope you will stand up for your young tutee, because she trusts you, and she doesn't want to live another day of her life like this.

For all the depictions of racial harmony here, the Chinese in Singapore are really an extremely racist bunch. From the way they denigrate the darker skinned races to the way they worship the white man, it makes one sad to realise that this form of thinking is so deeply integrated into our society today. And someone said that the younger generation was better than the older one. They are all the same.

There are certain CCAs in NUS that are more open to individuals with different sexualities and gender identities, you just need to know where to find them :)

To the OP of  :

Don't get me wrong, but you sound suspiciously like a bitter cs3216 reject. 

I am one of the contributors of the nonsensical app that you mention (which is called Authorific - http://authorific.tk/, for those who want to judge it for themselves).

I am not going to waste my time defending our app to you. One of the comments in response to your confession has already done so.

To each his own, and that means you are free to find the app idea stupid.

Personally, I am happy that our app drew your attention, which means it probably did reach many others too:)

I've got an honest wondering about something (I hope it's not too sensitive or sexual) and I'd like to ask the guys and girls out there:

Generally, how do you prefer your partner's nether regions to be?

1. Totally shaved
2. Neatly trimmed
3. Wild untamed jungle

I'm sorry I can't think of a less crude way to ask this question :(  but I am really genuinely curious about what people think of this issue.

I want to post a reply to a comment , about how the public questions if they can trust doctors since we technically "earn money" off their sickness. I'm currently a medical student in the clinical years.

For starters, I'm very sure that there are black sheep around that have tainted the good image of the medical profession. These people will always exist in any line of work, and unfortunately there have been several high profile cases where doctors have abused their position for their own personal gain. I would like to say that so far all the doctors I have had the opportunity to meet are at the opposite end of the spectrum.

You really don't know how many sacrifices that we make being in the medical profession (doctors, nurses and allied health alike. You really, really need to have a passion to help people in this line of work, because of the intense workload and exceedingly long hours. Everyone likes to say that we are paid well; in the long run maybe, but for most of our working life we will bespending countless hours in the hospital, running around doing night calls, spending sleepless nights ensuring that you are well taken care of and our knowledge is sufficient to provide you with optimal care.

Also, we have no lack of sick people in the hospitals; rather our hospitals are facing a bed crunch, where we have more patients than we have beds due to our overflowing population. We really, really don't want you to be in the hospital. We want you to be able to be healthy, independent and back to your normal state. Furthermore, we're not paid per patient, rather a fixed amount per month regardless of patient's seen, tests given, hours worked. Maybe in the private sector it is the case, but from what I've seen and heard we are put under scrutiny if there are unnecessary tests and medications given. Also, we don't prescribe placebos. There are reasons behind medications prescribed, and they have a clinical use.

TL;DR, doctors really want you to be well and we really don't benefit off you being sick. Healthy living guys!!!

SG lack of creativity and perhaps is our liner thought process, we just can't match the Russian/American programmers. Even if we just compare in AP, the Indians and Vietnamese are better at programming. If you consider in terms of service quality, we also lose out to more service orientated / patient people like Pinoys for example. If want to compare efficiency, our grads are also too into the concept of work life balance. Plus a lot of them not willing to put in OT... I won't even use the "cheaper" argument. I am just coming from the point of competency.

True?

Sexist boys, I have a really brief essay for y'all. Read up.

My newsfeed on Fb sees trends, such as the annoyingly ubiquitous 9gag memes. Recently I’ve been seeing quite a few anti-SGG (Singaporean girls) article links. All seem to center on how materialistic they are, throwing all the negative connotations one can ever associate with the adjective.

This is why feminism exists and has to exist. The blame always (often unjustifiably) ends with with the female. Got raped? Oh you must have been dressed scantily; you were asking for it, you deserved it. Income differentials? Choice theory-the women “opt out” themselves. Falling and low fertility rates? Some senior politician says it was his biggest regret to educate women; women are the ones not having children; women this, women that. Women are the biggest punching bag.

Back to the issue, materialism has manifested itself in the Singapore culture waaay back. Probably when the PAP came to power and prided itself on providing the ‘good life’ and 'delivering the (material) goods’, which inadvertently shaped our prioritization of the material above the abstract. In a sense, the fact that men themselves pursue money and career so fervently also feeds and confirms this materialist culture. It’s not just the women; it’s a social consensus. Couple this with the theory of evolutionary psychology and see how unfounded these childish grumbles about 'materialistic women’ are.

So what gets on my nerves is how some men act all peeved by women who pursue what society expects them to pursue, which at the same time makes up what men’s aspirations should be. So technically, women aren’t the socially deviant ones– these “men” are. They are the ones who have failed to meet society’s expectations and hence are the sore losers in the name of social Darwinism. 'Tis inevitable with the reality of class divisions but that’s precisely the point: REALITY. Fact is, women have sociology and psychology and increasingly, university degrees, to back their expectations up as entirely justifiable.

So, poor men-or boys- out there, why not try to pull your own socks up instead of taking it out on the women, as your possibly sexist predecessors probably have done? Stop resting on your laurels (and laptops), and DEAL WITH IT. That’s society for you- get your head in the game or simply get washed away in the inexorable current of social Darwinism.

To OP of , I've been through the same thing so I understand how you must feel. There were attempts to commit suicide in my case though, and I also suffered from another mental disorder along with depression. I won't go into the details here but it took me quite some time to reach the point whereby I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, and at the end of the crossroads I chose to live. Nobody can make that decision for you, to choose to not give up, to commit to these words: I want to get better. Only when you want to help yourself can you allow others to lend you a helping hand as well. Think about what in your life is worth fighting for. For me, initially it was my family and friends but that wasn't enough. I realized that I have to fight for me: for me to live on my own terms, do things that make me happy and discover new facets about this big big world every day that makes me feel grateful, blessed and humbled that I'm still alive, breathing and living. There may be many bad things in this world, unfortunate circumstances you can't escape from and day to day monotony that makes you wonder what meaning there is to life. But it's all a matter of perspective. When I made the decision to pick myself up from the dirt, it just seemed self-defeating and self-sabotaging to dwell on these negative aspects that I'm already conditioned to replay over and over again like a broken recorder in my head. I had to consciously build up another voice to fight against it and actively seek out the good in life and I'm still working on that now. Since I've decided to get better, the only way to go was forward and exploring ways that can help me feel better about myself. I try not to worry about things that I can't control/have little influence or ability to change and instead focus on other things that I can play a part in that can improve whatever situation/issue I'm facing. In my opinion it all starts from the mindset and things will fall into place easier after that. I understand that it's difficult to put on a facade (like a clown who makes people laugh but may be sad underneath that painted smile) when you're feeling so bad already so I suggest that you surround yourself with people who care about you and whom you care about as well. As for your point about people being happier if you're not in their lives, I used to think that way too. But think about it, who in the world would feel better off or that the world is a better place if someone they knew (and it doesn't even have to be someone they are very close to, or someone they have a good relationship with) decided single-mindedly to commit suicide? The consequences are irreversible and the aftermath is just cruel, filled with guilt, regret, and leaving a permanent scar in the hearts of the living. If you are open to counseling, you can give the counseling centre at uhc a try. It really helped me to release my locked up emotions in a non judging and open environment, and helped to challenge certain ways of thinking I had that were obstacles to my own recovery. I hope you can find your own meaning in life once again. Don't give up and all the best!

I was told I have an accent (won't say which), which I didn't realize I had. Maybe it came from International School. And because of that, I feel that everyone always judge me whenever I'm at work. They think I'm faking the whole accent thing (because I'm Asian). So when I'm in a new environment, I make a conscious effort to speak like a Singaporean, but when I get too excited or passionate about what I'm talking about, the accent comes out again. Anyway, long story short, I just think it's ridiculous to judge someone and think he/she is "mightier than thou" just because of the way they speak, because of the stereotype that "people who speak with an accent seems to come from more affluent families". That is not true at all! I'm not an airhead or someone who is relying on her parents' money, okay? I work like everyone else and I'm not a spoilt sheltered kid. Gosh, just be open-minded and judge me for the quality of my work.

This post is primarily inspired by , but also intended as a response to the disturbing trend of relationship-related advice that tend to promulgate the relatively shallow mindset of encouraging reckless behaviour. 

To  I would believe that the feelings and confusion that you experienced are normal and typical of such situations. Whenever sudden changes occur, it is a natural bio-psychological response to be disoriented and to search for reasons or explanations. However, as rational beings, I think that we can do much better than to simply and mindlessly tackle the issue head-on, as some commentators have suggested, by confronting her directly. 

The reasons given in support for such an action are usually along the vein of "having nothing to lose" or "you will never know unless you ask her". But is that truly the case? The harsh reality is that you probably already know the reason why. And that answer is unfortunately antithetical to your hopes, leading to self-denial, trying to cling on to the faint possibility that you may have interpreted it wrongly or missed something. Here, I must clarify that there is nothing wrong in this - it is just human psychology. 

It is also natural to want to seek clarification directly from her. But, try putting yourself in her shoes. From your description, I would give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she is in no way a mean person. She needs to convey a difficult message to you, and it is definitely in no way easier on her part. Direct conversation will likely be awkward or even trigger emotional responses. She decided that this method is probably the best solution or outcome for the both of you, so give credit to her and respect her decision.

In particular, she does not owe you any answer, and isn't the desire to seek confirmation of what you already know, upon careful thought, merely a selfish notion of wanting to seek some sort of closure on your part? Meanwhile, confronting her will likely only make things worse and may even distress her.

The best thing you can do now is just to let time do its work. If it is possible that some of your prior actions may have made her uncomfortable, you should consider apologizing through some non-live channels. Hopefully, with the passage of time, things may improve between the two of you. But, if they don't, respect her choice, and most importantly, you should weed those initial misguided ideas out of your mind.

Just my two cents' worth towards making the NUS community a better place.

OP of  here.

I know it’s annoying to see the page being bombarded with NUSSU election, but bear with us for a while. It’s a seasonal thing, just like the LGBT season and xenophobia season.

External election is over. We can now say things without being accused of mudslinging or being politically motivated. Yay.
Ultimately, I believe both sides genuinely want the best for the students. They just don’t trust the other side with it very much. From AUTC’s perspective, the other side is a bunch of corrupt incumbents that engages in mudslinging. From TU’s perspective, the other side is a bunch of self-victimizing people in their attempt to sway the votes to them. To those that voted during the election, you know your friends. Some of you’ve interacted with them on a personal level. You know they are not such people. If both sides managed to convince hundreds of people to get their ass down to YIH to vote for them, I would like to believe that they are at least decent people.

As for the NUSPA post, I did some digging on my own, and while NUSPA is rather tight-lipped about it after the whole incident, I found out that their sentiments are shared by some other organizations in which these two belonged to, although not to the same extend. You don’t have to believe me. Do your own homework. That being said, it’s still a d*ck move. No question.  Unlike me, NUSPA is not a coward hiding anonymously under a confession page. Some political correctness is still needed at the end of the day. Although, I would love to believe that these two ladies are decent people, just perhaps sometimes overwhelmed with work. Give them some credit. If these two are reading this post, I would like to advise you both to communicate more with your team(s) to agree on the expectations of your job descriptions.

To address why the elections were so badly publicized and deemed unfair by some, in recent years, there was never two whole parties vying for the council, GRC style. External elections were all along a free and easy thing, unlike on Friday at YIH where you can feel the tension in the air. The election committee themselves were simply unprepared for this unprecedented amount of bullsh*t. That being said, I don’t believe in the exercise to begin with. External elections are all about who has more friends and who has a better PR team, both not really relevant in determining what makes a good council.

That being said, it’s a good thing that people are starting to getting aware of NUSSU. Contrary to popular beliefs, they are not a bunch of people in suits and tie whacking each other off. The gradeless first semester, the D1 now being able to go from UTown to the other side of Engine, the orientation camps and the student fair, the NUS student discounts in certain outlets outside, the cheap faculty canteen food, heck, even the S/U option. The student union played a role in all of these things. It’s not just about goodie bags. So if you think that it is not worth your time to give a shit, think again.

To the next NUSSU EXCO, please make UTown Gym opening 24/7 a thing.

Why this NUSSU election machiam like Game of Thrones one? You see, that's why people don't want to vote. Nobody likes drama in real life

All the talk about NUSSU election. I didn't even know it happened. Till my friends whatsapp and said pls support who and who if you can. I'm like what? I don't even know them on a personal level. And I don't know their personalities, their attitudes towards things. How am I supposed to vote? 

Also, why can't the elections be like GE? Introduce the candidates to us at an event. Or during student life fair. Let us know them better. Then allow them to go around garnering votes personally instead of sending whatsapp msg to friends who send to other ppl to ask them for votes. Also, make the voting convenient. Do an online voting thing.

I'm really sorry, it's a long post regarding the NUSPA issue (again).

To the OP of , I would like to refute your statements politely too. 

Yes, agree on your side that they should have released an explanation as to why the post was being taken down and not left there to let students continue reading, since it was already considered a stance taken by the organisation to stand by when they decided to post that message. Let's say, as what we all (or some of us) want, they post evidence of their claims. Personally, if I were one of them I would feel even worse. Everything is substantiated and I am denounced officially and completely. Do you really think that as a school organisation, they will be allowed to do that? Yes, other than official channels that are other channels you can take to, like talking to the people in the NUSPA room directly. But for me, I'm not part of them and it feels weird for me to just enter and ask, "hey may I know what's happening?". I don't have the personal courage to, and that's my problem. Therefore I am not perfectly informed and can't make a stand about it. Since you made claims that they didn't have evidence, did you go down personally to ask them what did the girls do to trigger that post? Think beyond personal/ organisational responsibility and look at the bigger picture.

Not offering evidence and made a set of claims - So what do you constitute as evidence? Whatsapp chats showing "irresponsibility"? In your post, why didn't you include evidence that they were dedicated, hardworking and passionate? Likewise, without evidence, why should we believe your claims? How can we know that you're not just someone from their team or one of their close friends who wants to defend their reputation? 

Even when in our own project groups when there is a loafer around, except writing emails to profs/ TAs and having your fellow group members supporting the claim, what else can we do? If that person does not attend the group meetings, how can you support it except by having all the group members agree that the person didn't come? Photo evidence of that person not being physically present or having a witness who steps up and tell us 'hey my son was at home when you guys were having your project discussion'? It just all boils down to one question for you – do you really expect us to start a new project/ task with the intention to capture evidence of every single thing, JUST IN CASE someone turns out to be a free-loader and we'll have the evidence to prove it when we make our case? 

How about people coming forth in their individual capacities to step up and attest to their lack of competency? Well, since you've worked with them personally and think that they're really dedicated and taken you to task when you didn't, so why did you not defend them in the comments in your personal capacity but instead take to posting anonymously? Why did I not write this using my own Facebook account but instead, like you, post here where everyone has no idea who I am unless I admit it? I didn't want to put myself under public scrutiny. I don't want people to click my Facebook profile and start cyberstalking me – Is he one of "them"? Is he faking everything just so that he can defend his team? I really just want to have my voice heard without suffering any personal attacks. And that's why I'm writing here. Yeah, not very brave but this is who I am. I'm pretty sure our motivations are similar. Or maybe not if you haven't really worked with them before.

They have not been able to present their side of the story – so why didn't they speak up? I'm pretty sure that even though if they did not post under the NUSPA Facebook page or any official channels, with the amount of attention on this issue anything that they post will be circulated well enough for them to be heard. Assuming that they did, what about the point you brought up earlier on – where's the evidence? If they claimed that they did their work, what can they use to prove that they did? If they had evidence, where is the evidence that they did not cook up the evidence? Bro (or sis), it's really a never-ending cycle. They would feel even more exasperated. What I'm saying is not that we won't need any evidence for anything and everything if I say this about presenting evidence. What I'm trying to say that in this given context, asking for evidence is not as easy or straightforward as you try to depict it to be.

Last one – posting as organisation/ individual. Obviously a statement by an organisation will be posted under a channel that an organisation endorses and not in someone's personal capacity. How can you expect an official announcement to be posted using their own accounts – if they do, what's the validity of it? I mean, I really don't see your point here. Any official releases would have to be written by someone! But I feel that you're bringing up this topic of personal responsibility because in your perception, it's not an official statement and rather a personal attack. If that's the case, then your point stands. 

I have nothing to say about their work ethics because I have never worked with them before. Even though my friends did, what they say can only make up part of the truth. No one of us knows them well unless we can say that we've worked with them over a period of time. It's hard to be perfectly consistent – and falling short of being responsible for one project, making this ONE mistake, does not condemn you for the rest of your life. Yes, the damage and labels are there because of the scale of the organisation/ it's impact. But it happens that that's what the organisation they were in perceived, and that's what the organisation decide to publish. 

Different people behave differently across contexts, and different people have different perceptions. We are humans and we don't have to be perfectly consistent – I don't have to be perfectly responsible or perfectly friendly. I can be an asshole at times but doesn't mean that I have to be an asshole all the time for people to consider me a "true" asshole (with supporting evidence). The onus is on us, as students who are at the receiving end, to integrate all these information and make an objective stand and we must consciously do it. It's easy to just follow what everyone says and I don't have time and effort to explore this issue in-depth because I haven't walked my dogs. And this point – I totally agree with you too OP7725. And not everyone has to make a stand anyway. 

To the two girls who were affected – please remain strong and all the best. ☺

NUSSU ELECTION RELATED:

I don't know why ppl want to see the NUSPA post on the poor performances of two ppl as politically driven. There must be truth in what they post. To publicly criticize someone without being anonymous takes courage and responsibility. If there were no evidence of poor performance, I don't think NUSPA would have brought this trouble upon themselves. I myself have met assholes that don't do shit and I hope they burn in hell. The hatred is uncontrollable and sometimes sounding it out makes you feel better. Oh no now I'm thinking about them again grrrrrrrr........

From the number of larger name slips observed during the voting, it seems that Team U has lost. They didn't lose because of incompetency nor because of the NUSPA post. They lost because A Union that Cares was better at giving off name slips. They would make a great team giving off flyers and could make a living out of it. Now what's to worry is whether they can deliver or not. Of course, the same worry goes to Team U if they win.

This election has failed in all aspects. It's not a good demo for the general election. Why are candidates begging for votes on election day? Most importantly, why are most ppl not informed about the election? Why did this election become "charm-or-pressure-as-many-passersby-in-9-hours-competition"?

In conclusion, it doesn't matter which team wins as long as they do a good job, but it matters a lot when students can't organize a proper election.

In light of the recent NUSPA crap and the subsequent sh*tstorm linked to the NUSSU election, I wish to say this: Hakuna your tatas. Before all that, I would like to highlight that while I am not part of the NUSSU council, I belong to one of the few clubs working under it. Unlike some of you, I am voting for who is going to be my superior rather than whose CV to polish, so it has a greater implication to me than to some of you. First things first, NUSPA’s post was a total d**k move, no question. That being said, it’s hard to believe that an organization would resort to calling one of their own as irresponsible, no matter how political motivated they are, unless some pent up anger have been piling up for a while now. I’m tempted to believe that the truth is probably somewhere in between, but then again, we wouldn’t know unless both sides tell their story.

Secondly, I find it rather convenient for a particular team to label the other team as the incumbent team, and group them together with all the mistakes of the previous NUSSU council. Fun fact. If you take a look at who is running and compared them with the previous council, you will quickly realize that you don’t see a lot of familiar faces. I counted like 3. Give or take a few. To label this team as the same bunch that is responsible for all the previous mistakes would be unfair to say the least. Even the genius that came up with the infamous “transparency primarily entails a state of mind” has graduated for almost a year now. For your information, just because we have a “NUSSU” attached in front of our club names, doesn’t mean we blow the NUSSU EXCO off. In fact, we sometimes don’t see eye to eye. Again, to cluster NUSPA with the “incumbent” team is a pretty damn convenient thing to do, don’t you think? The only reason why the old bunch support the running team is because they have proven their mettle when previously working together. I’m not saying that the other team is less capable. I’m just saying that I have no idea of what they are capable of or not capable of.

Last thing, contrary to popular beliefs, NUSSU EXCO is a hell of a saikang job. It’s not a fun job. It’s not an easy CV polisher. And it’s not an overly romanticized political quest for student welfare. It’s a tedious work of ensuring things happen the way they are. Just cause you don’t see a NUSSU logo in everything doesn’t mean they aren’t responsible for it. Vote for whoever you want, but vote objectively based on what you believe in and not because some charismatic dude gives a fiery inspirational speech. 

Sorry for the long post. Here's a potato.

Imagine this scenerio: Girl A is in danger and you risk your life to save her and got critically injured. On your death bed, you kept thinking and worrying girl B. Which one is your one true love? 
-
 
Another student council post. I like the fact that the other team prefers to call their opponents the incompetent incumbent team when most of them are also new to the EXCO board and are not responsible for the things that happened. Hey, maybe I would have voted for you if your campaign is more on HOW to care for the students instead of some vague ideals and constant kpkb on how bad the other side is. This is why I never vote.

This was my first time voting in the NUSSU elections and honestly I was very disappointed. I am not talking about all the politics and drama that was happening, but of the elections itself. The publicity of the elections was very poorly done. Many people had no idea that the elections were taking place. For the people who did find out, it was because they knew someone who was standing in the elections or they had friends who knew those people. Ultimately, this boils down to a test of popularity. The most social and popular candidate will end up winning the seat even if they are not the most qualified and deserving candidate. I'm sorry but I dont want the most popular person making the major decisions about my academic year, I want the most qualified person to do that. And I want to be able to judge if the candidate is qualified or not. Why do we not get to hear speeches from all the candidates? I would love to judge the quality of the candidate by their speeches, awarding the most capable and promising candidates with votes. A lot of people like me care about the quality of our leaders! Why are there no speeches? Why has it just become a test of popularity? I'm very sure NUSSU can book a venue where the candidates will be able to impress us. So whoever wins the elections this year, please take note! Please give us a better quality of elections next year.

Humans fear the unknown. Fire was once seen as a demon to many early people because they don't understand what it is, and touching it will hurt them. But now, this "demon" is our bitch and we use it for cooking.

I don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural. Throughout my whole life, I've been hearing tons and tons of these stories from people I know. I've also heard some creepy tales from the residents of PGP. To me, the reason why people had "experiences" is because of how our brains are wired. We recognize patterns, draw links and make imaginary conclusions to a certain unexpected phenomenal which we cannot explain. An example, perhaps there was a peeping tom in the girls' bathroom making all that fapping noise, however the only female witness had no evidence of a pervert in action, hence she may conclude the mysterious glazing eyes through the gap and the noise she heard to be a paranormal event, if she's superstitious. And people love telling stories with a little exaggeration... ahem..especially girls like ourselves. So when she told her friends about this, they started spreading a "ghost rumor".

However, things can get serious when we believe too much in the supernatural. Especially when it comes to making important life decisions, such as marriage. This problem can also come in the form of exchanging their hard earned money for some expensive rituals, items and false promises which are sold to them by some powerful "expert". If this expert really can connect to the supernatural, I'm sure he can do more than just collecting money from you. Surprisingly, it's not just uneducated people who are conned, educated people too can easily be deceived especially when they're desperate. Be careful, sit down and think carefully about how some things happen. Don't attribute everything to the supernatural!

Maybe it's because I've not encountered anything "supernatural" before? That's why I feel these are nothing more than tales to frighten or motivate people into certain actions, either for good, for bad or for fun. It could be one of the many flaws of human thinking. And if there's a ghost, slam me on my keyboard NOW dbweuqdwbdfiebwjwdwefe just joking, I'm fine.

Anyone wish to share their ghost stories? I am eagerly loving to read! :DDD

I agree with Jannell on the feminist post. Radical feminists are overrated. They fight for causes that they themselves are not exactly educated at and merely follow trends set by tumblr. It is essentially a rather weak argument for the rights of women. Shouldn't we then fight for the rights of people and humans in general instead of women?

It's the committee election time (not GE btw). 

So here's the question. Would you rather choose a Committee Head that is knowledgable in the cell he/she is in BUT always carry a rude and black face, or a Head that's wet behind ears but joyful and bright?

Decisions... decisions...

Is it true that if someone complains about almost everything that inconvenience him/her, it is likely the person is a very sheltered and pampered child who had never really "gone out" to society and always have people giving in to him/her at home? If so is it really true these people may find it difficult to go out to work in the society next time, because it is hard for these people to accomodate others?

The NUSPA shit that is going on is one heck of an amusing. Seriously, how on earth can NUSPA beat the odds of becoming more exciting year on year, and being more clown-like than club-like year on year? Someone should just give the incumbent ONE TIME GOOD ONE.

My friend is a hardcore meninist. Nothing wrong with that and he is entitled to his own beliefs but he says offensive things like "we don't need feminism" and "I don't support equality, I support fairness" and he refuses to believe in anything that anyone else says despite 'facts'. He denounces blogposts about girls' personal life experience saying that they're not credible as well as any other websites that isn't newspaper based etc. At first it was interesting to hear his views but after awhile he keeps shoving his beliefs down everyone's throats and it's getting annoying. Furthermore he retweets meninist (a Twitter acct) a lot and my entire timeline is flooded with offensive tweets about women. I understand that these tweets are jokes and not to be taken seriously but it does say something about him and his ways. 

I intend to talk to him soon but any tips/advices on how to deal with this would be appreciated, thank you for reading.

Girls, tell us which of this 6 (in order) you look for in dating a guy. Will appreciate your honest opinions.

1) Face
2) Body+height 
3) Wealth
4) Education 
5) Good character 
6) Popularity and charisma 

Thanks!!

Not that I dated much. But to me, the most important trait that also attracts me the most is filial piety. If I'm dating someone who's filial, there's a good chance she will be a "good" person due to good upbringing. This of course resulted from and leads to good parent-child relations.

I might be wrong, but I've never met someone who's nice to her parents but has a character that's totally messed up. Perhaps this stems from the fact that I have a healthy family relationship and I seek someone who is family-oriented too.

Yup I'm ready to start a family. If any girls feel similarly (about filial piety and ready to start a family), maybe leave a comment? :-)

I feel strange that individuals and LGBT activists blame/target the government for the lack of LGBT rights(marriage..etc). If tomorrow the government fully legalised LGBT and marriage and whatsoever, the LGBT community will still not get what they want, full acceptance from society. The target audience should be society and fellow singaporeans, for if enough people support it, it gives our leaders a mandate to change. 

For now it seems like a loud but small community is being drowned out by the silent conservative majority.

I think the best part about NUSWhispers is the veil of anonymity that it provides to confessors. Unfortunately, we are still unable to post comments anonymously and as a workaround, some commenters have created fake Facebook accounts and are actually hiding behind false identities.

"Give a man a mask and he will show you his true face". Anonymity is powerful yet dangerous.

Here are some ways to identify whether a commenter is using his/her real identity:

1. They use a pretty/handsome profile pic that doesn't show the full face.
2. Search that person on NUS mail directory. Do you get any results?
3. They decline to attend your meetup event due to private reasons.

Beware.

Mr LKY was a great man. An honest politician, a patriarch truly committed and dedicated for the welfare of Singapore. This country was always first and foremost on his mind. He could have been a very wealthy man, but he didnt live such a life. He chose instead to live a austere lifestyle. This was a man we would say is 清廉 and 两袖清风. Most of us have full confidence that the hard decisions he made are for the good of Singapore, and from experience, this has been true most of the time.  Such a politician and man is RARE and hard to come by. You get one probably every few hundred years.

I would not say the same for the current generation of PAP ministers. I doubt many of them are here to truly serve. Opposition cannot field good candidates? You really think it is because they dont know what candidate is good? No so-called good candidate will want to join the opposition because PAP is where the money is. Very very good money. Not saying they are corrupt, dont sue me. I am just saying being in the PAP pays very well (not just money, but favours and networks too. It is an open secret come on). Which scholar in the right mind wants to join the opposition?

You would rather have a 100% PAP govt than one with PAP majority and opposition checks? What? Are you 5 years old?
It is naive and foolish to think that voting for the opposition will end you up in a blacklist.
It is even more naive to think that a govt with 100% power will NEVER abuse it or that they will ALWAYS think only for the good of Singapore. They may not do anything illegal, but you can never guarantee that every decision is always 100% with only the interests of Singapore in mind. Your govt and ministers are not made up of monks and saints. Wake up.

LKY loved singapore like his son. Not every MP or minister share that love. You will always need voices to question and keep the ruler in check. Don't be so foolishly charmed by fair speech and promise of talent and honest work. The last time a nation did so, 6,000,000 innocent lives were lost.

To the OP of  
Chill. The 'dunking' in orientation camps merely involves the victim lying on the surface of the water with roughly 6 people supporting him/her. On command, the 6 people will throw the victim, causing the victim to sort of do a 'backflip'. After being tossed, the throwers are supposed to make sure the victim is okay by asking him/her. Of course, this is supposed to be done in deep-enough waters, ie. shoulder level.

It is certainly NOT the dangerous kind whereby someone constantly pushes the victim's head in and out of the water and barely gives the victim time to catch a breather. We're in NUS, not the SAF (which has caused the death of someone who was undergoing POW training). 

Take a chill pill!

There is no forever and always. Only the present. Cherish the people around you for they won't be there forever. Nobody owes you a living, nobody owes you his/her life. Your life, your future, your responsibility. And don't look back at the past and regret because always remember that at that point in time, it was the best decision you made evaluating the circumstances.

To OP of , I actually understand you. It is not too difficult to realize when you are superior in terms of intelligence. That being said, I do not despise my friends at all. However, sometimes in a normal conversation, when I say something that is beyond their comprehension, like the friends of OP of , they will behave as if i purposely did it when it is frankly just the way i have grown to speak after being in university for a while. I do not feel that I have surpassed them in any way but I do feel that our lives are diverging and it makes communication very difficult.

I think sympathy killing for those that choose it is needed. Would people want to be burdens to their families, if one is in a vegetative state? Not to mention the financial burdens that come with it as well. 
I for one, would want to be killed off if I do become a burden. 
-
 
 I think I have the same problem. From the exterior, I am conservative when it comes to sexual issues as in I am against pre-marital sex, but unknowingly (to others) masturbate and watch porn. Sounds contradictory eh?

I think this is just normal as we are humans, who are not perfect. And in the above case, your (and my) conservative views are the ideals (nothing wrong with it, it's good), while in reality you (and I) watch porn and masturbate. This is driven by temptation of pleasure. But, it is also a challenge and strive to make our reality conforms with our ideals.

So, to OP, you're not alone. Strive to live up with your ideals. Although it's not easy, it's possible.

My exboyfriend had been trying very hard to win my heart but I just don't want to continue the relationship anymore due to differences in education background, family background, outlook of life etc etc..and most importantly we don't stay in the same country and it is a long-distance love. Getting pr citizenship is not easy for him because he is not highly educated. There will be too many challenges ahead of us and so I suggest a breakup. However I still feel very guilty for doing that because he had really put so much effort to maintain the relationship. I am confident to say that he is willing to sacrifice everything (including his life) just for me, but all he could get is a breakup.

I am sorry..really sorry.

 As a nerd, I only care about being smart. Like Paul Graham said, "The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties [...] The popular kids learned to be popular, and want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned to be smart, and want to be smart."

Why is being wild, party-goer style, a necessity to being accepted by people? I'm sorry but I just can't keep up, energy-wise and money-wise with that kind of lifestyle. But just because y'all don't know my circumstances, y'all choose to judge me as an anti-social fag with your own moral standards. Sick of these people...

Reading most of the recent posts regarding romance and sex, I can't help but feel I am a bit weird. In the sense that such thoughts don't cross my mind.

A bit of background info on myself: I'm a guy with above average looks and build who usually turns heads as I walk by and has received a fair share of eyecandy and crushes from girls I have met since JC. However, none of this attention or compliments really interest me. Apart from a past relationship during JC/NS, I can't really say that I am actively looking for love or affection. In fact, I'm kind of satisfied with my current status.

What really interests me are more pertinent and deeper issues such as the well-being of my fellow man (both sexes). Our modern media, both locally and overseas, seems to be dominated by negative headlines, from xenophobia to horrific crimes, and I can't help but think at times, "Why so much hate and vitriol? Why has our society morphed into such a materialistic and selfish one where self-gratification is the rule of the day?" This really troubles me. So I have taken it upon myself to improve our community one smile at a time, one empowering message at a time, one kind deed at a time, one random act of kindness at a time, and most importantly of all, even in the face of disparaging remarks. Nope, this is not a practice in self-righteousness that allows me to go to bed at night with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. This is something I truly belive in and aim to work on for the rest of my life notwithstanding the seemingly insurmountable obstacles at times. And my faith has definitely supported me in this aspect.

Linking my first point on romance to my stand, I can safely say that if I ever do enter into a relationship again, it would not be because of what my S/O can do for me but rather what I can do for her. After all, love is a special bond where you value others above yourself.

So guys and girls, go forth and make someone's day. It may be a small or random act but you will never truly know the impact it has on the receiver and others. I understand that this entails a huge amount of self-sacrifice and you will feel that you are on this journey alone at times, but always remember: you never walk alone. There will always be other like-minded people there for you and you will eventually get through to others. Over the years, some people have labelled me as pretentious and fake but I refuse to let their comments stop me from being positive and kind. Our acts should be bigger than our insecurities and fears. Ultimately, we lose our humanity when we stop caring for one another.

To prevent this post from becoming TLDR, let me end by saying that I truly admire those who always look out for others. And we need not look any further than our parents or S/Os, who will always be there for us come rain and shine. As for me having such a "weird" take on life, I leave it to you readers to decide if that's the case (:

In response to 

I'm in pretty much the same situation as you are. My family's probably wealthier, to be honest. Then there's my girlfriend, who has been on financial aid her entire life. The topic of privilege comes up sometimes, inevitably, and I feel the gulf between us. Like you said, "I just cannot imagine it."

But you know what? You should keep trying anyway, to look through the world from her eyes and walk with her in her shoes. I would never, no matter how frustrated I am, call my girlfriend "naive and irrational". The fact that you have had an easy life, is completely sound. While it's true that money can be incredibly damaging and brings its own set of problems, with parents using gifts or money in lieu of giving love or time to children etc., your life has on the whole still been far easier than your girlfriend's life. You say you don't deny that, but are you properly acknowledging it? When you tell her to shut up, you're just evading the issue altogether. If she's bringing it up so often, then perhaps you're constantly if inadvertently slighting her, or she has unresolved insecurities your actions are provoking. Why the fuck are you asking her to shut up? Ask her instead what's wrong, and what you can do to alleviate her worries and insecurities. Telling her to shut up - that unwillingness to entertain her opinion - is an action that stems from a really privileged and entitled mindset. Check yourself.

Yeah, your story kind of struck a chord. I'm not going to generalise your relationship from a single anecdote but I'm glad I don't vent my frustration on my girlfriend the way you did. Listen to her, treasure her. And from someone who's as privileged as you, you really aren't as aware of your privilege as you think you are. Be nice.

I am wondering how do people become socially popular and accepted into the more popular cliques in school and in social environments. 

Personally, I'm not like on of those cool kids who knew a lot of people or clicked well with many. At times, it is inevitable that people like us feel left out and not in sync with the cool kids.

On a another question, do you think such 'cool kids' achieve considerable success in their future lives or would they have burnt out most of the time. Is popularity that important?

Is it based on good looks, outgoing personality, charisma, humour or anything else that makes one popular? And does this affect one's chances of finding a good looking and hot gf?

Thanks for answering my queries peeps.

Today in a cancer lecture i learnt that women who did not give birth or give birth late have a much higher risk of breast cancer than those who does. Of course there are other contributing factors that lead to breast cancer such as diet, lifestyle but i thought it is unfair that a woman's personal choice of either not wanting a child/having children late have gotten herself one more risk factor :(

To  Perhaps being pretty is correlated with different characteristics like being narcissistic, condescending towards others, or having a misguided notion that their pretty faces serve as immunity cards against negative consequences? 

Or maybe we unknowingly associate physical beauty with inner beauty, such that when we find something bad in someone who is good-looking, it tends to disappoint us more? 

Everyone has some weaknesses, and I do find that this is magnified when someone is better looking, possibly because people pay more attention to him/her. 

It's true that jealousy could be one of the reasons, but that's sort of suggesting that the person feels inferior, which is not necessarily the case. I don't think a person has to feel inferior to dislike someone. Of course, it could likely be the case too.

I do find that a good-looking person with lousy attitude is likely to be tolerated longer than someone with average looks. Not sure why. haha. this is just my personal view from past observations :)

I want to add another perspective to this seemingly endless virginity debate (first it was about which faculty provides best route to success, then LGBT and then sex stories and now this - seriously the riddles were the best "theme" we had). 
TL:DR - this isn't a for or against argument but instead an observation about the slightly sexist attitudes of the various original posters. 
A majority of the posters spoke of the entire situation with the focus on the loss of female virginity. About girls who are unsure about giving their first up to someone they love, about girls who regretted it after their "heart was broken" and about guys who use love as an excuse to get sex out of their poor confused virgin girlfriends.
Forgive me if I am unable to put my point across clearly, but this way of thinking is demeaning to both sexes. Why are the girls seen to be losing something that the guys are taking? Why does it seem that the girls' actions aren't voluntary? I don't mean consent, I'm referring to sexual desire of their own. Why is it that the girl is doing the sex act to only please the boyfriend and not herself also? If I'm not wrong there was a post from a girl about "giving" sex to make the boyfriend happy. 
Do vaginas in this part of the world lack nerve endings or what? 
I speak as a straight, cisgender, minority, 2nd gen Singaporean, agnostic, 20 yo girl, who is a virgin (not by choice though for lack of dating opportunities). 
So what I'm saying is, for both sides of the debate - change the reasons you imply about why a girl chooses to have sex for the first time. It can also be for herself. Though in Asian society, I think that aspect isn't even considered and many women never fully explore / understand their own sexualities in their entire lifetime. 
Now my PoV (no pun intended) :
I personally don't really hold that much value for it. I want my first time to be an adventure and a learning experience. From what the books and movies say, die die must try! People haven't stopped talking about it since it was first discovered! It's a thing all living things on earth do and we as humans needn't put our extraneous social constructs on it. 
If I really like the guy - ok, great. If he's "the one" - unlikely, but I'm not saying no. If it's just casual and he's an acquaintance -that's ok too. I am too young to set out on my first sexual experience with big expectations in mind. And that doesn't mean I don't value my body or that I don't have enough self worth. I value myself by my character, achievements and contribution to society, not by whether or not a membrane of skin has been stretched. And all this doesn't at all mean I disrespect those from the opposite point of view. So stop worrying about others' junk and go study, tutorials starting soon already.

After reading the recent post on pre-marital sex, I would like to post my personal opinion on this issues.
On a side note, I am posting this non-bias  and religious view free.
I don't know what's up with undergrads today. Are they really so crave up for sex? Dis they lose the  custom of keeping your first for your life partner? You all can argue that you all are giving to one whom "will" be your life partner. But I have seen alot cases whereby one regrets  after either party offers a break up. Girls,  please keep your first for your husband.

There's nothing wrong with sex, people. Whether it is:

- Having sex every day. 
- Saving sex for your wedding night. 
- Never having sex.
- Having sex with different people.
- Having sex with one person.
- Having sex with a person of your same gender.
- Loving sex. 
- Hating sex. 
- Loud sex. 
- Quiet sex.

The only thing wrong with sex?

When it’s not consensual.

Because that’s not sex. That’s rape.

"It is 2015 and people aren’t virgins. They aren’t whores. They aren’t sluts, and they aren’t losers. People are humans, with amazing and glorious qualities that have little to nothing to do with how many times they’ve slid their hot dog into a taco (or whatever other applicable sexual metaphor you prefer)."

Yah people, being a virgin does not define you in any way. You are NOT holier or less holy, NOT more desirable or less desirable, NOT less slutty, i.e. NOT better or worse than people who have had sex. 

The only reasons why a virgin will hesitate to get together with a non-virgin (who practices safe consensual sex, especially if it was only done in a committed relationships) are because you are either 1. very insecure with yourself and your body, 2. think that somehow you are better than your partner? 

If it is 1. then newflash: doing it with another non-virgin will not mean that there will be less fear of judgement or security. You should want to sleep with your partner because you love him and you trust him enough that he will not make judgements on your body. Him being a virgin or not is not really relevant? Unless he is someone who has never even seen a naked body before (and thus cannot make comparisons and judge how perfect your body is), and that includes porn. 

If it is 2. then your judgement of the value of a person is entirely flawed. Someone who is a non-virgin can be of a worse character than a virgin. Virginity does not indicate any character traits at all? Unless he is someone who visits brothels repeatedly and has like 1000 non-protected one night stand before, then him doing it with another girl before doesn't really have to say anything about his personality trait. 

Sorry for the rant. I am just very bewildered how some people still want to judge others by their status of hymen. If you believe in sex only after marriage, yah good for you honestly, but don't go around acting/thinking that you're somehow better than people who don't. it is like you liking to eat KFC and thinking you are better than someone who prefers McDonalds. It is just immature and I urge you to give your judgement call a more thorough thought.

Since the topic is on sex recently, I have a confession as well. My colleague from my weekend job was discussing over some relationship matters and she began to preach that premarital sex is sinful and will make me regret and depressed. *Roll eyes in the back of my mind* I have already done it and no regrets or disgust or whatsoever. I enjoy it with my boyfriend and I see no problem with it as long as it is safe. Our discussion faded from there as I cannot stand people imposing their religious opinions on me. Peace.

His parents are against our relationship because I am white and apparently they do not like me. I do not know how to please them neither I know what to do in this situation. Last time I met his mom she closed the door saying us being together is a shame for their entire family and that she wants his son to marry someone from the same ethnicity. :(

I don't understand why there is a stereotype that people that do well in studies must be lacking in social life. I HAVE SOCIAL LIFE.  I have frequent conversations with my best friends, Durkheim, Weber and Marx.

Is everyone open to the idea of sex before marriage? Wouln't it be unfair if your spouse is no longer a virgin, yet you are?

I once had a heated discussion with a "feminist" who was conducting a workshop on sexual consent. According to her, a guy must not initiate any sexual moves on a girl, unless the lady expressly consents. In her words, the girl must say "yes" first. I thought that was bullshit. Has she gotten laid before? From experience, consent need not be expressed through words alone. There is also body language, the level of comfort between the parties, et cetera. Like, you can also infer consent from whether the person reciprocates your intimacy. After the heated discussion, the "feminist" deleted me off her Facebook. She thought I was a MCP potential rapist. I know she follows NUSWhispers and she would have graduated by now. Hahaha, if you remember me, you can add me back. I think you are a bit cute ah.

Since everyone has sex stories... I will simply just share a classic story.

I am the contributor for #OP6917.

Totally not a troll. Every week I will hear something "new" from her about some guy trying their lackluster advancement. 

Hmmm... Just highlighting this matter so the other guys don't become a story for others to laugh.

Seeing the posts around here, I started questioning: Is abstinence, i.e., not having sex before marriage, really an outdated idea and only upheld by a minority of dating couples and singles (evergreens or not) out there?

Next, it seems to me that the motivation of abstinence comes from religious background. Are there any other motivations other than that? Then, are there still valid reasons to avoid sex before marriage (for dating couples with mutual attraction) even when STI can be prevented by safe sex?

I am a person who has gotten an overseas scholarship for undergrad studies, and sometimes I wonder if I will ever regret studying outside of Singapore. There will be a Singaporean community but with it being small relative to the population in local universities, I wonder if I will ever find a suitable romantic partner. Perhaps even if I do she might want to work overseas while I return after studies. Heard that it is tough to find romance in the working world, and this is not helped by the fact that I am a male more inclined to date someone the same age or older. Are people aged 21 - 22 generally still available nowadays?
-
 
Before I entered NUS, I have always been under the impression that Singaporeans were largely a conservative bunch especially with regards to saving their virginity for after marriage. (Personally I still stand for sex after marriage but I don't judge people that engage in sex before marriage). 

However, after one year of staying in hall, I realised that there are many couples who have sex right now. In fact they do it in the hall room itself (illegally). Some of these couples are still together, while others have broken up. My current boyfriend has had sex with his ex and I'm rather pressured to have to match up to that. :-(

I am an SMU student, been following NUSwhispers for some time cause SMUConfessions is pretty much dead. 

So imagine my disgust when I notice that a certain trio of idiots have migrated from SMUConfessions to NUSwhispers. Basically all they do is tag each other in comments. They tried pathetically to get famous in SMU, but failed miserably and are now repeating their attempts here. Please do not indulge them in any way!

All those "pro-life" hypocritical groups saying abortion in murder and whatever bullcrap they are saying just for their own selfish religious/egotistical self fulfillment,  only care about the physical act of "birth" and not the lifelong care for the child. No one really knows when an organism has a soul so stop spouting random religious articles comparing embryos to amoebas or whatever crap just so you can feel good about yourself for something is that NONE of your business.

A close friend of mine, and many others like her, got pregnant accidentally and being young/without support/without income, was brainwashed by her "religious concerned friends" to keep the child until birth. Yea they supported and was there for her during the pregnancy but only to ensure she didnt consider termination. The moment the child was out guess what, no one gave two hoots about her or the child anymore. She had to quit her undergrad course, take on odd jobs, and face the ugly side which these "activists" never once mentioned. No one cares for the mother's or child's future or difficulties they now face. Behind the superficial cheer and celebration of the "right thing" to do, was followed by a lifetime of missed opportunities and years of suffering for 1 mistake that could have been averted.

To the "pro-life" hypocritical fanatics out there, you either declare that you are purely "pro-birth-only-and-not-give-a-shit-to-the-mother-and-child-post-birth", or completely keep your nose out of someone else's life changing decision.

I'm an introvert. Not meeting up for lunches/outing is not my form of anti-socialism/avoidance but that i prefer having some personal time and space. Having little to say does not mean i do not have any opinions but that i prefer to observe and listen, nonetheless with like-minded people, our conversation will never run dry. Being strong-headed does not imply my dissatisfaction with you, but that I have strong opinions about something, which are more often than not, warranted. Nodding to one-sided arguments does not reflect my agreement to it, it is just that I am clueless about the topic; I will be more than willing to share my advise if i had any experience or to present my views from a bystander's point of view if need be but definitely not providing baseless answers.

Introverts, I believe, are sensitive. Being sensitive allows us to put ourselves into others' shoes to understand their feelings and prevent/avoid undesired outcomes. Being sensitive makes it easy to discern between jokes and sarcasm. Being sensitive to negative eternities (e.g. sarcasm/taunt) sometimes sway our judgement and make us behave un-accordingly. Being sensitive therefore makes us regretful and over-think.

Introverts, like myself, tend to keep their detest to themselves. I dislike people resorting to shouting to win arguments. Dislike people who tend to outcast others especially those subtly. Dislike talking behind others' back or having the feeling of being talked (introverts are sensitive).

Author of  here. To , erm ... I don't know if others feel the same way but I think most people would agree that it's easier to tolerate Christian evangelism (if you mean Christmas carols ... ) than it is to tolerate incense burning. But why am I comparing here? Again, I stress that we should of course tolerate and respect people's religious or cultural practices, but only if any negative impact has been minimised so far as possible. I feel that it's a fair expectation. You said that people should have the right to do what they want, as long as they are not breaking the law. My point is that there should be laws to regulate incense burning. For example, making it illegal to burn on pavements at housing estates, making it mandatory to use the bins provided. I think it is fair. However, whether or not it's feasible or palatable to the people is up to debate, but at least we are discussing this topic! Finally, I thank everyone who has commented on the previous post (). Frankly I don't know whether it's a religious or a cultural practice, but my point is the same. People should be considerate when going about their business. Good night!

To Op, my parents have separated and I supported their decision. Perhaps the circumstances are much different, so this is just my 2 cents do take it with a handful of salt. I find that my parents' lives belong to them. They too have the right to be happy. And if divorce makes them happier I support them. It's just the circumstances we are born with. Some people are born with birth defects. Some are born to poor parents. Some are born to single parents. Some are born to parents destined for a divorce a little later down the road. Others are born to see their parents pass on in their 20s. But the point is, that's your parents' life. In your 20s, your life is in your hands. While you can't change the hand you were handed, you can definitely strategise for a happier life. 

Chin up.

To  What about Christmas? Just because it is cheerful doesn't mean it doesn't cause irritation and inconvenience to others. The constant evangelizing that everyone is subjected to (even in school by some CCAs) is an inconvenience as well. I believe some tolerance is needed. I don't like whatever they're doing but as long as it isn't breaking any law or infringing on human rights, people should be allowed to practice their religion in whatever way they deem fit. 

With the mention of 7th month, I would like to highlight that the display at FASS is highly offensive to those who view 7th month as important. It is very ignorant and insensitive of the organizers.

with reference to  So when a girl puts on make-up and looks pretty, you dismiss her efforts in making herself look good. And when she does not put on make-up and looks pretty, you reward the lack of effort in making herself look good. Huh...I think you should thank her parents and awesome randomness of genes instead, for giving her a gift that she did not earn. I don't understand why good looks from wearing make-up should actually be taken at a discount. If this is so, then shouldn't people wear trashbags or awful garments, since flattering outfits also enhance one's good looks and thus making it "unfair" in judging one's beauty? Also, foundation, some eyeshadow, blush and lipstick do not dramatically alter facial features.

PS: I don't mean to offend anyone with a different view; I just felt like I had to speak up for people who genuinely love wearing make-up. To each his own I guess :)

I like the idea of anonymity. It is the mask of courage. Confessions-wise, I have a sick desire to know what goes on in the minds of girls. I have the sick obsession of wanting to see if their actions in public and in private actually tallies. I'm infatuated with this notion of authenticity. On the surface, this might seem normal. Unfortunately, I have since found myself stuck in my own sticky web of voyeur-obsession. Somehow, normal porn (whatever normal is) is a total turn-off. It is bloody fake. I hanker for secret films of girls, especially local girls. Not that I take these videos, but that I am a disgusting patron of them. I face what I call a reverse-exoticism, which simply means I find local girls more attractive, probably because there are too many and too readily available white porn out there. When I say white, I refer generally to caucasian. Race and ethnicity is not intended as the topic of contention here, do pardon. At the end of the day, I ask myself if this is what I really like... But it's a difficult question to answer. Believe me, I psychoanalyse myself, and I have in mind the perfect justification for my actions, except that I cannot accept it myself. I am sure there are guys out there like myself, girls even. I just want all to know how disruptive this lifestyle has been, and will likely continue to be for me. I am not even talking about being "distracted" in lecture, because hell most guys do. I am referring to holding a proper conversation with a nice girl (but is she really nice...) and having to resist the urge to take advantage of her (in whatever manipulative ways), or rather trying my most real and utmost best to be a good man. And girls f-ed up enough to see right through people like me won't bother talking to me anyway. The formula I have for avoiding this snare is, don't have a heartbreak, don't be paranoid, don't read books you cannot deal with. Which is not helping much, anyway. Have a great day in school.

"Politics is meant to be filled by the wisest of its citizenry. However, due to the increasing prestige, wealth and power given to politicians, politics ended up attracting ambitious but incompetent go-getters who treat the system like a means to end and not an end itself. Do you agree?" I gave this essay question to my secondary school students during tuition and divided them into two groups to prepare for a class debate. Here are two interesting extracts from the points my students gave during their discussion, with each argument from opposing sides.

"I agree the perks of being a politician will attract the wrong people into power. The best experts in every field never ever choose to do what they are doing because of money, fame or prestige. They simply do it because they are passionate about what they are doing. It's the intrinsic value they seek. In order to select the right man for the job, every government needs to go beyond assessing education level and make an attempt to examine the past records of a potential candidate. If he shows a long history of social and community work, he is probably a compassionate person and care for people and maybe suitable to be in a role which require that personality."

"I don't agree. The benefits of being a politician are necessary to bring the best out of people. This is because all humans need motivation in order to be motivated to do something. It can be money or fame. Just imagine if you are not rewarded an extra bonus for doing a more difficult task than anyone else is doing, are you still willing to do it? Managing a whole country is a very tedious task which not many are willing to take up the responsibility. Hence, those who are willing must be well rewarded, else no one wants to do it and the country cannot get going. " 

Then I told my students on the need to give specific examples. They started bombing the entire class with tons of local examples, such as quoting certain prominent individuals and finger pointing at a few of our ministers. Some are downright insensitive, others are logical and a handful are rather hilarious. It's time to get them to start reading more on global examples! Muahaha!

I am still quite impressed by their discussion. When I was their age, I was writing childish narrative essays. "One very beautiful day, Jane goes to the market.....met George...fell in love...have kids...live happily after ever."

It's good to start thinking and discussing about current affairs from a young age. I'm glad the schools are emphasizing more on this, and allow the students think and discern for themselves what's right and what's wrong, instead of teaching them to think only towards a certain direction without question.

Don't you just hate it when someone can just get away from responsibilities with little to no consequences? 

I have personally worked with Person X before and the work ethic is less than desirable. Also, I had to cover for X who decided to pull out of camp, due to the inability to see eye-to-eye with others on many decisions. Yet, X continues to be trusted by many people around my social circle. It would be great if people can look past one's charms and words, but really get to know one's character (or lack thereof).

To X, you seriously need to grow up and work on your attitude towards work.

If you have a child next time, make sure it is a female. Here are some pragmatic benefits on why having a female child is more beneficial:

1. No need to serve NS. Not saying NS is bad but 2 years saved is another 2 years your child gets to spend on her career.
2. Equality means that in the future girls can earn more than guys and have better chance of entering university. Already there are more girls enrolling in university than guys this year.
3. Your child will be able to live off a man on his income and be cared for. Try doing that as a man and get laughed at.
4. Woman's charter and current laws are more protective of females. Your child will be well protected and can claim alimony if a marriage go south. Does not work if it is a male.
5. On the plus side, females tend to live longer.

So if you want your child to have a better life make sure it is a female. Males have been the better sex for the better of the last few centuries. I foresee females to be the better sex for the next few decades to come. One day, Singapore might actually have 90% females because there is just no longer any benefits to being a male anymore.

When I saw the Arts Bash photos my first thought, I admit, was "wow that's really raunchy". My second thought was, "wouldn't this totally rub some people from FASS the wrong way?". 

I am not really that conservative, but I never really understood the points of these pageants to begin with, let alone a hyper-sexualized and raunchy one. You might say it is a double standard since I was looking at those photos as well. But I do believe in using my actual head to exercise some rational thought and doing the right thing. I do not particularly appreciate seeing people who could potentially be my classmates in that light and I suppose I do have some expectations of appropriate behaviour for university students. To be clear, I have no issue with some exposed skin. But I make a distinction between wet white t-shirt photoshoots from say a beachwear photoshoot. The former is usually used specifically to tease. One of the few places that I hear of wet t-shirts being used was the sex-expo that happened a couple of years back. But my point here is not to voice my own opinion on the topic or pass moral judgement.

My point is that I am kind of expecting there to be vocal and opinionated people (or feminists even) in FASS who would disagree and speak out against these things. (ok I also admit I am stereotyping arts students abit, I mean yall study stuff like sociology, media etc. right?)  Are there? How have you tried speaking out against such things? Did anyone in the committee try to veto this idea?  How about the pageant contestants? Was it explained to them right from the beginning that there would be expected to do such shoots or was it sprung onto them mid way through the process? Did all of them agree without hesitation or were some pressured into doing it? Or is hyper-sexualization/objectification so commonplace that everyone just accepts it and this is essentially what the student population wants?

There has been much talk of politics, people lamenting how university students can hold irrational opinions or are not open to discussion and when they do discuss things it seems more like bickering. Well I think one of the problems is that we do not discuss smaller issues like the one I brought up above (assuming that people even do find it an issue at all) but we yet we feel that we are equipped to discuss big ticket issues like governance. These things take time to develop. Sure it might be a minor issue but we learn to build opinions an arguments with similar problems right? On a related note, does NUS even have a student run press that brings up such issues that affect students and give them something to talk about?

Additionally, does anyone else see the, albiet remote, relationship/parallel between the current state of national politics and the various student councils in schools? Voting for school council/union members seem arbitrary and simply a popularity contest. No one really bothers with talking about what responsibilities such positions entail or holding student leaders to a higher standards for reasons such as the fact that such unions are not given much executive authority by the instituition, the general student population just does not care (vicious cycle really), students complaining about the unions but dont give constructive feedback, and worst of all, some unions often end up serving just an insular group made up of the "in" and "popular" folk and not the full student body. We end up squandaring a good opportunity to develop competent leaders for politics, which is really kind of the whole point of emphasizing the importance of student leadership positions throughout education right?

p.s. I am not bashing student unions. the state of student leadership in universities and schools is not entirely the unions' fault. And I understand that unions do lots of stuff without the student population knowing, which is a problem too. If unions are doing something significant that impacts students, they should be publically acknowledged. This would encourage more discourse from the student population as well.

Summary: 2 issues. 1) What is your opinion on the raunchy arts bash photoshoot? 2) To improve quality of politics and discourse in Singapore we have to start small and encourage similar discussion between student leadership and student population. This might involve giving more authority to student unions, make them responsible for more significant student matters and giving them a more prominent platform to address the student population. When students feel like the student unions actually affect their life in school, they would be more inclined to voice their opinions, exercise their votes, etc. Agree/disagree?

To OP I understand how you are feeling about being a minority among the population. Let me share some of my experiences when I live in a Western country (I shall not name the country as it is my own personal opinion and does not represent the public's opinion).
 
The grass appears to be greener on the other side. It may seem greener but the appearance doesn't matter. It is the experience that is invaluable. From being a majority population group to a minority Asian in a Western country , it feels that there is definitely a certain "privilege" for the majority popluation group. An example is looking for work. It can be a challenge to look for work in a foreign country whereby the majority group are white. Racism do occur now and then though they are one-off incidences such as racist remarks. One has to be a bit cautious when drinking in bars or clubbing at nightclubs. And as Asians are the immigrants here, it is common to point the fingers for certain social issues towards this minority group. 

One thing that is almost certain is that the majority group will always be the ruling government. The minority indigenous group do receive benefits but are often protrayed as the marginalised group. This is not the case in Singapore though. As I compare here and back home, I do agree that the majority has certain "privilege" but not obvious. Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion, are first class citizens back home but always second in other countries. Yes there will definitely be some difference in treatment of the majority vs minority group. 

However in Singapore, at least there is meritocracy to some extent. Everyone, including the foreigners or migrants, are given an equal opportunity to compete for study opportunities and to some extent work opportunities. Yes there have been instances of certain groups hiring their own people in some companies in Singapore. But my point is that majority group do tend to have slight privileges over minority, such as hiring process for work etc. So when I reflect being the minority group now, I understand how it feels like to be the receiving end of jokes, criticisms and also missed opportunities for work or study being in the minority. And hence I will better understand and show our friends from the minority group with more respect.

I personally know the person in NUS who's running for elections. I don't want to mention who, but he's in a special programme somewhere (narrows down the options a lot, don't you think?)

Anyway, friend, I don't know why you are running for elections. I have spoken to you before and thought you were an unforgiving soul. You aren't new to controversy --- the issues surrounding Neil de Grasse Tyson, in part, was centrally you.

I respect your political affiliations, and I hope we can agree to disagree. I didn't even know about your motivations till rather recently. However, all I can tell you is to re-examine whether your ideals are indeed too lofty; there are many things everyone wants to change, be it the Transport Minister or the MCI press secretary or even the coffee shop uncle. I just thought that given your ability, you could have worked through a more effective channel or raised awareness on these issues more constructively.

I wish you, politician-to-be, the best of luck. But remember that politicians must always place Singapore and Singaporeans at the heart of what we do.

@6517: You act as if people do not get any flak for being opposition supporters. Opposition supporters are often blasted for being stupid, irrational, ungrateful etc. I'll say that people on both sides like to pick on Trivial/strawmen issues, not the meaty issues. For example, not many people replied the girl's question on political monopoly. 

The inevitable discussion about my anonymity only serves to show this :p

And for that pro-PAP guy... Well i also find him quite irksome, and not because he supports the PAP. He doesn't really discuss points in the confession and seems to just go off in a sideways rant about the opposition. I think he knows it too, he's not the only pro-PAP guy who keeps commenting after all and yet he and others unanimously thought it referred to him.

-
 
It is quite amusing that I know who the PAP IB is, the opp IB is, and I am just watching the arguments fly back and forth. No substance leh, I'd rather go read something actually objective like The Middle Ground. Waste my time sia.

So much talk about this PAP IB guy. Aren't you all opposition IB too for supporting opposition blindly? Seriously, have you even seen some of the opposition parties (cough Roy cough). Give credit where credit is due, don't blindly support any party just because you want to rebel/conform.
-
 
 It's precisely because of people that "don't know a lot" or simply don't care about politics that people like that "irritating pro-PAP guy(s)" have to come out to make their views heard. After all, the online space is dominated by anti-government critics (some of whom have openly admitted that they are spreading half-truths in an attempt to "bring down the PAP") and their reach is quite extensive. Let's not forget TRS was earning shitloads of money before they got shutdown. 

I applaud the "Pro-PAP" guy for publicly airing his views. I've been called a "PAP dog", "PAP IB" and received abusive messages from people before. Freedom of speech works only 1 way in the SG online-sphere.

I know people might be getting sick of the politics debate here, but when I saw that Lui Tuck Yew doesn't want to run for GE2015, it honestly makes me sad. Someone who inherited a difficult ministry, facing constant backlashes from the public, quietly doing his best to improve public transport in whatever ways he can while still trying to manage the companies running them. 

Not saying that there cannot be any criticisms at all, but for all the complaints, how many people actually acknowledge when public transport is actually running smoothly? Over the National Day weekend, I must say that despite the huge crowds moving around, I didn't have to wait more than 5min for a train, there were no train breakdowns to my knowledge, and it wasn't that insanely packed considering how many people were actually using public transport during that period. If you say that it's expected that public transport runs smoothly, even in first-world countries like US and London, train breakdowns and delays are not uncommon, even expected. You can't have the best of everything.

Ministers, or MPs for that matter, are human too. I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later to one of the Ministers who just cannot tahan all the criticisms anymore despite putting in his best effort. Isn't that what some confessions here are also about? And to those of you who name-call and ask for ministers to step down, I hope you're pleased with yourself. You got what you wanted right? Let's see someone else try to take over this ministerial post and do a better job than LTY. Honestly if I were him also, I would be sick and tired of trying to serve and appease the ungrateful Singaporeans who only know how to complain and make a lot of noise to overpower the ones who actually know how difficult his job must be. It's only a matter of time before all this destructive criticism scares away talented individuals (whether opposition or PAP) from deciding to join politics to help Singapore progress. So Singaporeans, if the pool for politicians declines in quality, you only have yourselves to blame.
-
 
In 2011 it was George Yeo our Foreign Minister, this year it's our Transport Minister. How many competent and committed Ministers must participate in the exodus for Singaporeans to realise that such people are really hard to come by? At this rate, there won't be a SG100.

Help.

I must admit I do not know a lot about politics, unlike the guys (I think NS sort of makes them more exposed to political matters? I dunno us girls are quite indifferent tbh)

At the prospect of casting my first vote I've been thinking a lot lately, and one issue stands out though. The opposition parties do really look bad! But I feel that there is a social climate in Singapore that is very anti-opposition, and it seems common sense to me that the PAP would be interested in hampering the growth of any political party that may prove a threat in the future. Many people (including this irritating pro-PAP guy that comments on every confession -_-) say that voting anyone else other than the PAP is detrimental to Singapore in the long run. But wouldn't a monopoly be equally bad? After all, business monopolies end up ripping customers off. Will probably still be voting for the PAP, but I think people are making it out to be a simpler issue than it appears to be.

Since when did NUSWhispers become a political broadcast channel sia? Later dio media licensing.

In light of the recent election-oriented confessions here, thought would like to add something I want to tell a friend of mine in NUS.

I saw on the news that you were distributing flyers for a certain opposition party. Whether you are being fielded as a candidate or just being a volunteer, I'm thoroughly shocked by your decision to join the opposition. 
Against the tide of anti-PAP sentiment online, let me say this, although I'm not a PAP member, I'm at least a supporter of the policies of the ruling party. PAP is not a perfect party, no political party is. As the ruling party, its policies are never perfect, it has admitted that. 

On the whole, the PAP has done a pretty good job given that we are price-taking economy buffeted by worldwide economic trends and global circumstances that we have limited or no control over. In recent economic downturns, Singapore was not affected much and was in fact one of the first to recover.

I heard a couple of people including yourself claiming that the PAP ministers and MPs of today are not the same and do not have the gumption of our founding fathers. Therefore, we should not judge the present PAP by the good work of their predecessors. I do not deny that the time of the old guard has passed. However, their party ideals, machinery and talent acquisition of capable men and women have not changed. They have one of the best people in Singapore to govern our land, there is no place even for second-best.

People used to rail about the Population White Paper forgetting that is an infrastructure preparation plan SHOULD we hit 6.9 million and NOT a plan to import foreigners till we reach 6.9 million. The PAP has the foresight to plan for a worst case scenario which is not too much to ask for is it. Conversely, do you want our government to just plan for best-case scenario instead?

You admitted yourself that you are left on the political scale and want more social welfare. When I asked how you would propose to fund this welfare, you say cut defense spending. If you have seen our NDP 2015, you should appreciate the strength of our SAF. I bet the 50 aircraft that our RSAF could just deploy and still have reserves to protect us was the envy of our neighboring leaders who attended our NDP.  

As former Lieutenant General Winston Choo said 
“If we do not have a strong and capable SAF, we leave ourselves open to being cowed, intimidated and vulnerable to pressures from larger states.”

Moving away from the PAP, the quality of the opposition is dismissible to laughable at best. If the best of the opposition the WP already face issues running a GRC, a mini-version of Singapore with no external issues like defense and foreign affairs to worry about no less, why do they and the rest of the opposition deserve my vote over the tried-and-tested PAP?
Pritam Singh told a minister he would not answer his questions but only to a constituent. With such blatant disregard to the highest institution of our land, I shudder to think what would happen should WP or your political party seize power.

Idealists talk about the dangers of one-party rule and point to China and Russia or even North Korea as examples. North Korea is a bad example I concur but China and Russia are not as bad as you would think. If we measure a country’s scientific advancement by its space program, China and Russia are the only countries in the people who can currently send men into space. The supposedly mighty but actually deficit-laden weakening USA superpower has to resort to asking Russia to send its astronauts to the space station. Talk about technological backwardness.

I encourage you view this TED talk by the US-Chinese academic https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_x_li_a_tale_of_two_political_systems

To conclude, to my friend and all you anti-PAP folks out there, I shall leave you links to help balance your views against just reading the TRE, TOC, former TRS.

NUS whispers political debate now:
-
 
I have a nerdy friend who's usually quiet and reserved. A typical introvert, the kind that usually fades in the background. After NDP he has totally transformed into this huge politics nut. He just brings politics into everything and keeps repeating the same rebuttals to straw man arguments like a broken record. Anybody else have this problem? It's like they can't just talk with their votes!

What's the use of so much patriotism only on National Day and for all the SG50 campaigns? After this, everyone is going to start complaining about train breakdowns and bashing the government all over again. It's like you're appreciating Singapore only during the National Day, then for the rest of the year, complain and complain like most typical Singaporeans. It's like appreciating your parents only on Mother's/Father's Day then giving a rat's ass for the other 364 days. Please people, if you're going to feel/be patriotic, be consistent, or else it feels very superficial and undermine those who are truly patriotic (if such people even exist anymore).

Just penning some thoughts down. It's almost 4 am, and I apologise if this confession isn't the most coherent. I'm a final year student in FASS, and will likely continue to be a post-graduate student in NUS. I'm Indian and male. I was originally from Malaysia, but our family moved to Singapore for my parent's work when I was 10. I've lived the majority of my life in Singapore. I enlisted in the army and have already secured citizenship. My parents were simple folks who ran a small restaurant. They worked hard for me and my siblings, and because of them, I got to go to very good schools in Singapore. I'm, for the most part, immensely grateful for every opportunity I've had in life. Opportunities that I wouldn't have had had I stayed in Malaysia.

Earlier this evening, I was having dinner with my best friend. We met in secondary school and connected over Neopets and Pokemon. We became best friends. He's the sort of person I feel comfortable talking to him about everything as does he for me. Over dinner, he highlighted to me a blog about majority privilege. Specifically, on Chinese privilege. I don't wish to disclose the blog link, but I trust that as university students, you're BFFs with Google and know how to find it yourselves.

Reading some of the blog entries deeply resonated with me. I've never truly felt I fit in — be it in secondary school, JC and especially army. In BMT, I was the only Indian guy in my platoon. I was called "Ah Neh" by my sergeants, commanders and even my platoon mates. I was rarely called by my name. It was much better when I went to SCS, but on occasions, there were still references being made to my identity as an Indian person. It was a pretty shitty feeling to have your name conveniently replaced with "Ah Neh", but I just brushed off those incidences because I didn't want to be seen as being "easily offended". I'm not the sort of person to be offended easily, I can take jokes very well, but that shitty feeling ate at my core being. I've even heard once before when I was at a public pool with my niece - a Chinese mother in her late forties telling a young boy (in Mandarin, a language I learned in secondary school and which I love and speak fluently) to get out of the pool because she fears somehow that our presence will "blacken" the kid's skin. 

When I read the blog over dinner, I felt it not only resonated with my experiences in my early life, but it made me feel bitter. I went home, dug out a few academic articles (both local and foreign) and began reading on privilege and racial identities. Prior to tonight, I've never given "race" much thought. I saw people as either a good person or an asshole. I choose to hang out with the former in my social circle. The more I read about privilege, be it from the blog or academic articles, the more aware and bitter I become. Angry even. I don't want to be angry, though. I'm not an angry person. I certainly don't want to be bitter. I don't agree with the tone used in the blog, but I too see its value. Sometimes, not being politically correct, not caring so much about hurt feelings and choosing to consciously highlight issues are much needed in our public spaces. 

"Race", as a subject, is not something we talk much about in public. I suppose it makes people feel uncomfortable. Admittedly, I'm as well uncomfortable in making my opinions and identity known. I don't want to be seen as someone who's angry about the state of things. I've nothing against Chinese people. Because of the schools I went to, I grew up and played with mostly Chinese people. But I do have a problem with institutionalised racism. In Malaysia, when I speak to my childhood friends, they tell me that race is a subject now being discussed in public spaces. Things become heated at such discussions, but invariably, awareness and a mutual understanding of minority issues become more known. Are we, Singaporeans, ignoring these issues or have we become blind to it under the pretext of racial harmony? How can we promote a healthy discussion on race? How can we progress as a nation when we've policies that effectively discriminates people from based on their race and language? How is a discussion on the readiness of Singapore on a minority PM valid in this day and age when we say in our pledge the words "regardless of race, language or religion"? How can we change mindsets - both of the young and old - so that it does not extend beyond their generation? I don't have answers to those questions, I wish though I did. But I'm very determined to effect changes when I eventually begin work in public service. 

After browsing through the blog, my best friend asked, "How do you feel about it?" I told him frankly that it made me angry and bitter knowing that my earlier experiences in life were not isolated incidences, but rather, shared with other minorities. We talked at length about some of the things he's said over our years of friendship... things he weren't aware of that hurt my feelings.. things that I brushed off because it didn't matter much to me at the time. I dare say that after tonight, we're much closer as friends. At least, amongst ourselves, we're being honest.

 After watching the National Day, my conclusion is that our country is resilient enough to move on from Lee Kuan Yew and PAP just like we did from the British and Malaysia. Our country is so good in the past that I want to stop the government from ruining the country that we had.

To  & , I face similar circumstances as well. People don‘t usually remember me, but it‘s okay, really. You don‘t really have to be a priority to many out there, but you have to be a main priority to yourself. Do something meaningful and worthwhile with your life and the rest should be simple already.

I wonder how is it possible that some people who are very muscular are underweight in terms of BMI while some people who are just as muscular is overweight using BMI. Is it simply a matter that different body work differently in response to workouts, for instance how much water is retained in muscle, bone mass etc?

I am a foreign student. My group of friends (who are almost entirely foreigners as well) always like to comment on Singapore's government, and how Singaporeans are ungrateful. I don't really know about politics here, and I agree that the government back home is a lot worse, but I don't think my friends should always harp on this. After all, if they are so passionate why don't they become citizens instead? None of us are planning to live here permanently :/

I'm just tired of hearing all the insults and jokes about Singaporeans. It's difficult to keep pretending to smile and laugh. I mean, we're renting a flat together and eating cheap food all the time and returning home on weekends/holidays, Singaporeans have to live here. When I heard the price of a home and a car I got shocked! 

In case you think we're all bad, we aren't. Its just a few who start the ball rolling about Singapore politics and set the "atmosphere". If I have one thing to console Singaporeans, it is that your government has equipped you with a world-class education so that you can migrate anywhere.

Sometimes when I speak with my "Friends" in NUS, i feel quite appalled by the narrowed-mindness in the way they think about certain issues brought up. The topic that we were discussing was regarding the upcoming GE2015 that was rumoured to be in September (Probably somewhere during midterms). 

Now don't get me wrong, I am NOT generalizing that majority of the NUS students think this way, rather I'm upset that despite advancing into tertiary education, they still have the mind of a toddler, making decisions based on rashness, emotions and unsubstantiated evidence. Furthermore, I feel that as a citizen of Singapore, you should at least be responsible to have some form of rationality and reasoning in choosing the party that you desire, rather than allowing your personal emotions to dictate who is worthy of governing.

 I don't understand why some people think it's a troll. I share similar experience as well. And I'm not trolling. It's a secret I kept to myself and most likely, to my grave.

I have a feeling not many people will care about this lengthy post, but here goes. I watched a recent video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNA6on-WY3Y) uploaded by the infamous Amos Yee.

Despite his annoying fake American accent and my anger towards his disparaging remarks towards the late Mr Lee and religion, he is actually a very intelligent boy who can see things and think beyond his years. When I was at his age, I was still thinking about how to have fun, where to hang out with my boyfriend and how to earn more extra money to spend. I am certain I'm not the only one who is indifferent towards societal issues during my teens. Amos Yee rudely pointed out everything that is wrong with our country, some of it can be true yet, we find it so hard to accept it due to his insensitive approach of bringing this message across.

What further justifies Amos Yee's opinion is how when he was treated like a criminal during his hearing. There are many others before Amos who made derogatory remarks on race and religion which threatens to destroy the social fabric of Singapore. However, most of them were simply fired from their jobs, instead of being charged in court and treated like a criminal. The reason is because Amos defamed the late Mr Lee, although he was charged in court on the basis of making scornful religious comments. So perhaps this saga would not have been so serious if Amos didn't mention Mr Lee? Is this the way things are done in Singapore?

Even though how rude or brash a person's opinion can be, it is wise to not take everything as a personal attack. Instead of brushing it off and saying, "How can he say that?", we should listen and ask, "Why is he saying that?"

I am always very happy to hear younger Singaporeans debate about the problems in Singapore in an open and objective manner. From that, we can learn our country's weaknesses and understand what are the aspirations of the next generation, so we can aim to fulfill them. The younger ones nowadays want more than just a roof over their heads or security, they want autonomy and ability to create their own lives instead of always being held by the shackles of stringent rules; rules which the previous generation desperately need in the tumultuous times.

I learnt something about solving life's problems from a beloved senior in NUS at the lowest point of my studies in NUS. Due to relationship and financial problems, I started doing stupid harmful things such as cutting my own wrist to release my stress as the pain on the skin distracted me from my internal turmoil. Since we are both in sports, my senior told me about the story of Painkiller VS Exercise. She said I am in pain, hence I am taking a painkiller. The painkiller can be easily popped into the mouth, alleviates the pain and makes me feel comfortable but it will bring more harm than good because it is addictive and it ultimately blinds me from solving the actual problem. However, exercise on the other hand, brings a healthier body in the long run and it will ultimately increase our immunity towards pain and illnesses, but we must make an effort to move out from our comfort zone and start exercising. Starting is the hardest and most painful, but then we'll get used to it over time and the benefit comes.

I use this same principle to think about Singapore, we have always been using painkillers to solve our problems such as shutting down alternative medias to "solve" the problem of dissent, and imposing fines on every undesirable behavior. This makes some people happy at the moment, however this method will blind them from the fact that the problem is still lurking around and waiting to explode one day.

Be bold, be brave, and most importantly, be polite too, since most people will close their ears to whatever your opinion may be if you are rude, no matter how true your words can be.

Thanks for reading my naggy story. I wish everyone a happy SG50! Huat Ah!

Hi..I'm the OP of the post 

And yes, whether it's a post or Pre op. It doesn't matter. 

I struggle to live with the guilt that........ I have feelings for trans people in this certain way.

I'm wondering if I'm gay or bi or whatever it is called. Because I still do develop feelings for girls nonetheless.

My deepest fear isn't coming out and telling people about this. It's wondering how people would ....react.

Seriously, I'm wondering if I should come out of the closet to the NUS community

do people still believe in sex after marriage? or is being a virgin with this mentality very rare now?

I think were all old and mature enough to know that rape occurs, whether we choose to believe in it or not. If you downplay a rape confession with trolling, youre an asshole. Even if the confessor was indeed trolling, others might have gone through a similar experience. Telling them that it sounds too absurd to be true would make them feel worse off then they already are as they are having their traumatic experiemce invalidated. So please resist the urge to be a complete dick in such situations.

One of my guilty pleasures - I don't mean to be an elitist prick - is reading how students from local private unis defend their alma mater and then pick apart their argument in my head.

I mean it's funny cause they really do try but their assumptions are unsubstantiated and their "supporting articles" are mostly taken out of context. 

Oh well... A majority of them seem regarded to me so I can't blame them.

-
 
Sometimes, the OP might be writing from their own perspective so we don't truly know what the full story is. I noticed that some of the confessions are on blaming others/faulting others etc you get the drift but sometimes you need to reflect on yourself. The problem may not be with others but yourself ... Face the truth and work on it. That said, we are always on a learning journey so it is ok to make mistakes along the way.

I am thinking about an other half. The problem is that I realised that while I am probably an excellent planner and philosophically, I am probably correct in what I hope for, I just don't seem to know how to flatter.

Let me explain. In a union, it is important to understand the other half, so I value face-to-face chats a lot. But I have increasingly few opportunities to do that. Admittedly I do look out for an other half that is quick. Quick not as in being able to perform a quickie or running very fast, but as in the ability to keep up with conversation of high intensity (not necessarily just with a fast-speaking machine gun, but the type where each sentence is well-thought out fast enough).

I really don't care much about frivolity in life. I am willing to accommodate in all sorts of decisions which I will call "willing to concede", such as where to eat (as long as I don't eat too unhealthily), what to do (park? Sure! USS? Ok! Walking by the beach? Can! Climbing trees? I try.) and shopping (I shop for utility, of course, but people do shop for different reasons --- that I understand). I would even go so far to say I have few favourites when it comes to this aspect, and thus am willing to compromise. (P.S. I even get frustrated when my parents ask me what to eat simply because, as long as the food isn't that terrible, I'd be ok.)

Funny thing is that, despite my supposed relaxed conditions as compared to a few years back, I just can't seem to find any that catch my eye, maybe in part due to an exceeding lack of opportunity to find new people. Unfortunately, my social gatherings tend to involve attending organised events... basically places where one tends to listen to people speak about issues. I thought one could learn about others quite a lot by asking the right questions and from there, inferring how someone is. Then again, that requires a quick head; the questions are never pre-set.

Some friends have questioned at my apparent lack of similarity in finding other halves, but I must admit that people do change (even if they never admit I do). What we think is the answer today may not work say... 5 years down the road. Unfortunately this holds true even on this aspect.

But if I don't even have a chance to get to understand people deeper on what drives them, keeps them going and happy with what they do, and their innermost desires, passions and issues, how would I ever be able to find a significant other?

(Given where I plan to head to, I am not sure if I'd ever settle down. :) )

They say in real life you will work in multi-cultural environment. This seldom happens lah.....
People usually hire the person from the same culture. My office programmers mostly from India. Admin / HR is usually pinoy staffs. The overseas office in China is ALL Chinese. 

So it doesn't make sense for a module to enforce different nationalities to work together.

I'm heartened to see so many election-related posts here; they really speak volumes about how Singapore has come a long way in terms of her civil and political progress. From what I observed (cursory reading of selected posts here and there), a respectable air of civility still exists between commentators, even when they diverge on very charged issues. As for the foreigner-vs-local debates unfolding here in recent posts, I can't say I'm convinced by the arguments against shutting our doors to foreign talent; they are teetering close to xenophobia, and remind me conspicuously of antisemitism and its accompanying prejudices, albeit on a much diminished fashion.

I don't know if this has been stressed here before, with SG50 in a few days' time, let us not forget that beyond our political inclinations and personal inhibitions, Singapore flourished precisely because the specter of politics was not allowed to overshadow our bid for national development and progress. Granted the next 50 years will require Singapore and its people exhibit a different kind of tenacity (with an entirely different plethora of problems to contend with), politics is merely a mean to an end.

P.S. looking forward to cast my first vote yippee

In countries like Korea, Israel and Taiwan, where mandatory military service similarly exists, conscripts are treated with respect and honoured as defenders of their land. And therein lies the problem with National Service in Singapore:

NS men here are hardly given the due purpose and respect they deserve. From being stomped for taking a seat in public transport to having complaints against their supposed body odour (after sweating their guts out in training for defense of the country I might add); Singaporean soldiers are treated with derision and disdain for the most part. Whatever one does in national service is similarly a nondescript footnote on one's resume - 99% of employers pretty much don't care whether you were an officer or clerk in the army; to them, it was something that every man went through anyway, so why should it be accorded any difference?

The lack of appreciation and recognition is thus the biggest problem to why many Singaporean men feel disgruntled with these 2 years of conscription. After all, its hard to argue against that NS is a "waste of time" when one hardly receives any due recognition for their service.

Me and my dad are fans of Japanese anime. During dinner, we brought up an issue which I never really thought of until he talked about it. The topic is: Why do Japanese characters in anime have Caucasian features?

Ignoring some characters with outlandish pink or green hair, most anime characters have Caucasian features despite the fact of being Asian. When I think back about some of my favorite characters, I was like, "Oh yah! That's true!" So I searched the topic on the Internet and found the image below which shows how some of our anime characters look like if the artists are more technically accurate...

So this brought me to think about the perception of beauty. Despite the fact that the Japanese are known to be very proud of their ancestry, their view on beauty is largely influenced by the West. We have a lot of Asian people like ourselves who desire large colored eyes, a sharp nose bridge, a more chiseled jawline and other features which are more common to the people of Western heritage. Anything which is not the Western standard of beauty is deemed to be unattractive, since I do not know of anyone who's interested in going for cosmetic surgery to have smaller eyes...rounder face.... duh....

Once, I saw a documentary which shows us that throughout time, beauty has been evolving. In the past, ladies who are corpulent are considered desirable, and now we love a slim and hourglass-shaped femme fatale. How volatile we can be!

However there's a type of beauty which is timeless. That is the beauty of the heart. Even in Japanese anime, the kindest and most sincere character (such as Hinata Hyūga) will always be well-liked and adored by most fans, even though the character may not be the sexiest or the most beautiful. Therefore no matter how your looks may be, whether or not you are seen to be physically attractive by others, you will always be a beautiful person to the people you deserve to be with, as long as you have a beautiful heart. Fortunately, having a beautiful heart is always a choice XOXO

To 
You are a fool who does not see the crux of the problem. The debate is not whether NS is necessary. It is. The key issue of fairness is of one segment of SG residents (male citizens) making significant and tangible sacrifices that benefit ALL other residents (a subsection of which happen to be foreign nationals studying here on taxpayers' money, ignoring those on private scholarships). The unfairness of it is that x% of the resident population sacrifices for the benefit of 100% of the resident population. x =/= 100. As such, to even the scales, some benefit only accruable to the x% should be in place. When put this simply, I sincerely hope that an undergraduate at a fantastic university such as NUS can look at at the matter a little more clearly. This post has not drawn any necessary link between NS and scholarship deservingness (similar position to the 2nd paragraph of ). This seems clear to me, but I'll spell it out nonetheless as a precaution, since the standard of debate is so low.
-
 
 I'm a SAF NSF of the Year recipient and I don't think your post is being objective. Recognizing that the two 'lost' years were an impediment is not the same as condoning vitriol against foreign students. And yes, NS was an impediment because I could not do what I originally wanted to, even if I ended up making the best out of it (hence my award).

The issue at hand is how we see NS as a burden instead of a duty. Now, there are a myriad of factors behind this but justifying NS using cheap phrases like 'make the best out of your 2 years' contributes to the problem. I am severely disturbed by the overwhelming support of your post, its comments and how no one else has recognised this problem.

Currently at some large companies, because of our foreign talent policy, it seems that many heads of department or senior management are all foreigners, whereas Singaporeans are merely middle managers.

Many sandwiched-class Singaporeans feel they should have the opportunity to rise further, but cannot do anything about their situation.

If the situation continues, it will threaten Singapore's development and youth, he said. "When Singaporeans can't even be the leaders in their own country's companies, to a certain extent, it means Singapore has lost a leadership role, and we will not be able to develop the younger generation to take over and become leaders in various domains.

Do you agree?

I find that the biggest flaw in democracy is that everyone gets a vote. How is it that people who do not understand complex economic policies actually have a say in how the country should be run? NUS should provide basic courses in political science, public policy, economics, and a bit of sociology to would-be voters. Heck, they should create a compulsory course taught in the 4 main languages to the citizenry so that they actually know what they are voting for. 
-
 
 *It depends on the faculty and your course. Certain courses have higher percentages of locals relative to foreigners.

tl;dr: There is no party to blame in the "us vs them" debate. Foreigners should make a effort to integrate with us, and we should be more accommodating to them. Both sides have their fair share of perspectives and faults, so really no point arguing about it.

That being said, I really do not see the point of arguing about foreigners vs locals. Yes, they come in, they kick you to the bottom of the bell curve, but instead of blaming them, shouldn't you focus more on working harder and smarter to get the results you want?

Ehh, they come in with pre-educated knowledge of courses such as CS1010E, and you expect them not to use it against people like us who might not have any programming background at all? Does it matter to them? No. Does it matter in the working world if someone has an edge over you and you cry unfair? No.

The "us vs them" debate always has both sides to blame, don't justify yourself to being entitled to things using NS as an excuse. You served 2 years of duty, it's over. You're now a man, get on with it. 

To us locals, we cannot go cherry-picking the foreign talent that come in, and you know as well as the rest of us do, that in the larger picture, we need to welcome them for the survival of our country. Though the "large picture" argument is seriously bs - I work, I live, I do what I have to survive, maybe do well, I where got time for your larger picture??? 

That, and well, they are here to earn an honest living as well, as much as any of us here. We should cut them some slack. We should have that humble empathy to do this much.

To foreigners, we served 2 years of NS for guys (not sure about the situation for ladies though). Understand that, we have to do this simply because we are born here - given a choice, we wouldn't want to do it either, but we will face charges and fines against us. Most of us ain't that rich to tank being charged in Singapore.  

From the perspective of the more less-informed amongst us, foreigners just waltz in, grab the jobs, scholarships, etc., that we might need to survive at this here our home, which we gave 2 years into learning how to protect, and 10 years more of ICTs in being an active military unit - which can be detrimental to our jobs, no matter how many rewards or shit you give our companies. It doesn't make a lot of sense.

This is where we come from, and this is why, the very least you can do, which many of you in large groups failed to do, is to join us, and integrate into our society. 

Learn our mannerisms, our behaviour, our food, our local culture (ehh, not the one the government shows you) instead of sticking into one gigantic cluster just because it's your comfort zone. Joining CCAs, etc., will just make your records look good, and make you mingle with those people in your CCA, nothing much more. It won't change the fact that you haven't really made an off-the-records effort to reach out to us.

We speak English, so stop speaking in your own language when you are in front of us. If I keep speaking Hokkien in front of you, to my other friends, I don't think you will find it rude like how we do, but you will detect that we are trying to exclude you from our conversations, which is what we see most of the time.

However, to those who actually make an effort to reach out to us, I am very happy for you, well, for us as well, but I can only say, "Welcome to Singapore". I for one don't mind extending out a friendly hand to you.

I am the OP of  and thank NUSWhispers for posting my story. Anyway, thanks for all the likes so I assume that it is kind of a positive response from the majority. My friends are all Singaporeans, all of them are very understanding and I never think Singaporeans are unkind thoe. For those who keep using NS as a piece of evidence that shows the unfair treatment between locals and foreigners, I hope you guys actually feel proud to serve the nation, make a lot of friends and acknowledge the fact that male local friends are much more mature than female ones. Digress a bit but I actually watched Ah Boy To Men 1, 2 and 3 and see...NS is not that bad even though movies only show good scenes but yeah, I don't mind serving NS thoe :]

I am not saying that everything PAP has done is right but whatever they do has a long-term purpose...The fact that what the opposition parties have done for Singapore is so minimal (got any reported by new media? No!) that I doubt they can handle this big fat Singapore...see how the residents complain about WP failing to manage Aljunied GRC...you have your answer of what other small opp parties can do

I realize if you ask for direction from Singaporeans, most of the time they will give you vague or wrong information if you are a foreigner.

 If you think that its fair for foreign students to receive government sponsored scholarships while we locals have to source for the faint hope of obtaining private ones. If you think we deserve to start life in debt just because we are Singaporeans. Then I have nothing more to say.

Have you asked around? How many of us have to work part time to make ends meet? How many are draining away our families' income? Majority of Singaporeans aren't as rich as you make us out to be.

By the way, the exchange rate is a non issue. Singaporeans suffer from it too. For some unknown reason, a strong Sing dollar doesn't make imports any cheaper.
-
 
I'm disgusted to know that NUS has some privileged few (possibly scholarshiped) students who try to tell the poor in Singapore that they are really not that poor. As if we never applied to scholarships, as if you don't know how hard it is to get one, as if we can migrate when unhappy.

Hey! Just because we don't come with educated families with fixed income and the ability to employ lawyers to declare that our family's finances deserve financial aid, doesn't mean that we are any less Singaporean!

It's already bad enough that I have to decline social gatherings with friends because I can't afford them. And that I live thinking about the cost of my next meal, university materials, transport fares, etc. I don't need to take your trash talk as well

When it comes to politics, people would do well to think of politics as a cold, calculated business transaction where the voters use their votes to "buy" a government that takes care of their needs.

If your needs are currently taken care of, don't make the mistake of thinking that your government actually cares about you. It is merely that your needs and profile belong to the majority of the voter demographic. Keep in mind that when you no longer belong to the majority demographic, you won't get the same level of "care". So do think twice when you offer the government weapons to suppress "minority" voices.

The primary aim of political parties is to preserve their position of power. This doesn't mean that they are necessarily bad. As voters we just have to make it such that the only way for them to retain power is to take care of our needs satisfactorily, especially since the government will use any and every tactic to twist the "partnership" to their advantage.

There are different class of foreign talents in Singapore.

The superb ones are like Petr Cech that bring quality.

The lousy ones are like Falcao, with big reputation, but perform like shit.

We have too many Falcao in Singapore.

In light of the recent local/foreigner debate and discussions about the related government policies, I would just like to share a wider but related, personal experience.

While I was on exchange in Europe, it was common for people to assume that I'm from China merely because I'm ethnically Chinese. By sheer numbers alone, the majority of Chinese in Europe would be from China and this assumption is understandable.

Back in Singapore, I was queueing up at a food stall while busily translating for a man from India the Mandarin spoken by the stall assistant from China. When it was my turn, the stall holder asked me in the most innocuous manner, in Mandarin of course, "Are you from China?"

Upon her utterance, I doubted if I was in Singapore. And then I was furious.

Virgin voter here. My mum has been warning me not to vote for opposition parties. The reason is not of unsound policies or bad TC management, but because I will be marked and blacklisted. Years of brainwashing and scaremongering  at the finest.

Regarding the whole xenophobia issue. Let me share my personal experience. I live in an estate with many foreigners and while some are friendly and put in the effort to integrate, the majority cluster in their own cliques. The chinese tend to be noisy and inconsiderate, the indians arrogant (probably because of their caste system ) and the whites think they are better than asians. So are xenophobic comments really baseless? I'm not xenophobic. I have chinese and indian national friends. But this is the situation

To  and 

I'll bite. I accept that none of us can control the country we're born in. And without anything more, it would be at best slightly absurd and at worst incredibly unfair to expect excessive benefits simply because your parents had sex at spot A while a 'foreigner's' parents had sex at spot B. 

However, Singaporean males do something called National Service. 50% of us make a contribution to the place we were born that I daresay is not matched by any citizens in any other developed country. This entitles (yes, entitles) us to demand some benefit in return. Duty is well and good, but that alone does not bind me to something as arbitrary as where I was born. I should be at least given a fair chance at making a decent living. Some people, hating the concept of compulsory conscription, might demand more. They would not be unjustified in doing so. In particular, it would be nice if people who did not do NS were not put on a pedestal and be given preferential treatment over people who gave 2 of the best years of their lives to the country. (To be intellectually coherent, this argument extends to a lesser extent to Singaporean females as well, but not many people are willing to accept that implication, so I will leave it at that.) The argument crumbles if there exist no foreign scholars with worse grades than a similar Singaporean with a comparable family background, but evidently that is not the case. 

TLDR: Xenophobia is stupid, without anything more backing it up. But in the unique case of Singapore, we do in fact have something that justifies a Singaporeans first policy. 

I suppose this may be seen as tasteless and unpopular, but I think it is a position with verifiable merit. I took care to inject nuance and lay out assumptions, and welcome criticism.

Recently, I ended my orientation camp. Everything was great except for one thing. It's about the annual Rag & Flag Day.

So, during the camp finale, the PD for rag & flag came to the stage to convince freshies to join rag and also to come down for flag day happening soon. But, some of the things he said in his speech made me very uncomfortable. 

I'm sure we all know what flag day is all about right? Going around asking for donations from the public in school uniforms is quite a common sight nowadays. But, not once was the word "charity" mentioned from him. To quote loosely, he said that flag day was for us to "do whatever the fuck you guys want", either as a OG outing or most importantly, "free shirt and goodie bag!". Not cool, man.

I was feeling pretty damn uncomfortable by the way he viewed flag day, especially given his role as PD. He even said to "collect just $1, $2 or $3" was enough and we could just all go sing k or watch a movie. Not sure for the rest of you, but during flag day, I always had a small sense of satisfaction when I could feel the solid weight of my tin can. 

I know people always say singaporeans have little kindness, but most that I've encountered have been willing to give. And I try my best to approach people, as do my friends who go for flag day. 

Honestly, I don't understand how he could have said those things. I'm not trying to bash the guy, but felt he was too insensitive, especially saying these stuff to all of us. Whose gonna take flag day seriously if the PD already feels that way? I appreciate the major commitment and dedication he had to volunteer for such a saikang job, but still? Maybe the job should have went to a better man who felt more for charitable causes then he did. 

I urge everyone to attend flag day, and yes, the freebies are an incentive, as well as the chance for it to bond with your OG. But most importantly, it's a great opportunity to raise money for charities, and for the public to give selflessly.

Not sure what I can accomplish with this post. But I genuinely want to convince those going for flag day to try their best to get donations. Trust me, you'll feel accomplished with a tin full of coins. Afterwards, feel free to lepak with a clean conscience. 

That aside, props to the committee for a fun and shag camp. Looking forward to my years in this awesome faculty!

To chip in on this whole Singaporeans vs foreigners thing, i am a foreign born who has been living in Singapore for close to 20 years. I speak Singlish just as my other friends, i served NS, I hold a Singaporean passport, I mingle with only Singaporeans and not with those from my birth country and yet, from time to time I still feel that I am not being truly accepted here.

"You are born in xxx-country? Why don't you go back one day?"
"See lah, you act exactly like you are from xxx-country"
"Singapore is not your country please. Your home is always where you are born in"

These are but some of the comments i receive from some of my friends and acquaintances from time to time, and sometimes it really hurts. Because I have always thought of Singapore as my home, and yet so many in Singapore do not see me as one of them. I feel lost sometimes, I feel as if I am neither here nor there, neither a true Singaporean nor a citizen of my birth country... :(

Allow me to share my story on the other side of the coin regarding Singaporeans vs. Foreigners.

I'm not currently studying in NUS, but I have quite a few friends who are. Personally I am studying in a university out in the UK, and as such to the locals there I am of the same identity as many of the foreign students who come here to Singapore to study. 

I did not go there on scholarships, neither am I being bonded to any agency anywhere. I thank my lucky stars that I am blessed with a stable family background that allows me to study overseas without any worries about student debt in future. And I'm definitely not one of those who throws money around overseas in university as though it's one 3-year long party. 

The way I see it, why people in many countries generally take a neutral-ambiguous-apathetic to hostile-xenophobic view towards foreigners in their midst is because of the inherent group mentalities between nationalities. Borders and identities are no less real in today's world, and even with globalisation we are more inclined to still divide ourselves into "us" and "them" for identity purposes. 

Having said so, I believe that one way every individual who travels overseas for extended periods be it to settle down or work there is to actively take time and effort to assimilate into local society. I chose my university location not just because it had the course I wanted to study, but also because the Asian student population there was relatively small compared to other bigger cities in the UK. My logic was simple: if I am to stay overseas in a foreign country for extended periods of time the last thing I want to do is to go there and surround myself with people of my same skin colour and language. It is not helpful to both sides of the immigration/foreigner-local narrative when people actively/passively encourage cultural and language bubbles to form for their own individual groups. 

In my year overseas so far I've deliberately kept interaction with Asians and Singaporeans to a minimum. And thanks to my bilingual education here, the immediate breaking of the English language barrier has proven to be a godsend for me. Now I can safely say I'm seen as "one of their own" by the local Brits and many of the International students who are not Asians. I count amongst my friends more Caucasians than people from Asia or Singapore. I can say that I have made the effort to assimilate and I have succeeded.

It is unfortunate that most of the problematic foreigner groups in Singapore choose to form insular societies here whereby they mix predominantly with their own kind and choose to continue to hold on to their own previous national identities. And all I can say is that till the day that individuals from any country, including our own, truly accept their role as guests in a foreign country such us-vs-them comparisons and misunderstandings will always exist. 

Too bad, most people have no ability to be a chameleon in the world. When faced with the powers that be who do not know how to put their country first and their people first, we can only but rely on ourselves and give up notions of nationality differences. After all, if globalisation is the wave of the present and future, what worth is it to call yourself a citizen of a certain country? 
-
 
Sometimes I want to mix with foreign students. But I can't speak their language well and English is not their fortitude. I am also afraid that they think that I am patronising them if I learn their language from the Internet.

So far those that have gone through Singapore education can communicate in English proficiently.

Not related to NUS. Just wanted to find a place to rant

What are your opinion on Low Kay Hwa?

This is what I think of him

Despite the amount of "likes" on his page, most than 90% of the likes are because people wanted to get update on the comedy that he copied from other website.

More than 50% of his status update are actually him "upping" his own post

Furthermore, he never respond his follower at all regardless of whether it is private message, post to him page or comment on his post.

In fact, he rarely actually contribute anything to his own page.

What do you all think?
-
 
  I am a foreigner. I think the bulk of the Singaporeans in NUS does not hate foreigners; most of them are indifferent and that could be due to the fact that they do not know how to interact with the foreigners.

I recently returned from a long overseas exchange and realized why that is a problem for many Singaporeans. Foreigners grow up in the different environment as to the locals. Thus, when you first arrived in the country, even if you speak English fluently, you do not speak Singlish. That's not the main point. More importantly, you speak on a different frequency to the locals. They do not find the jokes you think it's funny; you do not like the food they enjoy very much. You might want to go out and explore the country while they prefer to stay home and watch tv. All these nuances provided the gap for the locals wanting to be close friends to you, and it will be trying for both parties to talk to each other without constantly thinking "what should I say next?"

-
 
Stop the hoohah about xenophobia! If the dun adapt n treat this place like their stomping ground n do whatever they want. SORTIE!!!

N hey what is govt gonna do with those poor local chaps that have to slog studies n work part time to afford higher education. Freaking double standards! Yah foreign students are welcome cos they maintain standards but overfunding them is not! Especially when an equally deserving local student who already or a place can't study with a peace of mind.

Haven't you seen a fair bit of OP's waxing about their humble backgrounds? Don't u think they deserve some funding?
-
 
I personally have no issues with foreign scholars who make an effort to integrate themselves into our local culture (ie respect our way of living and not bring bad habits into our society) and also stay to make our country better after taking the scholarship. What irks me most are those proud foreign scholars who merely see us as a money tree and stepping stone (to pay for their fees and learn english) and scoot off without any contribution. Worse still, some even verbally insult us (just think back on those black sheep who called us pigs), or even view us as stupid for sponsoring their education and life in Singapore. No one likes selfish and proud individuals who merely use you for their own self-gains. I am sure this holds true for any person we meet in life be it your friends, etc. Therefore, don't single out and bash either sides. Foreign scholars have to make an effort and locals have to be gracious enough to also reach out. I have good friends who are foreign scholars who truly love Singapore, and I have acquaintances who make me disgusted when they insult my country and blatantly tell me this is a stepping stone for them to UK/US.

I am a foreign scholar. Regarding recent posts related to foreigners, I believe that there are more Singaporeans who are awarded scholarships and financial aids than foreigners. Even for admission, Singaporeans enjoy lower cut-off points compared to foreigners who have to fight among themselves so as to fill up the remaining 18-20% of the uni population. Besides, there are also different types of foreign students including scholarship holders, self-funded ones and those who are on tuition grants. There are not as many scholars as what you think. I understand that there are academically inclined Singaporean 'non-scholars' and yes, not-so-good foreign scholars; however, I just want to ask for an acceptance from the locals by telling my personal story. 

I came to SG and yes grew up here when I was a sec student...almost 10 years I guess...It was never easy for me to overcome my own shyness and integrate into the local culture, to try to speak your language and to understand your jokes. Since I was a little boy, I've been fully aware of the pressure exerted on a scholar who had to strive for excellence in order to gain respect from locals, who think that scholarships were only awarded to those who deserved! From someone who could hardly pronounce a single English word, I got straight As for my 'A' level with 2 H3 Distinctions and now on my way to graduate with 2 majors and 1 minor at NUS. I work really hard just to make sure that I deserve to enjoy your tax money, not saying "to be a scholar". If you just hate us because we are here to steal jobs and grades, please remember that it's not our fault as we are humans and we have to live too. For locals who know me well, I am very thankful for having you all as friends. For 10 years, I have always been hoping that locals and foreign talents will not have this kind of Cold War anymore...one day...

I've only just started reading my soci readings, and to my horror, it's impossibly difficult to interpret. In view of the stacks of readings to come, I come to the mighty NUSWhispers to seek advice:

If we swap position now. We come to Singapore without wasting 2 years serving national service, no need to have university debt (assume you are on scholarship), no need to have reservist which affect our career, still enjoy all the good stuffs and treated equally as citizen, how would you feel?

Yes, they are results of government policies, which is why they are losing support.

Why the fuck do I have to sacrifice some much when I receive the same treatment as non-citizen? "Fuck Singapore belongs to everyone", take a look at other developed countries such as Australia, US and their work visa. And if you want say xenophobic, I call it patriotism.
-
 
I'm pretty much in support of the OP of  and . As a student contemplating graduate studies abroad, I don't really agree with the hostility we're directing towards international students, particularly when I don't want to be be on the receiving end of that elsewhere. Put yourself in their shoes - Would you like to be seen as a parasite just because you decided to learn elsewhere and broaden your horizons? And what if you have difficulty securing the means to study overseas without a scholarship? Wouldn't you want to look for scholarships offered by foreign universities (even governments)? Are we so xenophobic now that we hate everyone else in the world just because they're not 'one of us'? Definitely, definitely don't agree with that. Xenophobia is on the rise all across the world again, and that's a crying shame. Just look at the policies that are slamming down in the UK now, much less the increasing xenophobia in Australia, Europe, and the US. We should be breaking down borders these days, not building it up.

Essentially, it's just a simple matter of reciprocity, I feel. If you want to be treated with respect when overseas, why wouldn't you treat people with respect while they're here? Regardless of what they are like (and admittedly, some are less than pleasant--I'm sure we can all call to mind the relevant incidents, as blown out of proportion as some of them might be--, but that can also be said of our overseas students.), they're still people, and deserve to be treated as such. I for one am glad that they're here and raising the profile of NUS. Not only do they help boost us up the rankings (research alone does not make us a world-leading university), but they give us so many new experiences and worldviews while they're here too. You can't quantify things like that. I am reluctant to even call them 'benefits' because that risks a sort of objectification.

Even if you are willing to be treated appallingly in another country for the sake of your degree and that it isn't a big deal to you, I'm still not convinced by arguments that the 'their country their rules' argument is at all well-grounded. We're living in the 21st century, with all the benefits that provides. Primarily, it's a time when we can travel and still keep in contact with our loved ones, a time when heading out to search for work isn't the complete and utter uprooting of our lives as we know it. We can go anywhere and it's not a big deal for us anymore. Some of us will want to study elsewhere for a while. Why should that be penalised? So if the boundaries are more permeable than they've ever been, why should we employ such a knee-jerk and static response of 'foreignness' to it? Sure, local taxpayers put money into the area and should enjoy more privileges that foreigners don't because of it, but it's not like they don't bring money in and spend it here while they're here. We shouldn't be bitter or in any way unhappy about them receiving scholarships and/or the tuition grant, because they bring so much with them, and we have as many opportunities as they do to go elsewhere too. Ultimately, I hope that we've reached the stage where we can be a bit more moderate and welcoming in our response towards foreign students. As the OP pointed out, blaming them for government policy isn't exactly cool, and in the first place, maybe it isn't that bad a policy at all.

tldr; can be mature and rational adults ornot, guise?

I'm the OP of . Honestly, didn't expect so many responses!
Some of my closest friends are Singaporeans. I make an effort to mingle with everyone, and don't stick with a group of my own country people. 
 
I think we've all seen a pretty good example of the xenophobia us foreigners are subjected to; the comments and responses on this page prove so. I don't face racism everyday, but when I do, it hurts. 

I'm a scholarship holder too. Go ahead, sue me, but my parents don't have enough money to finance an education abroad. If you all didn't know yet, the tuition fee for international students is DOUBLE that of Singaporeans. So yes, if you're coming from a poor family, it gets quite difficult. 

Whatever I've done and whatever I've achieved is due to my own hard work. We're not having an easy time in university, we're working hard too, to get the grades we deserve.
Plus, you're forgetting the 3-6 year bond that comes attached with any govt. scholarship. We don't have the freedom to do what we want to do later. Imagine wanting to go for higher studies later in a university you're getting a scholarship to, but having to pass up the offer because MOE rejected bond deferment.

Imagine this now- you have to live for (upto) 10 years in a country where you're made to not feel welcome. How would you feel?

It's not our fault that the government is making such policies. Instead of directing your hate to us, you should direct it towards the people responsible for these policies. 

A little acceptance is all I ask for.

The concept of nice guys finish last is by far contradictory and immensely flawed. The notion of “nice” is fallacious if it does not contain genuineness. If the underlying reason of displaying excessive helpfulness and concern over a girl’s wellbeing is to ultimately satisfy your sexual desire, then “artful” is probably a better adjective for you. Or if you insist that your love for your partner is absolutely sound and that your niceness will not dwindle over the years, then moving on will be the best option. Being rejected by a girl should not give you an excuse to “turn bad” just so you could hungrily hunt down the next girl in line. That itself proves you are not mature enough to love.

Relationships are built on so much more than just being nice. It requires attention, compatibility, and nurturing. It is not meant to be forced, and will come at the right moment. In the meantime, I recommend you dedicate your time to more pressing issues and perhaps some self-improvement. 

I am in love with a nice guy. He has neither looks, body or money. But he is genuine, responsible, organized, intelligent, sensible, mature and most important of all, he makes me feel loved every single day. Why would I choose a bad guy over him? It just doesn’t make sense.

Obvious IBs are obvious.

I think one of the key tasks of the government has to be to make basic amenities (food, transport, healthcare, utilities etc.) affordable to all classes of citizens, before even mentioning the quality of those amenities. Though you mention students and the needy, there are whole spectrums of people not covered in those 2 categories, who will be severely impacted by such frequent raises, such as the lower middle income group. You would increase their burden further, and force them into poverty? Or are you saying you would have the wealthy bear the burden of that raised fare? That wouldn't quite work either would it? Since they don't take public transport.

If I recall (and business majors do correct me if I'm wrong), businesses will only pay any individual employee a certain salary if they are certain these employees are able to bring a far larger amount back to the company in profits. Have our ministers really made contributions worth so much? While I'm not saying that all the decisions made by our ministers are of no value - they have contributed to the sustained growth of SG, even through recession - there are a fair amount of screw ups in a large number of areas (Urban Planning, Transport, to name the obvious). And as many have mentioned, do they really do so much better, so much more than those in equivalent positions in other countries? I think not.

No, SMRT needs to stop paying (so much) dividends, stop paying high salaries to those who fail to make beneficial decisions to both the organisation and the common folk, and instead pour those funds into employing more engineers (foreign if need be) or getting new gear, and get those problems resolved. (I should also say that I think that it's stupid to fine SMRT when they actually need money to solve their problems - how bout helping them out instead). In the same vein, rather than trying to increase the government budget by things like ERP, Park parking fares, CPF minimum sum, the ministers can take a cut (they could show some actual remorse no? rather than just express concern), and use those funds do whatever it is they are trying to do. 

The ruling party has the expertise, but as far as I've observed, they are no longer the representatives of the people, each only furthering their own, or the party's agenda. Mark my words, they will still be in power come next election, but only because we have no choice. And because of that, the next 50 years will be a long long road...

I find Dr. Chee Soon Juan (a former NUS lecturer) to be inspiring. He suffered much ordeal yet continue to persist on. From his articles, he is an intellect at heart.

To be honest about changes in school policies and other school matters there needs to be more transparency; the justifications and reasoning.

 However we have to understand that first time rollout of the policy will not be perfectly implemented. Feedback needs to be provided in order to have a better idea of editing the policy so that all parties are more satissfied / less dissatisfied. 

For those exempt from modules, or those who have taken summer progs/online classes, perhaps someone could email the relevant parties and voice out your concerns on 18mc thingy

WRT    
I think those commenters who support NUSSU should rethink their words, its AS IF they come from a place of privilege. 
I believe NUSSU can go further than just simply getting more companies to open shop in NU and things like bus routes. Shouldn't NUSSU also represent the student body in academic matters and open up conversations with NUS academic authorities over academic matters that the students are actually concerned about?

Its like a superficial way to placate the students when the thing that we are really concerned about is the academic atmosphere. 

Please. NUSSU, please look further than just the physical environment. Campaign and represent the student body in academic matters.

The General Elections are coming and I am voting for the first time in my life. My parents have been trying to brainwash me to vote for a particular political party. I told them that we Singaporeans should be more self-reliant, be more entrepreneurial and take care of ourselves rather than relying too heavily on politicians to set the direction of our country and to safeguard our well-being. I emphasize on the need that regardless of whosoever is in power, we must be able to adapt to the situation and find our own path to success. Then my mother said I am too ambitious, stubborn and unrealistic. Am I really being too unrealistic, or am I being too realistic such that my mother find it hard to accept? :P

Hey fellow schoolmates, I have burning question to ask...

How many of you are apathetic towards political issues? I have the impression that most young people here are kinda YOLO until something strikes them really hard, a family / personal crisis, some hardship will make you wake up and really spur you to know how your 1 vote could affect you.

I guess most of us first time voters will be influenced by our parents opinions, or at least from the people around us, our socio-economic status, and even to how brainwashed we are by all the pro-establishment national education since primary school.

Will y'all vote for change, or to vote to express your deep-seated anger, or just vote to keep the status quo, whether you can't be bothered or even satisfied or feeling gratuitous towards the current establishment. At the end of the day, our vote still matters bcos our choice of govt will affect how our country will turn out (even if it's just for the next 5 years).

and I'm kinda anti-establishment BTW. Happy SG 50 too! Please do have more babies too cos true-blue born n bred Singaporeans are an ageing, extinct species, our cohort is the last biggest cohort (if you look at the stats reports).

A sad tragedy that could have easily been prevented. For those of you who are facing overwhelming pressure from your parents to succeed, remember to take a step back and remind yourselves that sometimes your parent's expectations can be unreasonable and it is not the end of the world if you cannot meet them. Rather, just do your best and set realistic goals for yourself to meet. Push yourself to succeed, but only because you want to, and not because your parents want you to. And above all remember that your parents are human and they make mistakes too. You are not a disappointment if you cannot meet your parent's expectations.

Listening to opposition mp's speeches in parliament, I don't see why they're such a big deal. Those are words even I could have said myself. I mean it's so easy to just sit there and criticise policies, but much harder to be the one creating and implementing them. For example they have been criticising the population white paper, but I really can't see them writing a white paper themselves from scratch, only critique the white paper written by someone else. By the way, the current population white paper has always been a blueprint, not an actual plan, one which envisions a scenario where our population hits 6.9, and what we should do to manage that. It has never been a deliberate plan to increase our population size to 6.9. We obviously have to improve and increase the capacity of our infrastructure first before doing so. And guess what, I've hardly heard the opposition giving viable suggestions on how to improve and increase the capacity of our infrastructure. All along they have just been saying, "we don't agree with the white paper. period," which is honestly disappointing.

That being said, if alternative voices are necessary in parliament (which I agree with), I do believe putting just one member from each opposition party in parliament is enough. Simply put, those members represent their respective parties to critique the policies that the pap introduce. Isn't that more productive than having two or more people from the same party doing the same job of criticising policies?

I hate it when other people bring me down and I cannot say anything to defend myself. Just because I am less expressive does not mean I am weak. Does it make you feel good to bring other people down? Can't wait to cut you out of my life so that I could be  a happier person.

During the holidays, I spend quite a long time on decoupling. At the same time, I discovered that the idea of decoupling can be applied to everyday lives. So I devised a theory called 'social decoupling' to tackle life issues. The goal of social decoupling is to stop the behaviour of others from affecting our lives. We need to understand that this is a process of making things to be less dependent from each other.

Here are some principles:
(1) Keep failures isolated in it's own domain. If you fail in academic studies, keep it there. If you fail in sports, keep it there. See each domain as discretely as possible.

(2) Very important to keep them independent from each other. If you do that, you can concentrate on fixing the problem if you wish to.

(3) Aim to avoid calling others outside your social circle for help. If you asked for help, make sure it is not critically enough that rejection will make a huge blow on you. Follow principle (1) and (2).

by now we all know that elections are coming up, and as savvy internet users i guess most of us even realize that the society of mute & deaf even created a hand sign to represent "Lee Kuan Yew". So, clearly, we are all gonna hear lots of stuff about him, about continuing his legacy, and how we should continue to vote for the correct people.

but among these LKY and all inspiring speeches, i cant help but wonder: continually saying how well we've done in the past is like driving by looking at the rear mirror, and it's not just looking back, but reaffirming that driving without looking forward is 'ok' because there have been no accidents yet. 

as a famous guy in white once said: what do you think?

Tracking the GE story as it rumbles along.. The redrawing of the electoral boundaries, announcing of new candidates, all parties suddenly appearing on the ground, parties shooting each other..

I am apprehensive about WP and their methods, however I feel that it is the fear of change that certain supporters are afraid of. PAP has done a decent job, could be better. I will like more opposition in Parliament to challenge the incumbent 
The question many people are asking is: "Can WP do perform as well or better if they come into power?"

My question is: If WP come into power, who is going to be the new PM?? I cannot imagine any of the WP leaders being the new face of Singapore and attempting to build bilateral ties. Imagine Low Thia Khiang heading to the White House to meet the US President...

Just a thought. What do you guys think? #nohate

I have started to realise that the baby boomer generation had it better than the later ones. True they had it bad in their childhood but beyond that is generally improvements after improvements. They had more job opportunities, a chance to own landed properties if they are willing to work hard. My generation generally face an uphill battle in most aspects of life unless one has rich and powerful parents. Social mobility is less flexible now

I'm a CS major. Have been hearing people around me (some of them are profs) talking about "there are many paths to success" or "those successful people usually have the following traits" these sort of things.

Honestly do you have any idea what "success" means? Working at Google, Facebook, or other big-names? Earning a lot of money? Owning a start-up? Or even having found the right person, giving birth to a baby, and spending the rest of your life (happily or otherwise) until you die?

I don't know. For me I don't really want to get married (I also don't know why). So it seems like life after graduation, for me, would be to work, work, and work. After some years my parents would pressure on me and ask me to find someone to spend my life with, which I obviously don't want. So I will work, work, and work, and wait for myself to die.

I don't know what I'm living for; maybe I'll go for a PhD then.

With reference to 

Hello, my first reaction to your confession was deep compassion and empathy. I know how you feel because I have experienced the same thing. 

I ask that you do not believe that you are inferior because this belief will bring nothing but mediocrity and the confirmation of everything that you do not want for your life. Your degree is not a revelation of your worth. I wish you knew how important you are. We all struggle with judgment from others, especially those who are important to us. We struggle with self-doubt. We struggle with fatigue from soldiering on. And perhaps the biggest struggle is whether the doubters are right.

I want you to believe that we are each an offer to the world. We each bring an offer that we expect ourselves to fulfill for the people whom we extend that offer to. I'm sorry that your parents made you feel that your achievements are worthless compared to theirs. Even though I know nothing about you, trust me, you are enough and that is all you need to be because from your words, there's a profoundly deep desire to be acknowledged and trusted for the offer you bring.

I hate that I get compared to my successful siblings and relatives of whom a majority are in one of two professions: medicine or law. I'm in social sciences. My parents never fail to make me feel like shit... They always ask why I am not as smart or as successful as the rest over dinner tables and family events. Makes me stressed out that my achievements are nothing as compared to theirs. :(

I find the 'TLDR' culture appalling.

Post 90s kids are better educated and had easier access to information via smartphone/internet, but some of their understanding is quite lacking in conversations. 

The reason might be due to a lack life experience or the new syllabus of teach less, learn more. 

Alot of them duno alot of historical events or got white washed to believe the sanitised version.....
-
 
With reference to the comments towards , 

I think what the OP meant was that youth/teenagers these days are overwhelmed by and hence apathetic towards information that they cannot be bothered to verify and make sense of. 

I'm pretty sure that 'historical events' and 'sanitised version' could be better phrased so there's really no need to nitpick OP's grammar, clarity of expression (besides making yourself feel intellectually superior). 

I agree with OP that many teenagers and young people these days are ill-informed. I don't think OP meant that we should read 'every pointless shite' - this is an false dichotomy. You don't have to read everything but you don't have to show apathy ('TLDR') to these issues and dismiss them as unimportant either. There are others who are deeply concerned and affected by some issues.

Information is fundamental to argument and discourse. And the foundational purpose of argument and discourse is tied to interests. It is perhaps the surest way forward we have as a tool to make sense of a world dominated by a species that are completely driven by perspectives ... and the quality of those perspectives determine the fate of the rest of us.

On a side note, just because information is freely available does not mean that information is used appropriately and wisely. In the same way, even if someone had billions of dollars, it does not mean that he would use his money wisely. 

'How do you know, what you know, is not altered in different ways too?'

I'm not the OP but I know what I know is altered by my experiences. That is precisely why I don't engage in this sort of 'TLDR' behaviour because it shuts out different perspectives. I doubt calling someone a 'joke' helps to widen your perspective either. 

'TLDR' is not a sign of neutrality. It is a declaration of inevitability that I promise will extend to more spheres that merely the ones you choose to ignore. 

I do not know about you but I would like to think that the human race is capable of far more compelling arguments than, I don't care simply because I don't have to or I dismiss simply because I can.

I've noticed that recently there's a couple of posts complaining about how people judge them. People judge, okay? You complaining lot also pass judgement onto others. I don't think, nor have came across anyone who don't judge others in one way or another.
Either you change your current state, or embrace it. What good does complaining do? Those comforting words people hand out to you won't stop others' judgement now would it?

P.S. (from Louis c.k.) People like to say things like 'There's someone for everyone'. NOPE. Not at all true. And stop saying it because it's mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there whom we've all unanimously decided that they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the *lips* even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it and then they die.

Breaks my heart to see frail old ladies clearing trays at food centres, hunched-back and hobbling. 
Makes me think back to Tan Chuan Jin's remark about the elderly collecting cardboards as as a form of 'exercise'.
This is a classic example of "If you have nothing intelligent or useful to say, then best to just shut the fuck up."
It's mind-boggling how out-of-touch and deluded the ruling party is with the common folk like us while they sit on their thrones and fat paychecks. 
SG50 and impressive SEA Games medal tally my ass, don't even dare to boat about our first-world status and development when you as a government can't even get your fundamentals as moral human beings right.

My father is extremely controlling. My siblings and I have no say in the house. Every time we try to voice our opinion, my father shuts us up in a very harsh manner (when we were younger he'd ban us from going out and take away our phones). Whatever he says counts. He is so controlling that he even decides the things my mother wears - how many pieces of clothing, where each item goes, the size of each item... he just wants to be in absolute control. It is extremely frustrating.

But recently, there is a change. I think father senses our displeasure, and he seems to be trying to mend things. My mother's birthday is coming and father has been extremely nice to us. He bought a lot of things for my 3 siblings and I. He also keeps reminding us of the times he was kind to us. He's even planning to throw a super big birthday party for mother. 

Should I forgive my father for the times he was demanding? But I am scared that when mother's birthday is over and we all forgive him, he will go back to his old ways.

I come from a fragmented family. My father used to have only 4 children. We were poor back then and all of the children worked very hard to help my father. Our family became prosperous and we moved into a condo. 
Soon after that, my father brought a new mother and we had new siblings. Initially we were sad and told our father that we didn't need to have more siblings. He didn't listen to us and married another wife soon and had more kids. With more siblings, there were less time for us to spend with him. 
Recently, he told us that we form the most important core of the family and that our future was not to be worried. Should I listen to him?

With regards to the evolution/Social Darwinist thing, here's an interesting article- http://aeon.co/magazine/science/why-its-time-to-lay-the-selfish-gene-to-rest/ 

The essence of the article (to quote the article itself)- 'First, an organism adapts to a changing environment by altering its gene expression to change its phenotype — its form or behaviour. Second, a gene emerges that locks in that phenotypic change. Finally, the gene spreads through the population.'

If we apply this to humans (and assuming intelligence is dependent solely upon genetics) traditional notions that people such as LKY had would be wrong. 'Smart' people do not necessarily give rise to 'smart' progeny, and 'dumb' people do not give rise to 'dumb' progeny. A person born to 'dumb' parents, given the right environment, could pass on a gene that locks in greater expression of intelligence. A person born to 'smart' parents, if s/he grows up in an environment where he/she does not have to express much intelligence, could pass on a gene that locks in suppressed expression of intelligence. Also, things like IQ tests are foolish endeavors because the parameters they supposedly monitor will definitely change over time.  

tl;dr: if you come from dumb/poor parents, and are dumb yourself- apply yourself more; your kids could be smarter than you and you could become smarter too. if you come from smart/rich parents but are lazy af- you're literally destroying your advantage of good genes.

When people use the word 'Darwinism' or 'Survival of the fittest', do they know what they really mean?

It upsets me that alot of smart people are not studying the words that they use properly. A trip to the library or a search on the net can easily shoe what are your prejudices.

Social Darwinism is a pseudoscience that is practiced based on prejudices like racist, sexism, elitism and so on.
-
 
 Indeed. Don't be struck with textbook version Evolutionary theory. The field of inquiry have grown since 19th century. Check the works by Denis Noble where he criticizes genetic determinism and reductionistic biology.

As for Social Darwinism, if you make an effort to study History, you can see some roots of origin. In Ancient, there is hardly any social mobility. The children from the Noble class will inherit their power and wealth from their family regardless of whether they are capable or not. As the social hierarchy changes, how do we make a distinction and allocate people to their positions in the society to avoid over-competition?

One method of making distinction is to use Math. It's so much easier to use Math skills as a distinction in our society. There are clear answers to see whether one can make it or not. Most people will not need to use high level of mathematics in their jobs except the specialists, but our society still uses this method to distinguish people.

We use math as an IQ test to classify people. In the next era, I see that algorithmic skills will be used as an IQ test to classify people. The goals of Education today is so much different from the goals of  Education in the Ancient days where Virtue and Wisdom is emphasized. Compare today's education curriculum to Plato's, Aristotle's and the Renaissance's Liberal Arts education. 

Hence there is a need for self-education since Education is not delivering what we need after we leave school. Seeking wisdom is important especially when the complexity of society is increasing. Having mathematical skills is not sufficient. We nearly destroyed ourselves with Nuclear weapons during the Cold War. We have intelligent people who can build Nuclear weapons but cannot see the danger of what they are building.

I will teach children not only coding/math skills, but also to see the meta-levels of what they are doing. In the Ancient, being able to see the meta-levels is called Wisdom.

I don't get what the big fuss is about this whole "I didn't get to take CS3216/17". I applied, but I didn't get it either. But hey, what the hell, just because one door closes doesn't mean there're no paths left to your end goal. Seriously, people need to stop being so self-entitled and stop whining about why they have to take a different path. Some people don't even have the opportunities we have. Sorry to the previous OP but I'm on Prof Ben's side for this one.

It's strange but I always feel very disappointed after watching local TV programmes. My parents insist on watching the 5 show and Tanglin. I find it all so contrived and silly. Some of it is so awkwardly executed that I feel like leaving the room in embarrassment. 
It really seems to me to be a forced attempt to come across as cosmopolitan and modernised. So much so it borders on the unrealistic and ludicrous. Take 5 show for example, the way the hosts deliver their dialogues is so artificial and unlike regular conversation. The lady not so bad one, but the En Lai guy is horrid. He is great as a comedian in shows like the Noose, but in real life that accent he puts on and the artificial way he behaves makes him look like some of the characters he has himself made fun of in the past. His accent is a mishmash of British, American and dunno what. I'm not saying we should all talk Singlish to give an "accurate" representation of reality, but just talk in a natural way that is clear and easy to understand. No need to put on anything.
And when they have experts on certain topics, he keeps interrupting them trying to act cute. 
And then Tanglin. Oh god. Older actors are somewhat believable. Younger ones are painful. The whole thing looks like a school drama with low production values. The acting is just terrible. I've literally seen my school theatre productions with better actors. 
I'm no film expert, but I believe the problem is that these shows don't display people behaving in a real, believable ways. I don't mean plot lines being realistic, I mean the bearing of the people on TV. That is why the non-English language channel programmes are better to watch (Suria, U, Vasantham), or the non-entertainment (CNA and the channel 5 news) or western media is better to watch. There is no artifice and desire to come across in a certain way. It would be better if they didn't try so hard to seem modern, and perhaps western. 
Phew, sorry for the rant. Just sat through an hour of quality local programming with my parents who are ardent fans of MediaCorp.

To 

I somewhat agree. But some channel 8 dramas are actually quite interesting. For instance the one with Christopher lee and rui en called against the tide. I like the plots though somehow I knew and saw the plots somewhere. 

Other than that, I agree that foreign dramas are somewhat of higher quality. I like american dramas like Scandal, Forever, and Madam Secretary. Also I like hongkong dramas in the sense cos they can make a lot of stories from a single idea. That's why I always look forward to hk dramas on channel u. 

I believe channel 5 has its own issues with accents always and language. Cos it is an eng channel so they can't really use authentic Singlish to present information. It would be deemed inappropriate by some.

I’ve been out of medical school for approx. five years now. It still feels like the worst thing in the world when I’ve to tell someone that their loved one is dead. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to it. I still remember the faces of each one - especially the first case I had of a young man who lost his mum to cancer - that I’ve had to deliver this news to. It’s horrible. Funnily enough, when I graduated from medschool, I felt like God. Experience, however, has greatly humbled me and made me  more aware of how limited my abilities are. Sometimes I think this job is not for me.

Aiyo you all so stress about cross-cultural relationships relek ah. I tell you, if you want it to work out just work at it. 

Parents are mostly reasonable. If your partner is genuinely nice, their hearts will melt over time. Just keep making the effort and let them know you for who you are and they will eventually see you as a person and race/culture/religion wont be a problem in the long run (:

-from one half of a couple where one is from a muslim family, the other from a christian family. And yes, both sides parents have finally accepted the relationship and are happy with it

This is in reference to   . OP seems sincere enough so i dun understand the negativity of some comments. By miss j in particular. I'm 27 and met my wife 4 years ago on a dating site. We are now happily married and expecting our first child. Are you saying our relationship is built on something disgusting?  Maybe OP has been nice and a good person but just not met anyone for him yet. Is it so wrong to date first? Before i met my wife, i had only ever been in  1 relationship with someone i met first as friends and she turned out to be verbally abusive and selfish. I don't see you commenting on the posts about cheaters, which clearly is disgusting. I don't know OP, he may be a nice and good guy, he may not be. But all i know is this isnt disgusting. Maybe he just hasn't met anyone suitable so far and someone here may be the suitable one and neither will know unless they give him a chance. With all the recent talk about freedom to love and all, you need to grow up if you think dating first is disgusting.

I think it is true to say that most Singaporean and Malaysian parents stereotype Chinese girls from Mainland. One of the most obvious reasons is that some poor Chinese girls are escorts/prostitutes in Singapore and Malaysia for the past few decades. This inevitably forms a bad impression in old generation. 

I have a Chinese female friend who has been attaching to a Singaporean guy for 1 year and yet they have not revealed their relationship to the guy's parents. To be perfectly honest, I have crushed on the Chinese girl and I think it is irresponsible for a guy to keep a relationship while he cannot guarantee her a future. According to her, her obedient boyfriend tries to keep her and his parents in touch so that they would find out what kind a person she is. The question is how long should it keep going ?

I don't think her boyfriend her good enough.  I am struggling whether I should chase her as I think it is not fully morally accepted. Chasing her simply means I want her break up. 
So, sometime I even plan to confess and let her refuse me so that I wouldn't have second thought.  

To help her succeed in bonding relationship with her boyfriend's parents, I even gave her some advice. For instance, it is very common for parents to think their children are superior than others. So I told her she needs to shape her image, like "So ask you boyfriend say good things about you all the times in front of his parents";"Buy small gifts to their parents"; "When it is necessary, even ask him to devalue himself, so that his parents would think you are  better than their son and accept you more easily." But, this guy has low a IQ as he did not know how to filter information. 

***********************************************
I points I want to make here are:

(a) Please do not stereotype any person based on your past experience and the group he or she belongs to. They are different individuals after all.  

(b) It is our responsibility to guide our parents, relatives, and friends to step out from this stereotyping zone. Parents will feel stressed as well when their relatives know the nationality of their potential son's wife. So help them clarify and make a unbiased, well-informed judgement.  

 (c) (I have not thought what yet...... )

I hate it when people I barely know shout, “EH MELAYUUUUU!”, in public or be all surprised when they learn that I’m in one of the “most sought after faculty stamped with smiles and nods of approvals by many Asian parents.” What, you think I’m Malay, I’m not smart enough to be in my faculty? That I didn’t work my ass off in JC? Statistically, I admit that I’m in the minority, but when people have this look of disbelief (and it’s very obvious, I can read facial expressions very well), it comes off as offensive.

Everyday, I’m thankful to be in school and to be learning from very amazing professors. Alhamdullilah, I’m blessed with many good people in my life: from overworked neighbourhood school teachers who believed in me and saw a rough diamond in the making during a time when I felt unworthy as a person, friends who encouraged me to be at least 1% better each day and parents who worked hard as mee soto sellers in a primary school to put me through my education and afford me opportunities to go overseas (via ODAC) when they themselves have not been out of Singapore. 

This will remain an anonymous rant because I’m truly a polite person in real life. I don’t tell off people and hate  pointing things out. I believe people are capable of self-reflection. My best friend, a Chinese guy I met in army, agrees I’m too nice and even joked that I should hire him to be an asshole on my behalf. I urge that everyone be sensitive in your words. I’m not advocating for you to be politically correct. Call out if you must, but only for the right reasons. I know that most people don’t mean offence (it’s really the product of society), but it comes across condescending and offensive. Please look at the content of my characters and not the stereotypes you’ve of me.

It can be very easy to fish out a person's character - be screwed up, be weird, and don't do very well academically. 

Then you can see people who are friends because of:
1) utility purposes
2) common interests
3) common culture
4) objective motivations
5) there is an applied formula to it (no kidding)
6) status standards (level of wealth, knowledge, etc.)

You can also see all the pride, selfishness, ego and stubbornness in others coming out by the way they treat you, and by observing the ways they treat others - because when you behave in a stupid manner, and when your grades are not that good, it warrants, in majority of the population, a not-so-amicable behaviour. The reasoning they give, etc., will be used against you, but not amongst themselves. There is nothing wrong with it.

They will never notice that there are actually people observing and reading them, their body languages and all, and when you actually behave differently to become more natural, they will insist that you should not, because it is out of their expectations of your character. 

They don't see that I cannot behave in an odd, screwed up manner all the time - it gets tiring every once in a while.

Yes, I am a hell of a bitter person, with a hell lot of pride and ego issues, but if you can make it past everything, past through the layers of protection I put up, I can promise you, you will always have my best, because you've been through my worse. You deserve it.

If you do treat me in a screwed-up way, hey, the fault's not on you. I deserved it.

Does anyone have any opinion/advice on this?

For two years, I’ve worked part-time as a front desk CSO at one of the telcos. It doesn’t pay much as teaching tuition, but I like my job lah. I know that sounds weird because most people would run away when they hear customer service. I personally find it a challenge. Interacting with customers and negotiating a fair agreement are two aspects I find most fulfilling. It's fucking orgasmic when you're able to negotiate in favour of the business.

Today, a customer came in, acting all mighty and demanded I waive charges for exceeding his local data by at least an additional 2 GB. He claimed he didn’t use it. When I told him I couldn’t do that, he started being MORE verbally abusive. I eventually brought in my manager to resolve the situation when I assessed there was no longer room for mutual respect and negotiation.

While my manager worked hard to resolve the dispute, another customer came with the same request (only thing that differed was that this customer exceeded his limit by approx. 200mb). I gave him an immediate waiver. Why? He was polite and incredibly sweet. I’m a straight dude and even I fell for his nice, gentlemanly nature of his words and behaviour. The previous customer saw this and asked why the waiver didn't apply to him.

Because I was trained to be politically correct and “service-oriented”, I explained to him that the other customer only exceeded by a fair bit, unlike his case.

The truth is… even though I could (I've gained enough seniority in the work to have a bit of leeway), I just didn’t wanna waive the charges for him because he was being an… ASSHOLE. :) It felt pretty good though to deny him the waiver. Mwahahaha! 

Anyway dear NUS peers, I'm sure you all are a nice bunch! But if I may, just a reminder yah, please treat your CSOs (regardless of industry) like a fellow human being and with mutual respect. Don’t be a cheebye lah in your negotiations. Trust me, we want to avoid disputes too. It reflects badly on our staff records. You think we like being scolded? You think we like having cases drag on for weeks with no resolution in sight? Just by being nice and respectful to a fellow human being will, in most cases, get you what you want because at end of day, we also want to pang kang and will give in to you one if we got the power one (and often the case, we do, just a matter of are we arsed enough to give in to you or not). 

Ok, I shall end my nagging liao. Selamat hari raya to all my malay friends!!! I'm quite happy because for the first time ever, I got invited to go raya visit this Sunday! Woohoo rendang! Pineapple tarts! Shiokkk! Noob qns: (1) As a guest, do I need to bring anything or not ah when raya visiting? (2) Got dress code not ah? I usually wear shorts at CNY but dunno if appropriate at raya.

1. No, you do not tell your mother. Don't make her worry when she's got enough to handle. If you're good at the casino, continue doing it. Only use your winnings to play. If you've lost all, stop immediately. In the meantime, find a proper job.

2. This is a dangerous fire you're playing with. Rule number one of hiring such services : Never fall in love. If you did, then you have my condolences. People involved in such services want easy money to solve their myraid of problems : family debt, personal debt, excessive shopping etc

Unfortunately, you are a nice bait to them. You have the potential to earn big money from casinos and that is perhaps what she is after. If she sticks by you when you're down and out, then post here. Till today, I havent heard of stories which has a happy ending like that in the movie '' Pretty Woman ''.

Anyway you can test her by asking if you could stop paying for her services and act like what real gf/bf do: Going on dutch. 

Take care stranger.

Ok, one "going-to-hell" confession coming up. It makes me feel weird to see ugly pregnant women. And before anyone gets on my back about how pregnancy takes a toll on the body, I'll say that I'm well aware of that fact and am in fact commenting on their pre-existing. physical features. My point is, I find it extremely odd that something that unsexy, could have had sex. 
Aside from this initial childish thought, I came to realize that we all perceive sexuality through only our own mindset. There is an extremely wide field of sexual preferences, "turn-ons" and fetishes. I'm not talking about orientation, I'm talking about guys who like big women, people with foot fetishes, ugly people being into other ugly people and the fact that I as an individual can perceive certain other individuals to be ugly, or sexually unappealing. 
How much of this is nature and how much of this is nurture? What causes sexual attraction at all? 
I had this thought that most of the time even ugly guys don't wanna bang ugly chicks, but they do cause, well you know... who else is gonna do it. 
That sounded terrible, but my next question is actually what is the line separating perception of beauty and sexual desire. (You can always put a paper bag over her head). 
Maybe I'll go read some of Freud's essays or something. I'm suddenly confronted by a bunch of these mysteries. 

* for the record, I'm not some fat, male chauvinist douchebag, I'm a 20 year old girl who has too much time on her hands and stares at people too much on public transport.

We often assume that our senses give us direct access to the World. But what is going is that we mentally synthesize all these experiences into a coherent fashion that we can understand. Therefore, every time someone brags about being a 'realist', I cringe because every realist must be an idealist first.

There is a fundamental rule I keep to in dealing with people. That is, no matter what we do, never hurt the innocent under our charge.

However, who used to be a fairly decent friend has decided to turn his/her back against me and now has made life extremely difficult for multiple otherwise innocent parties around me. If it's me you're looking for, come at me directly. Don't you ever hurt or give trouble to the innocent, simply because you now have a motley crew. Actually, knowing why said friend turned his/her back is not difficult to understand.

It may also have been a lesson in trust that even the close can betray you. I will still hold on to a Chinese value that some of these decisions are "merely business", so I won't hold that against you. But since we are now in "business", we will set personal feelings aside and play this game out. That also means I will not remember any personal association if you want to make use of the middle-men around to hurt the people I care for.

But that's life. Sometimes there are games that are twisted, but you have to play them simply because it is not your game, but the results have to be accountable to someone else.

Just curious. Suppose we can never know what reality is. Our experience of reality is what appears to us. So I wonder whether watching too much Korean/Taiwanese dramas makes us hold their particular values about what is beauty? In other words, our values of what beauty is is ideological rather than darwinianistic.

I think alot of singles are suffering from what Sartre calls 'Bad Faith' but choosing not to choose is also a choice. Learn to take responsibilities in your life. Sure there are facticities which you can't change. But stop pushing the blame to these facticities.

Can't comment because well, cold turkey. Yep, can't heat it up. Oven ain't working either. The non-fb site is probably the only site I have around. Anyway...

 Well, that's a very practical view. I don't see anything wrong with it, and I don't see the need to condemn you for it -  you're simply prioritising your family, after all, and your view on nationalism is actually... Very sensible.

I guess we do have different perspectives, so here's mine, if you're interested. 

We simply have different priorities. I don't love the flag, that's for sure. No point, love the flag got money drop down from heaven arh? No what,right?? So love the flag for what.

However, I will fight when the time comes. Not because it's right, not because I'm patriotic, but ehh... You have to admit, no matter how shitty this country is, it's still quite good if you manage to see it differently. 
Food expensive? Ehh everyone also... food expensive. 
Weird politics? Ehh everyone also weird politics. 
Durians??? Ehh, of course lah, not everyone durians, but we also... Durians!!! 榴莲榴莲莲榴莲~ *dances with durians

Point of the matter being, I do believe that the concept of Singapore is not defined by its economy, or nationalism alone. It is largely defined by the community it has here (if you'ld been at LKY's funeral, you'ld understand why). I will fight to protect this community...

Or you can take my other excuse. I am just too lazy, and too poor to move to another country. 

Whichever points to the fact that somehow, it'll still make as much sense that someone is willing to sit here, and sink, or swim, with the country.

Is being poly-amorous a legitimate thing? It seems like a fancy word to give to somebody who likes playing the field and doesn't want to commit to a real relationship. Are there any people out here who are poly-amorous and can claim to have a clear conscience despite having multiple partners?
(note: I do not refer to polygamy as practiced by certain religions. I'm talking about dating several people at once, with all those people being well aware of the fact. Either way, I gotta say: that shit cray)

If an inexperienced jobholder gets enough opportunities to be in a position that is beyond his experience and aptitude , he will in time grow to be capable of taking on that position. 

The biggest issue with the fake degree saga is that FTs armed with fake degrees are denying many our young grads that opportunity to build their competence. Many Young Singaporean grads cannot get jobs that requires a recognised degree and a certain number of years of working experience. Instead , these jobs have been taken by FTs armed with fake degree and possible fake working experience. 
The result is a lost generation of young Singaporeans who will end up in limbo

I am aware for a fact that many fellow Singaporeans stay in my condo. Yet mine is the only house with a flag flying below the window. I've lived here for 11 years and have only ever noticed 2 or 3 other houses doing the same (if at all). This year again it looks like its gonna be just my family. I've thought about a few reasons and decided there's no valid reason really: 
a) the way the buildings are positioned often causes the wind to flip the flag completely upwards. - but then that is just my block out of 5 blocks. And I've seen plenty of other housing estates facing same issue but still displaying flags for all units.  
b) there is some condo regulation. But that makes no sense - SG flag is not an undesirable thing. Anyhow the management is so bodoh that they never noticed when we varnished our front door completely black ( which is supposedly a big no-no) 
c) there is no hook or proper fixture. - so then improvise! I tied raffia to the ends of the flag and then tied the ends of the raffia together inside my house itself! If there is a will there is a way. 
So my conclusion is that it is the residents' choice not to do so. So my question is, why so unpatriotic?
My condo can get the award for being the only flagless estate in the neighborhood. In the past they used to at least put some decoration on the boundary wall. This year nothing. If I could I would go spray-paint the walls red and white in the middle of the night. 
I see this behavior occurring in a lot of other condos which are inhabited by those richer Singaporeans. What a big shame it is. Less than a month to go for SG50 also don't wanna decorate. Maybe I'll do an aunty-ish thing and complain to the town council. :(

 Nationalism is an outdated concept. No one owes any nation anything nor the other way around. The state takes taxes and we receive public services - A purely transactional relationship. And let's face it - For all of your flag love, if a crisis does happen, I doubt you will stay for long. For me, I'll be the first to liquidate my assets and hop on the first flight out with my family.

Could a girl possibly like anyone who is like Christian Grey from that ridiculous book which was recently turned into a movie, except that this person isnt a billionaire or even remotely 'hot' or attractive? If no, how does one become asexual in an environment that unfortunately has many members of the opposite gender?

I come from a broken family. I live in a small rental flat with my mum. My dad died five years ago but I don’t miss him or grieve for him. He was an abusive father and husband, and to this day, I still hate him.

I remembered the times when I was a young boy. My mother would hide me in her room as I listened, from the other side of the door, her screams. The abuse became less common in my teenage years when he realised that I wasn’t going to take his shit and that I wouldn’t hesitant to beat him if he landed a finger on either one of us.

When he died, I’ve never felt more happy. I owe him my thanks for putting me in this world but that is about it. My mum, on the other hand, is everything to me. Despite the struggles, she gave me two of the greatest gifts in the world: a mother’s love, and hope in the form of the written word. My childhood was filled with secondhand books. Novels gave me sanity and an imaginary world where I could escape into.

I’ve been out of NUS for two years now. I did brilliantly in school, graduating with a good honours degree and was even offered an opportunity to do my PhD but didn’t due to other pressing priorities in my life. I landed a job I truly love upon graduation. It's long hours but that, on the grander scheme of things, doesn’t matter much. I’ve benefited from the education system having had access to good teachers, resources and financial assistance. 

Now I give back my time freely as a private tutor for some of the kids in my neighbourhood. Kids who come from broken families like mine. I teach four teenagers every Sunday morning in my flat. Sometimes, they turn up; other times, they don’t. This morning, one of my kids - a young, smart and talented Chinese boy - turned up after having been missing from class for the last six weekends. 

He passed me a note at the end of the lesson, telling me the reason why he hasn’t been to class. His mum was recently sent for drug rehab. At the end of the short note, he wrote, “You give me hope that my life will sum to something greater than it is now. Thank you for teaching me.” That was the most defining moment for me as a tutor to know that I’ve impacted their lives in small ways. That was the best birthday present for me and it gave me affirmation that I should seriously consider becoming a full-time teacher eventually in my career.

I'm very disturbed with the recent surge in popularity of the don't judge challenge. The irony about this challengeis it's initially intended to combat "body shaming". However, this challenge became the very symbol of body shaming itself, with features of the videos include some scope of qualities the society deems "unattractive", like thick eye brows, acnes, gap teeth and facial hair, these videos reinforce dehumanizing and damaging beauty "ideals". If that person has  any number of these qualities, he or she is deemed "undesirable" by society - a caricature of a person who deserves ridicule rather than a living, breathing one who deserves respect.
In the end, the don't judge challenge is only about "pretty" people making fun of other people has possess the "undesirable" facial features.
Stop #dontjudgechallenge now.

I have something to say to a blood relative of mine. You are barely two years older than me, but you graduated three years ahead of me. Your life has been defined by achievement after achievement despite having come from a lesser background and having been a sickly and unhappy child. You've had poor physical and mental health (though that didn't stop you from becoming a sporting star who graduated from one of the toughest NUS courses with first class honours). To compensate for whatever childhood difficulties, your parents and our grandparents constantly gave in to whatever you want. 
To this day; you are 21 years old and behave worse than a 10 year old. 
Here are some facts you need to know: 
1) you are selfish. Your parents and sister dote upon you, and you take it for granted. They came down last week to see you graduate. I have not seen you say one nice thing to the people who love you the most. You always whine at them or ridicule/talk down to them. You behave despicably and they take it lying down. 
2) you have an inflated self image. Our family treated you specially while you were a child because, well, you were abnormal to say the least. My parents have told me that you would cry inconsolably for hours and would demand your mother carry you and walk on the road outside: for hours. The minute she stepped inside the house, you would scream. To appease this behaviour, people started giving in. For example, our grandfather asking us all to say sorry to you, for no reason. That was fine for as long as you were a child. But not being specialists or child therapists, our family didn't know how to stop. Your lot may continue to see you as special, but nobody else in the world cares. So when you come to my parents house, you better realise there is a reason we don't coddle you. 
3) your mother is crazy and our grandfather is obsessive. She is influenced by her rural, uneducated mother whose wisdom consists of feeding children as much as possible. A majority of your stomach issues stem from overeating and not knowing your limits. The more you fell sick, the more our grandfather obsessed about your health and micromanaged. You became a science project and hypochondriac. 
4) you are not the only one with mental issues. We all feel stressed and lonely. That is modern life and now you have a coping mechanism: medication. So suck it up and move on. Our grandfather recently told my father not to criticise you at all. Apparently you'd get upset. Well, you are unhygienic, unhelpful at home and leave us work to be done even when you visit us a single day. 
5) you refuse to change and adapt. You want to live in a comfort zone. You were insane enough to eat at the same stall in Koufu for four years. Today you are living a life people would die for. But you are concerned about not getting lunch you are used to at your much sought after workplace. Please don't bitch about hawker centres, the rest of us eat there. 
6) you are responsible for the strained relations between my parents and yours. You carry tales and gossip since your mother actively seeks it out. You bring about misconceptions and make your mother resent us. Your sister says when you go home you never stop commenting on the inconvenience as compared to our home in Singapore. Why do you purposely wind up your mother who has always been irrationally jealous of mine? 

If I were to say this in real life you'd all easily chalk it up to my reaction to my jealousy of you. And is not in my place to destroy a relationship my mother still cares about for some vague reason. But peer to peer, I'm telling you. You're a turd. You care for no one but yourself and your foolish family will never let you realise that. I wanted to be friends when you came here four years ago. But your selfishness and your mother's constant interference made that impossible.  So please stop exacting more time and effort from my parents, because you may have your parents, sister and both sets of grandparents running after you endlessly, but I barely have my two busy, overworked parents. You wanted a parade at your commencement. I'll be lucky if my parents can make it. Your folk don't give two shits about me, why should we care about your made-up inconveniences. Hell, you'd all be happy if I failed miserably. So never mind affection, but it's about time you showed some goddamn respect.

What do people feel when they volunteer for community service? Do they think like 'hey I'm doing your community a favour, so you gotta listen to me'?

Today, this group of volunteers engaged the residents of a place where I have worked in and did long term voluntary work (I know the residents personally, and yes, I admit I am kinda protective of them). So their leader along with the volunteers were shouting across the corridors constantly as though it's their house - kinda gangster-ish. They took charge of the place like it was theirs. In particular, the group helped to clear some stuff from a resident's house that was hoarded but without the consent of the hoarder (she went out, permission given by flatmate).

It bothers me. A lot. I feel really uncomfortable that the 'power' is strip off from me. It's like, this is my estate and my residents, so why should you be here doing what you think is right when you don't even know how my residents are / what are the background of these units. What if the hoarder turns violent and attacks her flatmate (happened several times). Who's gonna be responsible?

I am definitely grateful for people coming in to provide assistance and improving life of residents. But surely there is a more dignified approach to that...

I am wondering if we all Singaporeans really understand Malay language. I met several people who even need to count in Malay using their hands. Even though Malay language is not our communication language, it is still our national language which I believe we need to be proficient with.

Prof Kishore Mahbubani is one of my favorite thinker and writer. I'll like to recommend this book, which is a collection of some of his writings and interviews, because it is objective, brutally honest and raises the awareness that we cannot take Singapore's peace and prosperity for granted. You can borrow it from the library. And I would just like to summarize some points which casual readers like myself, can relate to. My summary may not be the best representation of his views, but hopefully, it gets you interested enough to go read the whole thing.

The first part simply explains what makes Singapore successful, such as our relatively lower crime rate, efficient infrastructure etc. and how we cannot become "free riders" and start to rely on someone else to do the job when it can be a personal responsibility, such as being able to pick up our own trash instead of thinking we are providing someone a job by helping us to do so.

The second part explores some issues we face, such as education, transportation etc. Some interesting topics would be "Why Singapore has yet to be become the next Silicon Valley?" and 'Why a liberal arts education is useful?", which challenges the convention that an engineering or accounting education is always the default path to choose. Also, on how the COE policy can actually backfire, because instead of discouraging car ownership, it may in fact encourage a greater demand for car ownership as people in Singapore associate owning a car with status and prestige due to the premium prices.

The third part talks about our values and identity. Why are Singaporeans unhappy? Our other South East Asian counterparts do not have much of our privileges, yet they seem to be more satisfied and complain less? Is it because we are too unrealistic to be able to see things beyond materialism? And how the 5 'C's may be impossible for everyone to achieve due to Singapore's limitation as a small nation.

What are you waiting for? Add this book to your reading list!

My senior shared this with me. This quote sounds very pessimistic but it is true to a good extent.

There are doctors who do not provide the best cure but prescribe medicine to delay the illness so the patient will return.

There are lawyers who do whatever it takes to win for their clients, even if it distorts the truth.

There are universities which are overly grade orientated and neglects teaching students how knowledge should be wisely used.

There are religions which exploit fervent believer's weaknesses for immoral agendas.

And banks... do I need to say more?

I just hope we can become better and better with every generation. If not mankind will become the victim of his own doing.

From , we can see that there are two general types of people.

1. Ambitious, discontented individuals who are stepping out of their comfort zones with hopes of fulfilling their dreams. Probably more accomplishments, but also more emotional stress. Fighting fish.

2. Laid back, contented individuals who are perfectly fine with where they are now. Probably fewer accomplishments, but also less emotional stress. Goldfish.

Just like in most systems, these two fishes are in equilibrium. It is just the natural order of things.

It’s sad that barely two decades into life and I could think of people I wouldn’t mind seeing unhappy. Their happiness doesn’t matter to me at all. And as much as I wouldn’t go out of my way to harm them or rejoice in their misfortune, I don’t think I would waste a split second feeling sorry for them. And I’m not sure if that makes me a vengeful person or if it demonstrates how much I’ve been lied to and hated on and hurt by other people in my life. Or if everyone has people like this too?

Everyone got their own definition of humour, and my personal favourite sense of humour is that of sarcasm, puns, and some satire. Unfortunately, not many people get it or have that. It's been really hard to find friends with matching sense of humour.

In Singapore, a car is strictly a want. However, it may be a very important one to some people due to their lifestyle (families staying far apart, business, certain hobbies, travel to ulu areas often for whatever reasons). The incessant, great demand for car ownership already tells us that a car is an extremely important want to many people--almost like a need to them. $60k COE will not stop them because it is their way of life, and there are currently no good alternatives.

To those people arguing against indulging in wants, please consider how much of an improvement a car can bring to some people's lives. Remember that its worth is subjective. I also hope that you walk the talk by attending to your needs only--the bare essentials. No hobbies, no restaurant food, no travelling etc.

Regarding the post 5066, I am a Singaporean girl studying in a Western university. I think one of the reasons behind why employers prefer overseas graduates is that they tend to be more worldly, open-minded and interesting. There is a stark difference between the Singaporean students in my university and those who have spent their entire lives in Singapore. Unfortunately, I find it very hard to click with born and bred Singaporean guys and it always seems that we are on a different wavelength. Overseas Singaporeans are usually more of a go-getter and ambitious.

In reference to / "Government ... operate with the belief that they will never face repercussions ".

That is certainly not the case. The repercussions are huge for the government and this is reflected in the results of the General Elections. The ruling party's supporters has dipped considerably as more Singaporeans are increasingly dissatisfied with the policies created. That and also because of the herd mentality whereby people are easily influenced by their peers or social media to hate on the government.

One must do due diligence and understand the complexities every government in the world face, not just the Singaporean government. No policies are perfect and no government can predict how the future will turn out to be.

1. People complain about the rise in the number of foreigners (immigration policy) within the last decade but fail to understand what was the policy's intent. Jobs with less-than-expected starting salaries for fresh graduates are dismissed not to mention jobs that no Singaporean (educated or not) would do : cleaners; maids; construction workers; low-paying civil service jobs etc. How do you expect a country to function if her own people do not want to do what is necessary and worse, complain when others come to help ?

2. People complain about the CPF system, raising the average retirement age ceiling or the whole policy in general. What was the policy's intent ? It is to ease the difficulties of the average Singaporean (which is the bulk of the population) with their house loans, hospital bills and acts as a form of pension in old age. People complain that they may never see their CPF retirement money because they may be too old to even enjoy by then.

Why then did the Government raise the ceiling age ? Because at the national level, life expectancy for the average born and bred Singaporean has increased significantly. We have excellent healthcare facilities and people to treat age-related problems, hence prolonging our lives. 

At the individual level, there have been complaints that Singaporeans squander their retirement money on casinos, alcohol, brothels too early and too fast. Again furore was directed at the government for their lack of consideration of this matter. 

So the government revised the policy to raising the retirement age ceiling. You know what the public did next. I sometimes sympathise with the government because no matter how hard or how well they perform, it is never pleasing. It's tough serving the people.

I just wanna say I'm grateful to have lived my entire adult life in peace, to have legitimate meritocracy and an able government doing their utmost to ensure the next generation of Singaporeans can live a better life than their predecessors. #SG50 and #VoteWisely !

Be grateful for the tiniest things and have a great week !

A little sadistic to say this but .. it's heartwarming to know that I'm not the only one who is heavily restricted by my parents. 

Basically there's just SO MANY PEOPLE out there who don't understand how we feel when our parents make numerous restrictions on us even after we are 21 yo. And I especially hate it when my friends go 'Just tell them or persuade them la, not like they will really disown you' if I were to tell them the situation.

Just FYI, it doesn't mean that your parents (+ many other parents) have a modernized thinking, my parents will have one too.

Mortified to read about the social worker taking advantage of the vulnerable needy and being convicted in court. It got me thinking whether there is any interview process for people studying the subject. There could be wolf in sheep's clothing hidden among the do gooders.

Met some social work majors which make me question their intentions. There are interviews for medicine, teaching, what about social work? They are at the front line of serving the most vulnerable in society.

Recently people have been posting that NUSWhispers has become a dating website, aunt agony, gossip column, customer support etc. Let me add one more. It has become an avenue for people to insert snarky and unnecessary comments to get likes. Oh, you're correcting OP's grammar? You managed to understand it right? Then, move on dude. It's probably a typo. This isn't a spelling competition. I know there are those who may genuinely correct grammar of others.. But is that necessary? To put someone down, especially by making condescending comments? And these are the comments that gain the most likes. Guess we all love to hate.

, you didn't make a mistake by confessing. In fact, kudos to you for having the guts to reveal your identity when people were making snarky comments with the 'apparent' support of other frequent commenters. OP had a doubt about the lecturers, hence she posted to NUSWhispers to reach a 4,700 wide audience. One of which surely had to have an answer. Isn't that what NUSWhispers is about? Reaching out to people? I'm pretty sure that most of us don't know how to use NUSMods query feature, and even if we did use it, the admin won't be so prompt to respond as he's busy with other commitments (read, commenting as NUSMods on the Facebook page) I won't be surprised if this confession doesn't make it through. Anyway, if you really don't want us to ask questions about NUSMods on NUSWhispers, maybe you can stop with the self-promotion?

Not related to NUS but I hope this will be posted

Anyone still remember their NS life? There are several questions I wanted to ask

During BMT, did your superior give you a G50 form?
1)When did your superior collect the G50 from you(E.g 1 weeks before POP)
2)Did your superior ever gave it back to you?
3)What would happen if you never fill it up?(Superior scold you fiercely, superior merely gave it back to you the next day and asked you to fill it up)

Try to read the post carefully. I am sure that STEM degree have trained their students well in Classical Logic? Set Theory? Very basic to know that someone says 'many', it doesn't refer to all. I hope that I don't have to illustrate with Venn Diagrams.

"-Redacted-:
Another uppity Pol Science student. If you're so much better at learning about political science in a brainwashed Singaporean academia environment, perhaps you'll just as equally turn out to be a party stooge, no?"

Indeed some pol sci. professors have ideological leaning towards the ruling party. For Sociology, there is a mixture of views. In short, it is difficult to generalize. How do we identify who is a Sophist? They appear in courts, lectures, tutorial classes, social media, and mass media. They sound clever. 

So am I a Sophist? Up to you to decide.

Another thing is that because of the specialization enforced in Academia, there are things which the professors don't know. How to get out of such trap? Usually, I do research and study things from different parts of NUS instead of purely political science stuffs. Most social sciences don't teach you rigorous statistical methods. Things are applied mechanically. I have to go deeper by learning from FOS. Even then, by probing further in the libraries, I found out the limits of Statistics in dealing with certain classes of events.

In short, I was doing Liberal Arts before Liberal Arts exist in Singapore. Brainwashed environment doesn't stop you from discovering and learning things. To blame the brainwashing environment is having "Bad Faith" as what what Sartre puts it. You blaming facticity which you can overcome if you have worked harder.

Though no, I don't think many people would actually mind if you do say that what we do is easy. We should be professional enough to understand that not everyone can appreciate the complexity and beauty of machinery."

From experience, it can be even more fascinating if you try to go into higher orders of understanding. The phenomenon of people using the metaphor of 'beauty' to describe machines - does it show us that we going deeper into higher ontology by creating machines, software and AI?

In light of , I'm just interested to know how you guys perceive the issue and this whole right to freedom of speech issue. I, for one, am starting to understand the right to freedom of speech less and less. Does freedom not come with responsibility? So apparently one can say anything one wants to even if it's not true or even if it hurts other people and those concerned are not allowed to take offense or act on their hurt because it's your prerogative? For e.g. if Amos says I hate the PAP and I say I hate people like you, is that not my freedom of speech too? Then where do you draw the line? Should we then condone all kinds of hate speech, retaliation inclusive as well, because freedom of speech? Does the social contract cease to exist one's freedom of speech comes into play?

Question for the straight male population (fabulous NUSWhispers commenters are free to give advice, but I'm not really concerned what you guys think in this context). What do you think of girls' body hair? Meaning would you rather pretend we've never been born with body hair or are you ok with us as is? I've always shaved EVERYTHING. But it seems rather unfair when you guys don't. Looking for opinions on 1) arm hair 2) pit hair 3) leg hair 4) the carpet. 
Do you prefer 1) waxed 2) shaved 3) epilated 4) au naturel ?
Be honest. Doesn't mean that'll change anything, but I think I speak for a lot of others when I say that I'd like to know your opinions either way. 
As for the way I prefer guys: well, there isn't any one way. As long as we're all hygienic, I'm good.

Coming from a Pol. Sci. background, I observe many people, especially those with STEM degree, often think that they can understand politics very easily without spending hours thinking about the issues carefully in a broader sense historically and contemporary. And their views usually do not get past the 'doxa' stage.

Imagine someone makes a comment that building a software / airplane is very easy without spending hours and hours in the craft. They get angry about such a naive view. 

Yet, they themselves make naive comments about things that are related to social sciences and humanities.
-
 
STEM major here, voicing support for . Underestimating the complexity of political issues is a problem shared by a wide section of the populace, but it seems particularly prevalent in STEM majors. There's a tendency amongst people in STEM fields to underestimate the complexity of problems outside our own specializations. Sometimes we really need to shut up and learn more before commenting on the latest policies. 

Actually in most cases, I wonder if it's even possible for anyone in the world to have anything like an accurate analysis of the situation, but the ones with the best chances are probably the ones who study the subject intensively, not the armchair commentators.

Just curious - what does everyone think of the Amos Yee debacle? Personally I feel he deserves everything he's experiencing and I don't care that he's only 16 years old - but I wonder if I'm being too harsh on him?

On a related note, I have nothing against Hongkongers, but on this issue I think their interference is so incredibly unnecessary.

I'm the OP of . A special thanks to all the kind hearted people who sought to enlighten me  with this comic: http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate which tells only one side of the story. 

No, not all poor people are hardworking and not all of the wealthy are lazy. 

During As, I was privileged enough to be able to afford tuition. Or rather, my parents were kind enough to hire a tutor for me. Without fail, every time I had attained better-than-mediocre grades my classmates would degrade my achievements saying "you have tuition, that doesn't count". OH REALLY? So you're telling me that I didn't put in the hours and the effort as you did? Certainly I had help but that doesn't mean that I didn't work hard too. 

I've heard so many fatalistic groans from those less priviledged. More commonly, snide remarks as seen on this page. I also know of those from less well-to-do families who betray their friends and use unscrupulous means to succeed. 

As one of the commenters of my original post has stated, we will never know the struggles of others until we know their full story.

 It is naive to think that the current system has no flaws because no one came up with a better alternative yet.

What's wrong with admitting that a better background does confer advantages that are increasingly insurmountable - like overseas education - as you go down the bell curve distribution of 'zainess'? 

What's wrong with admitting that on the other hand we still have competitive social mobility in spite of that?

It's not choosing between keeping the incumbent system or discarding it. Is it so difficult to hold a balanced discussion? I've always thought that the ability to do that increases with education.

(And this is all shallowly assuming that grades and exams are the universal indicators of skill.)

There's this girl who is very active and always commenting. Mostly on posts about guys looking for girls and all. I just don't get it why are you always criticizing people. Your comments are harsh and it's very offensive. Sorry but can you tone it down? It's not nice at all and I personally find it very annoying.

Health is Wealth. This is not a metaphor, but a literal truth in our selfishly "productive" society.

I am a civil servant who work in the procurement department after NUS graduation. My section head, let's call her Mary (not her real name) who has been working here for almost 30 years had recently been diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. She is a very kind and nice middle-aged lady who looks after and helps junior staffs like myself. Unfortunately, due to her medical condition, she has to undergo chemotherapy, which takes a toll on her working hours and of course, her physical appearance. 

And guess what? The director demoted Mary and promoted her subordinate to take her place as the section head! This includes a pay cut and she no longer sits in an individual room but rather, she now sits outside with most of the junior staffs. The director said it's because her medical condition requires her to get more rest by having less responsibilities. He sounded reasonable and empathetic, but I know the director is a very selfish and arrogant man who usually gets his juniors to do most of his work while he takes his afternoon nap daily. So basically, he doesn't give a f**k about Mary's well-being, but he needs someone healthier and younger to help him to do his "sai kang". It is actually quite humiliating for Mary.

I told Mary to perhaps bring this issue up with the Ministry of Manpower, however she said she doesn't want any trouble and cannot lose this job as she's got a family to feed, medical bills to pay and she may not be able to find a better job outside because of her age and education level, since she only has a diploma. Not saying that a diploma is bad but it's just that there're always younger and more highly educated people who can easily fill her role.

I feel really sorry for her but there's really nothing I can do, unless she's willing to act on her own and fight for her own rights. But she's ill, very tired and has tons of commitment, how can she stand to fight for herself?

Even if her health condition hinders her capability to do certain tasks, she had contributed so much for the organization for decades. Why can't the director take into consideration how much she has contributed over the decades and help her figure out a fair way to deal with this, instead of simply kicking her out of her position?

On the other hand, when a VIP (someone the organization cannot do without) falls ill, not only do bootlickers visit him everyday with showers of get-well gifts, but he also continues to receive his paycheck during his leave-of-absence and he'll be cordially invited to return to his position. I've experienced this before.

This brings me to realize that the weak will always be bullied by the strong. And the weak is often seen as resources to be used, manipulated and thrown away when their usage limit is up. For goodness sake, even the most lowly positions are humans with a soul, feelings, commitments and aspirations! The organization as a whole is very productive, yet the moral standards and empathy has been heavily compromised.

From this I've learnt that we must constantly put ourselves in a position so that we're indispensable to any employers, perhaps through our personal connection or pure brilliance. This is just to protect our own seats and our family's future. 

I always hear that kindness starts at home. No. Kindness starts at the top. If leaders are responsible and kind to their subordinates, it'll create a culture where people want to assume leadership roles not because of the personal benefits which comes with it, but rather the responsibility and the burden to look after those below them. Yet, we still have a long way to go to achieve that.

During my internship, I befriended this Malay guy from SMU. Very funny, very talk cock one. He was my lunch buddy almost every day at work.

He told me the trick to get a lot of ingredients on my nasi padang plate is to flirt with the Makciks and speak to them in Malay if possible. Over the two months period of internship, I was able to pick up some Malay. Enough to order food and be asked questions like, "Are you Malaysian Chinese?" I put the theory to test at 10 different nasi padang stalls all over CBD manned by 10 different Makciks and Kakaks. I admit lah, it's a small sample, but my result shows that 7 out of 10 times, I get more ingredients (price being equal) when I speak and flirt with them in Malay than if I order in English. 

I can't wait for semester to start and test it in school.

Some phrases (excuse the misspelling/grammar, I learned by ear) I've learned:

Lu apa khabar makcik? Baik? Bagus? Sayhad?

Makcik, lu pakai tudung merah jambu (pink), banyak jambu (pretty woman) leh!

Wah panyak panas nari! Macam lu la makcik!

Boleh kasi gua itu ayam besar-besar?

There's a lot more I learned (mostly the ingredients names) but that's just some I remember that makes the makcik either creeped out, charmed like siao or set them laughing at my atrocious Malay. 

THANK YOU SMU BRADDER!!! LU STEADY!

It's funny how everyone thinks that meritocracy = equal opportunities for all. 

In reality, meritocracy means the best person gets the job and that means if you are born richer, smarter, better looking; you naturally have more attributes to make you the "best person" which in turn gives you access to all the great opportunities. 

And in this case, Singapore is indeed a pretty efficient meritocracy; but do not for one second think that it means everyone is on an even playing ground
-
 
 don't be so naive. Can you think of an alternative system to even out the odds? What's wrong with people having an advantage? 

It's not about where you start but where you end up. You can start damn far ahead but still fall back if you're a lazy sack of useless. 

And don't give the perfect case of a zai person with resources, because the point is not to pull them down. The point is in having a system that let's a zai person with no resources catch up/excel. And in that regard the meritocracy we have is gr8. And in that regard do we say meritocracy aids equality - equality to succeed given X capability barring uncontrollable factors like background

I am happy that some girls took the initiative and asked me out.... gender equality.... modern women... chauvinism etc etc.....

I know a married couple who are the "perfect couple" in everyone's eyes. They have 3 beautiful children and several lovely grandchildren. No, this isn't a story about "how the external is just a facade and internal is wreck" story. This is to offer a perspective about love and finding the 'soulmate' of your life.

Their family is not rich. The husband is a lowly civil servant and the wife is a full time housewife. But they are not poor, although they couldn't afford any luxury like cars, family overseas trip or branded stuffs, the husband makes a little more than enough to put food on the table, and his wife is incredibly skilled with the arts of the kitchen. Their children finished their education and got a good occupation, not spectacular, but good enough. Overall, they have a very peaceful and happy life, like a "happily ever after" ending in fairytale, but in a much simpler way. 

After 35 years of marriage, both in their 60s, I would assume they are the soulmate for each other. They didn't have many big quarrels, they didn't divorce, and still very much in love with each other till now.

With their children all grown up, they started to do some retrospection of their lives up till now. When I asked them "do you think he/she is the 'right one' for you in this life?"
Both of them answered "I don't really know."

Husband: "I used to date this educated accountant girl when I was younger and almost end up marrying her. My life could be much better and comfortable with that extra income in the household, and she is more intelligent (not sure about capability to take care of family) than my wife."

Wife: "There was a rich guy wooing me back then. He lived in a big bungalow, had a chauffeur to ferry him around, bound for huge inheritance and high company position. There was once he brought me to his house, showed me around and told me 'all this can be yours too if you are willing to share them with me, as my wife'. I forgot the reason why I didn't marry him in the end. My life could be much easier if I had married him; I don't have to take care of my husband's mother for 20+ years, I don't have to worry about what to cook everyday or where to find the best bargains because our house budget was really tight with 3 young children in the past." 

Even if you have a "perfect life and marriage", in the end, on your deathbed, there is absolutely no way to be sure that your spouse is your 'true' soulmate. 
Do you know it instinctively? Who can confirm it for you? Is there really 'the one'? If you subscribe to religions, will you beat yourself up if the guy up there told you that you actually missed 'the one' in your life? 
To people who subscribe to the 'soulmate' perspective in relationship, keep in mind this doubt will always linger in your mind during your relationship, when you propose, during your marriage, on your hospital bed. This is a 'life' question, it's not meant to be solved easily. It will stay there and persist till the end. All of us must answer it again and again, from time to time at different parts of our life.

Hi , I think you've not participated in RAG nor Flag and you're talking through your hat and being presumptuous. Especially so when you mention that people who are involved in RAG are not involved in RAG.

I may not speak for all faculties, but for my faculty, the RAG team actually goes all out on Flag day. Yes, "motives" may seem questionable - some faculties/halls want the plaque, etc - but the deed remains. That is, RAG team DOES go out and help on Flag Day. Believe it or not, I've flagged from sunrise to sunset for two years in a row. Maybe this is unique to my faculty, but please don't be so dismissive. Am from the Biz faculty, in case you think I'm being all secretive/evasive. 

On that note, I do agree that RAG is a waste of resources ;) time (wtf, cut paper/cans need so much time meh?!), money (I hate to agree but yes, people do BUY the materials, which is damn lame)... 

But the spirit behind RAG and Flag is appreciated. :) not everyone may agree (hey, that's life), but that's my humble opinion. 

TL;DR - RAGgers DO go out on Flag Day, I think RAG and Flag showcases school spirit, but RAG is a waste of resources. May be great to rethink the judging criteria.

After reading , ,  and the like, I shall chip in.

I'm the OP of  and the earlier confession of being from an "obscure major". And my story runs pretty much similar to yours. By the way, I do most of my assignments in the language of Chinese, including my HT.

Firstly, kudos on having survived uni with that much lack. It's 9 days more to Commencement for me, and I can safely say I feel you people. Even I have felt that my parents weren't doing enough, my parents similarly had the inferiority complex to avoid meet-the-parents session (particularly in my ACJC days for obvious reasons; I made it there by merit but was an obvious sore thumb there) but that was before my NS days.

Indeed, it's not your parents' fault. I'm sure they've done their best. But the reality is, even in a meritocratic society like SG, hard work is not always THE key to success. Very often, no matter how hard we work, how much we want to succeed, there is just no opportunity, simply because we make a single mistake or we lack charisma or personality and all that nonsense. I understood this in NS; I screwed up my BMT because I was slower to adapt to the military and couldn't go to command school. I was stuck as a trooper, and I hated it because, why others could but I couldn't? It's just unfair isn't it? I still worked hard all the same though, and did well even up till now as I just finished my 4th ICT. (2nd year in a row as top 10% too.) I refuse to give up on being an officer, even if it takes me a longer route with a longer time, even if there's no foreseeable possibility.

But what I've understood through this example, and some other experiences is that, my parents, or your parents may have faced the same damn problem. They try their best, but it's never good enough for this screwed up world. When education wasn't as advanced prior to the 80s, drop-out rate was much higher, opportunities were far lesser as well. I daresay the Chinese-educated parents were hit worse because they apparently needed more time to adjust to such a change in the macro-environment. And as they moved into the newer economy, they were compared with more younger graduates and higher expectations. As such, they were just disadvantaged. The only thing they could do, as they grew older, was to do their best to put me, or you, through the best education possible so that we do not have to live the same life as them, being phased out and subject to the whims and fancies (and mockery) of monsters out there. It is normal for us to blame, but the blame shouldn't be on our parents, it should be on this cursed world and some elitist monsters.

Now that we pulled through, and we step into a brighter future, we can support our parents. I gave pretty much half of every month's allowance during my NS days to my parents, and I took up the only government sponsorship with bond that was offered to me, so that my mother could battle cancer with ease. Bank loan for university before pursuing my dream job with the men in blue was not a choice for me. To be honest, I still resent my mother sometimes, but well, delay isn't that bad. I shall just serve my bond, take it as repaying my mother (who has passed on in 2012), then pursue what I wanna do after that. It is true, when we have disadvantages, things can get worse if we have to make sacrifices with no other alternatives. Once again, the blame is on life, reality and the world. I stopped blaming my parents and just worked hard.

With a much more stable financial power in your hands, heed my advice, never forget where you come from. It's not just about your family or your kids having an easier life than you had, but it's also how we use what we have in our hands to change the reality of this world we live in. Remember what I mentioned about the lack of opportunities for those who are late-bloomers or simply have some lack in attributes. The best thing we can do is to make the world and this reality a more fair place for them. I sent a feedback to MINDEF lately to suggest establishing NSmen commander conversion courses to convert NSmen to officers/WOSPECs, to boost the commanders corps and also such that late-blooming NSmen wouldn't be faced with the hopelessness of the lack of opportunities. (I hope they consider it and come up with something great of course.) I did some relief teaching and tried my best to help weaker students catch up and discover their potential. And there's much more I can do as I serve my bond as a civil servant.

While meritocracy is apparently flawed in some ways, the humans that dwell in this system are the key to perfecting it and making it work for humans. There are some elitist idiots out there who would prefer the status quo so that they can continue to trample on the weak and disadvantaged. (I would love to take them on in a fight and show them who's boss, but not in this confession now.) But there will always be those who protect the weak and help the needy, and level the playing field to ensure no one gets left behind.

My question for you is, what about you? How will you go about to make this world a better place for others who face similar disadvantages, or worse? If you see someone going through something similar to you, I doubt we can just walk away.

After reading all the posts about financially disadvantaged students, I'm feeling so damn guilty. I am so sheltered and oblivious to the realities of life. I could kick myself. My monthly household income (parents' salaries + 2nd property rent + investment returns) is 60k. My internship monthly allowance is itself 1k (and I'm only a yr 1 student). It is inconceivable to me how a big family can live on merely 2.5k or less! I always knew there were disadvantaged students at NUS but these confessions have just totally put things in perspective. Thank you for the reminder that I have had no real struggle thus far and therefore have a lot to still strive for and achieve. 
(Also, SG meritocracy = a joke)

Hey 

Cheer up, I'm from the same background as you. My mum passed away when I was 14 and hence my dad not only became the only sole breadwinner, he also had to juggle the role of a househusband. Being a taxi driver, his monthly income was only around $1200. I've a brother who's in SP and his poly fees are quite high too. As the older child, I'm constantly worrying about my family finances at the back of my mind. My dad is 52 and I'm also worried about his health, especially more so as he's a smoker. Despite me and my brother telling him to quit, but habits are often hard to get rid of.

Unlike my friends who can always go out, shop, eat supper, travel, without having to think about money, I have to. You may call it extreme, to the fact that I chose to even walk home from the MRT station (3 bus stops away), no matter how tired, how shag I was, just to save that insignificant 79 cents. When I signed up for paid experiments, my friends laughed "It's just $5." But to me, if I do 2 experiments, I could get $10 and this is equivalent to my daily allowance (excluding transport). When my friends could afford a cup of starbucks, sometimes I only allow myself to buy it once every few months. If my timetable allows, I would juggle part time work and school.

Your rant is not pointless. Yes I do agree that money can be the source of unhappiness, the source of many issues. Things may not change the way you want them to, may not change in the short term, but I believe that as long as you try any way possible, even the tiniest, subtle change, could lead to something great. So cheer up!

Deeply annoyed at the wannabe do-gooders all over the place constantly insisting on making us "get out of your comfort zone". Can't you accept that some of us have already found what we want in life? If you have to try everything willy-nilly in the hopes of finding your true calling, it just means that you don't know what you want from life yet.

TLDR: I'm not going to try tasting crap just because "try it out, maybe you might like it".

I really don't understand what love (between people of no family ties e.g boy-girl) is, let alone the LGBT issues. Why do people want to find a partner? Is it because of loneliness? Is it because of the biological imperative? Is it an essential in life? Is it because they like children? Or is it an achievement in life? I don't know...

I've no issue with RAG at all. There are many other events that also spends lots of time, money and space. They all serve a purpose. In the case of RAG, it bond students together in a powerful way like no other. 

But I've every problem with trying to tie RAG and Flag together. Likelihood is, those people participating in RAG never actually went out to solicit donations during Flag Day (because they're busy preparing their float) and surely do not have the intention of thanking the public for their donations in mind. Members of public were never actively invited to view RAG, and we always have more student audiences than actual public members, if any at all. Flag is about raising funds for the unfortunate, RAG is about spending resources for the students' enjoyment. Flag is suppose to come first, then RAG (you raise donations first, THEN you thank the public), but we're calling it RAG and Flag, not Flag and RAG. Needless to say, students are more excited and enthusiastic about RAG than Flag. 

Sorry to say this, but it's downright hypocritical to tie these two events together.

Stay strong my friend. Our lifestyle today has ruined us. We are exposed to so much stimulus on a day to day basis we need to find some ways of release. The more we become self aware of our habits, be it watching pornography, or masturbating to pornography, it would be the first step to self control. Change your lifestyle such that you don't get triggered. Avoid all these above activities and soon you will feel wholesome again. 

Ive seen people who have freed themselves from the shackles and it is beautiful. Its like they are real men. We who fap behind a screen are merely boys slave to our vices.

NUS Rag and Flag is the only university-wide event that gets all halls, residential colleges, faculties of all levels and staff together. Given that it is held at the start of the AY, its a way to start the AY off with a vibrant unified front. OP of  has obviously not joined rag before.

The rationals stated: (The charity/fund-raising aspect is omitted because that distinctly belongs to Flag, billed as a environmentally friendly event) is no longer relevant in this argument.

I am a final year student having done 2 rags, hall and faculty, and have seen similar events in foreign universities while on exchange and i strongly feel it should be sustained.

1. NUS Rag has never been environmentally friendly, its sometimes even laughable how resources are obtained during the float and costume/props construction where they are by no means environment friendly, the organisers/participants of rag have never advocated that misguided fact, at least the ones ive been involved it, it seems NUSSU is the one maintaining that stand.

2. NUS Rag has constantly given enthusiastic students with opportunities to grow and interact. Designers and creative students flaunt their talent on the drawing board and float engineers assist them to bring their ideas into physical reality. Dance/cheer choreographers get to try out their concepts and ideas on a non-competitive platform, and non-dancers get to try out discovering their inner interests through this stress free, non competitive environment. Event organisers, planners, logistics, tech crew learn so much from these processes over the summer break which most freshies would otherwise spend clubbing and drinking anyway.

3. NUS Rag cannot be separated from Flag, the traditional purpose of RaG(Receive and Give), is to return the favor given by the public(during flag), by putting up a show by the various Flag collecting bodies. If you are observant u should see the many beneficiaries attending the Rag events where ophans, elderly and the less fortunate watch and participate in the process as well, they are present at rag not to "enjoy the show" but to express their gratitude for the donations received through flag.

4. NUS Rag creates a certain vibrancy in NUS which NTU and SMU does not, many students from those unis are envious of NUS Rag and Flag and have times attempted to organise similar events. However without a backing of a strong legacy and system, it has been hard to pull off. NUS needs to invest in vibrancy to continually attract the best students and groom those with potential. A float's budget is about $5-10k depending on size of the group, most of these are fully-funded by sponsorships and canvassing over the 3 month summer break, i feel that its a worthy investment for all the unobvious positive benefits.

I could go on and on but TLDR, i feel that everyone should try rag once in their uni lives. If not, at least attend the event, NUS Rag and Flag is probably the only all inclusive event where students can feel like they are part of this huge vibrant community.

Think it will be interesting if NUSWhispers lasts till the upcoming General Elections...

I am certainly looking forward to the exponential increase in subject-matter experts, heated exchange of political views, and thoughts on which female political candidate is "the most chio" :D
-
 
 well, it's your perspective, I'll respect that. 

I'm one of those crude, rude people, so I can say (and mean, and ehh, this is just one of those tips kind of thing) that you have to make people like me really trust you if you want our behaviour towards you to change.

If it's anything, we look at others' characters, rather than their paper qualities and whatnot. This ain't a job interview.

So don't come near us if you are there with a selfish motive, if you are selfish and unwilling to lower down your ego, or you are there to test a sure-fire befriending formula you memorised. We have a lot of pride. It's insulting. We can and will spoil your formula. I did it before.

If it's for helping others, I do know that we'll be more than happy to help.

There are people who voice for RAG to continue to be held year after year, on the basis that RAG is a legacy that deserves to be protected and carried on. Proponents of RAG often cite two elements that make it worthy of remaining on the NUS calendar; the bonding of faculty/hall mates, as well as the fact that it is a long-standing NUS tradition. (The charity/fund-raising aspect is omitted because that distinctly belongs to Flag)

But are we really comfortable ignoring the fact that despite being billed as a environmentally friendly event, RAG ultimately results in tremendous wastage of resources? Or that participating bodies are spending an obscene and rather unnecessary amount of money on the floats? And that RAG creates competition among the participating bodies that sometimes borders on unhealthy?

But what is perhaps more important to ponder... Is RAG still the tradition and legacy that we want/need to protect? When something has lost its relevance and sense of purpose, which I believe has happened to RAG, then we should probably make a tough call and move on without it. 

Lest we forget, the tradition and legacy we want to protect is NUS', not RAG's. NUS' can still be furthered with other more relevant marquee events or initiatives.

Hey, why you never post my confession on the LGBT debate? It is very long and talking about Galen Strawson one.
-
 
Sometimes, when you speak to friends during lunch on topics like the potential exit of Greece from Eurozone, or the threat of ISIS and religious extremism, you get blank stares and calls of "Mmhm, I don't know anything leh.." 

I am not saying everyone should be well-versed with current or global affairs but... we are Singaporeans/residing in Singapore, and Singapore thrives on its connectivity to all parts of the world. Shouldn't we, as students in arguably the top university in Singapore and Asia, be at least equipped with some basic knowledge of what is happening around the world?

Hey, can you please post the very long confession on the LGBT debate (Galen Strawson) one? I lost my own writings because I didn't save it.

The TL;DR is this: Someone made a comment that LGBT did something wrong and should be punished but LGBT did nothing wrong according to Strawson. People should read up more to resolve some of the questions that they have for themselves.

[The Post]
Hello guys, this post is going to be me weighing into the LGBT (hereby referred to as ‘gay’ for brevity) debate raging on this couple of weeks.

I had encountered an argument online which is intriguing and henceforth, I would present the argument here and provide another perspective of it. Here, let us presuppose the axiom that whatever gays are doing is wrong (of course I would strongly disagree with that but that is not the point of THIS argument so let us accept this axiom for now, just for the sake of the argument). A certain author (henceforth, ‘the author’) online has claimed that since gays are claiming that it is beyond their control to do whatever they were doing (the ‘born this way’ claim) and therefore, should be forgiven for what they did (in the eyes of the law and of the society), then, by similar token, we should also forgive (and not punish) rapists, murderers and any criminals for their doings if they claim that their actions were beyond their control. Since we do not forgive (in the sense of not punishing) and we do punish criminals for their wrongdoings, similarly, we ought to not forgive gays and we should punish them for what they did. That is the end of the author’s argument.

On philosophical terms, how I would interpret his argument is this. The author claims that both rapist (or any other type of criminal) and gay are doing wrong. Both do not deserved to be pardoned from their wrongdoings. Therefore, we ought to punish them (for instance, jail them, send them to rehab centers etc).

Now, I would like to point out that a possible fundamental flaw with this argument lies on the understanding of morality and its existence. I will present a counter-argument here, but in no way I am claiming the argument to be right or even superior to the author’s point. What I am claiming here is: there exist a logical way of circumventing his conclusion by reconsidering what it means to be ‘wrong’.

In NUS there is a certain module known as Introduction to Philosophy and in that module, we learn easily that Galen Strawson has presented a very compelling argument against the existence of morality. His school of thought in this aspect is known as ‘moral nihilism’, the claim that there is no such thing as morality (right and wrong do not exist). For those who are not acquainted with his argument, I would briefly explain it here for your benefit. Of course, you can certainly read more by googling ‘Galen Strawson moral nihilism’.

Our universe MUST be either purely deterministic, indeterministic or a certain combination of both (i.e. maybe a 50/50 or 45/55 or whatever). This statement is obvious, extremely difficult to prove but as I will show later, the conclusion does not depend on whether our universe is of what nature. ‘Deterministic’ here refers to the phenomenon that any future event is caused by past event(s), that is, you reading this post is caused by you having a screen to read, having a screen to read is caused by you having the money to own the screen and so on. ‘Indeterministic’ then refers to the phenomenon that some events just occur out of nowhere, by no cause. Quantum mechanics is indeterministic in the sense that a particle can be at a certain position with a certain momentum but the laws is by nature, not predictive of the future trajectory of the particle (it is not due to the limitation of our theories but the fundamental nature of the universe is as such). Newtonian mechanics, on the other hand, is deterministic because a particle having a certain momentum and certain position will definitely be at some other position and momentum at future time according to the laws of physics. Okay, that is enough explanation for determinism here.

Now moving on to something known as ‘non-control thesis’. You are not morally deserving of any reward or punishment for anything (objects or actions) that you have no control over. That is, I suppose that if today we received news that a dead human body was found in Mars, nobody would blame you for his death since most probably you have absolutely no control over any event occurring on Mars. I guess this thesis is pretty much easily accepted. Of course there are attacks on this but that is a discussion left for another day.

Regardless whether our universe is deterministic, indeterministic or a combination of both, it must be so that we have no control over our actions. If the universe is deterministic, all events are caused by past events. Let’s say typing this post is morally wrong, but my thoughts of typing this post would be caused by reading the author’s argument and the event that the author typing out his argument would be caused by other events which are (events when traced back indefinitely) linked to our births or even to the beginning of the universe. All of which we have no control over. If the universe is indeterministic, all events occurred out of nowhere, by no cause, then they must be purely random events. ‘Random’ not in the sense of tossing the fair coin and having half the time heads etc because tossing of a fair coin is a purely deterministic event. If we know precisely enough the initial conditions of the event, with the laws of physics, we can predict definitively on which face the coin will land. ‘Random’ is then in the sense of randomness in Quantum Mechanics, totally unpredictable (predictable in another sense as the probabilities are definitively predictable). Since the events occurred out of randomness, having a sudden thought of wanting to eat ice cream or being gay is totally beyond my control. For how can I have control over purely random events? If I do have control over random events, then those events occur according to certain laws and therefore, not random. A universe which are both deterministic and indeterministic would mean only some events occurred randomly but it does not really matter here. As you can see, no matter what the nature of the universe is, we have no control over our actions, thoughts or any event that occurred.

Therefore, since we have no control over anything, then we would not be morally responsible for any of our actions. Since nothing we ever do (or think) can make us morally responsible and morality hinges on our conduct, it is meaningless to speak of morality and this translates to moral nihilism.

You may ask, then why do we punish people for their wrongdoings still? Strawson provided a utilitarian response to it, just one of many possible reasons. We punish people for their wrongdoings not because they had done something wrong (morally) but because they had caused harm to us. He separated the concept of ‘punishment/reward’ from the concept of ‘morality’. A person can be NOT morally responsible for his doings, e.g. he has no control over donating money to the poor and hence not deserving of his reward, but we can still reward or punish him for his doings for the sake of preserving the ‘good’ of our society, e.g. we can continue to praise him as a good person so that others can emulate his behavior and do more good to others.

Having said all these, what I have shown? What I hope to show is that, there are ways of thinking that can help to validate or disprove certain conclusions that one derived from self-inspection. He may have a question in mind (‘whether we should punish gays’) and formed his own answers to it (‘yes we should because we do punish criminals afterall’) from certain logical deductions but his answers to it may not be the best or even right (‘but maybe we punish criminals not because what they did is wrong but because they caused harm. If gays do not cause harm to the society, then should we still punish them?’). The author reached a certain conclusion by assuming certain axiom (‘what gays did is wrong’) but here I hope to show that by challenging the very fundamental axiom (‘what is wrong’? Does it exist?’), it can make his conclusion completely obsolete (‘if morality is proven not to be in existence then he ought to have another reason for punishing gays, one reason could be they cause harm to society but again, he ought to have reasons to prove that’). 

In conclusion, I certainly feel that having questions in our minds is good. We ought to have questions whenever we encounter any situation in life. We may have our answers to these questions and our answers can easily be derived from our own experiences and understanding. However, that is insufficient. Many questions that we asked ourselves had been asked by humans thousands of years ago and that is what philosophy is about, answering questions! Philosophers had dedicated their lives in search for answers to questions that every new generation will encounter (maybe once or twice) in their lives and given their brilliant minds, some of them have provided good answers which may not be right but certainly worth considering. I would implore every one of you that every time before you answer any question in your mind, especially those philosophical ones, check your answer with the literature available, read more, find out if someone else had already proven you to be wrong. It is in this manner of seeking answers, within yourself and from others, that we can consistently and constantly improve ourselves and more importantly, improve the lives of others whom we may cause harm from having the ‘wrong’ conclusion.

Thank you.

I tend to watch a considerable amount of pornographic material on a daily basis. I have a deep rooted fear that in future if I am to marry and have a daughter, I would run out of names to call my daughter. Imagine your wife wants to name your kid Lisa, Sarah, Sophie etc. but the first thing that comes to your mind is a famous pornstar's name!

How now, brown cow?

Thinking about my life these few days has reminded me of a quote from one of my favourite graphic novels of all time.

Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says "But Doctor... I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.

 What you have described is not surprising. In general (especially since the advent of social media), many see a need to distinguish themselves from others, be it as an individual or as a group. Being in a clique or group gives them a sense of identity, affiliation, exclusivity and specialness.

It is no doubt that everyone is unique and special in their own right. However, some just have a greater need to show to others that they are better off (socially, financially etc.). Perhaps, it satisfies their ego and quells their insecurities.

People compete and people compare. More so in Singapore, where there is growing social stratification. There are probably reasons (which I will not go into) why our culture is as such.

Therefore, do not expect everyone to be inclusive. That is just idealistic. Just ignore them and carry on, for you were merely observing human behaviour. Do not express disgust or jealousy--they feed off these feelings.

Do philosophy professors / students usually hold cruel views about other people? I read Peter Singer believes that parents should be given a choice to kill their severely disabled children AFTER they are born and their disabilities are discovered. It makes sense from a utilitarian point of view. But outside the classroom, how many parents will maximize their expected utility?

I'm in engineering, but I love languages much more. I consider myself a polyglot. I get this intense, intellectual orgasm when I learn a foreign language. I've truly enjoyed learning Spanish, Russian and Arabic in my free time and can honestly say that except for Russian, I've achieved intermediate levels in the other two. I'm pausing my Russian language studies now, and have for the last four months, started picking up Mandarin with the help of my very lovely Chinese friends, but I don't find myself enjoying it as much. 

I think I'm doing it for all the wrong reasons. I learned Spanish, Russian and Arabic for the simple joy of learning. There's no pressure to use it in my professional life. But I think I'm learning Mandarin because I feel I'll be disadvantaged in term of jobs and opportunities if I cannot speak Mandarin. :( It makes learning less enjoyable...

Just want to share with the NUSWhispers community an observation I made at my internship just now. I hate to generalize but this is an undeniable fact about many Singaporeans. This country prides itself on being socially advanced and a very friendly place with true multi-cultural integration. But more than that I see displays of complete insensitivity. It doesn't have to be a big display of racism, just a general outlook and behavior. 
You must all be familiar with those typical office cliques that form with women from the admin/business/sales/commercial sides. They're very close-knit and wary of outsiders. Well there's one on my floor and they are easily the noisiest and most visible of the entire staff. 
It's raining pretty heavily here and the nearby lunch options have hence become limited. So these bunch of local chinese aunties are quite good at taking care of their own group. No harm really, but this is where I come to the point of SENSITIVITY. 
They order pizza for their own group and bring it up here and eat it amongst themselves. They are doing it quite conspicuously and spreading aromas of pizza and garlic bread all over the place. Nobody expects them to offer it to everybody and throw a party or whatever, but why must they do it in the office environment in front of other colleagues they have gone and purposely excluded. 
There are SO many Muslim men and women who work in this office and are fasting during this holy month and hence decide to stay in during lunch and continue to work. These folk don't say anything of course, but shouldn't the onus be on this aunty clique to exercise some sensitivity?  
And then there's me and other interns and some people who are staying in during lunch to rush off a project submission. We all aren't greedy and childishly upset that we haven't got pizza. But we're hungry and tired people who don't appreciate being reminded of the fact that our stomachs are empty for the time being. 
Ok, I must get back to work. I and the other non-eaters will sit at our desks while the aunty clique takes up all the common area with their exclusive pizza party. And allow me to say that this is but a small example of their general unpleasant behavior that can easily be extrapolated to the wider community in Singapore. :(

What do you think of sibling who uses up whole family's education budget on mickey mouse degree?

Let's say there is a family with four children, and the parents save up about 80k to pay for their education. 

Then one of the siblings uses it all to go to UK or America or Australia to study for a course that has a super low return on interest (some Humanities subjects like English or Women's studies).

Then now this sibling thinks it's a big deal and acts like the "educated" one of the family.

What do you think of such a sibling? And what would you do if you had someone like that as a bro or sis?

Yesterday night, I was watching a local movie about marriage out of boredom. Then out of random, I went to to discuss with a guy out of curiousity about his opinion about marriage. According to him, he doesn't dreams about marriage as a guy but he thinks it is important to have a marriage to let everyone knows about it and show how much he values it and makes a public assurance to his wife in front of all the witnesses. He agrees with me though wedding to some extent is just for show.

I know I'm weird, but I'm a girl who doesn't wants a marriage. I don't dream about wedding dress or neither the ring. Engagement is compulsary though. To me, wedding is just something you show to others. Like a fanciful funeral also is to show others only. haha from the movie, I can imagine I might have a hard time with my future mother-in-law who might not agree with me. If the guy wants a wedding, then he probably has to plan most of it. I just dislike, but I will still follow my husband wishes if he desires a wedding. If you meant a wedding can be as a simple dinner with both parents there, I also have no desire to do that.

The same thing goes to having a child. I don't dream about being a mother. But I will give birth for my husband if he wants as long as my health allows + not too many children already + financially sufficient. It sounds like I'm forced to and partially its true. But a guy who can bear and wants a child but a wife who won't give is just going push his desire to find some other girl who will give birth for him.

I just wonder...guys opinion. Will you accept a future wife so aloof like that?

  "In my opinion, the readers who comment with their actual accounts generally give much more sincere advice since they actually have to stand by their suggestion."
And persons whom post anonymously aren't sincere? And they had nothing better to do but craft replies all day? I would say counting trolls aside, whether anonymous or not and whether or not you believe them to be good advices, by and large, they are sincere.

"On the contrary, those who reply anonymously (excluding those of personal experience) aren’t exactly able to step into the shoes of the OP, and simply gloss over the subject. Empty encouragements are worth as much as the sound the keyboard made while typing them."
Just because they don't express having been through the exact same experience, doesn't necessarily mean that they've not? And how exactly would you know they aren't able to step into the shoes of the OP unless you think you are able to or are the confessor for the many confessions of problems? If it's the former, what makes you think you are able to then, and not others? The OP should decide for himself/herself if the advices are useful, regardless if the advices are posted anonymously or not. Even if they aren't useful, is there any harm done? Compared to the confessors who are sincerely trying to help and whose posts may at the very most be not useful, here you are putting people down, people whom are willing to give up some of their time to try to help others and give their best opinions on the matter.

Sometimes I don't feel as if people understand me through their comments, but that doesn't change the fact that some of them really genuinely care about me and I really appreciate them being around. It's a privilege.

There really is no point worrying now is there? Just proceed on with life as usual and do the necessary medical follow ups. By "usual," I mean cherishing the moment if you are not already doing so, and whatever that entails. Live your life like the end is near. Do not be afraid to seem/to be vulnerable, desperate, different, small and so forth. That's what we all ought to be doing; to be the "best" we can be and want to be. For (1), that's what we ourselves want, either for ourselves or for others we deem important to us. For (2), life is just full of uncertainties, for the better or worse. A great read here is "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable."

STAY HOPEFUL :)

Hi everyone! I'm the guy who wrote in under . Since writing in, my girlfriend and I have talked how we are going to reveal our relationship to my family; in particular, to my mum. We also took the advice of  (appreciate it bro!) to discuss our cultural differences  and how we plan to raise our kids. These are issues we feel are important to talk about early in the relationship. We both agreed to let the kids decide for themselves (once they're able to) their religion but that it was important to both of us they are exposed to both our cultures. We also befriended another Chindian couple we got to know and I've to say that we are learning a lot from them.

The best part though is that my dad has already met my girlfriend on two occasions over dinner. He likes her a lot. My dad has made it a point to make me miserable by showing her embarrassing childhood photos of my naked self chilling in tubs. My dad's also promised me that he'll drop hints to my mum and that he will talk to her about it when the time is right. He's been so supportive and he respects that I'm an adult capable of making my own decision when it comes to a life partner. I know for sure that I'm gonna give my greatest effort with her no matter the odds. Seriously, she's so amazing. I really don't know how she puts up with my child-like and troll-ish behaviour I inherited from my dad. Lol!

Also, I remember reading a comment about teaching her basic Mandarin so that she could talk to my mum easier. That's not a problem because she speaks better Mandarin than I do. Say whaaat!? See lah, how not to love her?? Anyway, that's all I've to say. Just wanted to write a quick note on our progress. Appreciate all the comments and best wishes left!!! :) Dhanyavad! Curry is life!

Been following nuswhispers for quite a while already and while there are a lot of romance stories including LGBT and interracial. I do hope to see more LDR related confessions especially if both parties have different nationalities, because this is my current situation and I am hoping to learn some insights from others success/failure stories. Thanks! :)

Let's be honest and not kid ourselves here. Girls in their teens go for sweet talk and feelings, girls in their late teens to early twenties go for looks and height. Girls in their late twenties on look for stability, maturity and wealth.

Guys on the other hand, handsome and charismatic guys get all the pretty girls at the start but wealthy and smart guys finish the race best.

Don't give comments that I'm over generalizing and overly pessimistic because I am not. In the real world, pragmatism and money is king and no one can deny that. Feelings, albeit important, can't bring food to the table or comfort to living.

I'd like to end of by saying, money, money, money, must be funny, in a rich man's world.

Tl;Dr: since love is love, where do we draw the line? Paedophilia? Incest?

Gay marriage is socially acceptable. And that's fine. But where do you draw the line for #LoveIsLove ? I feel the argument for "All love is the same" is flawed. 

Should paedophilia be legal? An older person wanting to marry a teen? I mean if they both consent, then isn't it the same as everyone else? 

Then you'll use the argument that a minor does not know what they want yet. Alright. So what about incest? 

It would be between two consenting adults. Their marriage doesn't affect anyone else as it is between them and "not anybody's business" 

"Oh but their children will come out deformed and retarded." 

Just because they are married doesn't mean that they have to make children. Gay people can't even produce children together. So why shouldn't incestual couples be allowed to adopt? Also from a scientific standpoint, mutations from in-breeding don't come about immediately. It comes about only after generations of inbreeding. Most designer pets are products of inbreeding as well.

Call me a prude, but I always thought it was the norm to wait until marriage before having sex. Premarital sex just doesn't seem worth it since there's the risk of the girl getting pregnant (even with protection) and you might get STDs or worse of all, HIV, from someone you may not end up marrying. Guess the sex ed I got in school was too effective LOL. But in uni, there are so many stories about couples doing it, especially if they stay on campus. And even FWB-something I thought only happened in American TV shows or books -.- Is being a virgin really that uncommon? Is sex expected when you're in a relationship?

 when I read the first few lines of your post I almost thought you were my half-sibling. But I only have one half-sibling, so we're definitely not related lol.

I come from the 'legal' side and I just want to share the 'legal' side's perspective. Apologies if this whole post isn't coherent at all because it's late at night. I didn't know my dad had a whole other family until I was 19 when my grandfather passed away and my dad wanted his illegitimate child to come pay his last respects. Worse still, he was younger than my sis and older than me, which means.. you know.. 
The whole story and why my dad still kept this woman was revealed to me by my mom. This news broke my heart so much as I've always held high regards for my dad. How could he hurt my mom like that? At that point I hated my dad more than I hated the illegitimate mother and son (although I also really hated that woman). 
During my grandfather's wake, I finally met the two of them. You can say I had that "holier than thou" attitude towards the woman but I knew the kid - my half-brother - was as innocent as me. He didn't choose to be an illegitimate child and he probably felt a lot lonelier than I did during that period, since I had my sis. So we decided to treat him like a friend and got to know one another over the next few days. When we parted ways after the funeral, we never saw each other again nor contacted each other. He is in NUS too but every time I go to school I hope that I never have to bump into him or end up in the same classes as him. I hate awkward situations.

Coming from the 'legal' side, I'll never put the blame on the children. It was the adults who decided to complicate things and f up their lives and families. For me I have no respect for "the other woman" because she was the one who couldn't accept my father breaking up with her and attempted suicide. He took it upon himself to be responsible for her and has been financially supporting her including buying her a flat (she never worked). I don't know how much of a role my dad has played as husband and father for the other family and I don't want to know. Granted he was the one who played with fire in the first place, I forgave my dad after some time since he is my dad after all. I learned to think these adult matters are not my problem but I will never acknowledge "her". (Also she tried to show off to my grandma that she gave birth to a boy while my mom had 2 girls, as told by grandma.) Whatever half-siblings I have, I will treat them as equals if the situation calls for such interaction. Other than that, you lead your life and I lead mine. Both parties will be happier this way. 

I think it is human nature for people to side the 'legal' party because they already have that status established in black and white. Some third parties are victims, some are not. People who don't know your story may look down on you just because you're born out of wedlock, but keep in mind not to let this validate who you are as an individual. There are a lot of single-parent children out there too so you are never alone. Kudos to your mom for being such a strong woman and hope you will continue being filial to her.

TLDR; I'm from the legal side. My perspective is I won't judge my half-siblings based on their (our?) parents' mistakes. Leave all the complications with that generation and don't bring it down with us. Also your mom is super strong, please be good to her.

In response to 

" "Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view. That ends today," Roberts wrote. "Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept."

Roberts disparaged the majority decision by saying that it was nothing more than a flimsy argument.

"Stripped of its shiny rhetorical gloss, the majority's argument is that the Due Process Clause gives same-sex couples a fundamental right to marry because it will be good for them and for society," Roberts wrote. "If I were a legislator, I would certainly consider that view as a matter of social policy. But as a judge, I find the majority's position indefensible as a matter of constitutional law." 

"If not having the opportunity to marry 'serves to disrespect and subordinate' gay and lesbian couples, why wouldn't the same 'imposition of this disability,' ... serve to disrespect and subordinate people who find fulfillment in polyamorous relationships?" he writes. "I do not mean to equate marriage between same-sex couples with plural marriages in all respects. There may well be relevant differences that compel different legal analysis. But if there are, petitioners have not pointed to any." "

This should be what is troubling you. Not all the blind following etc. Do you think governments really care that much? The power of the governments lie in their political will power not in being construed as a blind follower etc. Governments don't really care about whether they are considered a blind follower or not, as long as their policies are perceived as being beneficial to the population.

Of which, I think the legislation has far reaching consequences that many need to consider.

My only reaction to US passing the same sex marriage law: ok lor

Its not like anyone will now start caring for the Dalits, sexual slaveries by the LRA, oppressed Vegetarianism in France, Islamicphobia etc.. Not like these real and severe injustices actually matter in the first place among first world screams of 'we want equal rights to love the same sex!'.

 An ideology won, not love. Love never won, in fact love is still on the losing end in the universal sense.

So the US Supreme Court made a landmark decision by legalising same-sex marriage and most people in the US and elsewhere in the world erupted in joy. But I find this a little troubling. Not because I oppose homosexuality, I am all in favour of LGBT rights. In fact I am against any sort of distinction between humans, even between males and females.

But I am troubled because this decision affects people living only in the United States of America. Why are we (people living in Asia) celebrating it by colouring our profile pics and all? It is not a case of some European country finding a vaccine for AIDS that will eventually benefit us in Asia. It is also not a case wherein a country XYZ in Africa finally gets a democratic government and we can all celebrate that another troubling government has fallen. This is a decision that only affects the USA. And for us living in Asia, it only means 2 things. 1. What happens in the USA does not affect the rest of the world, especially legal decisions. 2. If you feel that your country now has a greater chance of leagalising same-sex marriage now that 'America' has legalised it, then your country is just a loyal dog of the US and a sucker of American policies. It is precisely this thing that troubles me.

Sure it is good news that barriers to equality are slowly being removed in more and more places in the world. First the Irish, then the Americans. But this just calls for a tweet or two congratulating the Americans and then hoping, if not working towards such policies in our own countries.  Celebrating with them is not going to alleviate us from our own miseries. In fact it might just make it worse.

I am sure lawmakers in India and 'China' are not going to follow suit anytime soon. They cannot be seen as blind followers of American policies when they have such culturally rich societies and have now become important world powers. And what about countries like Malaysia and Indonesia? Many of their leaders in various positions of power have condemned several modern policies as blatant acceptance of western culture, slowly eroding their own cultures. Over-joyous celebration of this American achievement jeopardises genuine LGBT movements in these countries that may have begun on their own, without being influenced by westernisation. Now, instead of these movements citing the American ruling as support for their cause, the over-joyous celebration may result in leaders opposing homosexuality further strengthening their chant that western culture has invaded and destroyed their culture. And lastly, what about Singapore? Will this landmark American ruling change anything in Singapore?

Thus, to me, this American victory is a sad realisation of the misery of our mostly conservative Asian societies. We may have excelled economically and technologically, but we are still backward socially. This issue, along with free speech is rubbing salt into our closed society wounds. While the US Supreme Court announcement is definitely good news for humanity that calls for some celebration, we must pause to think what it means to us living in a politically divided real world. Does it mean that our LGBT friends will now call USA their home when they decide to settle? And we must also not forget that the US Congress can always overturn this decision by enacting a law, although highly unlikely.

Sorry for the long post. But my point is basically suggesting that we should not celebrate too much because it does not affect us living in Asia. I had to make this post here because most of my friends including me are straight and if I start this discussion with them they will just start teasing me 'as somebody is coming out of the closet'. (But I know I am straight because I know what my penis gets excited at)

So what do you guys think?

I'll be honest. I think NUS Whispers is far more important than its pure entertainment value we seem to think.

I mean it's an open platform for us to share our ideas, and also listen to other peoples' perspectives and debate them, under the veil of anonymity if necessary.

This interaction is absolutely crucial in the functioning of a democracy. This IS freedom of speech. Freedom of speech isn't the freedom to insult and verbally injure anyone as you please (yes, fuck charlie hebdo, seriously.). Freedom of speech is the freedom to voice your perspectives, and to let everyone have a precious, privileged glimpse into your life and how you feel things, because this glimpse will change, and hopefully help refine how society is being run.

And THIS, my friends, is the core of freedom of speech. This is why freedom of speech is so important to a democracy. If we truly want to be democratic, it's not just about having free and open elections to cast votes. It's about helping other people see how and why the things they do injure us, and then humbly plead or negotiate for a change that is acceptable (or least injurious) to all parties involved.

This is why I think while it may be sickening to some, the countless pro- and anti-LGBT posts are both important, because it grants us precious perspective as a society.

The sex posts and gf/bf posts, while entertaining, are important too. They help us to negotiate, debate, and reconstruct social norms over these issues behind the safety of anonymity, as opposed to blindly accepting the norms our grandfathers handed down and imposed upon us.

I should remind you that it's through dialogue such as this that the black man came to no longer be thought of as 2/3 of a man, and women were acknowledged as discrete individuals.

I can't post this because I have my family on fb. I just wanted to get this off a bit, so pardon me for a while.

I am an illegitimate son. Which means, my father and mother weren't married, but my mom was supposed to be the "3rd party" in a relationship. The entire side of my father's family does not know of my existence (nor my mom's for that matter), less my late grandfather who left me an heirloom, my father and my brother of the same age. 

When my mom was found to be communicating with my father, my father simply told his wife, "she clung on to me", to describe the very same woman, who was a divorcee from a previously abusive relationship, who raised 3 children on her own for the next many years to come. 

Ironically,he was the one who clung on to us, for the good many years, up til the day I ORD-ed, and pulled him in for my parade simply because I felt obligated to. We had to cut off all contact with him, sever all ties, to protect our peace.

Being an illegitimate son, it has its perks. I have a strong-as-hell mother, and a warm family to go back to. I didn't learn how to appreciate that, until when I was down and out on my first relationship (very short one, don't even think it counted as one now that I think about it),and had a depression for the next year and a half or so which costed me my grades. My mom was worried sick then, when I went on my own selfish reasons to climb a mountain. My family, and friends, many of whom have moved on ahead without me (well, not hard to see why), supported me through this phase. I also don't see the need for a fatherly figure in my life, simply because I never saw the need for one.

However, being an illegitimate child also has its down sides. Due to my family being a single-parent family, my mom has had her fair share of stresses. Precisely because she had to work, I was left alone, and developed major behavioural and attitude problems, and did not really develop much of normal behaviours, to be able to even talk properly to others (much less hold a conversation). My friendships do not last, because I react instinctively to kick away anyone who gets too close to me, because I am afraid to let anyone get close. I tend to excessively overthink things a lot. I do believe that I stand as a living example of why, if you can provide a proper family, you should do so, and make every effort you can, spare or not, to maintain it very well at that.

I do not have much of memories to speak of, because the stuff I was supposed to remember my childhood by were burnt away - when the storage place where it was stored conveniently caught fire. Why was it stored away? Family politics - my photos were ordered not to be put up in my mom's home, until one of my uncles got married. 

I do find it offensive if they start putting people in families such as mine down with a certain "holier than thou" attitude, though. They will never understand what it means for people to be in families such as mine, much less, possess any right to call us sinners, etc. This world ain't flat, those who live on flat ground shouldn't criticise those who don't with hurtful words.

I didn't ask to be born,but I have a life thrust upon me. I don't intend to continue wasting it. 

CQ (name edited by admin), if you can read this, treasure your family, take care of your father, because I have my own family, and my own life to take care of. We, over here at my side of my family, do not plan to destroy our long-held peace, and I hope you didn't come to NUS, or FoE, because it'll be pretty damned awkward if I actually happen to meet you.

Those around me would know who I am, albeit at different parts, but at least now you can see a bit more of the picture. I do trust that you'll maintain the secrecy of my matters.

 Hmmm would you personally be comfortable being the main breadwinner of your family (I'm assuming in a long-term thing). It may be quite likely that you will have the higher pay in your working lives than him.

Unfortunately though, Singapore is a very practical minded society. While you may not face a problem with it, it seems that he will tend to struggle to some extent. 

Considering what you said that he does for you, I would recommend continuing with him. 

As for parents, I guess you know how they feel about such things (it's for your own interest!) but usually they won't and can't intervene much, even less so after you start working. Would you personally prefer a peaceful home life but lack the 'happiness'? Or do you seek the happiness at the expense of some conflicts with your parents? One thing here: continuing this relationship will definitely lead to conflicts. The extent, it depends on how aggressively and how often you push it.

Yet, there's still a long way for the both of you. Give it more time and see whether he 'improves', after all, if he really loves you, I'm sure he will eventually try to work on it. Sometimes people don't really 'get it' when young.

To the OP of  
Ask yourself how much you value your parents' opinion on this - if your mum's objection does affect you, then my advise here would be to end the relationship. It's probably for the better.

Of course, if your parents' opinion isn't the biggest worry for you, then you should put your faith in J. He stayed by your side when you were at your lowest, and you should treasure anyone who does that - such people are really really rare now (solely my opinion). From what it seems, he really loves you, and personally - that's the most important thing. He might not be rich now, but you never know what the future holds - for him, and for the both of you. Work it out together. Speak to him, and let him know what your concerns are. I'm quite sure he'll work hard.

All the best.

I saw a Facebook post about a secondary school boy in Singapore committing suicide after being bullied for being gay, and I just want to say, no matter if you're for or against the LGBT community, please be mindful of what you say, write or post. Words can indeed be powerful tools, and especially so when you feel protected from repercussions.

Perhaps we should start to accept beyond races and religions, but before that, let's at least not go all nazi and dismiss all whose opinions are different from our own.

I speak fluent hokkien Cantonese,  simple bahasa and certain European languages on top of our standard  bilingual skills taught in schools. Some friends and most ladies would go woahhh everytime I speak it with elderly or foreign tourist and friends. 

Little do they know the shallow reasons I picked them up. First to order nasi padang, Chinese food(depend on hawker owner dialect ), almost always they will be extra ingredients such as egg meat or simply more gravy. muahahaha. 

And I hate watching Canto taiwanese shows in subtitles too.

There have been a number of posts about being unable to find love due to average appearances/personality or people only being attracted to them for looks and money. I have a slightly different problem. 

Everytime I get close to someone, I get anxious and distance myself. Why? Because I have an autistic brother which I will have to take care of in the future.  Essentially this means I have a +1 dependent with special needs before I start a family of my own. (and no, he is not "high functioning". Jokes alluding to Amos Yee is unappreciated.) 

I can't bear the thought of having someone else share this responsibility. It just does not seem to seem fair to the other person. For abit of background, Singapore doesn't have special homes for autistic people and neither do they belong in IMH. Does anyone face a similar problem? Would you mind if your future spouse as a special needs dependent?

This post is probably gonna get a lot of hate, but I just want to know if anyone agrees with me.

I find it really ridiculous whenever I see posts boasting about how Singapore has the greatest food in the world. It's just kind of stupid. I mean these people have certainly not visited any other Asian countries if they say that. I honestly feel like most of the food here is kind of bland. The chili sauce here is too sweet and not hot enough to be called chili. And please stop about the chili crab or durians. You can get those in other South East Asian countries for just a fraction of the price here and they would probably taste the same if not better. 

Anyway sorry for the rant. I don't even know what I'm trying to achieve by posting this here. maybe I just miss the food back home so much.

 How exactly are such rankings derived? What do these rankings really mean?

Learn to seek validation from yourself instead of from others, while still valuing the opinions of others of course, if they matter to you. Don't let the standards of others set the standards of you for you. As long as you are comfortable with yourself, that's all that should matter.

Ask yourself if you've tried your best. If not, work harder. If you've tried your best and still unsatisfied (yes, reality deems results important), work harder. Keep in mind though, grades are a very inaccurate measure for competency in many areas; just think of how the are materials are tested (no, this is not an excuse for not working hard).

Again, why do you even think you need to particularly good at anything? And I highly doubt you are not particularly good at anything. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Such so-called talents need not be obvious to the eye; it may be something such as being able to think very abstractly. Or maybe what you are looking for here is that your strengths are not as good as the strengths of others. Does that matter? Why?

If you really want to change that much, what's stopping you? No one is stopping you except yourself. Lack courage? Gain courage. And so on and so forth. Or else, you will only look back at yourself in the future with self-pity and regrets.

Last but not least, I personally think there's a very big and main problem existing in some people whom confess here and whom seek advice. What you really need is not people telling you what to do. What you really need is finding out what you need to do based on the different perspectives/information/knowledge provided and being made available to you either on this platform or elsewhere. Learn to think for yourself. Information/knowledge sure are important, but equally if not more important is having the necessary ability/skill set (personally, I think the ability to think is very valuable in all areas of life). Perhaps that's why I'm replying with more questions than answers. Also, another reason is perhaps that we ought to take responsibility for our own lives. Yes, that too means analysing, critically thinking and being skeptical about what I've just said.

Press on and take care. <3

Is celebrating "Rag and Flag"  environmentally friendly? On the surface, we make use of recyclable materials to make float, but we do use some environmentally harmful substances (paints, spray) to complete our arts work. 

What is more, there are some building blocks for float, for examples the container of vitagen or can, we do not search it from dustbins or collect it from our neighborhood, we produce it! Which of course is a wrong concept of protecting the mother earth. 

 It takes long time (3 months) and many manpower to finish as well. If we  devote all our time to do recycle activities, helping the needy, wouldn't it be more helpful?

Due to my religious background, I was quite flabbergasted to see recent posts both about relationship and sexuality here, as far as my belief is concerned, they are considered as fornication, a category of serious sin. I considered those as totally unacceptable.

Nevertheless, post  also made me realize that I overlooked a crucial teaching, which is GRATITUDE (CMIIW every major religious belief that I know teaches that). The sense of confidence and self-sufficiency can arise from being thankful of what God has given unto me, including who I am, what I have, and even what I don't have (or maybe haven't had).

The bottom line is that I am not proselyting, but perhaps I should change my mindset, from making too much fuss on what are immoral, what are sins (although they are still important) to focusing on the positive values that can bring goodness to self and, more importantly, to others.

My two cents and self-advice

Why are some individuals here so concerned about relationships, not getting into one, or even talking about the inequality regarding giving oral sex!

Imo, if people allocate more time to more constructive matters such as financial planning, career goals, current affairs or life goals, and stop being overly concerned over such primitive and primal matters, they'll be much more likely and capable to succeed in their lives and then those inducials who are concerned over such insignificant things in life, such shallow beings.

Relationships, a healthy one, and the most right and pretty girl will come to one naturally, if one has the right attitude, perspective and morals. Those people who are just concerned over being evergreen and giving blowjobs and not getting anything in return are just giving up their chance to lead a good life and putting their eggs in the wrong basket. Only the  people who are concerned over meaningful things and with good morals will lead a fruitful, if not successful life.

Just my two cents..

 I actually prefer to go down on the girl vs receiving a bj. seeing a girl pleasured from that perspective is one of the hotest things a guy can experience. but from what i understand, this is an unpopular opinion. Most girls just tolerate the inequality and give in. A relationship should be balanced and mutual. if he puts his pleasures over yours and expects you to "service" him unconditionally, despite you explicitly bringing the issue up, you might really want to consider your relationship. And if you compromise, you just feed his chauvanism and sense of entitlement. I guess you you could give him an ultimatum - "go down on my or no smexy time for you"

What women look for in a man: Charisma, confidence, sense of humour, kindness, respect and stability. I am not sure if there are such people out there, or if its possible to attain most of such qualities. Is it worthwhile to attain all them qualities with lots of effort? Also is it necessary to do all that to get a girlfriend? Hell i am still single and need help.

TLDR: Stop being passive complainers on NUSWhispers and go create the change. 

For every ranter on NUSWhisper about the unfairness of grades, job discrimination, gender inequality/singlehood woes and the LGBT war. 

Your voice might be heard online and anonymously, maybe change the opinions of a few receptive readers for that moment, but probably result in little to no change in the action of others. 

If you want a change that benefits yourself, or your community or society, please just go out there and make the change. Nothing ever got better without some effort or sacrifices.

I'm a Singaporean holding a grant-funded research position. Due to a number of factors, including (especially) the employer's CPF contribution, I cost nearly a quarter more than a non-Singaporean on the same scale and holding the same qualifications.

It's easy to say 'stay relevant' and 'make yourself worth the extra money', but can one really make himself a whole quarter more useful than the next individual in an academic environment full of highly talented people of different nationalities and, perhaps more importantly, scarce funding?

It's not the Govt's responsibility to ensure you have a cushy job or a decent pay. All it can is provide the environment and frameworks for people to succeed. Not just the rich, but for everyone. 

If you got ousted from a job, look at yourself before pointing the finger at the entire world. Did you stay relevant? Did your performance meet expectations? Why were you let go? Did you constantly upgrade yourself? Did you add value to your company?

It's easy to be that coffeeshop uncle ranting at gahmen for every shit that befalls him. But the coffeeshop uncle fails to realize that while he is sitting at the coffeeshop ranting, everyone else is at work.

The dangerous mentality that 1) poverty is the ultimate reason why you cannot succeed and 2) you succeed only because you are rich; has got to stop.

This goes especially to the growing horde of misinformed youths putting down other more successful peers with flimsy arguments, citing that they were born privileged which led to eventual success. Success is a result of determination, talent, and a bit of luck. To those who were poor and eventually succeeded, congratulations and keep working hard. To those who have not, quit whining about inequality and get your ass to work.

So...my father is currently on bail for some criminal charges. As much as I promise my mother that I will not blame him for the damage and instability he brought to the family, it is hard not to feel a really profound sense of jealousy this Father's Day when your friends and relatives are posting pictures and texts about how proud they are of their dads..... Sigh, just want to get this off my chest.

In the past, employers deal with manpower issues by giving training and apprenticeship to students. Now alot of them stop doing that. Instead they want you to have experience before joining them. And they claimed there is manpower shortage and want more foreign workers.

OP clearly hasn't been in the shoes of those whose jobs have been taken over by foreigners. He/she doesn't understand why some people feel that way. 

At the end of the day, if your boss comes in and tells you that you have been replaced and displaced by a foreigner who is willing to do the same work, better than you and at a lower wage, I don't think a number of us will simply sit there and say "hey, he's better than me, he deserves the job." 

You will be sitting there, wondering how to make ends meet, why you have been replaced, and how you are going to get a new job at your age. And no, some of us don't get stuck in the trench by choice.

Then again, we cannot cherry-pick foreign talent. If we let in low-skilled workers, we have to let in the upper elites, etc. (not an easy process to control entirely either). 

I work with these "low-skilled" workers you speak of, and I can tell you that they do not have the same self-entitling mindset as a lot of people you see around (you should observe yourself, and your surroundings more, observe how others behave, especially if you work in the retail sector). 

You have to leave your comfort zone. They live outside your comfort zone. It's just convenient to blame them.

Singapore is no longer what it used to be, and we have to face facts, move on with the world and times if this country is to survive.

If you have a plan that satisfies everyone, does not cause any instability in this country, you are free to push it out. Talk is cheap, armchair criticism is easy. To speak with gravity, to take action and not talk cheap words, is what gets things going.

To 

Came across the post of the OP having concerns on his/her 'B+'s, in which the OP was slammed for his/her views.

Those that were not criticising the post were telling/advising the OP to be contend with his/her grades.

Didn't you guys enroll in NUS with the expectations to do your best? Why let your previous grades and your peers pull down your expectations? 

My two cents? OP, don't give up! Continue to strive for 'A's! If you are already putting in hardwork and not receiving the grades you deserve, consult your seniors or your prof. Hardwork doesn't equal high grades, sometimes other factors such as the way you answer the question or probably your study methods could be better.

To conclude, I was really to disappointed with the comments on  mocking, slamming, discouraging (intentionally/unintentionally) a fellow peer striving for high grades. This is where I found out how fortunate I am to have friends around me whom I could complain to for my B grades. Friends around me that motivate each other to strive for the best and to understand that IT IS OK to not want a B.
-
 
  
Because celebrating mediocrity and bashing success is in vogue these days. The reality is that if you cannot break the B+ barrier then you are simply not good enough. Maybe your parents and past report cards said you "can do it if you try". Well of course you can, but it may cost you far too much. People don't understand the difference between theoretical possibility and realistic possibility. SAP 5.0 is a theoretical possibility for all but a realistic possibility for many. Nobody is entitled to success, you want it, work for it. It's not for everyone. Success is also not so narrowly defined to solely academic success either. Yes it is important, as an ordinary person with no connections, getting second upper is the only way to make it past the HR algorithms and human eyes. But it is not the only thing. People need to stop putting academic success on only either end of the "importance spectrum" and realise its a sliding ruler depending on industry and role.

 the 'friend backdoor' is another misconception. I think a close friendship should be the foundation of a healthy relationship. From experience. Only then do you get to know a person through and through, with judgement unclouded by the sometimes blinding excitement of the initial dating phase.

TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could 
To where it bent in the undergrowth;         5
 
Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps the better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same,         10
 
And both that morning equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black. 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 
I doubted if I should ever come back.         15
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.

-------------------------------------------

This has got to be among the best-known, most-often-misunderstood poems on the planet. Several generations of careless readers have turned it into a piece of Hallmark happy-graduation-son, seize-the-future puffery. Cursed with a perfect marriage of form and content, arresting phrase wrought from simple words, and resonant metaphor, it seems as if “The Road Not Taken” gets memorized without really being read. For this it has died the cliché’s un-death of trivial immortality.

But you yourself can resurrect it from zombie-hood by reading it—not with imagination, even, but simply with accuracy. Of the two roads the speaker says “the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” In fact, both roads “that morning lay / In leaves no step had trodden black.” Meaning: Neither of the roads is less traveled by. These are the facts; we cannot justifiably ignore the reverberations they send through the easy aphorisms of the last two stanzas.

One of the attractions of the poem is its archetypal dilemma, one that we instantly recognize because each of us encounters it innumerable times, both literally and figuratively. Paths in the woods and forks in roads are ancient and deep-seated metaphors for the lifeline, its crises and decisions. Identical forks, in particular, symbolize for us the nexus of free will and fate: We are free to choose, but we do not really know beforehand what we are choosing between. Our route is, thus, determined by an accretion of choice and chance, and it is impossible to separate the two.

This poem does not advise. It does not say, “When you come to a fork in the road, study the footprints and take the road less traveled by” (or even, as Yogi Berra enigmatically quipped, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it”). Frost’s focus is more complicated. First, there is no less-traveled road in this poem; it isn’t even an option. Next, the poem seems more concerned with the question of how the concrete present (yellow woods, grassy roads covered in fallen leaves) will look from a future vantage point.

The ironic tone is inescapable: “I shall be telling this with a sigh / Somewhere ages and ages hence.” The speaker anticipates his own future insincerity—his need, later on in life, to rearrange the facts and inject a dose of Lone Ranger into the account. He knows that he will be inaccurate, at best, or hypocritical, at worst, when he holds his life up as an example. In fact, he predicts that his future self will betray this moment of decision as if the betrayal were inevitable. This realization is ironic and poignantly pathetic. But the “sigh” is critical. The speaker will not, in his old age, merely gather the youth about him and say, “Do what I did, kiddies. I stuck to my guns, took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.” Rather, he may say this, but he will sigh first; for he won’t believe it himself. Somewhere in the back of his mind will remain the image of yellow woods and two equally leafy paths.

Ironic as it is, this is also a poem infused with the anticipation of remorse. Its title is not “The Road Less Traveled” but “The Road Not Taken.” Even as he makes a choice (a choice he is forced to make if does not want to stand forever in the woods, one for which he has no real guide or definitive basis for decision-making), the speaker knows that he will second-guess himself somewhere down the line—or at the very least he will wonder at what is irrevocably lost: the impossible, unknowable Other Path. But the nature of the decision is such that there is no Right Path—just the chosen path and the other path. What are sighed for ages and ages hence are not so much the wrong decisions as the moments of decision themselves—moments that, one atop the other, mark the passing of a life. This is the more primal strain of remorse.

Thus, to add a further level of irony, the theme of the poem may, after all, be “seize the day.” But a more nuanced carpe diem, if you please.

I share your exact thoughts when I was younger (and still do). The generosity of these GPs is definitely respectable and laudable. For those who wish to spot them, here are two signs: 1. Old, neighbourhood clinics. 2. GPs with frugal lifestyles e.g. living in an HDB above the clinic.

That being said, I read some idealistic comments pertaining to materialism which I do not quite agree with. Perhaps, I can offer a more balanced perspective.

1. Face it, money makes the world go round. There is nothing wrong with being concerned (not obsessed) with money in today's context. After all, the cost of living is going up. You need money for practically everything these days. Also, charity begins at home. Not everyone has the ability or means to give to others comfortably.

2. We all have hopes and dreams--some may be more noble than others, but there is no "correct" or "wrong" aspiration. Some of these dreams require money. Is it wrong to enjoy the finer things in life (within reason, of course)? In today's age of consumption, it is easy to call somebody "materialistic". By that same logic, all bankers and businessmen who profit are "money-minded".

So now, there is no need to be (or sound) righteous and all. To each his own. Not everyone can live like a saint or monk. That being said, we should all do our best to give back. Most importantly, it should come from the heart.

In defense of JW (cult), I was part of them for 7-8 years. (i consider myself agnostic at this moment) I've attended several of their Kingdom Hall meetings in malaysia. I am writing this in response from the guy who is ex-JW earlier.
In my experience they are really no different from a typical small christian church (excluding mega churches) except that 

1. they do have some form of tithing but its never hard-pushed onto us nor used to shame people who don't give money. i know all megachurches and some small churches are into this. the only thing I have given them is my time. not once have i ever felt taken advantaged of, and people are in this generally for their beliefs. 

2. like all religions, members are compelled to be God-ly in behaviour, however JW tend to be a more close knitted bunch. Rationale being from some of the verses in the Bible which advised against associating with un-God-ly beings. in fact most of these people are single, or marry within JW.

3. there are some hard-to-stomach values like blood being sacred stemming from some Old Testament verses (i think?), and JWs take this rather seriously and DO NOT opt for blood transfusions even if its the only means to save lives. Rationale being that going against God's word is more sinful than allowing one to die. I always had an issue since at the start, I told my JW mentor and peers that I definitely do not subscribe to this idea and that while I will factor blood transfusions as a sin, it will not be the end-it-all factor. I believe saving one's life so that he can do good things on Earth is also a desirable outcome.

4. one cult-like behaviour is that they take "bearing no allegiance to politics and nations" to quite an extreme. not bearing arms for NS will get them into military court martial resulting in 3year3months sentence. almost a rite of passage every Singaporean JW male go through (which I didn't) I told my mentor that I really do not see the point in this, because a significant bunch of Singaporeans see this as a disruption in their lives and they LLST go ahead with it anyway. 

5. this "end of the world" is very real to JW. they take the book of Revelations quite seriously as well. But I don't think anybody thinks "OMG THE WORLD IS GOING TO END :(" and emo all day long. 

Apart from taking the Bible in a very literal sense, JW's aren't very different from other fundamentalist christian denominations. If you follow the evolution VS creationism debate (NOT the youtube ones because they were laughable) and go deep into say, the fossil evidence discussion, one would realise things are not so simple as the evolutionists put it. Okay I realise I sound like I am proselytizing now...

I believe my experience with JW might be a tad different from most other JWs. in fact most of my weekly sessions towards the middle/end of my 7-8 years with them involved me reading scientific journals and studying david hume (yes i know it sound ridiculous). my mentor presented evidence/arguments in favor of creationism, and of course i also do read about arguments in favor of evolution. i have never once felt brainwashed. (or maybe my mentor just suck at it haha) In fact I kinda drifted off from JW because of a very fundamental belief i hold, that is to do good to people who strive to do good, whereas they believe in only associating with people in their faith.

Anyway if you meet with a JW, chances are that if you allow them, they will attempt to convert you. While it might come across as annoying to non-believers, JWs are doing this because of their beliefs. But other than that they are generally nice chaps, some might be more detached from society due to point 2.

Looking at all the LGBTQA "wars" going on here, I noticed a 'trend' (sort of)

Most arguments are seemed to be focus on the G (ie gay). Of course, it's likely so due to a larger proportion of gay people compared to the other groups. But I think it's time we pay attention to the other parts and think about the issues they face to. 

The 'A' (asexual) group is perhaps the least affected. These people aren't particularly interested in sexual relations with any gender, and although biologically (reproduction-wise) it is not normal, society doesn't really care much. (note: some asexual people do have children).

In Singapore, sex between females is legal so I wouldn't really comment much on it. 

Perhaps we can look into the T and the Q group? These people have real struggles, that are made 'invisible' by whether "should 377a be legal, or gay marriage be allowed). Although there is a right to change one gender in Singapore, the group (esp We are against pinkdot) and FCBC's Lawrence Khong have commented that it is unnatural and sinful. 

I'm not saying that the matter of 377a should be ignored, I simply felt that the voices and debate over the T, Q and A should be discussed more. What do you all think about people who believe they are the other gender/not sure (or define themselves as gender neutral) and asexual?

For those arguing against, those fighting from a theological, political or economic standpoint with regards to this LGBT debate. Please remember that WHAT you are talking about is more of a topic of WHO. Who are you talking about? Who's lives are you discussing? Who's lives are you debating? Who's lives are you generalising? Who's lives are hurting? 

It will always be a personal issue for people who are living the debate. There are real faces, real people. For me, it is easier to feel for the topic because I have friends who are living the pain of being LGBT. I cannot say the same for those arguing against, because I doubt they have associated themselves with people from the LGBT community. If they have, I expect greater empathy. But when I see posts with sweeping abstract topics of theology, politics and economics, that is when I realize that this is where we differ. I see a face, you see an abstract topic.

They say never argue subjectively because nobody will take you seriously. But this entire thing, isn't it about people and emotions? The LGBT individuals' ultimate pursuit is happiness. For those arguing against, essentially what you are trying to say is that my gay friend cannot receive the same happiness and privilege that we straight people can enjoy because of political, theological and economic reasons. And for the good of mankind, they have to straighten themselves out if they want the same benefits as we straight people have because the bible said so/the law said so/the graph said so.

The people we are talking about are not mere 'THEY', not mere numbers or statistics. The people we are talking about is somebody's family, someone's friend, my friends. My friends are in pain because of policy-makers, because of religious bigots, because of society that built the closet around them. How do you expect them to fight back? Or do you just expect them to roll with the punches?

Tl;dr #notsrs #traditon

To   Arguably, the arguments put forth by anti-LGBT activists are also rather repetitive, which could, likewise, suggests the mindless jumping-on-the-bandwagon tendencies of, not just youths, but of people these days.

Of course, this confession isn't another contribution to #LGBTwar. Instead, I'm going to share some trends, that I have witnessed, in NUSWhispers, that I have found to be more interesting than the LGBTwar here. Sure, LGBT debate is important. But comedy? I have my priorities, you see.

Today, we're going to talk about tradition - the kind of tradition that people think about, before LGBT debate was a thing in Singapore. You know, stuff like our almost-dead hawker centres, our protected traditional buildings and monuments, our uninteresting traditional-style marriages and practices, and our disappearing traditional food and festivities.

Despite efforts by our Government and people from the older generations, it is rare to see many youths grow interested in any of our traditional practices and custom. I mean, come on. Tending a hawker stall? Visiting a museum? Eating those weird tasting traditional treats? Dressing up in ugly costumes doing weird things for marriage? Wasting time on pointless traditional activities? Please.

Fast. Progressive. Efficient. Easy. Comfortable. These are the things that our youths desire; the things that would appeal to them. After all, in this fast-paced society, few would have any extra spare time and effort for anything that is slow, tiring and cumbersome.

But it seems like there is hope, after all - and NUSWhispers is where I found the hint to this conundrum. I mean, where and when else have anyone seen NUS students (and our youths) fight for #traditional (family unit). Indeed, it absolutely amazes me to see the sheer number and frequency of our youths fighting for anything (in their own words, too) "traditional". Great stuff, really.

I mean,  even wrote "Traditional marriage is a bedrock institution of our communities, state, nation and society. It is foundational. Protecting its historic definition for the sake of our society is both wise and courageous.".

Thereafter, I realize that, perhaps, this is the exact tool we can use to keep our youths interested in our long-standing tradition and culture. Imagine the possibilities!

Just... picture this:

Government: We would like more of our youths to inherit our hawker tradition and business.
Student: Hawker centre? Eww... that's like smelly and dirty.
Government: But the hawker centre are a bedrock institution of our nation and society. It is a valuable tradition that provides a social and economical value in producing cheap and affordable food to everyone.
Student: Sorry, you said something?
Government: If not enough youths take this up, our tradition and culture would be eroded.
Student: So? Ancient artifacts disappearing is merely a natural result of societal progress.
Government: The sustained erosion of our #tradition could suggest the eventual erosion of our #traditional family unit.
Student: Which do you think is more popular? Pork ribs or Oyster omelette? When can I start?

Or even:

Parents: We're going to our relative's house for annual festive celebrations tomorrow.
Children: What? But it's so boring. Can't we stay at home?
Parents: You shouldn't be complaining. It is an important traditional activity that has significant cultural importance and meaning.
Children: But there is nothing fun to do there? Why do we even need to keep such a useless traditional bore alive?
Parents: Well, you might not see the importance of keeping our #tradition alive now, but someday, your growing disinterest in maintaining our traditional cultures will come back to bite you when (yes, you've guess it right) #traditional family unit disappears too.
Children: Should we set an alarm to wake us up for tomorrow's event? I can't wait to see my extended families!

And there you have it! The solution to our dying traditional woes.

Here's a question for the guys or gals who work out regularly in the gym, what's your reason for working out?

For me, I am the typical evergreen, skinny, low self-esteem nerdy guy. I'll admit it, I'm doing it as I hope that there will be a "change in fortune" for me. To put it crudely, I'm doing it to attract the opposite sex. I see working out as a form of "cosmetic surgery" and hopefully it will improve my 桃花运.

Sorry, another LGBTQIA related post coming right up.

Reasons anti-LGBTQIA supporters give:
- It's not natural! --- Debatable and will be for a long time coming

- It ruins the traditional definition of marriage! --- Who decided that marriage is solely between man and woman, anyway? :/ Like, what difference does it make if two males/females actually marry?

- It lowers our birth rate! --- With the world already overpopulated as it is, this may be something positive, actually. Oops. Okay fine I know that the places where babies keep popping up won't help countries struggling with birth rate issues (like Singapore), but you're insinuating that gay people should get with opposite gender partners for the purpose of giving birth. If there's no love, the family's bound to be ruined.

- This is a step towards allowing incest/pedophilia/necrophilia! --- No. Just no.

Reasons LGBTQIA supporters give:
- Equal rights! Freedom to live! --- Is that too much to ask for? o_O To be able to do the same things a straight couple can do? I still have not seen a logical, coherent, unbiased argument on why equal rights especially, cannot be given to LGBTQIA people.

Even if Singapore's society is still largely conservative, it just means that effort needs to be put in to educate people to let them know that LGBTQIA people are no different from "regular" people. Ugh, I cringe to even use that word.

Perhaps I'm ranting like this because I'm a gay male myself. Oh sure, that sure makes me sound like I have an agenda to support the LGBTQIA group. But when I look back, the struggle I had coming out to two of my best friends in NUS in year 1 just showed me that there is still much to do. Coming out shouldn't be something feared or discriminated upon, yet it still is, and it saddens me to see friendships and families broken apart just over the gender one person likes, or the things s/he does.

At the very core, we are still who we are. Whether we have come out or not, we are the same person inherently. Be it that quiet (or bubbly) person you see in a corner, that muscular hunk (or scrawny guy) you see in the gym, that lady that caught (or didn't catch) your attention when walking in NUS -- what we are inherently cannot change, unless circumstances force otherwise.

Then people are probably gonna say "yeah, then we'll change them to be straight again" -- *facepalm* sorry, this post is already really long, not gonna even argue on this point.

Crap! I wanted to keep it short and then this happens. I've never taken a stand in LGBTQIA issues, but the chain of posts recently has motivated me to really be more active in sharing my voice in this. Well, to end off, love you all supporters of the LGBTQIA community, your posts make my heart warm up and believe that there's still hope out there that change will come one day. Thank you.

If you speak a language more familiar to others, you can be closer to them, than when you speak a common language such as English. Not just your words, but your tone, etc., as well. After all, a language can differ in usage and cultural representation, under different settings and backgrounds.

I speak Hokkien. It's close to me, I speak it, and if you actually speak it, you can understand this: Hokkien is not necessarily a language used for vulgarities, nor is it a language used to demonstrate power or anything. If I see that you speak Hokkien, then I will speak Hokkien to you as well; it's less formal than English, and I can better express myself.

Interestingly, despite a certain stereotype, most people who speak Hokkien are not necessarily vulgar. It's very, very rude if you think of it that way, and worse if you actually demonstrate such thoughts, as in some cases I have actually come across. 

Though yes, depending on the setting, Hokkien can be a language which exhibits roughness. The nature of my workplace makes it such that I actually speak it in a certain way, which more refined people may find very provocative, though I possess no aggressive intention at all.

Haha, that's about the language (or a dialect, as it is officially termed locally) that I speak. Now, aside from English, what other languages do you frequently speak, to represent your culture?

Maybe its just fear. I dont know whether homosexuality is predetermined or can be caused by influence/environment. If I had a child, I would be pretty scared that he/she would get influenced. I'm sorry but that's the truth.

In the end, mankind is just trying its best to survive. Heterosexual couples can procreate but homosexual couples cant. And to be honest, I would try my best to minimize the chance that my child would become influenced into homosexuality. Doing so is one of the ways to contribute to our survival. Everything we are doing now. Isn't it for our future as well as the future generation?

However, I am not against homosexuality. If my child is/becomes a homosexual, I will still love and accept him/her. It is true that the homosexuals are in pain and need some form of acceptance. Just please please, dont blow the whole thing up and cause a detrimental effect on the future generation.

I know some are tired of the debate on LGBTQ rights on this platform, but I'd really like to share my stand on this. 

As a Christian, I admit that I'm uncertain that homosexuality is a sin in the Bible. The original Greek and Hebrew phrasings are arguably ambiguous and have been contested in theological debates. 

Even if homosexuality is a sin, I question if this law is universal and transcendent. There are many other laws alongside the one on homosexuality that are deemed to be context-specific and irrelevant to our time and culture. How do we determine which laws should be considered universal? Is it justifiable to strive to implement only some of the laws and not others? 

Finally, even if the part about homosexuality is universal, I'm hesitant that Christians should petition a secular government in a multicultural state to enshrine this belief in the law on religious grounds. I believe the role of a secular government is to achieve peace and equality by creating a minimal framework with secular and pragmatic reasons to build an environment of mutual respect that is free of violence and crime. 

I have to emphasise that I do not speak for all Christians. Firstly, there are differences in beliefs and practices even within Christianity, and secondly, different Christian individuals have different interpretations of the Bible. Just to qualify, I may have a limited understanding of the Bible myself. I've attended church and bible study for the past decade and I've read some books and scholarly articles arguing for and against homosexuality laws, but even so, I dare not say that I'm sufficiently clear about theology, exegesis, and the complications in biblical translation to conclude that homosexuality is a sin, that should be considered a crime (note the difference between sin and crime), that should be the basis for arguing against marriage equality.

What I'm clear about, though, is that the Bible has this one fundamental, universal and transcendent law, that is to love God and to love people. I believe that all Christians strive to love people, but how we should exemplify that love is actually a complex issue. The Wear White movement is based on the belief that Christian love entails condemning homosexuality and same-sex marriage in law. But is this the best and only way to practise Christian love? Even if homosexuality is really a sin, do we have to criminalise it and enshrine it in the laws of a secular state? Will enshrining this belief in the law really help people to overcome the "sin" of homosexuality and protect our morality? Should we outlaw all sins then? What is the role of the law and of the government, and can we (or should we) enforce religious morality through the law in a secular state? 

On the issue of whether homosexuality is a choice, again, studies have been inconclusive. I'm inclined towards the fact that it isn't a choice. If you are straight, can you choose to have romantic feelings for someone of the same sex? Probably not. If you can, then congratulations, you are probably not straight. I think it's as simple as that.

There are also concerns about the impact of homosexual marriages on child development. Again, it seems that studies are inconclusive. My understanding is that it is less about homosexuality or heterosexuality, but more about the parent-child relationship and the quality of the child's life. I am really skeptical of the argument that the"traditional" family structure is the best and only way for children to develop happily and healthily. A one-man-one-woman family can provide a nurturing environment for children as much as a devoted, loving single parent, and as much as a devoted, loving homosexual couple. Similarly, a "traditional" family can destroy a child's life if it is characterised by parental conflict, divorce, or abuse. The fact that the family is a "traditional" family does not necessarily guarantee a child's healthy development.

That's as far as my view goes, for now, based on what I've read and researched about. I may be wrong, but I'm totally open to revising my views if there are more conclusive evidence or arguments. Just want to put this out there, because I think this whole PinkDot/WearWhite movement is getting quite divisive and hateful and creating an arbitrary us-against-them mentality.

The arguments put forth by pro-LGBT activists are honestly getting very repetitive, which really suggest the mindless jumping-on-the-bandwagon tendencies of most youths these days. I highly doubt the primary reason against legalising LGBT marriage is that religion forbids it though it may seem so with all the 'Wear White' parades. 

Research has shown that no particular ‘gay’ gene exists. There have been theories tossed around but none have come up with any definitive conclusions. This article was written by international team of scientists studying homosexuality in carnal genetics. (http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/668167) This will be disputable for some time to come, admittedly. 

The main opposition against legalising gay marriage lies in its meaning and consequences – the societal and thus economical impact it would result in an Asian nation struggling with falling birth rates. Let’s begin with defining marriage. Marriage is a virtually universal human institution. In all the various cultures flung throughout history, in society after society, whether tribal or complex, human beings have created systems of publicly approved sexual union between men and women that entail defined responsibilities of mothers and fathers. Marriage is inherently normative. Marriage is not simply an artifact of law; neither is it a mere delivery mechanism for a set of legal benefits that might as well be shared more broadly. The laws of marriage do not create marriage, but in societies ruled by law they help trace the boundaries and sustain the public meanings of marriage.

Heterosexual marriage, unlike the homosexual, connotes societal and cultural normality in an Asian country that still holds on to conservative values that has been established, developed and refined over centuries. The longevity of a societal norm is no justification for its rightness. But it has to be recognised that we are a society living together and connected by familial ties to the older generally more conservative generation. Whether or not the legalisation gay marriage would create a greater division and dissonance remains to be seen. In an ideal society, it is unthinkable that we allow the archaic prejudices and long-held conventions to determine the present. In Singapore, until there is tangible fruition from gay marriage, I doubt mass social pressure and a multitude of LGBT campaigns would suffice as justification to legalise homosexual behaviour. 

When pro-LGBT activists argue that it’s simply ridiculous for Christians/Muslims/anti-homos to prevent others from living out their desired lifestyles, they fail to recognise that we are not living separately which means no one’s freedom increases without another person’s freedom diminishing. By calling for homosexual marriage to be legalised, this undermines the value of heterosexual marriage. By assigning equal value to heterosexual and homosexual marriage, it explicitly means that the child-bearing qualities of the former relationship is completely negligible or unimportant. This indirectly suggests that life itself is not valuable or esteemed, which is preposterous.

It is arguable that by that logic, barren people and couples who decide not to have children should be excluded from the realm of marriage. There is a slight difference in the case of barren people for they do not have a choice. Even if their ways are just as selfish as homosexual people who decide to follow out their inclination, the meaning of a heterosexual marriage is intrinsically different from a homosexual marriage. Whether it really is or not, every marriage between a man and a woman is a representation of the life-giving qualities associated with child-birth. Heterosexual marriage, unlike the homosexual, connotes societal and cultural normality in an Asian country that still holds on to conservative values that has been established, developed and refined over centuries. 

Traditional marriage is a bedrock institution of our communities, state, nation and society. It is not discriminatory. It is foundational. Protecting its historic definition for the sake of our society is both wise and courageous, not discriminatory. Homosexual people have a personal right to live as they choose but they are just not granted social or legal approval because they don’t have a right to redefine marriage or sexual behaviour for all of society. 

On a larger scale, if one of the primary cause for humanity be procreation, campaigns to promote LGBT, if successful, will bring about regression and not progress. Legalising same-sex marriage diminishes the value of a procreative relationship (one that is for a larger purpose as opposed to merely following one’s feelings of love). Since same-sex relationships, which are intrinsically infertile and can never result in natural procreation, would be treated as identical under the law to heterosexual relationships which are the sole type that can ever result in natural procreation, The idea conveyed would be that there is nothing valuable about the continuity of the human race. The law stands to protect what we believe in – the idea that heterosexual relationships, as a life-generative force, should be valued. Because, by extension, it would mean that life itself is valuable.

Well with regards to the white shirt movement, I honestly do not think that they are against LGBT or the Pink Dot Movement. All they are supporting is the traditional family unit of father, mother and children. 

It's sad to think that just because you stand for something, people think you are against another. We can all live harmoniously. 

As Christians, we are taught to love. Jesus hates the sin, loves the sinner.

Genuinely curious: to spare both parties the awkwardness/emotional havoc about the ambiguity of the 'does s/he like me', is there any universally understood social cue that conveys 'I'm only looking for a platonic relationship' without being presumptuous of the opposite party's intentions? 
-
 
 That's no surprise. Gay people have been the biggest obstacle in our own movement. It's always easier to remain at status qup than to rock the boat. In the end, they still get the same rights that others spend their lives struggling and sacrificing for. The gay community is just like any other, we have no lack of freeloaders and lots of bitchy ones at that.

Ok this is getting way too much. Let me be clear, i have nothing against the LGBT people, you guys can and should have your own freedom to love and be happy for each other. I am no Christian or Muslim or a Jew and i believe you guys can and should do whatever you want. But please please please leave our core values alone, leave our laws alone and leave the world as i know it alone. At least in Singapore. I mean, we are not Uganda or Russia, gays and lesbians are free to do whatever they want, except for getting married and really what is the matter with you people going around the internet right now blasting at those that are conservative? 

And seriously if we take this slippery slope downhill and start allowing gay marriages and liberalise our society to the point where its acceptable to have gay cartoons on cartoon network, or have gay channels and gay dramas, what's next???? Are we gonna allow incest to be legal for the siblings who are seriously in love with each other? How about beastality, for those who claim that they have no control and have a sexual preference for animals? Or necrophiles for those who only want to have sex with dead bodies or even paedophiles, thise that only likes kids? 

I mean come on, do whatever you want, SG is still quite liberal and tolerant, so long as you don't flaunt it or start demanding for legal rights, we even have gay bars and gay clubs and we are not thrashing those places, but leave the core of our country alone. Please. Be careful for what you wish for,imagine decades down the road and LGBT rights are all acheieved and then we have the next round of people fighting for bestality rights and rights to commit incest...

In my opinion, religions mainly operate by convincing their followers that they are innately sinful or prone to sin;argumentere is something wrong with them and that there is a need for them to be "saved". 

It doesn't matter what the issue is -homosexuality, abortion, masturbation, contraceptive usage, premarital sex, wearing leotards when getting gymnastic gold medals, or common crimes - the fact is that religion needs you to feel that there is something wrong with yourself (even though there may not be) and the only way to repent and attain forgiveness is through some higher power. In this way, they acquire and cultivate their flock of sheep and keep them in line, suppressing them with threats of eternal punishment if they do not align themselves with the doctrine of a book written thousands of years ago.

In that pursuit, religious groups condemn and demonise many things that are perfectly fine in order to assert their position of dominance and authority.

Just to clarify : I'm not hating on religion here, these are just my opinions on the modus operandi of many religious groups. Feel free to rebutt, flame and find faults with this post: it will help me find holes in my argument so that I can form a better one :)

continuing from  TL;DR - RIDDIKULUS

wah piang eh limpeh already say have a nice steaming cup of stfu and go enjoy your summer but you guys really cannot right? Come, limpeh join your discussion.

(for simplicity's sake, let's divide the camps into pink, white, and popcorn)

////////////////FRAMING THE ISSUE///////////////////////////
Breaking the issue down, it is ultimately a question of policy. You know how some people say "govt do kena whack, don't do also whack"? This is one such issue.

At the end of the day, the issue is one of whether LGBTQ relationships are legal. The general mindset being, if it is legal it is - oh wait, THERE IS NO GENERAL MINDSET.... HUH?!??!

The white sees legalization as promoting the LGBTQ lifestyle. If it is legal, you are encouraging people to be gay and whatever, and WALAO EH WHY YOU DO THIS? YOU WANT EVERYBODY GO TO HELL IS IT? Wah cannot, have to save everyone, they MUST know that this is wrong!

The pink sees legalization as legitimizing the rights of a disenfranchised segment of the population. They view it akin to the end of institutionalized discrimination ala racism and sexism. By codifying this discrimination, we are WALAO EH PEOPLE WANT TO STICK THEIR PARTS WHERE YOU GOT PROBLEM MEH? ALSO NOT STICK INTO YOU. KAYPO LEH

///////////////// why so kaypo /////////////////
Ok la, kaypo has a negative connotation. Let's try painting the whites in a better light.

We have to first go into a philosophical discussion on the meaning and purpose of a legal system. But very cheem leh, limpeh shall just throw some quotes in la. You guys mostly NUS students right? #NUSTopInAsiaLaSia

Personally, limpeh feels that "Law is the formal glue that holds fundamentally disorganised societies together", and, "law is a guidepost for minimally acceptable behavior in society".

The whites, on the other hand, probably thinks along the lines of "Nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated". (if too cheem, it means, law is logical, and it is to help people)

In this context, the whites are simply viewing the criminalization of analsecks (henceforth known as 377A, A for anal) as logically bad (well as logical as their theistic reasoning gets), and hence hope to prevent people from doing it. Not to mention that you will probably go to hell as a result. 

It is thus important to understand the context that the whites are coming from - they are trying to HELP you, why you so stubborn sia.

Granted, pinks will say that this is not the true reason why they are opposed to it, and will throw all sorts of claims of bigotry and nonsense into the mix (which, honestly, does not help. Insulting me then expecting me to change my mind? You think all whites are buddhas ah, bodoh) Let's just give all whites the benefit of the doubt. And let's not go into arguing whether their stand is logically valid -> democracy == one man one vote ; you primary school never hear before NEHNINEHNIPOOPOO MAJORITY WINS?

///////////// Slacktivism /////////////
It is now "hot" to support LGBT rights, especially among the younger generation of Singaporeans (which includes all you NUS kids). Arguably, it is even hotter than supporting the opposition. Why leh? Easy what, I support LGBT means you are a champion for reason and equality. Not bad sia, I think GSS also cannot find so good deal. Hold a moral stand, don't have to do anything, can feel good about yourself. Some more don't need to touch touch ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Jokes aside, many pinks are being what they are - young and idealistic. You do not change other people's mindsets by insulting them and insisting that they are archaic/bigoted. Actually ah, RECOMMENDATION HERE! Limpeh recommends everyone reads Carnegie's "HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE", especially the INFLUENCE PEOPLE part. You do not persuading people by confronting them - If they do, it is only because they are superior to you and are able to be so inhuman that they can separate logic and emotion to parse through your argument.

collection of choice quotes from nuswhispers - 
"So what is your basis? God? Or you?" (dey they already religious, God > them, what you trying to say? That Invisible Pink Unicorn doesn't exist?!??!?!)
"Is there such thing as a LGBT agenda or should we instead question religious agenda? One is pushing for equality of rights while the other argues that they're standing up for family values. But really? " (hello, who are you to question whether their moral values are acceptable to you? They have a vote just as much as you, telling them their agenda is invalid is just like me telling you your post is stupid. Your post is stupid. I'm sorry it's true)
"I'm going to lay it as straight as possible. A huge number especially the 70s to 80s generation are largely misinformed or conservative on this topic." (same guy who said "To add on, I didnt make a stand, why so defensive?" You are already implying a stand la dey, your intention oozing until i think you need torniquet la sia)

/////////////////////overarching mindset ////////////////////////////
Whites think they are helping and saving people. Pink likes to help people and also feel good because they are not bigoted not religious not illogical.

Actually right, as a popcorn myself, I think i want to speak for Pinks and popcorn. I can safely say that most popcorns actually support the pink, just that not the way they do their stuff. It's an even less contentious issue than smoking in public. The end idea being, people do what they do, if it's not gonna affect you, then don't so kaypo go and stop people. Unless you some kind of benevolent God that will chain people up to stop them from hurting (going to hell) themselves, then uh, you continue your good fight lor.

Even if it is not genetic, even if they choose to poke their parts with similar parts, WHY DOES IT CONCERN YOU SO MUCH. Not as if they poking their parts in your face, or stopping you from having different parts to poke with what. If anything, YOU GOT MORE OF OTHER PARTS TO POKE LEH.

/////////// summarizing of views ////////////////////////
pink: FREEDOM! JUSTICE! EQUALITY! THOU BIGOTRY AND UNFAIRNESS SHALL NOT PASS!
white: NOOOOO DON'T GO TO HELL I LOVE YOU YOU LOVE ME WE ARE HAPPY FAMILY
popcorn: $@^%$ damn noisy sia

//////////////////// Limpeh advice //////////////////////////
white: If you are right, you are right. I know you guys all sian that everyone wants to go to hell, but sometimes like a parent, you have to let your kids go when they grow up. Why you think God come kachiau in our mortal affairs for so many years? (insult aside, seriously, you are not their parents. You may have a need to evangelize or save people from hell, but when they are pewpew you with so many pink dots and kpkb discussions, why you want to make life so hard for yourself??? just vote for your politicians wisely, because they are your lawmakers. And same thing for you, don't go holding that "I am right you are wrong" mentality if you want to discuss this. If you want to go into a discussion with your mind set, discuss smlj, just stfu and go vote)

pink: read "how to win friends and influence people". Doesn't matter if you're right. You can be so right that you become left, but if the other person blindfold his eyes and tell you that the sun already set stop disturbing him he want to sleep, you also must LLST right? REMEMBER! insults/confrontational = blindfolds on! But most have blindfolds perma on anyway so don't try too hard la.

popcorn: Guys, we need to tell people to stfu! SERIOUSLY! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY DIATRIBE.

POPCORN CALL TO ACTION! YOU DONT GET THESE SQUABBLING KIDS TO HUSH HOW I HEAR STORY ABOUT SEX AND I LIKE YOU YOU LIKE ME?!?!?!

Sincerely, Limpeh the popcorn eater

Can the LGBT war on NUSWhispers just stop already? If you guys seriously want to continue talking about this, go create a NUSWar page or something. Kthxbye.

For all those telling us queer people to shut up and sit down, this is for you. For those who think we should be happy with what we have now, this is for you too. 

According to some wear white members, I'm considered a scheming LGBT bigwig of the homosexual agenda. Why? Because I was one of those who set up the inter-uni LGBT network, because I'm one of the people behind last semester's NUSPA family forum, because I organised last year's orientation event for incoming NUS LGBT first-years. 

So why am I doing all these and what do I want? What is my gay agenda? Legalize same-sex marriage? Repeal 377A? Turn everyone gay? 

Honestly, I find that question almost impossible to answer. Maybe the short answer is, I don't know. People are so focused on these "big goals" but there are so many other things that urgently need our attention too: 

HIV/AIDS infections in the gay community is still very high, affecting people as young as 15 or 16, when it could all be prevented with better outreach and education efforts; 

What happens if a gay youth is sexually assaulted by another man? What can a lesbian girl do if she is correctively raped by her classmate to "set her straight"? 

Who will help a young feminine-presenting boy in school who's bullied for being who he is? Can he turn to his teachers or school counselor? Will they out him to his parents and send him for therapy so he will "man up"? 

There's more - should the 18-year-old pre-enlistee declare that he's gay? What happens if he does? What about the young trans women who were kicked out of their homes had to leave school because of the bullying and harassment by her teachers and classmates, and end up in sex work to survive? What about the teacher who was forced to leave the service because a parent saw him with his boyfriend at the mall and made a complaint to the principal? 

Sure, it's easy to just characterize LGBT issues as either 377A or same-sex marriage but we aren't just criminals or couples. We are people, and there's a lot we are being short changed for by the state and our society simply for being LGBT. So before you ask us to shut up and sit down, please give it another thought. 

For those who claim to be sitting on the fence/ in the "middle ground", you are complicit in the violence, discrimination and injustice we face everyday. There is no "middle ground" because there is no two equal and balanced side to this matter. Real people are dying, crying, hurting because of your silence. You can treat us as an abstract issue to be talked about, discussed, laughed about. But our lives are not just something for you to post about. We live them. We live them every day, every moment of our lives. 

It doesn't matter if you wear white or pink or if you don't care at all because right now, we all wear the same colour red on our hands for the blood of the 16 year old lesbian girl who committed suicide because her brother raped her to make her straight, of the 18 year old gay boy who cuts himself every night after he was tested positive for having bareback sex with his first love because he was never told in school about safe sex for LGBT people and thought that STDs only happened to straight people, of the 23 year old trans woman who works as a sex worker every night and got beaten up by her client who refused to pay her. 

Sometimes, I wonder to myself, is there a point? Can we ever get things to change for the better? There's only so much I can do, so much people in the community can do. So what exactly are we doing? What really is my gay agenda? 

Hope. I think that's all it boils down to. Hope that tomorrow will be better, that someday my parents will turn up in pink for a Pink Dot, maybe next year, five years or ten, that one day there is no closet to come out of, that there is no pink or white but where everyone is comfortable donning whatever colour because we finally realize that the pink and the white actually stand for the same things: love and family. 

At the end of the day, that's all that matters. To give hope that we can live another day, that tomorrow, it will get better, that we will survive through it all. I will end with a quote from Harvey Milk: "I know that you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living. And you... and you... and you... gotta give em hope."

Is there such thing as a LGBT agenda or should we instead question religious agenda? One is pushing for equality of rights while the other argues that they're standing up for family values. But really?

To  Homosexuality is a disposition, just like any other bad dispositions like lying, violence and stealing. We are not born with homosexuality in our genes, and that has been theologically and scientifically proven. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just like man may be born with a greater tendency to violence and other sins. This does not excuse the person's caving in to sinful desires though. If a man is born to greater susceptibility to anger and rage, does that make it morally good and right to give in to the desires? I don't think so, no matter how hard it may be. God did not make man homosexual, but man weighed down by the sinfulness of the human condition can be shaped by his/her environment to gain a disposition towards homosexuality. The question comes in whether you express that disposition or not.

Whenever there are problems confessed there will always be common pretentious and hypocritical comments like: 'Just be happy'; 'Just be yourself'; 'Its not all about the money/look'; 'You will find the right one for you'; 'You are special in your own ways'; 'You are important'... etc. I'm really sick of such comments flooding the post where commenters do not understand the real issues at heart, the brokenness and rejection. So here's my advice:

To all the OPs out there who make such confessions, do yourself a favour, you make vague, anonymous and unreliable confessions you can only get shallow, troll and vague replies. You want deep conversations or people to truly understand you or offer really relevant suggestions don't do it here. Go church/mosque/temple/self-help groups/communities or what so ever place where real practical help and support can be offered.

Seriously are looks really that important? Are they the first criteria that people look out for? Is it the most instrumental tool that people use to judge others?

So, I would like anyone to tell me :

When looking for dates; looks aside, what else do you people look for?

I find it ironic that some friends of mine, who identify as homosexual, are also against the idea of LGBT movements such as Pink Dot, among many others. To clarify, they do not disagree with the goals and objectives of such movements per se, but rather with the way they are carried out. These friends feel that the 'attention-seeking' nature of such movements inadvertently draw far too much undesirable attention to the LGBT community, making them a flashing beacon and a wide-open target for attack, as we have already seen in many instances both here and abroad.

Even they feel that the community is asking for more attention than they should, and I am also inclined to agree with them, although I am typically less vocal with my views as I am afraid of being wrongly labelled as homophobic or whatever.

Wrt all LGBT posts - both sides really need a good dose of stfu. 

Pro - yes it's ridiculous, but that's what religion is at times. Stop being as ridiculous by insisting that ridiculous people stop having ridiculous beliefs. And don't go all "but they not happy we pink dot". Ya, you hold and event celebrating they are against what you expect. And don't get started on unfair laws (377). It's inherently difficult to change something that already is, what more when you have a sizeable population against it. Working to change it is a good thing. Working to change it by telling people against it they are ridiculous and stupid is ridiculous and stupid. Or even just constantly being in their face with "give us our rights damnit", because they will not until they belief it's right, and by jove they definitely don't right now. 

Against - what has something going on between two consenting  adults that has no repercussions on you have against you? And don't go dragging in the beasteality or paedophilia examples. Both are cases where both parties are evidently not consenting or where one party has a high chance of being exploited. At the end of the day, yes, you are quite ridiculous. But I'm not going to tell you that you are ridiculous because arguing about who's ridiculous is ridiculous. Maybe some day you will understand how fragile your beliefs are if people acting differently is a threat to your beliefs. 

Sincerely, middle ground popcorn eater.

Only time can heal our scars. I hope that you can understand that I don't despise your poor and less fortunate background at all! I have always love you and grateful for all the sweet things you have done for me. However " love cannot be sustained by bread alone". My dad and mum have always taught me that 贫穷夫妻百事哀, that's why I have chosen the richer guy instead of you. The image of me living with you in a HDB flat and leading a life full of hardship, is so dreadful to me, there will surely be no happiness for both of us.

Please forgive me, it wasn't a easy decision but I won't regret my choice. Because I would rather cry in the back seat of a Ferrari ,then to smile on the back seat of your bicycle for the rest of my life. Heaven played a big joke on the both of us...... If only you are born into a better family from the start. Perhaps meeting me is your greatest mistakes, 我不是个好女人.

I came across this Facebook group "We are against Pinkdot in Singapore" and was sorely disappointed when I saw a few of my friends in it; friends that know I am a homosexual myself. 

Thus I implore you readers to give a reason to oppose the LGBT movement in Singapore that does not have religious basis (if religious grounds were valid reasons, I'd think Muslims should want the outlawing of the consumption of pork and Christians should aim to abolish polygamy; after all God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Eve and April and May and June) nor TFRs (because face it, the percentage of homosexuals is so small making us breed like rabbits ain't gonna help the TFR much.

To , I'm getting tired, and this will be the last time I repeat this, and if you still don't catch this, I'm not going to care anymore: Your sexuality is not a choice, just like how your sex and gender is not a choice. Our founding father also thinks our sexuality is genetically predisposed, if you're keen on quoting him.

Quoting your newly brought-up illustration, "You can tolerate Christian/Islamic views and not agree with it," this is a bad illustration because you DO have a choice of religion. You can disagree with a different choice of religion made by others. My original illustration still stands. You do not have a choice of race, therefore you can't agree/disagree of a certain skin colour; you can't choose your sexuality therefore you can't agree/disagree of a certain sexuality. It is not a bad illustration. We have to protect the rights of our sexual minorities (LGBTs) in the same way we protect the rights of our racial minorities.

I'm not going to the rest of your refutations, because once you understand the point above, these refutations will logically become irrelevant.

I am not hateful, I am tired. Tired of repeating the same thing over and over but you still don't catch it.

I agree with your key focuses, but I see a disparity between your understanding of sexuality and your key focuses, which baffles and worries me. End of story.

Oh you fervent defenders of LGBT rights. Your voices are so loud whenever someone so much as hints that they might be against the LGBT community. Forcing the traditionalists into line, denouncing them as heretical, non-tolerant, discriminatory, archaic fools who must be enlightened to the different tenets of modern society. 

Are these not the acts of a bully? Are you making others respect your choices by force, shoving your homosexuality in their faces and demanding that you be heard and seen? Ask yourselves this: are the majority of your social clique going around, carrying posters saying: "Kill all the homosexuals! Down with the demon-spawn!"? If they've simply joined a group that promotes traditional family values, it in no way empowers you to condemn them. They are simply exercising their freedom of choice, as are you, in choosing to attend the Pink Dot event. 

Confessed to a friend about your sexual orientation and got misunderstood and ostracized? Taking to NUSWhispers to garner sympathy and lambast your friend for his behavior isn't a solution. Pity votes only serve those who wish to use the apparent power and authority granted by an anonymous "majority" to punish and bully the perceived minority into line. Talk to your friend like a mature adult instead. If they still do not wish to continue their association with you, your conscience is clear, you've acted maturely, and your friend still has their right of freedom of choice. I'm not lauding your friend's choice of actions (in fact I think that course of action is infantile in the extreme), I'm simply disagreeing with your response (also infantile in the extreme). Two wrongs do not make a right. They merely lead to outright war.

Make no mistake. I am not biased to one side or the other. I am apathetic to both the LGBT and traditionalists. I, however, deplore the use of scare tactics and bullying to promote an agenda, no matter what that agenda is. You have something to say, make your stand, and get off the backs of those who disagree (have you not heard of: "let's agree to disagree"?). No one should be denied their freedom of choice or speech. In this case, I mean freedom of choice and speech in the purest sense of the phrase. Denouncing someone with no foundation to your arguments is NOT freedom of speech. It is defined as libel. I define "freedom of speech" here as the freedom to pen down any constructive, conducive, critically thought out argument or position that provokes analytical thought and progress. I also define "freedom of choice" as the freedom to undertake any set of actions in accordance with the will of an individual, provided that those actions do not cause physical, financial or emotional distress to any other party.

It is also my hope (however blind that hope may be) that none of you bring religious views, "populist" views, and other such-like into any intelligent discourse. By default, religious dogma is called dogma for a reason. It is not to be questioned. If you choose to follow your own religious views, do not act like how some Jehovah's Witnesses are, going around and shoving their bibles into people's faces and demanding they convert or go to hell. "Populist" views are again the voice of an anonymous, unproven "majority", and must not be tolerated as the basis of an intelligent discussion. 

/* The views presented in this long and lengthy rant are the views of one disgruntled OP, and should not be taken as being representative of any one group of homo sapiens. */

Those who is homophobic should read Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality.

"Entering the second chapter of this section, "The Perverse Implantation", Foucault argues that prior to the 18th century, discourse on sexuality focuses on the productive role of the married couple, which is monitored by both canonical and civil law. In the 18th and 19th centuries, he argues, society ceases discussing the sex lives of married couples, instead taking an increasing interest in sexualities that did not fit within this union; the "world of perversion" that includes the sexuality of children, the mentally ill, the criminal and the homosexual. He notes that this had three major effects on society. Firstly, there was increasing categorization of these "perverts"; where previously a man who engaged in same-sex activities would be labeled as an individual who succumbed to the sin of sodomy, now they would be categorised into a new "species," that of homosexual. Secondly, Foucault argues that the labeling of perverts conveyed a sense of "pleasure and power" onto both those studying sexuality and the perverts themselves. Thirdly, he argues that bourgeoisie society exhibited "blatant and fragmented perversion," readily engaging in perversity but regulating where it could take place.[9]"

Anyone like me thinks that an academic genealogy makes hardly any sense? I think knowledge or academic competency are not like genes which can only be inherited from your parents, but it is built on almost anything you read, listen and experience. When I read classical works by Rudin, Clayden, Atkins, Richard Dawkins, and sometimes more ancient ones like Riemann and Dedekind (though Riemann is super hard for me), why can't I state that I am a student of them since I am really learning from them? I don't understand why some people seem to care more about who their teacher's teacher's teacher is than what they actually learn haha. But above all, I am only against the academic family tree thing. I respect sincerely all my profs!

In reference to my previous post: 

To: 
I provided a link from The Washington Times.  The fact that you blatantly take the link title out of context and assumed I was taking a stand shows you didn't bothered to read the article at all.

The article quoted children from gay families showing the differences/similarities between gay and traditional parenting. It wasn't an argument, instead views from opposing sides.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/8/gay-couples-children-oppose-same-sex-marriage-tell/?page=all

Secondly, if I may quote you.

<Would you ever say something like "I tolerate black people, but I don't agree with their skin colour." Doesn't make sense right? Similarly it doesn't make sense to say "I tolerate LGBT people, but I don't agree with their sexuality.>

"Black skin color" seems like a pretty bad illustration.
But I get your point. 
You can tolerate Christian/Islamic views and not agree with it. This is perfect logical in which yes everyone can concur to.
And with all due respect, you can tolerate LGBT behaviors but do not agree with it. Seems perfectly logical as well.

Below is part of one of our founding leader's opinion on racial cohesion.
"By telling each other, we have to live. Put up with each other. Accommodate. Compromise. That's how it's been done."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moEPY8kIhts

"It's a hell of a journey yes, but something that needs to be done."
This is rather subjective from different perspectives. I would not argue on this point to prevent from taking any form of stands.

"Just look at the Wear White campaign in response to the Pink Dot campaign. That is because they are ignorant of the points above. But I'm glad they are a dying breed and equality is winning."
I do not think they are a significant majority of voice, probably as effective as making a post on social media.
I would not go on anymore but "dying breed" seems rather hateful.

Once again I re-iterate my key focus.
1. LGBT community is small but not to be overlooked.
2. Legalization would be difficult as SG is still a rather conservative country.
3. Accommodate and Compromise. Then Accommodate again.

Share some love folks.

Cheers.

I was born into a less privileged Singaporean family. Every since I was young, my parents are always quarreling about money issues. I wonder what made them to choose to marry and start a family in the first place if they know they cannot support a family well. Perhaps they thought that love can conquer all odds? But that's pure nonsense. 

My parents had to work a couple of jobs to bring food on the table for me and my 2 other siblings, they have no time for us. They leave us to do whatever we want. So what will most undisciplined kids do? Do anything except studying.

We played played played and picked up a lot of bad habits along the way. As my house is dirty, old and small, I hung out every time. I was a terrible student, rude and rebellious to the school authority. I didn't perform good for my O levels and ended up at ITE. Back then, the ITE isn't as beautiful as the ones now, and there's the cultural stigma of ITE students being those who cannot make it in society, especially in Singapore where the emphasis on education is strong. 

At that moment, I started to feel the pressure from society. As I become older, my parents are putting less and less food on the table  as they said I should be taking care of the family. I know they also need to save for their retirement. Hence I had to do a part-time job at an industrial park as a packer. It was very tiring to manage both studies and part-time job, but I need to force myself as I have 2 younger siblings and myself to take care. I began to feel I wanted a better life, as in Singapore, everything is so expensive and it's a country where your socio-economic status plays a huge role of how people view your worth. It's not through luck or god I did well for my nitec and got a place in poly. Then I continued working hard and after NS, I secured a place in NUS with financial aid and graduated with a good honors and got a good job at an MNC in Tuas. It's a painfully long way but I made it because of the constant support of my lecturers and friends.

Other Singaporean children who come from a good family, who no need to worry about money and food, who can afford the best tutors who has been overachievers since young and whose parents can give them the connections they need to get the best jobs. These privileged kids have a huge head start in life compared to me, and I know even in my entire life I may not surpass them. But that doesn't matter, as I will be a more happy person because I will appreciate and be grateful for every grain of rice on my plastic plate, instead of complaining that the plate is silver and not gold.

just a random thought with pink dot around the corner.

when people start championing a cause, if others oppose it, they'll start insulting proponents and even wishing ill on them and their families (especially their children). why do people do that? just because you disagree with their ideals doesn't give you the right to say those things. it's not even that they are holding you at gun point, forcing you to accept them.

but on the other hand, proponents trying to work for their cause don't help their case by wishing ill on the opponents either. what good is there to gain from insulting one another? why can't people be civilised and rational? all these childish insults just serve to degrade both sides.

kudos to those who deal with #wearwhite and #wearpink maturely. both in pushing for or against it.

just how i feel. for someone who is pro-family, where family means people who make you feel safe and loved regardless of gender (chosen or not) and sexual orientation.

 No. The "selfless" act of donating assets and organs is negated by the selfish and cowardly act of hurting your loved ones, and evading your duties and responsibilities. Remember, charity begins at home. Help yourself first and spare a thought for your loved ones before you "help" others through suicide. Also consider that there is probably a net loss i.e. more suffering than happiness brought upon others due to the act of committing suicide.

Life is given not to be wasted. Treasure it, consider the feelings of others, and look at the big picture.

I know death is an event which people are suppose to be sad. But after the death of my father, my whole family felt relieved and happy. My father is a very bad-tempered and abusive person. He's constantly claiming to be broke, but always going out to drink and smoke. He didn't even have a proper job, and whatever money he has, he spent it on his own merriment, at the expense of our family. Whereas my mommy is different, she works hard day and night and her pay isn't much (about $1K+), but yet she saves for me and my brother's future, and even pays for my expensive fees at uni so that I don't need to seek financial assistance or take a loan. She doesn't want me to have the burden of debts in the future.

However, not only my father didn't appreciate what she has done for the family, he always abused her verbally and physically over the small mistakes she made, such as forgetting to clean his table etc. I would've sent him to jail for his actions, but my mommy always told me not to as other people will look down on us if our relatives know that our father is sent to jail. I even don't wish to have a girlfriend because I am embarrassed to introduce her to this man I call a father. So I pray everyday, that I want this scum out of my life. Most people age gracefully, but he become worse and worse every passing day. One day, my prayers were answered.

Just last week, he got a heart attack at home. That scum is still scolding people because he is in pain, then blacked out. My mommy called the ambulance, and after some time, he is dead. And now, we are preparing his wake. I am really happy, although there are challenges ahead in life I have to face, this major obstacle is finally out of my life. My mommy and bro looked more delighted these few days. And no one shed a tear for this man who will be forgotten.

The death of one person can be exchanged for the happiness of many others, it's totally worth it even though I shouldn't be in the position to judge. I can now come home in peace and even start looking for a girlfriend. I'm thankful that nature has its own form of justice.

Children neglected and committing suicide, some forced into warfare; human trafficking and many forced into unpaid/low-paying labor jobs and prostitution; racial and religious intolerance causing large scale killings; petty politics and corruption causing people to suffer. Is this what the world has been reduced to? How do these bad people sleep soundly at night? I really would like to make the world a better place, but a single human like me can't do much. I don't know about you but amidst all the shit that has been happening in the world, our petty complaints about hot weather and train delays seem pretty trivial. Whenever news portals (CNA and Straits Times) come up with this kind of news, my faith in humanity decreases. But then again, maybe that's just me.

To , you provided a viewpoint from a conservative newspaper, The Washington Times. I can also do a quick Google search and provide you with an alternative, and equally valid viewpoint from a liberal newspaper: http://ind.pn/1BMiWmt

I don't understand why you're still talking about agreeing/disagreeing with LGBT relationships. Like I said, people can't choose their sexuality, just like how we can't choose our sex and race. Would you ever say something like "I tolerate black people, but I don't agree with their skin colour." Doesn't make sense right? Similarly it doesn't make sense to say "I tolerate LGBT people, but I don't agree with their sexuality."

I hope you do understand that since people can't choose their sexuality, it is discriminatory to not allow them to marry, get housing grants etc, in the same way straight couples can. It's a hell of a journey yes, but something that needs to be done. And yes, our society is not ready for this whole legalisation process yet. Just look at the Wear White campaign in response to the Pink Dot campaign. That is because they are ignorant of the points above. But I'm glad they are a dying breed and equality is winning.

Should bigamy be allowed in Singapore? Discuss

Imo, we have a low birth rate. Will bigamy "boost" it?
-
 
To , it's great that you're tolerant of LGBT relationships. From what I read, you seem to think that if LGBT relationships are allowed then polygamy might be allowed as well. This is a misconception. LGBTs do not consciously choose their sexuality like polygamous people consciously choose to have multiple partners. A man does not wake up one day and decides to like men instead of women. Sexuality is determined either genetically, or the environment the man grew up in moulds his sexuality. It's not a conscious choice. (Sidetrack: and that's why 377a and the non-legalisation of LGBT marriages are discriminatory practices, because sexuality, just like race and sex, is not choosable.) On the other hand it is definitely a conscious decision to have more than one spouse/partner. People are not born or raised to have no choice but to need like four wives or something.

As for whether polygamy is a functional family structure, that's debatable. Whether it's right or wrong? That's debatable too. But you shouldn't consider whether an LGBT family structure is right or wrong in the same way you consider for polygamy, because once again, LGBT isn't a choice, just like you wouldn't question whether being of a certain race is right or wrong. Finally, is the LGBT family structure functional? That's debatable too.

I feel that Singapore needs to rethink what it means to have a "traditional family structure". Since when was it traditional for a couple to comprise of a man and a woman? Maybe "dominant family structure" should have been the phrase we're using? #LGBTWhispers

Has anyone thought about suicide?

Is there really a good way to die? I would think so.

We all agree that life is the ultimate priority, that we should live life to the fullest and cherish the time we have left on earth. But, what if I have come to a decision, that death is the only way out for me?

If I really have decided to throw my life away, I would think that my death should be fully utilised. First, my assets, both monetary and physical, should be willed and donated to the needy. Next, my organs should be preserved as much as possible, such that they can be donated to someone else; someone whose quality of life would improve with them. Therefore, even if I were to die, the benefits of my death would be fully reaped.

Wouldn't this be the best way to commit suicide? I would achieve my goal in mind: to put an end to my suffering, while benefiting countless others. Imagine this scenario: I make an appointment with the hospital. I report to the operating theatre at the scheduled time. I could even choose the time at which I would want to die. Ready to leave the earth, I close my eyes as the doctor sedates me. The surgeon then methodically dissects my body, harvesting my organs. I would have left this earth peacefully, and my eyes, heart, kidneys and even limbs would be given to patients who need them. 

One life to improve countless others.

Wouldn't this be the best way to commit suicide?

 Thanks Colin. My ex is a humble, accommodating and joy-vial girl who knows how to code. I don't think I can meet another girl like her again. 

She pays for her mum's shopping, even though she is just a student. While I find this weird, I think she is really filial. But shouldn't it be the parents' responsibility to take care of their children's expenses while they are still a student? After all, her family is well to do unlike mine.

Her mum gave her a difficult time during her examination too. She "leveraged" (a term that she used consistently) on her daughter for her work when she should study for her exams. I have always thought that one should not bring his/her work problems home, and that we should draw a line between family and work. Just like it is difficult for teachers to teach their own children.

Also, she forced her daughter to do housework in the morning when she had to go for her internship. I really cannot understand why she has to do this to her loved ones. I can't accept her mum or Is it just me?

I cant deal with this lost of the relationship, I can't let it go because i really love her. She is with another guy now, an arranged partnership by her parents. I couldn't handle it, kept harassing her and said nasty things to her. I really regret it, i really do =(

Hi folks,

This is Colin, one of the evil profs in SoC. I believe in standing by my opinions so this is probably going to be the first and last time I use NUS Whispers, but since one of my awesomest bestest students was one of the people behind this, I must show face and post at least _something_.

I want to appeal to everyone from Computing, Business, Engineering, FASS, Science, and everywhere else to stop this nonsense of judging each other and putting each other down. 

Being a comprehensive university has always been one of NUS's strengths, and each discipline exists because, being a national university, our country needs the graduates from each of these disciplines.

Yes. NEEDS.

Besides, we are NUS, regardless of which discipline we come from. I'm proud to see this university's crest anywhere and everywhere, knowing that our students are out there making a difference, regardless of their chosen fields.

The story of why I only want to date Caucasian men. I believe most of you will call me the "party girl" as I have heard time after time. But perhaps you should understand why. I do not wish to stereotype any races here, but this is just an honest opinion.

I am heavily influenced by the media. There are indeed beautiful men of other races, however I grew up watching programmes which are heavily influenced by the western media. A white man is usually the Prince Charming who is brave, witty and drop dead gorgeous. Every girl will fall for him.

I am born with average looks but I love to have good-looking children, and thanks to the media's influence, there's the impression that a child of mixed blood tend to be generally more good-looking :)

Also, Caucasian men are more adventurous. Singaporean girls, like myself, seek excitement in a relationship. We want our boyfriend to take us to new faraway places and show us new things in the craziest possible ways, without making it look as if trying to impress anyone. 

And personally as a Southeast-Asian, there seems to be a form of social prestige which comes with associating ourselves with a Caucasian. Perhaps this culture is preprogrammed by our ancestors during the colonial times, when the white people are the colonial masters. Such an obsolete way of thinking is hard to eradicate.

You can call me superficial and naive. But everyone has their own fantasy right?

The past month I have been shot down by the comments of some of my fellow camp committee people after they inadvertently discovered that I swung the other way.

Some were deeply hurting when they kept referring to me brashly as 'cock-lover' and some were more subtle but nonetheless affecting when they say things like "oh but he's gay". Or sometimes they find a constant need to refer to my homosexuality, whether as a handicap or not.

But then I saw this meme and my heart warmed instantly...

Thank you Ellen!!!

My mom and me always had a fierce debate regarding this topic. Every time there is a news on females getting raped, my mom will comment "high chance is the girl is skimpily dressed, or stayed out very late outside, which tempt the rapist in the first place because men in generally cannot control their sexual urges". While sometimes it may be true that some girls is skimpily dressed/stayed out late at night, I am strongly against the view that girls who behaved this way is inviting rape. So what is the girl is skimpily dressed/ stayed out late? In my opinion "cannot control because you tempt me first" is simply an excuse by rapist. If "cannot control" is an excuse, then why only some men rape while other men can control despite seeing skimpily dressed ladies? Why does some men rape despite knowing the consequences? 

This then leads me to a big question. Is sex a need or simply a want? Why do so many people say sex is a need? It's not as though we would die without sex...

Therefore, is it ignorance on my mom's part that girls dressed skimpily/stayed out late is inviting rape or is it really true that some men have no way of controlling sexual urges once they see the female body?

It is understandable how people confessing their deepest hopes and fears do it anonymously because they feel vulnerable as it is and they need an outlet or advice. They aren't "keyboard warriors", unlike the troll commenters. I personally find it pathetic how they don't dare stake their real life identities behind their words. Just goes to show how malicious they are inside. inb4 yah lah this post is also anonymous.

RE: the "it takes one to know one" concept. Really? If this was actually applicable then /everyone/ is probably screwed up inside. How does recognizing negative attributes in someone else = possessing said attributes? So if you find someone annoying, stupid, materialistic, (insert negative attribute), etc, it must without a doubt mean that you're like that too, right? Warped logic much.

 You do sound like my ex girlfriend. She lives on campus to avoid being home. She has a Mum that is extremely demanding, and we broke up because of that. I know this isn't a pleasant experience for you and that things haven't always been easy for you at home. 

I think you should take a step back and ask yourself the following questions. Is the person whom you are avoiding, behaving in this manner to everyone and anyone? If he/she is, you need to assert some form of independence, which you already done by staying on campus. If this problem stem from self, you improve yourself and the situation will naturally turn for the better.

Parents alway want the best for their child. Sometimes, we do find their protection - restrictive. I want to share with you my personal experience. When I was serving my ns in brunei, several of my friends disobeyed the rules and the law of the land and drank in the public. They drove back to camp and met with an accident. One of my camp mates died. Some rules are put in place to protect us. While we may find them restrictive at times, they are for our own good.

Of course, your story may be different and there is so much advice I can give here. Most importantly, I want you to know that you should live a life that you want and not what your parents expects you to be. Parents often do get confused in parenting as well.

What is the meaning of Dasein (life)? At each epoch of human history, humans have different conception of Dasein. A better question to ask is what is the meaning of Dasein today after the epochal shift at the beginning of Internet?

Can you all tag girls who have the following attributes:

1) speaks mandarin & english very fluently (singlish doesn't count, mandarin dialect would be a bonus)
2) soft-spoken character
3) no reluctance to do chores (cleaning, sweeping, etc, someone who treasures tidiness and hygiene)
4) reads a lot (owning lots of books/eBooks doesn't equate to reading a lot)
5) additional skill-set that she is proud of (eg debate / dance/ music/ sports)

I don't care if she is A cup or D cup, has big or small eyes, long or short hair, 100kg or 40kg. I only care about  her inner attributes.
Looks will fade, but characters remain.
I'm looking for a lifelong soulmate, not a temporary puppet.

In light of all the virginity/no pre-maritial sex posts, here is my take on it. I feel that prizing female chasity is sexist and discriminatory. Female virginity, pureness and innocence are overvalued and overprized by the society (by both men and women). It deprives females from sexual exploration and self-discovery. It casts a negative light upon issues like female masturbation and sex (done faithfully and responsibly). And shuns females who are more open about their sexual nature as "sluts". On the other hand, you often don't see the term virginity prized with guys, perhaps the contrary might be true. In some confessions guys always profess to having no-premaritial sex. But in  way, all guys always have a more avenues of sexual release, or self-exploration that are societally acceptable.

I'm about to graduate from an obscure major in FASS, and I'm one of the rare ones in this course.

My CAP is 3.69 while most others are well above 4. Oh well, studying ain't my cup of tea, and I've done my best already.
I'm hardly noticeable by people. Saves me loads of trouble, I just keep true friends around me.

Of course, I'm nearly unnoticeable by ladies, no charisma, scrawny and average-looking I suppose. Oh well, looks can only go so far in time and basically in anything else, and they're often deceiving, so why be preoccupied with those shallow ones?

My family background can be described as less than average, things happened and had me living out there alone in a rented room. But I overcame all odds, and here I am graduating with a job waiting for me.

Do I compare myself with others? At times, yes, but what good will it do? I'm better off walking my own path.

Do I feel lousy? At times, yes, but I'm not that lousy either.

Do I feel helpless and hopeless? At times, yes, but even so, you just gotta fight on. Or rather, you just gotta win against your inner demons, and also, those outer demons.

Do I have those elitist people looking down on me? Everyone has them, it's only a matter of being discreet or right-to-your-face. I had both types, and to their face, I show them their worst nightmare: Their lowdown mistake, in their own coin.

Do I go through shit? Hell yea, life boxes me, I whack 'em right back, double the damage. Fate ain't gonna dictate my life, I have the final say.

Very often, it's the perspective you take and the attitude you adopt that makes the difference. They can say what they want, do what they want, and so can you; who cares what they think? Raise your head high and look up, because up is the only way to go if you're down. Work hard, do your best and have fun, whatever you do.

And if you need a peer's/senior's help, leave a comment here, I shall PM you. Cheers.

 I think that's great, to want to make a big change in your life.  Whether or not it's worth it really depends on what you really want, even if these expectations are out of the ordinary and do not conform to what majority of the society thinks. Do you have an alternative choice? We can't say for sure how far you will go, but it seems to me as though you are unsatisfied with the status quo, so work on your unsatisfied areas and work hard on them. Lastly, believing in yourself is insufficient without hard work and hard work too isn't enough without believing in yourself. How long can you sustain your hard work and what sort of effort are you going to put in if you don't believe in yourself? I think as we grow up, many people forget to dream, which is really important. I wish you all the best :)

Why do people associate virginity with morality? I have a couple of friends in nus who are absolutely against premarital sex not because of religion, but because of their "morals". As expected, they also expect their future wives to be virgins, somewhat as a requirement. They view non-virgins as "loose" and dirty people, looking down on them.
It's fine if you're against premarital sex. Primary school civics and moral education really worked well for you. But please do not force on to people your own set of morals because that's just narcissistic.

To the OP who said that SG ppl are anti china. I've been wondering. What makes new Singaporeans true Singaporeans? Does it mean being in Singapore long enough makes one true Singaporean? Does going through NS make guys more Singaporean? If given a chance would you forsake going to NS and just continue with studies? Does doing everything Singaporean make one true Singaporean? 

I don't think these are gauges and benchmarks to judge if you have really become a true Singaporean. Cos you haven't been through certain things that true blue Singaporeans have gone through. All the nostalgic stuff in the past that we played. All the events that happened when we were kids. That's why we cannot relate to you to a large extent. 

I often wonder, didn't foreigners come to Singapore for better prospects too? And not just solely because you want to be a Singaporean?

We at NUSWhispers are concerned about the postings by people who express the desire to do harmful things to themselves.

This is alarming and worries us. We advise posters to seek immediate help from their faculty. There are always practical, actionable ways to deal with the issues at hand.

NUSWhispers is a true anonymous posting site and we do not have any way to contact the posters themselves. Please keep a look out for the people around you (:
I'm an engineering student. There seems to be quite a bit of discussion recently regarding engin vs. biz, luxurious life vs. stable but not-so-rich life, etc. I'd like to share a personal, general viewpoint that I've been upholding for a long time. I apologize in advance if it seems morbid or trivial, but it's a guideline that I've genuinely abided by.

In the end, does any of this even matter? In about 5 years from now your degree/CAP would most likely have been completely obsolete and overshadowed in terms of importance by your working experience.

And, much more pertinently, in about 60 years (approx.) from now we'll all be dead. For example when it comes to mediocre results I always console myself with the following train of thought - "In 60 years' time, when I'm dead, this B-/C+ will not matter. At all. Zero."

It bears repeating - We will all be dead.

That's right. In the long run we'll all be six feet under the ground. So really, none of this fervent discussion is of any significance at all in the grand scheme of things.

To hell with the paper chase. Let's just enjoy while we can and make the most of our current lives as homo sapiens, which we may not experience again after reincarnation.  =)

I understand that you become disillusioned with guys after your two failed relationships. Anyway, I am a guy and I share your conservative view, mainly due to my religious background (I shouldn't mention it here to avoid proselytizing, but am not sure if we happen to share the same faith). In my opinion, you have made right decisions putting an end to your two previous relationships. They are simply not meant for you as they have conflicting beliefs to yours.

However, being disillusioned to an extent of deciding to stay single for the rest of your life, please think again. Love is beautiful, while lust obscures its beauty. I am pretty sure that there are guys out there who believes in the sanctity of love and marriage, regardless of religious views. It is simply that you have not found them. And I don't think you should be 'sexophobic' in a way. Sex, if exercised properly (i.e., within marriage), is a profound expression of love and keeps the humanity alive. It is lust, once again, that obscures it.

So as to your decision, I don't think it is a good idea to decide to stay single for life for that particular reason. You deserve a guy who really loves you, not just have a lust on you. But at the end, the choice is yours.

people will find anything to complain about. 

While some censorship can be argued to be necessary (the banning of troll posts removed harmful trolls, eg. those trolling on sensitive topics), I think that blanket banning everything that "sensitive" people dislike will result in bland boring posts and drive people away from NUSWhispers [the blanket banning of all "troll" posts(which I do not agree with), harmful or not, have already partially achieved this].

To people who are griping about how this platform is becoming another tindr, and I don't mean this in an interrogative manner, I'm genuinely perplexed! At least for me, I don't find anything wrong with taking this opportunity to create a connection between 2 individuals who cannot do so in a harsh, judgmental society....I think this platform is wonderful; it allows people to share raw emotions without feeling exposed or chewed up and torn apart(at least most of the time). As long as no exploitation or cyber-bullying comes out of it, I don't think we should "censor" these posts. This is a good platform for us to share frank views and be open, accepting and mature. P.S. love the brave honesty here! :) this platform makes NUS more like a community imo. Have a good weekend everyone.

 Singapore has linked success with money to such a great extent that people come to Singapore not to treat it as a homeland, but to chase wealth.
To immigrants generations ago, home and work were the same place. To 'immigrants' today, home and work are an air flight away. (Singapore being the workplace)
Something dear to Singaporeans had been lost. Each passing day we see our home turning more and more into a business, a place where profit is king. What little culture we had in the past is dying and the populace is being treated as replaceable.
To decry this state of affairs is not being xenophobic. It is the cry of patriots lamenting the gradual lost of their home.
-
 
Aiyo another comment on xenophobia. What I see is that Singaporeans think they are Singaporeans because they have experienced 2 to 3 generations of being in Singapore, from their ancestors till present. When they are in Singapore long enough, they feel rooted and thus this feeling. 

But when other immigrants enter singapore to become Singaporeans, be it their spouses are Singaporeans, that's why they come here, or they come here to seek better prospects, the group of Singaporeans whom have experienced the 2 to 3 generations may feel that they are not authentic enough because their time in Singapore is not long enough. 

Maybe a few more generations later, this group of immigrants will become accepted as true Singaporeans. If you observe closely, isn't that the case for the first generation Singaporeans too? They came to Singapore to have better prospects in the past, and now the new group of immigrants are also doing the same. 

There will always be xenophobia here because this 'generation' issue is extant. Another reason why new Singaporeans are ostracised may be that their actions in Singapore are deemed representative of the whole singapore population. For instance, talking loudly on mrt. Or arguing in public loudly. Or throwing cigarette buds anyhow. Let's call the generation Singaporeans as G. New Singaporeans as N. I don't think G will be that bold to break the laws as we've undergone transformation with stringent rules and legislation. However,  we may not know about N. They are new to Singapore and may not be familiar with the lifestyle here. So when internationally acclaimed surveys show that Singaporeans are loud or when Singaporeans are still coarse and rude, this G group may feel indignant. Who were involved in this surveys? How many percentage are N and G? 

It is this disparity between G and N that causes xenophobia I think, putting aside the competition for jobs or spaces in schools. The acceptance of N will take time, but it is not that easy. Even with efforts from the government to immerse N into society, G will still think they are true Singaporeans because of the generation gap. We can only live with it.

23 years old, 176cm, 74kg, Chinese. Love to travel, learning foreign languages, maybe a bit nerdy and studious (well, I like reading). In Chemical Engineering, going on Yr 3, gay, and in search of a boyfriend who is similarly an NUS student (maybe also from FoE?), of similar physical traits as me, and probably also Chinese (not because I'm racist, trolls, but because I can't get horny otherwise). 

Have been pumping iron in the gym? Sorry but I really don't appreciate huge muscular chunks. Chances are if you're lean you'll stand a good chance. 

Any takers? Wish to know me more? No need to try searching for my details, stay tuned to this confessions page, as I release a date and time so that we can appear in Techno Edge and meet. Till them, ciao! ;)

As a christian and a gay person, I struggled over my sexuality for a long time. I have left an open question to God - sure, I can suppress my feelings and thoughts I have for other guys. But how do I elicit an attraction towards girls? Does it mean I am denied a lifetime of happiness with another human being?

(Seriously, I have touched a girl's boobs at a strip club (colleagues brought me there; they didn't know i was gay). It was freakin' gross. I felt the lumpiness of the fat cells. Reminds me of the bits of yellow fat you see in chicken meat). Gross.

Since then, I have accepted myself. It's actually pretty awesome. I was lucky to be born with relatively good genes. On Grindr, I have met other smart, driven, and powerful men, and have expanded my network tremendously (without having to sleep around). I'm like that pretty girl with short skirts you see at networking events, but at a better position given how we live in a patriarchal society ;)

Looking at sites like trs and temasek review im appalled at the xenophobia here in singapore. How do you define a singaporean? What is the singaporean identity? I see comments implying that you have to be born here or raised here or have a pink ic to be considered singaporean. Come on, 4 to 5 generations ago most of your families were not even on this soil. Many if not most of us would be descendents of migrants. 

To be honest the concept of nations and borders is a terrible one. Many of which drawn by western intervention in the new world. Whatever it is I think that against all odds the social engineering the government has embarked on is really remarkable and is a testament to the success of the nation. Somehow i wish many of the corrupt or unsafe  or lesserdeveloped and even some seemingly developed countries would reform themselves to more authoritarian models to ensure social stability. I mean go to any other country in the world and you would be exposed to greater crime rates and social intolerance. 

Sorry for this rant bye.

So there's been a series of evolution-related discussion lately... here's my contribution: http://wtfevolution.tumblr.com/
-
 
Adding on to , this is coming from a guy's perspective. I honestly think looks are one of the first few factors everyone looks out for before approaching someone and getting to know them better. Don't kid yourself saying you are so almighty and straightaway only delve into personality etc. Most people are superficial. Majority of people have crushes because the looks FIRST appealed to them. Their crush's looks are acceptable to their standards. Then charisma etc comes into play.
If you still want to flame people who think looks are important, then I'll have nothing to say except, don't lie.

Secondly, sometimes you just don't feel anything for someone, no matter how "universally" attractive they may be. I've had my fair share of these situations.  Shit happens. Get over it.
-
 
I would like to respond to , especially those who gave negative comments. I personally see no problem with being superficial, and before you guys slam me, let me explain. 

As the saying goes, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”. Everyone has different standards of “good looks”. My friends and I seldom agree on a girl/guy who is good-looking (unless the person is seriously “universally” good-looking). I typically don’t agree with my friends’ choices of good-looking girls/guys, and neither do they with mine. So I would just like to say that OP isn’t wrong in being picky about her choices, because who knows, maybe her standards are different from everyone else. Different standards does not equate to having higher standards. To each his own. 

-
 
 I am very sympathetic with your girlfriend's situation. I think it's a situation that happens more often with girls than guys - girls seem more controllable, maybe? 

I think XX has to think it through and make a general stand that applies to all her actions. Rather than fighting small battles all the time (I will put my cup here, I will come home half an hour later), she has to decide to fight the major battle - this is my life and I will live it this way. After that, she should have a talk with her mum where she tells her her decision/ultimatum. For the talk and the subsequent chaos that will ensue, refuse to be drawn into arguments that will inevitably consist of a lot of emotional blackmail. Declare firmly, "This is my stand and I will stick to it," and then don't respond and shut her out. She must recognise her mother's emotional blackmail and not allow herself to be moved by it. 

At the same time, give XX your support and advice, but don't pressure her to do what you think she should do, otherwise you will only be adding to her stress.

To all the philosophy student (non-philosophy can try) out there: according to Existentialism, there is no objective meaning of life, we create our meaning. But because we are affected by external factors, our meanings change, so there is inherently no meaning of life

  Whoever uses purely genetic arguments without considering the kind of environment the organisms are living in has missed the entire point of altruism.

For social animals, there are various benefits of acting altruistically. Most important of all is that the debt will likely be repaid. Minor benefits include showing off to potential mates.

In humans, not saving parents causes emotional distress, loss of productivity within the family, shaming by society, etc. etc. That said, I can easily imagine situations where the choice of saving parents or saving unrelated strangers could go either way. Because the benefits differ in different circumstances, as well as different people place different values on things.

My girlfriend XX is already 23 years old, yet her mother still interferes with everything she does, and finds fault in every decision she makes. Even ridiculously small things like where XX places her cups in her room, where she hangs a new piece of decoration or how she paints her toenails is subject to criticism. XX is extremely tired of listening to negative feedback and acquiescing to her mother's inane demands, but on the other hand she feels that she has a duty to accept all her absurdities simply because she was the end product of a zygote after a 9 month long stint in her mother's uterus. Just last Sunday, XX was barred from going out because she, according to the mother, "needed to rest for work the next day", which is the most idiotic thing I've heard in my life, even though XX promised to be back home by 7pm. I hardly think that 7pm is an unreasonable time at which one should be return home, and I'm still unable to wrap my head around the fact that she lets herself remain under the thumb of her authoritarian mother. Being the subject of ridicule on a daily basis is already bad enough, but being incarcerated at home under such a stifling atmosphere is simply making matters worse. I can't do much besides staying in touch via text and trying to cheer her up, as her mother doesn't approve of XX being in a relationship and probably desires to sadistically play the role of malevolent god in her daughter's life for as long she lives. Disagreeing with her mother has made her very tired recently, and she pretty much has no energy to do anything besides eating and sleeping on her rest days. This has been going on for a while now, but as XX doesn't overtly show displeasure at her mother's behavior I suspect it has been subconsciously ingrained in the latter's mind that such behavior is acceptable, and of late her controlling nature is increasingly getting out of hand. As a result, she is perpetually feeling down, and I'm feeling sad because I feel powerless to improve her situation. If you have any advice to share, it would be greatly appreciated.

Society spends 16 years preparing us for a job via a degree that most of us will probably divorce (statistically speaking) after 2 years. Isn't it funny that after 12 years of asking you to remain single and focus on exam, parents and society give you just 4 years to get a partner for LIFE and expect it to work? Can be collectively do better so that we have less sob story on NUSWhispers?

Remember how people are always telling you about "It doesn't matter how others see you, but what's most important is how you see yourself" or "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"? As comforting as this may be, in reality a lot of outcomes are solely decided by how others perceive us. 

In a job interview, no matter how passionate you can be on the inside, it is up to the interviewers to accept your application based on external factors e.g. grades etc. Even if you love a guy deeply, your love will never be reciprocated if he deemed you as "ugly" and not his cup of tea. Even those around us are always aspiring to be associated with someone of status and beauty. And even a revolutionary idea requires the acceptance of the majority to become a success. As I like travelling, I notice whether how well I dress will cause different treatment from the shops and even at the airport/plane.

But a Hamster is different. A Hamster doesn't really give a damn on who you are as long as you feed it well. 
                                                                      
And that's why I love the Hamster.

Why are people discussing evolution in anonymity?
-
 
 when i mentioned parents, I think perhaps it was not sufficiently clear. I assumed that our parents (mother) would not be able to reproduce. 

Your claim that having offspring with your mother will help improve the chances of passing down ones genes is not wrong. But firstly, apart from simply passing down OUR genes, we do have to consider the viability of it. Our mothers advanced age would mean 1) highly unlikely to conceive 2) health risks 3) later age= higher risk of genetic defects in babies. Same goes for mating between siblings. There is a better chance, but with the greater risk of genetic defects, the baby may not live to pass on their genes to the next generations.

Evolutionary is not just our genes, but the genes of the human species as a whole. Crossing-over provides genetic variation, which will help to reduce the impact if a bottleneck situation occurs. Mating with others helps prevents a homogenous pool of genes (i forgot the correct term) but the idea is, it increases our chances of survival. The 'less of our genes' being passed on is outweighed by the greater chance of survival by our offspring.

Just to clarify, I don't believe in the evolutionary account against gay marriage (I support LGBTQA rights)
-
 
With reference to  and 
It is tempting, almost natural to believe that life is to be measured by the number of successes and failures of an individual. Especially so in a country like ours. This college environment obviously also worsen the problem as it is a place where many successful individuals congregate (including you OP of ). Take a step back from the chase of success. There is much more to life than counting successes and failures. Moreover, being successful doesn't equate to being happy with life either.
As for making friends (romantic or not), I believe that you first need to start liking yourself for who you are. I mean, no one wants to hang out with someone gloomy. Reel them in first >:D.

to OP of . Read a book on theory of evolution or ask your friends who study bio or look for a bio prof. The gene is the unit of selection. Not a particular particular bloodline. 

To the atheist OP who argued against homosexuality based on this you serve either a neutral or negative evolutionary purpose to many other bloodlines also. So should you jump down the building?

-
 
To  er no, the evolutionary account states the opposite, that we are more likely to save our parents because they have OUR genes. You and your parents share genes, that is why (by evolutionary terms) you would save your parents. Its called kin selection/altruism. Your cells (or genes or whatever) do not in some sense "detect" that your parents have already passed on their genes and stop the desire to save them. And when genes get passed on, your parents do not "lose" genes, since copies are passed down. Who is to say that your parents would not pass on more genes after you?

Please read up on evolution before you claim something like that.

-
 
This will be my last reply to this series of evolutionary "debate" (getting a bit long here). To OP of  I'm sorry but maybe asking the right professor would be more apt -- a biology professor?

Look up reciprocal altruism, or read Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene. Basically, genes that promote altruistic behavior, especially towards that of close ones (parents, friends) or people who helped you are gradually passed down across generations and are naturally selected. Its pretty obvious - helping someone who has helped you before is beneficial in establishing a helpful mutual relationship. Saving your parents is more beneficial than a stranger because well, they are your parents! They raise you up, they provide care and nurture. But saving a stranger does not guarantee that he/she will help you back, or what if the stranger is evil? Most of the time, saving your parents provides more survival benefits, to put it crudely. Through a long period of natural selection, people with genes that generally favored helping their parents will tend to fare better than those who help strangers (you can think of many examples on your own why this would be the case)

You mentioned "saving a stranger who we may have a relation with and pass down our genes". What are you talking about? Someone whom you have a relation with is NOT a stranger. "pass down our genes"? So you mean you share more genes with a stranger than your parents?

Sorry people, I feel like many of you don't understand evolution. But broadly, I agree that evolution holds no weight in a moral argument about homosexuality, lest we fall into a naturalistic fallacy ("ought" should not be confused with "is").

Anyway, not sure we can do anything more than to agree to disagree. At some point this is going to come down to a clash of values, right? I mean I have my own views too but not to fan the flames further...

I disagree with  as it seems rather delusional. IMO work-life balance is exactly what the author says - an entitlement. "When you become so good your boss has no choice but to tolerate your work-life balance" - this is exactly what happens.

Imagine a project group member who consistently fails to pull his own weight and says, "sorry guys i cmi i'll be joining my family for... my friends for..." My reaction would be like, dafuq, like I don't. On the other end, someone who does pull his own weight saying the same thing draws less flak since his claim to work-life balance seems justified.

This is also how respect is earned. By acknowledging that you gotta work hard to prove your worth first, and not claiming a right to every damn thing.

Yes of course in the first few meetings, some might already not be able to commit for whatever not stuff for whatever not reasons. But the ire it draws depends on the ability to deliver substance to the table later on. If it falls short, then everyone's gonna be like 'wat. da. fuk.'

 I disagree entirely. We are supposed to be pragmatic and not dwell on intangible ideals like "take more pride in the work". Disregarding remuneration entirely is foolish, and so is measuring a job solely on its effective hourly wage.

Prestige and pay is ridiculously low because we are easily expendable and the resultant low cut-off reinforces the image that it is but a dumping ground. Words of thanks will not feed you. Either move to a more engineering-friendly environment that lets you get by or relegate your passion to a part-time hobby. I will do the latter.

a lot of presumptions especially when asking a man if he is okay with dating "upwards" on the socioeconomic scale and for women "downwards".  do women care more about both looks, qualifications and earning power of a man than vice versa? and does this expectation show a stigma of some sorts towards the whole issue of gender equality as a whole? like to hear your thoughts

 To add on (I'm not the OP of that message). The implication of evolutionary purpose would mean doing things that increase likelihood of passing on one's genes to the next generation. Consider the following scenario: Your parents are being trapped in a fire along with strangers. You save your parents first. Based on 's logic, we should save the strangers since they are more likely to pass on our genes than our parents (who have already passed on theirs). Generally, most of us save our parents. This doesn't show an evolutionary purpose. Using the evolutionary account doesn't explain fully the reasons behind an action, there is a need to factor in human relations. Otherwise, we would start saving strangers.

In relationship, trust is the most important element. If you keep thinking that the other person is a sociopath or two-timer, the best course of action is to call an end. You are driving the person crazy and sooner or later, the person will become what you wish for

I am personally against the LGBT lifestyle of promiscuity. Once I've seen two pairs of shoes in a cubicle. As much as I questioned it, I didn't confront the two individuals in the stall. But please gay people stop using toilets as your hangouts. I don't think an inter-uni LGBT group is good or effective. The school administration should step in to moderate the university's direction on LGBT issues.

I was reading Work-Life Balance My Foot by Prof Ben Leong and I was shocked, upset, downright angry even. 

Then I scrolled through the comments and the comments of the linked article and I smiled. 

I'm so glad that many people don't subscribe to those ideas - it's comforting to know that I am going to have less competition in the working world. (:

Every time I tell my relatives and friends that I'm a Theatre Studies major, I get weird/funny looks followed by some (well-meaning but lightly offensive) advice to change my major because it's not practical and finding a well-paying and sustainable job will be an insurmountable problem. They think that I do nothing but act and look pretty all day and will subsist on air and welfare handouts for the rest of my life.

Hey, it taught me some real skills okay. For example, I'm smiling politely and acting as if your advice really means something to me. Keyword: ACTING.

Okay, but seriously, don't tell me shit about my major and the degree I'm going to get and how I won't be able to do anything, because at the end of the day, it's still a Bachelor of Arts (perhaps with Honors). I can still do everything (and nothing). The difference is that I enjoy what I do, and I do what I enjoy. You can't take that away from me.

Disclaimer- this post is not intended to spread hate. It's just something I want to share.

So I've been in Singapore for a while now, and I made an uneasy observation. I come from a country that was under colonial rule as well, so we know very well how it felt like to be ruled by foreigners, or 'ang mohs', as they're popularly known. I feel that in most asian countries, we subconsciously perceive white people to be better than us. I see so much subtle kiss-assing going on when singaporeans talk to white people. Why are white people preferred for jobs that singaporeans will do just fine, if not better? This has got to stop. We're not worth lesser than them. We are all equal. We have to learn to respect our own race, and most importantly, ourselves. Whether we're yellow, brown, black, or even white, it doesn't make a difference in the kind of person you are or what you may achieve. Look at Singapore's story- we have achieved so damn much in such a short while, and instead of being proud, all I see is people complaining about the traffic, the mrt, and things like that. And people look up to the western world instead, searching for avenues to escape. We have to realize that what we have in this country is pretty damn special. And this is because all of us worked together, Chinese, Malays, Indians- 'yellow' and 'brown' people-  to make Singapore what it is today, and frankly, if we keep working like this, we'll soon surpass every other country and that means we won't have to look up to anyone. Everyone will look up to us. Since this is SG50, I think this is the time to be grateful and understand that we have in Singapore is special.
Love thyself, love thy country, amen.

I'm from Singapore (residing in Baltimore now), and the way that society works is that every person's intrinsic worth is judged by their paper qualifications. It was a culture which began millennia ago with China's Imperial Examinations and further exacerbated by PM Lee's late father, whose social engineering abilities brought this about. 
 
This reality is first brought to light for every person in Singapore when they're ten years old. By that point, the public school system would have "streamed" students into where they're either college-bound, mediocre or going to vocational school. Despite the talk about allowing for the "mediocre" or vocational school categories to work their way up, it is a lie when most resources are devoted to the college-bound category. Every parent wants their child to be in the first category, and dreads it when their child ends up in the latter two. 
 
This is, by the way, a school system which causes 22% of its children aged 6-16 to seriously consider suicide. 
 
My advice to PM Lee is to get his henchmen to set their example with their own offspring, and make prospect for blue collar work worthwhile. Otherwise, nothing is going to change.
-
 
Regarding , I agree with the OP. The comments claim a lack of  evidence but the evidence is in the fact that the laws still exist as they are based on the majority's social expectations. And let's not bring religion into this. I'm an atheist and I'm against it simply because it doesn't seem natural and serves no purpose from an evolutionary stand point. This doesn't mean I dislike homosexuals. I like people for their character. But it doesn't mean I support their lifestyle. 
-
 
 speaks the brutal truth. Anything and everything in life is judged based on a bell curve. We are only willing to pay a higher price if it is relatively better than the rest.

For example, in a group of men or women (depending on your gender), subconsciously more attention would be paid to the most good looking individual in the group. Other members in that group, even if they're good looking too, loses out on the amount of attention that is paid to them. And we naturally see that the most good-looking person is chatted up more frequently.

On a side note, this sets up a vicious cycle, actually. Since the most endowed person is chatted up more frequently, he/she will have more experience in dealing with such events, and gets better (in this case, becoming more smooth and knowing how to make others feel better).

Seeing the guys my age hanging out with girls 2 years younger made me see the distortion of time between the different sexes. The opportunities that they will never know they had lost; the setback in having a "rusty" brain as compared to their uni counterparts... I do see the unfairness between the treatment of males and females in this country but I never did dare to voice them out for fear of being judged.

Real life follows a power laws distribution than bell curve. They who lives in bell curve for too long will get surprised by a black swan.

Referencing    

Society has made great progress in LGBT rights, but still has a long way to go. Even though I would very much want to contribute to the push for more acceptance, I lack the courage to do so. 

People often have misconceptions about LGBT. It's definitely not a phase, and it's definitely not something that anyone wants. There are certain stereotypes about us, for example, that we live promiscuous lifestyles. As said, it's nothing but a stereotype. Some of us might lead such lifestyles, but it's not representative of us whole. In fact, we're as diverse as any other groups of people.

There are those amongst us who have accepted their sexuality and are active in pushing for our rights. However, there are some like me who are still afraid to do so. Public acceptance will help allay some of it, but many people seem to overlook the inherent difficulty that some of us face: self-acceptance. 

Self-acceptance has to ultimately come from within, but increasing society's acceptance of LGBT has been encouraging. Thank you, to those who accept us and help to push for our rights. Hopefully someday, we'll all have the strength and confidence to lead our lives truthfully.

How to handle gender imbalance within faculties:

Set a quota for each gender. If a faculty is predominantly male, give males a 55-60% quota. Likewise if a faculty is predominantly female, give females a 55-60% quota. Because there is an oversupply of students from the predominant gender, competition among the oversupplying gender will generally select higher quality students from the pool of applicants.

This has two main benefits:
1) Students of the opposite gender can find mates with potentially better material prospects.
2) Students of the oversupplying gender don't experience a supply bottleneck of potential mates.

Despite the effect of LGBT preferences, they are relatively few in number to make considerable statistical significance. So the overall intended effect can still be achieved for the most part.

University education is one of the hot places to find potential life partners. The most probable environment is the faculty of study. Of course, we know this is not the case for every single relationship - they may evolve out of involvement in CCAs, cross-faculty modules, extracurricular events, etc etc. But the fact remains that your own faculty has one of the highest probability, simply because of geographic location.

Many people seem to be supporting gay rights on this page but the fact of the matter is, the overwhelming majority of singaporeans and nus students do not support this but are too afraid to voice out for fear of attack by a loud minority. Whether it's right or wrong, singapore is not ready for this.
-
 
Guys in Computing and Engine, stop complaining about the lack of girls in your faculties. You only have yourselves to blame for not making the first move and shedding your nerd stereotype. As they say, all stereotypes usually have some statistical truth. No wonder those faculties have the highest male single rate.

Will the start of inter university LGBT network in NUS make us more open and accepting towards the LGBT community? 

I'm a guy and bisexual. Until now,I still have the feeling that the school community is unreceptive towards the idea of this. Whenever I tried hinting my friends about my sexuality or on topics of homosexuality,I will always get the irksome or disgusted faces. "Oh no. I think it's disgusting." 

If this is the case, the setting up of this network, though independent of the school's cirriculum, is weird. If there really is an effort or intention to spread and advocate the awareness and understanding of LGBT, why not make the network available to the whole school and not restrict it to Yale and Tembusu?

Currently, I don't even dare to confess to my guy friends that I am bisexual. I feel guilty when I keep staring at their bodies and fantasising about them. It is because of this social stigma that is so deeply rooted and instilled in our society that makes me and probably the rest feel insecure and uncertain.

Did you know, some of these people posting so self-righteously about troll commentors are such hypocrites? On one hand they tell people to be sensitive to the feelings of others, on the other they spew hate based on rash assumptions at the perceived trolls - hate far worse and far more explicit than anything some of these commentors have ever written - on the these supposed trolls' personal spaces. Do you pretend to know them? Are you familiar with how they communicate? Are they not people too? You may have started off with good intentions, but your actions damn you, and you are but a mutant of the ones you decry.
-
 
 I know how you feel. I consider myself "queer/questioning". Personally, I really detest being born a guy and stuff. 

I feel that people's opinions towards LGBT people are very much based on emotions rather than logic. So it may be really hard for someone who doesn't support the idea to be open in the sense. What the group should look at is to ensure no discrimination of a person based on sexual orientation. If a  person A makes a hate speech based on B's sexual orientation, it should be considered as bullying and dealt appropriately with. 

To get others to accept...i think it is pretty much an uphill task. But it seems to me that a number of people who are non-supportive of LGBT rights (they may be the extremes or the moderates) neglect the fact that LGBT people are being discriminated in Singapore. They simply campaign to prevent the promotion of the LGBT lifestyle.

 Yes, I am one of those who commented. Thank you for saying that I disagree for the sake of disagreeing. But isn't this a confessions page where we merely speak what's on our mind? Yes, we can agree to disagree or even disagree for its sake.

If you want you can PM me (it's easy to check who I am since the OP of , meaning  too, has already flagged me for "disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing".).

I know the seriousness of the issue, but why are we taking such a rigid stance for its rigidity and no-compromise sake?

What is this talk about LGBT and their rights? 

Liberal folks please keep in mind the sensitivities of your fellow Singaporeans when you talk about human rights and what not. 

Singapore is still a largely conservative society. The young idealistic people you meet in NUS is not representative of the conservative majority. 

What about freedom of religious rights to uphold the beliefs of traditional family values? Aren't you trampling on them too when you preach those Western values?

I am the OP of  and I'm here to defend it. On second thoughts I should have started a new paragraph after "made my heart sink," because now Lexus thinks saying "what did I just read" implies faulting him for everything from that point onwards. You are making yourself a victim of a non-existent slippery slope.

Being unsympathetic to the victim and "praising the perpetrator" only referred to the person who thought the victim "enjoy(ed)" the rape. All I was accusing you of was making light of this serious issue.

And I am still adamant that you and Jiawei were making light of this serious issue, despite you saying that "what did I just read" was merely an expression/reaction of surprise. Because it totally isn't?? "What did I just read" is literally a stock phrase that has been taken over by meme culture (http://tinyurl.com/m3elb34). It's a reaction meme used by people after they read something weird and are trying to keep a poker face.

Also, Jiawei first said "what did I just read", and someone replied, telling him to take this seriously. But still Lexus had the nerve to say the same thing again, practically ignoring the request to take this seriously. (Jiawei's first comment has since been deleted.) So nice try but no amount of explaining done on your part is going to convince me that you were merely surprised by what was written.

And lastly, Shawn Ng is just there to disagree for the sake of disagreeing. Why can't we all be allies in the fight against rape culture? I mean we all agree it's a bad thing right? It's simple as that.

"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor."

Comments under  which trivialised the rape victim's story by dismissing it with "what did I just read", and the one who gave shit to the victim instead of the perpetrator made my heart sink. Rape simply means non-consensual sex, and that inherently means no one "enjoys" it. That's literally the worst thing to tell a victim of rape, because not only are you being unsympathetic to the victim, you're praising the perpetrator for giving what you think the victim wanted.

Bear in mind that sometimes the victim has the ability to prevent rape before it happens, sometimes they don't. What is really consistent though, is the fact that rapists choose to have sex with their prey despite having no actual consent. Therefore it makes much more sense if we speak out against the perpetrators of rape instead of blaming the victims for not protecting themselves. A culture of victim-blaming also absolves potential rapists of any potential guilt and consequence of their actions.

I get that people love to hate Buzzfeed articles, but please take some time to educate yourselves about what is consent and what isn't consent. It's a good one. (http://bzfd.it/1cq9gs0)

Nobody knows this about me but I was a victim of rape. It happened a year ago in my room on campus. No I don't need your sympathy, or your advice, but thanks for the thought anyway.

I just want to write this down for all you girls and boys as a reminder. No means no. Stop means stop. Unless you and your partner have established a code and safety word beforehand, there are no other exceptions.

No exceptions. It doesn't matter if you were both 'tipsy' or if you were shown signs of arousal. If you hear no, it means no. No exceptions. If you hear stop, you stop.

And yes, even if you're the girl and the one saying no is a 21 year old guy with a raging hard-on. No means no.

When I was younger, I wish someone had told me straight-up that not all adults experience “a calling”. That many of them never find particular purpose in a career. That sometimes, their job is just what pays the bills and they have to seek satisfaction and fulfillment elsewhere. 

Because as an adult, this pervasive notion that there exists a perfect path for everyone, that people should love what they do, and that work is meant to function as a vehicle for fulfilling a person’s grand life destiny is not only inaccurate for many of us, it can be toxic.

The ideal is so ingrained that I have to remind myself constantly I’m not a failure because I don’t adore my job, and because I’m not rocking the world with my work. That is okay. 

If you love what you're doing then good for you, you got the better end of the deal. But for the vast majority of us, more often than not, work is just work. There isn’t always a perfect career path, magically waiting to be discovered. There might not be this THING you were born to do. Sometimes, you discover that what you really want to be when you grow up is “paid”.

To  You mentioned that a partner who insist on waiting till marriage before sex is most likely the right partner for a lifetime. Well, it could also mean that he/she lacks an interest in sex and/or aptitude in bed. To those people who place a high emphasis on the physical part of the relationship, it would be a great disappointment to learn about that only after marriage. Everyone has different needs and priorities in a marriage. To each his own.

To add, with the arrival of her son, Dashiel, the cute pictures attracts even more followers (come on, which girl would resist cute babies). Did I answer your question? ^_<

To poster 

You're far from alone.

Sexuality is hardly ever a black-and-white issue whether or not we choose to believe in the well-established Kinsey scale that defines human sexuality as a broad spectrum of possibilities with varying degrees.

I have known many friends who have had purely sexual attractions/escapades to/with the same sex. Yup they continue to have perfectly normal families of their own and life partners of the opposite sex. On the flipside too, there are many who just find their soulmate in the same sex as well. Something you might label as 'romantic' but I can tell you the connection probably transcends that way more. And no, these 2 people aren't f-buddies as well. Dude, that's how people have come up with terms like 'bromantic', 'man-crush' and 'gal-pal' to attempt and define these relationships.

In fact throughout the whole of history, plenty of evidence that it's safe to say the majority of our population aren't, in the most blunt way of saying this, '100% straight' or '100% gay'. It's pretty amazing how pressures from certain walks of society, religion, culture etc have been successful in trying to clearly delineate all these emotional and sexual boundaries into widespread stereotypes. Sure, reproduction is a main concern of the human race. But if numbers were purely the case, then we might as well be mosquitoes, cockroaches or cats and dogs. There's a reason to the survival and dominance of our race.  If the achievements of our race were just limited to pure biological functions similar to other species, such as reproduction and killing, we'd be just plain insulting our inner capability for a lot more higher-level stuff. And besides, I'd say our Earth is getting kinda crowded nowadays, wontcha think?

So hey don't worry , just be comfortable with who you are and enjoy life. I take it you're a NUS student as well so don't fret, you'll probably find people as open-minded, understanding and non-judgmental during your time there :)

in reference to confession 

I think my parents are happier after their divorce and so was I. There were no more daily fights and my parents are actually better friends now than they were lovers then. We are still a family albeit not one that fits the state-sanctioned and recommended model of family. I shouldn't even have to justify my family situation to you but seriously you are making incredibly shallow-minded judgements. It's people like you in this society that make dealing with social judgement and pressure after a divorce such a pain in the ass.

Can someone explain why the bellcurve is needed in Singapore Universities whilst this is not the case for a number of other Universities overseas? Yes, the bellcurve distinguishes the cream of the crop. But such a system only recognises people when they manage to beat out others, not because they've done well. This not only cultivates a selfish culture (not saying that this is definitely true, but surely you can't argue that the opposite is encouraged in such a system), but creates a learning environment that is motivated by sheer "mugging" rather than one that is motivated by an enthusiasm for learning.

Wow I'm amazed at how many people are treating the troll posts seriously. If you've been on the internet enough, you should be able to easily identify them. Telltale signs are when they unnecessarily mention a specific point meant to incite angry discourse.

For example , there is no reason for the person to specifically mention the fact that he 'stays in a condo' to make his point, and with almost 90% of the population staying in HDBs, I highly doubt an NUS student believes that staying in a condo is the 'average'; it is obviously meant to make people respond to it.  is another obvious troll, specifically implying that a CAP of 3.67 is "low", so the majority of students would feel offended and reply. 

Although I do find NUS Whispers entertaining, I find myself facepalming at the fact that so many people aren't discerning enough to realise they're being trolled. Happy whispering!

I'm a FASS major here and while NUSWhispers is terribly distracting (!), time spent here has been worthwhile. It's turning out to be a very well-constructed platform for analysis as to how people behave and interact in an online, virtual space, where anonymity leads to the deconstruction of physical and emotional barriers between people. In some ways, I start to understand how and why several types of people behave the way they do here, and relate it to theories and perspectives that I pick up from my *ahem* long-forgotten notes from lectures and tutorials. Income divides, shameless confessions, trolls, different perspectives; it has all been a very entertaining buffet of general information that I could take for my exams. It is strangely shaping up to be a trigger of social issues that we so often take for granted, with regards to the vastly different social positions we take up in society, via differences in age, gender, power relations......

So, thanks NUSWhispers! May you continue to serve up social issues and combined solidarities to keep all of us in a form of an "imagined community" (Anderson 1983) which bonds us throughout:)

(TLDR/don't understand the above: thanks NUSWhispers for bonding us together and providing a platform for understanding student lives and thoughts better!)

Sincerely, with much thanks!

to ... sometimes, it's not that 'religious ppl' are narrow-minded, it just hurts for both parties if they are of different religion. can you imagine you telling your bf/gf your story and then they say: 'lol. your god isn't real.'? it's like he/she is rejecting you esp if religion is a big part of your life. it's better for both to end the relationship early if one does not convert and the issue is straining the relationship. just my thought.

 Happen to see this reply and being a third party, I would say that I may not understand the POV for both of you but in my opinion, I think that it is a priviledge and not a given that we can ask our parents to pay for us.

in my case (and many others I believe), our parents are not ones who would pay for us, and this happens for my siblings as well. We take on loans and have to take on the burden on paying it off ourselves after graduation. Likewise, we have been working part-time during our academic years to save up and have not gotten pocket money from our parents. That being said, the house utility bills and dinner at home are still paid for by our parents. 

It is not that my family is poor, but rather, it is a difference in values and upbringing.

However, to say that you "don't believe that anyone can be so poor and still study in NUS" and even saying "Just ask your parents to pay lah!" seems to be over generalising that we have the same PRIVILEDGE(which seems to be in your case, a GIVEN) of getting our parents to pay for whatever we need or want.

to  and  such dysfunction of hardness could be linked to the brain only being turned on by the stimulus you have linked to getting hard (i.e. your hand motions or the videos you watch). so you should abstain from your self-loving and/or video-viewing habits whichever applicable so that the brain can rewire itself back to its normal response to physical sexual stimulus. the advent of the internet has allowed for sexual material to be propogated so freely. the full extent physical and physiological effects will be seen soon enough when the gen x/y reach the adulthood/middleage/oldage. so my advise to anyone out there, dont self-love too much, more importantly dont use a screen to be a stimulus of your self-love.

to  at least in your case religion was the genuine reason (i hope). imagine getting rejected supposedly because of religion only to later on find out she got attached to someone else not of her religion.

My parents, especially my mother, shaped my views on relationship and especially marriage.
My mother has a lot of suitors in her youth, many of them are rich and corporate heirs or successful entrepreneurs. It was confusing at first when she chose to marry my father who is short, ugly and poor. 

She said we don't need to be rich to be happy, but we cannot be so poor to the extent that we can't afford our meals. It is important to find a partner who shares the same views as you; she didn't want to work and wanted to be a housewife.

Find someone mildly religious, so that he/she wouldn't put god/deities above their spouse. 
Find someone who really stuck around and will remain faithful to you. She figured no one would want my father anyway. 

Most importantly, look out for his/her family background. 
-Don't marry a single child; the burden of taking care of his/her parents on top of our own will be enormous, both emotionally and financially. 
-Don't marry someone with a problematic childhood or come from a broken family. i.e. single parent family. It's okay if their parents are dead but they should not be divorced nor had a wedlock birth. (My mother's parents divorced when she was really young.) Their emotional burden will be carried over to your own marriage and generate a lot more insecurities than needed. 
-Don't marry a person with problematic siblings. (Mentally or physically challenged) No one wants to take on external burden. She wanted to break away from family because her brothers (my uncles) posed a lot of money issues for her. In the case of mentally-challenged relatives, very seldom we are so generous to take on care-taking roles for them. 

You may say my mother's decision is purely an economic cost-benefit analysis, but it's true they are still happily married after 30 years while people who married out of fantasy love and infatuations get divorced so quickly. I find love is an important starting point for marriage but it is the external forces (money, family, jobs) that keep it going.

 Hey whoever you are, please stop insulting my friend. She is very upset about your "claims" of her losing her virginity to you when you got no proof at all.

to 

To some people, it might be okay, as they are not that active in their religion. However, religion, to some, is a huge part of their life.  If you are very active in your religion, very likely you would like your partner to support you in it. Religion is not a trivial matter. Many times, people tend to struggle with what they believe as well. In times like that, your partner won't be able to rely on you to support him/her. It is not a good feeling to have to rely on another person more than the one who should be closest to you. This is why I feel that the choice he made was not for himself, but for the good of the both of you.

I do not think it is very narrow minded of your partner to think in that manner. Everyone has something that they hold very strongly and believe should not be compromised.

I hope that you can understand what I am saying, and not gain a negative impression on said religion.

Once upon a time, I was like you, a student back at NUS. In our time, however, we had no such thing like NUSWhispers. Life as we knew it had scandals, but they were of the “unspoken word”.

Today it greatly fascinates me at how much social media has changed the way we write. Being from SoC, I credit NUSWhispers for putting up what’s called a “giant social experiment”. Under the cloak of anonymity, we have read, for instance, sex stories in CLB (aren’t you guys worried there’re hidden cameras?), winking at cute girls and hoping they notice you (depends on who) as well as cursing over how hard mods are.

I wasn’t the best student, and in my time people haven’t really heard about Big Data yet, so SoC people were perceived to be “geeks” who could do stuff but aren’t that useful, and like some posters might be aware, geeks don’t necessarily have the best odds with girls. Of course, with Big Data, times have changed drastically and SoC graduates, well, have good odds navigating the job market. Many companies need Big Data, and so it comes as no surprise that we know of SoC students with lofty aspirations. However, keep one’s feet on the ground and prove you’re good, not ask for high salaries straightaway. A good boss will treasure you.

Moving onto relationships: cherish them when you can. I note many posts with trolls commenting on them. It is OK to break up, find a better partner or even boast about your exploits with whichever partner of your choosing, but getting attached is something one should think about with some depth. Will you want to be with that person in good or bad times? Chances are, if your other half is ranting on NUSWhispers, or sounds like one, you should think twice. It’s fun to read and learn about others’ plights but when one is on the receiving end or sending end of said plight, it is not so amusing anymore.

As to those declaring crushes: take heart. I have gone through breakups before, and then fell in love once again. It’s OK falling in love with a geek (not because I’m one, but because geeks are cool), but just know how to talk to one. ;) Geeks aren’t your normal kind of guy because they’re exceptional.

That’s all folks. Heard it’s finals fortnight. All the best for whatever, be it CS2010, CS1020, CS3217, whatever. I have no idea what all these stand for.

NUSWhispers admin team: good job! Without knowing it, you have made people realise how cool SoC people are at realising such applications such as anonymous portals!

to be honest it is a matter of personal judgement when it comes to "looking at scripts" before a test (i.e. when asked to turn pages). if you value the system of examinations negatively then trying to pull a fast one to enable a small time advantage could be debatable?however if you think examinations really are a true reflection of your skills or and a good measure of aptitude then it might be a different story. 

come to think of it its like stealing time back from the school. 

anyway if you inflated that train of thought to lets say stealing money from a bank because the system is bad and you want to help the poor. omg mindblown

to what extent do we go beyond what is written to be legal/moral to get better outcome for ourselves or others. is it right doing something seemingly immoral to achieve something  seemingly moral? what is morality? 

doesnt it feel like we are governed by too many rules, bounded by so many norms and expectations? (not saying its good or bad)

intimacy is one of lower requirements in maslows hierarchy of needs and it seems like many of us want that but do not want to jump into a relationship because of the commitment responsiblity etc. it seems like this need for intimacy driven by internal signals as well as external influences (lifestyle, media) is driving the transition of our society from conservatively asian values. im not sure how to feel about it. 

as it is I myself feel that i have a lot of love to give and this can be devoted to helping people making the world a better place taking care of family, finding inner peace rather than channeling it to one person for the rest of my life. i could do that just that intimacy and release is something that cannot be attained easily other than faps.

I'm not sure why people take every opportunity to blast NUSSU. It's a student run organization run by student just like us, just trying to provide best to their ability. 

If theres so much they're doing wrong then step up and try to implement the change. If you don't want to do anything about it then sitting on your computer (anonymously some more) 'bitching' about how bad they're doing isn't really going to change anything. Perhaps goes to show how immature we still are. 

Be the change you want. Complaining this way doesn't do any good.

for 
Debate in UK on miracles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hypMJ6lG7os

I also have a skeptical mind and I think faith healing does work in certain scenarios where it is psychosomatic, like a placebo. The questions you ask are good questions. Nobody had a limb or tooth grown back after they are lost.

People can choose kind of treatment they want even when we know that it doesn't work, provided that it is harmless. Pray, but continue to row the boat. Pray, but remember to take your medicine. What is bad about this is that there are reported cases of people who should have continued with medicine and evidence-based treatment but gave them up and died or suffered as a result. A video on youtube documents this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJfaaPdP0kI. 

When I said that 'faith healing does work', I do not mean to say that I accept that the causes are the metaphysical or religious claims made by the healer, ie. Holy Spirit. The phenomenon can be studied naturally, from sociology to psychology. Key concepts when questioning faith healing are Occam's razor, post hoc ergo propter hoc and confirmation bias.

Firstly, following Occam's Razor, we ought not to unnecessarily attribute causes to events. Jesus might as well be the cause of healing a headache, but if a certain level of belief that one will get better is enough for him to get better (AKA placebo), and it can be shown that this is the case, why is Jesus needed as an explanation? Why is it that Jesus doesn't seem to heal from afar, or at least heals more when Benny Hinn is at close proximity?

Secondly, many illnesses and symptoms go away by themselves. Because x happened after y doesn't meant y caused x. Even cancer has a chance of remission without interference.

Thirdly, how many of the requests are fulfilled? People always remember the nice stories but they probably don't know or forget the many who didn't get healed or probably got worse. So are we getting an accurate picture of its efficacy? There are theological rationalizations for this like how God has his timing and all but there are also criticisms for them.

I don't believe in faith healing (the claims of those who suffered because of faith healing can be disputed) but that is not as important as getting the questions and methodology right when evaluating phenomenons like this. Of course one can say faith healing is precisely that - based on faith - to which I dare thee to deny medical treatment for thyself or a loved one when kena cancer. Most people who believe in prayer, faith healing, astrology, horoscope, fortune telling, TCM, feng shui and so many more don't really think of these questions. Life is simple. I do X, Y happens, therefore X causes Y. Many people say the same thing too. No need statistical analysis or critical scrutiny of any sort. Which is sad. But don't worry there is uni which will save us all. #LOLwhoamikidding.

Ciao,

Has anyone actually experienced faith healing? As a skeptical mind, I really have trouble believing it and even more so understanding why people believe in it. It's 2015, how can people still buy that?
From a purely common sense point of view,

Why has no faith healer cured cancer
Why has no faith healer cured amputees
Why has no faith healer conduct sessions at the hospital

Just a few questions to think about.

Sincerely,
A real person

But seeing the overly buff gym addicts around campus wearing curved cut fbt (aka. boxers) and singlets with extremely low side cuts (why are you even wearing a top?) make me cringe and I can't help but stereotype them as someone desperate to get laid, a dependent creature who for some reason is totally unfamiliar with the concept of exercising alone and is in a constant search for a gym buddy.

Let's face it. CAP is important. So are the other sections on your resume and your actual skills and ability (and looks!). You can debate the relative importance all you want but the fact is it differs for each function and industry. Those who are capable and know what they are doing don't need public affirmation of what they are doing. Those who have to put down others (CAP vs portfolio) to feel better about their ineptitude usually don't have both, or anything for that matter. But that's none of my business (:

What makes it worse is that I live in a small town so business is pretty limited, and where I work is the only place that’ll hire desperate people looking for a job. I’d get out of this place if I could. I’m socially awkward, even my only other co-worker really hates my guts. I have repressed lust for one of my best friends too; she’s athletic, smart, and a gorgeous southern bell. I love her. You know what it’s like; I’ve been friend zoned real hard. She’s my only best friend, besides this one kid, who I’m pretty sure is only hanging around me because he is mentally challenged. I guess he’s the only one that can tolerate me. And what makes this all worse is that I live in a bloody pineapple under the sea.
Kiasu-ness should be banned in NUS.
I don't want to start a holy war here, but what is the deal with you Mac fanatics? I've been sitting here at my freelance gig in front of a Mac (a 8600/300 w/64 Megs of RAM) for about 20 minutes now while it attempts to copy a 17 Meg file from one folder on the hard drive to another folder. 20 minutes. At home, on my Pentium Pro 200 running NT 4, which by all standards should be a lot slower than this Mac, the same operation would take about 2 minutes. If that.
In addition, during this file transfer, Netscape will not work. And everything else has ground to a halt. Even BBEdit Lite is straining to keep up as I type this.
I won't bore you with the laundry list of other problems that I've encountered while working on various Macs, but suffice it to say there have been many, not the least of which is I've never seen a Mac that has run faster than its Wintel counterpart, despite the Macs' faster chip architecture. My 486/66 with 8 megs of ram runs faster than this 300 mhz machine at times. From a productivity standpoint, I don't get how people can claim that the Macintosh is a superior machine.
Mac addicts, flame me if you'd like, but I'd rather hear some intelligent reasons why anyone would choose to use a Mac over other faster, cheaper, more stable systems.
I like big butts, and I cannot lie. You other brothers cannot deny...

NUS is like a pressure cooker. Stressful it might be, but good food you will get in the end. :)
Many people think that I am in love with her...but I am actually in love with him.
