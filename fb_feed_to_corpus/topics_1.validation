I thought being on the giving end of unreciprocated love hurts the most. But being on the receiving end really hurts too.

There's this girl I've known for 3 years now. She's amazing: beautiful, kind and funny. I started getting more attracted to her in our final year of school and she did too, as we became closer.

I thought maybe she could be someone I could be better for, someone I could give a piece of myself to, someone I could fall for. But after a while, I realised it wouldn't be that way. I do not seem to have the capacity to love her the way she deserves or wants to be loved. I wish I do. I really do.

Of course, I have told her this and she wants to at least remain as friends, which I am very open to. But sometimes I feel that she's still trying and it saddens me to think of how exhausted she might be. I don't really know what to do. I feel guilty and trapped.

I feel quite heartbroken to be rejected after confessing to a guy. And he told me I'm not his type cuz my facial features aren't his ideal type. The strangest thing is he was the one who suggested we could be a couple in the first place cuz we have much in common and to talk about. It hurts to have your feelings toyed with in this manner.

As a bro, I have some advice to my fellow Singaporean guy friends. Stop drowning in self-pity when girls don't desire you, because you're worth more than that. Just assume girls are after you for your success and money, and work for it. Think from a university Singaporean girl's point of view.  A poor university girl would want a better life in the future, having been sick of living that life for 20 over years, while a rich girl would never want to compromise on her existing life style. Love is never enough for a relationship to last towards marriage. Money(security) is. So if you're a poor Singaporean guy without a charming accent, or something that is terribly unique about yourself, just forget about finding any Singaporean girl for the time being, because it simply will not work out. Always remember that girls are biologically wired to look out for mates that could protect her using the resources that a guy has. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and go and earn money. The girls will come after that, I guarantee, no matter how unattractive you are. Just remember the affair of the Bukit Batok MP and judge for yourself. Take care brothers, don't let any girl be your world. Remember, you live in materialistic Singapore. So know how the game is played, and have the materials needed to be desired by these materialistic girls.

 I think you are in love. You should tell the someone how you feel about them. It will make you feel better.

Recently I fell out with a friend over our disagreement regarding my insecurity of my singlehood. For the context, I'm a single male and turning 23 this year. 

I've always been very insecure of my self-worth even outside of a relationship and all through my life my growing up years have not helped matters much. All my life I've been the one chasing. Be it friends for outings, group mates for work, or girls in love. Now for the record I'm not some horrible human being who's a psychopath or something. I'd call myself an intense individual who's passionate about his values and loyal to a fault. But for some reason, other men who are utterly irresponsible (I believe the term "fuckboy" can be used here) seem to get all the luck in dating, love and friendships. Never mind that being fake or an asshat to gain popularity is pathetic to the max, the fact that they seem to succeed at doing so does nothing but make me feel depressed. 

I was the one that posted an earlier confession regarding how I felt bitter about hearing people console me about my relationship status with the "waiting for the right person/right time" quibble. That was precisely the argument I got into with my ex-friend. She thought I was too hung up on my singlehood status, and that I shouldn't be lurching from crushing moodiness to recklessness in mentality whilst dealing with it and growing up. I was the one that retorted saying that 1) good things don't always happen to good people so who has the right to decide when someone gets a happy story or ending? And 2) if a single person (be it male or female) can't date when he/she is young and not yet bogged down by life's commitments (jobs, bills, whatever), then good luck with finding love when you grow older and all these commitments start coming into your life permanently. 

Like it or not, society stigmatises single men as much as it does single women. Males are shamed tremendously for being single and/or not having a girlfriend or a significant other. Single males in media are portrayed as nerds or all-around losers. As soon as a male of a dating/marriage age goes without a significant other for any particular amount of time, the speculation starts. Is he gay? A player? Just a loser? Low self-esteem? Man child? It’s never discussed that he may be single by choice/no choice (because somehow he never catches someone's eyes), it is always speculated that it is some sort of failing on the part of the male. 

If you can’t even get into a relationship and hold it down and make it work when you have minimal commitments and are still young and in your prime, good luck imagining that it would supposedly get better with age because hey, society seems to believe that men’s dating values only go up as they grow older! How many older men get hitched up because true love happened, or is it because the women who hitched up with them are themselves afraid of being left on the shelf, or worse still these women are just gold diggers cosying up to men they perceive to be materially stable for themselves?

Maybe I'm just very cynical about love and relationships now. I'm not religious and therefore I refuse to believe in religion's rhetoric about how some "sky father in the sky" has a higher purpose for us all and that he has planned everything out for our life. I feel myself becoming increasingly bitter and jaded internally and in my heart I really don't know if I'll have what it takes to have faith in myself anymore. I'm confident in my own innate abilities to make it for myself in life, but who ever cares if one can make it on his own in life, when he doesn't have a woman who loves him for... him? 

I'm sick of it. For once, let me be the one who's desired and wanted.

To  and  I was bullied into performing sexual acts for a guy when I was still a minor. He was of legal age. 

I see him in NUS sometimes. I hate him to the core and I cannot forgive him. He took my innocence.

Because of him, I wasn't able to speak to guys. I lost most of my guy friends then. We have mutual friends but I refuse to go anywhere near him without my boyfriend accompanying me. I'm scared he'll approach me and touch me. I'm afraid he'll pinch my cheek and tell me I'm cute. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm smart but he's smarter. I'm afraid he'll tell me I should straighten my hair. I'm afraid he'll tell me I should wear makeup to enhance my face and chest. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm too tall. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm too heavy. I'm afraid of his compliments because in the end they make me feel incompetent. 

I never made a police report because I thought my innocence was worthless. That I was ugly and stupid and that I was so lucky to have someone showing even the slightest interest in me. He told me all that. 

Today, I'm afraid of random guys approaching me and telling me I'm cute or asking for my number. I'm afraid they will push me against a wall and forcibly kiss me. I'm afraid I can't run fast enough. I never walk home at night while listening to music because he followed me one night and groped me while I wasn't paying attention. He laughed it off as a joke but I didn't.  

I recently heard that he'd done these things to other girls in university as well. I want to smack his face with a chair. I've outperformed him in every aspect- academically, socially, but I cannot get his smirking face out of my head.

I have trust issues. I have body image problems. My boyfriend tells me I'm unique and perfect and I feel happy but deep down, I don't know.

My advice to OP, stay far far away. You're better than that, unless you want the past to repeat itself.

I am a guy here and I am in a few online dating apps. To be honest, I dont see the possibility of the event that my significant other and eventually my partner will be from an online dating .In online dating, I always feel that I am falling for someone based on only looks and that is definitely not love. I will still prefer the traditional way of meeting my significant other. It will be more mysterious and I believe the feelings will be more natural that way.

Been having sex with this girl for months. She initiated. But she has a boyfriend. For me, i'm perfectly fine. For that guy, I feel sad for him.

Alright i need some advice here.

I'm the group leader for quite a large scale project (worth 8 MCs since it's 2 modules combined together). As a group leader i'm not the kind who would order my team around, like "you do this", "you do that". But rather i'll take the responsiblility and initiative to get things/discussions going, ask the tutor on behalf of the group if there's anything, make sure group dynamics are good etc. As a result i have quite a good relationship with everyone in the group. We're all comfortable with each other and get along really well.

Now the problem is that in the past week or so, i noticed one of my group members has started focusing less attention on his project do presumably do other modules. he's doing a double degree and i know that's hell. I don't think it's right for me to ask him to switch his attention back to the project as i know it would be unfair to him since he did put in quite a lot of effort earlier on. But we're nearing the end of the project which is also the most critical phase as we need to rigorously test everything. I know if i ask him to do something, he would get it done but i'm very sure it wouldn't be up to standard. 

I was thinking of doing his part on my own, but then again why should i help him do his stuff when i too have other modules to take care of?  I don't want to confront him directly about this as we're pretty good friends, but more importantly, i don't want to potentially cause any upset in the team dynamics, especially during this critical phase of the project. How should i go about doing this? Any advice?

Saw a post regarding depression, and many of you commented. I don't suffer from depression, but I do suffer from social anxiety. I don't have any friends at school, and it gets worst during exam period. Just walking to MPSH makes my heart beat so fast. And beacause I have no one to hang out with, I just feel everyone's judging me. MPSH gets SO PACKED. It freaks me out. Plus the exam hall is huge! I feel extremely insecure there, I feel it's affecting my 'exam performace' too! Has anyone dealt with this before? I've been to UHC before regarding this, but I'm hopeless. Any advice? Would really appreciate if you guys could make a separate post, because I'm too shy to PM you. Thank you very much!

Hi OP of . I am curious too but I guess most people will be defensive and "mature: about it and claim that you are being nosy or immature, when you're really just curious as you've mentioned. I'll be honest with you, I'm a girl and I know that it is could be jealousy. I know many girls that dislike other girls for no good reason. They don't do it upfront and will still pretend to be friends in person. It isn't a good thing yet it seems normal and pretty much unspoken. The dislike is usually targeted especially so towards girls who are quite pretty but are awkward in groups. I guess they are seen as unfriendly or intimidating maybe? Hope that helps! Just rmb that not all girls are like that though :D
-
 
I sometimes find it difficult to meet up with people on a regular basis, but how do I hold off interactions without hurting their feelings? I don't think it's as simple as telling them outright that it's tiring, especially if we're not close enough yet and from what I know the other party doesn't seem like he/she would identify with the idea

Sometimes I wonder how many guys I have unknowingly friendzoned.

Then I remember I'm not really above average in terms of looks and I'm probably the one who gets brozoned instead.

OP of  here. That day, one of my messaging apps notified that Girl 2 has joined that particular app. Apparently, over these few years, her number remained on my phone contacts because I loathed expending the effort to clean up my phone contacts. Yes, I am very lazy that way.

Feeling curious, I opened up the app and there it showed her as one of the automatically-added contact. As I have nothing to say to her anyway, I closed the app and resumed my normal activities. A day later, when one of my friend messaged me on the app, I discovered that Girl 2's contact has been shown as hidden (i.e. I got blocked).

Clearly, she must have realised that I was on the app and took the step to block me. The hurt must have been sufficiently deep for her to be rankled enough to block me over all these years.

It made me feel guilty.
-
 
Sometimes I wonder if he is genuinely busy? Not interested anymore? Or just doesn't know how to hold conversations with girls? As he comes from a male-dominated background. Knew him for a few months but yet not much progress, maybe I should move on too.
-
 
 I was in a similar situation except that the guy is taking things way too slowly. So I basically ended things as there's no point in wasting my time further... 

Guys, if you are interested in the girl, please don't take your own sweet time... It is either you act fast or just let her go.

 Does shy quiet and pretty/cute girls exist in the first place? Have anyone encountered such girls before? Or shy and quiet is mutually exclusive with being good looking lol?

 I probably had depression once. It was after a breakup. It was the longest month in my life. I literally ran out of things to do and the days were so long. No motivation to do anything. Not even the thing I used to love, video game. You know, usual things: loss of apetite as well. At those times I realize that friends are of no help. They don't really cheer you up. You don't wanna get out of the house. I live alone, far away from my parents.

Anti-depressants, though personally I have not had them; studies showed that don't work too well. They are basically like amphetamines or cocaine. It jacks up your dopamine and helps you get through the day. It gets you to function, but part of the problem of depression is you have no close bonds, no close intimacy that get you happy. It's not really different from any other addiction. Like porn, sex, heroin, or cocaine.

Anyway, there's the issue of how to deal with work. Not really study. Study requires motivation; something you are in short supply in depression. Work, I can soldier my way through the more monotonous tasks. Not reading or writing though. I got through that with massive amounts of cheap instant coffee. They are really disgusting (now that I drink fancy specialty coffee; and manage to differentiate the coffee brewed at 2 degree Celcius difference), but they provide the dopamine required to not crash.

Other than that I went to lots of meetups and parties. Download the Meetup apps. Talking and socializing with strangers put your depression into the background noise. I learned so much socializing from those. Not realy making friends though. But a few hours after work drinking and talking with strangers take my minds of the depression. Made me tired enough to actually sleep and get 8 hours of bedtime.

I learn improve and acting. I read Homer and a few books. Online dating. All of those. Just to pass the time.

Well, what really kicked me off depression train is my current relationship; which I got into after that one long long month. Somehow my conduct on my first date was attractive enough to land myself a new relationship. I've never been happier in my life. She's just perfect.

 There is a problem, is that you rush things too much. As such, you burn out too quickly. The solution being, you have to learn how to take things slowly. 

Meeting a new person, you will have this rush of wanting to find out more about this person, who is he, etc., right? 

1) Well, you have to feel more confident in your own skin first - because partially, you're reacting this way in response to something alien to you.  

As a guy, I learnt more about myself, about what kind of behaviour will stress me out, etc., so that I will learn how to deal with various situations less anxiously. You have to be more confident, and less insecure.

What I do, about that rush that comes along, is that I try to calm myself down, and distance myself a bit (not too much) - because from hindsight, I can analyse the situation better, and adjust my pace. 

2) I focus more on learning about the new person's situation first, rather than immediately knowing how the person is like, what he does, etc. In time, this is the way I know a person better. 

Understand that if I meet you, and if you talk to me, I will take a bit of information about you, and that tidbit is what I allow myself to take and develop further; I think about it, and delve deeper into the topic, rather than asking you about all other stuff that you do.

This is how I prevent myself from rushing head-on into friendships and relationships - because it's not about the intensity of the fireworks, but more about keeping the fireworks alive. 

You should re-evaluate your efforts - because, as how we engineers describe problems, it's not just about the amount of effort put in, but is your approach wrong?

Hi I'm posting this confession to find out if anyone has the same problem as I do and how do you overcome it? So basically I think I have commitment issues. It's like every time I meet a new person and I'll be super interested in him, but after a while I'll be like "ew why is this guy texting me so much?" And I'll naturally ignore his texts until he gives up completely. This has happened more than once and I have no idea what to do... I honestly am trying very hard to settle down but every time someone likes me back, I will try to end things. Is there something wrong with me?
-
 


I think I understand how you feel! My boyfriend is in NS too, and with all his outfields and extras I hardly get to spend any time with him in person or even through text. And sometimes I do feel distant from him too! So naturally I talk more to my other freer guy friends. It’s easy to have feelings or even fall for someone who has more time for you every day, and who wont be leaving you in the future for Australia. I think its natural for you to look to your best friend as a potential partner instead (and I have done the same too) But I think its important for you to evaluate what your boyfriend means to you! If he is really someone you can marry, then hang in there! Stick by him! It sounds like he’s the one for you. A selfless love is the best kind of love anyway! 

Im pretty sure that telling you that there’s Skype and there’s LDR couples who made it wouldn't really help! Maybe you can take comfort in the fact that Australia is pretty near to Singapore and you will most likely graduate earlier than him so maybe you can join him there! And time will surely pass and he will be back from Australia in the end! Who knows, after putting your relationship through such challenges, you’ll be a stronger, more grounded couple! Talk to him about it, he’s the best person to make you feel better about this. If he is really the one and you know it, then love him with no conditions!

As for your best friend, dont make him an innocent victim! Dont ruin a perfectly good friendship just because you cant help but feel jealous. Figure out how you feel! Its not a crime to fall for him, but if you can get over him, please do! I think the ball is in your court for this one! Only you can stop yourself for having such feelings for him. Dont worry, you will make it out of this alive!! Keep pushing on and always find the bright side amidst all this bullshit life throws at you. All the best!

To the person who wrote . I totally feel you. 

Exactly same situation as you.  In terms of break up over incompatibility, both of us weren't at fault, both of us handled the relationship maturely, I can't convince her that we have a future etc. 

It has been almost a year since we ended our 1y10m relationship. After the break up,  when looking at things objectively, i was certain that she isn't the right one for me, i don't want her back anymore etc.

But it just felt so blissful in the dreams: she regretting her decision and coming back to me, we had a future, we enjoyed each other's company so much etc. Such dreams wrenched my heart for the next few days. I can really feel it. The heart crushing sensation. 

The dreams have been so repetitive that my friends were asking me to use tinder. Just socialise and not for the sake of getting attached/getting a fling. So i tried tinder. True enough, talking to new friends helped me better understand the female's perspective. It was really quite pleasant exchanging life stories. 

But talking to them made me realised one thing, my ex was still better compared to all of them. Except for the fact that she doesn't love me as much as i loved her.

I have no idea why am i posting this but I genuinely hope that you and i (and everyone else facing this situation) can learn to love again.

I'm in the same situation. And you know what hurts the most? I believed in the cheesy tactics a guy deployed to get me, thinking it came from real kindness, and care. I mean I was confident that I would never fall for things like that, but look where I am.

When he stopped the chase, I do feel sad. Unexplanably so. I know I don't like him yet, but I feel disappointed that I actually held on to the thought that someone really cared for me. And that this was going somewhere. I even thought about asking him what he really felt about me, but I don't want to become a joke anymore. If he's playing games, at least I will pretend that I was playing along all the time. 

Cheer up... Everyone has this moment. But at least after this time you know where you are and how gullible you can be. When you see signs he was not that much into you, walk away before you became a joke.
-
 
When you're crying in your room for the hundredth time contemplating a breakup, and your partner sends, "Hey, I just wanted to tell you I miss you and hope you have a good night's sleep." 

My heart is breaking. I still like him and will always care for him but we are too incompatible to work out in the long run. I can't bear to do this and I don't even know where to start but I know I will have to do it eventually. 

This is so painful and I have never done this before.

My bf of 3 years is in NS. Things are great between us - we talk about marriage and the future and we meet up weekly. Unfortunately, our schedules have started to clash and we haven't meet up as much these last two months. It worries me because he's going to Australia to study once he ORDs but nowadays when we can't meet for a week I already feel like we're more distant. When we do meet up though, all is forgotten and things go back to being great. 

My best friend in school is this other guy. He texts me everyday and we study and eat lunches and pretty much spend most of our time together. We're in the same groups for multiple projects. I know he only sees me as a friend as he tells me about all his crushes and dates and asks for advice. It's been very clear that we are just friends. But I recently i find myself more and more enjoying talking to him, bec we just have so much things we do together. I feel very lonely whenever I'm not with him and sometimes tell him about my school stuff before my bf (because my bf wouldn't really get it anyway).  Last week,  I accidentally saw my friend on on a lunch date (which he told me about) with his crush and I suddenly felt really jealous.

My bf knows about my friend and is slightly jealous but doesn't object to me being around him. But I feel like I'm emotionally cheating. Do i cut contact with my guy friend? He'll be so surprised and hurt and I'll be even more lonely. And how will my bf and I make it when he goes to Australia? What do I do? :(

I will not say that I am very successful at the dating game. After all, in the past 5 year, I've only in 2 relationships. However, the break time between those 2 relationships are only about 1 month. I have not spent any of the past 5 Valentine days alone; and probably will not; since I'm marrying at the end of this year, unless one of us die a sudden death or we break up. Anyway, I can probably attribute my success to my psychopathy. I'm not a psychology major, but according to the self-report psychopathy test, I am a high primary psychopath but low secondary. According to the test, primary psychopathy concerns affection side of psychopathy with the lack of empathy for others; while the secondary deals with the anti-social side of psychopathy: withdrawals, rejection, failure to learn, and inadequate motivation.

I can attest to the lack of empathy. When I read the recent news that a little girl got her head chop off by a crazy fucker, my first thought was not "how horrible", but "Holy shit, off-the-shelf meat cleavers can do that?" followed by "that crazy dipshit was lucky to be alive to be arrested". I generally do not give two shits about people I do not know. Live and let live. As long as they are not in my way, we are cool. I do not care if you die away from me. But if you die in front of me, it signals to me that something dangerous is going on and I should GTFO. But if you are in my way, or harm someone I care about, I will go to the end of the Earth to destroy you. My views on the refugee crisis is: "the fact that they can run away will make the war a lot longer". War's objective is to stack up corpses. War usually ends when enough corpses are piled up and people are too exhausted to fight. All the ceasefire, peacetalks, and people running away just delay that inevitable end; leading to Eternal Wars. Get on with the dying and perhaps we can end these war (before you flame me, take 15 minutes to read this excellent essay https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1999-07-01/give-war-chance . Give War a Chance!). The best way to stop the crisis is to send commandos to attach mines to refugee ships BEFORE people get on them. That's also perfectly legal. Countries are only obliged to care for refugees when they are on its soil. As long as they die somewhere else, it's not out business,

As for the secondary psychopathy, luckily, I'm quite good at not having. I'm sociable enough, appear friendly enough, and somewhat motivated for my work and study. I also found that while I do have enough energy to care and love others, that list is unfortunately very very short. I have no problem with staying faithful since my capacity for loving someone is limited. I learn from my past mistakes in my first relationship and apply it to my current life. Some of the mistakes are quite generic: taking them for granted, wanting to win in an argument, losing physical affection and attraction, failing to surprise, being a bit needy. I can't be happier in the current rs, but I still hate my ex for causing me one month of pain and suffering. I don't exactly hold on to the grudge, but I will leave my ex alone. Unless I can get away with it, and the opportunity presents itself.

So there, some guides on the dating game. Here's a few thing you could do to improve your social skills (very important). Download Meetup apps and find things you might want to do. Sports, drinks, party, interest groups. I suggest learning Social and Ballroom dance. It's a good opportunity to interact with the opposite sex, there's always more girls than guys, most girls there are single (if they are not, they will be there with their bf. And those twos only dance with each other). Improv is an excellent thing to learn because it teaches you to be extremely fast on your feet, and how to be expressive. Acting is not bad, if you can find the class.

If you are in a relationship, here's a big tip: physical intimacy changes everything. It's like sitting on a truck, closing your eyes, and hitting the pedal to the metal. It increases the closeness and intimacy very very quickly. It also blinds you BTW. But be consistent. Always escalate; not descalate, if you want it to be steady. Don't suddenly one day say: "I don't want us to do it anymore"; unless you want to derail the r/s. Without physical intimacy, you two are just a pair of close friends. It does not always mean sex. But a few orgasms here and there by whatever means work wonder. Yeah, guys, learn your arts and crafts of making a girl orgasm. It helps immensely. And no, not with porn.

I have a question for guys. What does it mean when you suddenly stop chatting with a girl you have been talking to everyday for hours? And what does it mean when you, still, drop a random mess, only to never reply to her? Aren't you supposed to pretend she never exists if you're bored of her so that you can get rid of her?

I am a year 3 student here who do not like talking to people whom i don't know. However, i talk a lot to people whom i had already known for years. I dislike joining any social events because i do not have much interest to make new friends as it requires me to step out of my comfort zone. Furthermore, up till this point in time, i never had a single guy friend (i'm a girl) even though i was from mixed gender schools all the way. I admit i am very shy to interact with the opposite gender and never overcome it and neither do i know how to talk to guys. I am intending to stay single anyway so it does not matter to me if i can communicate with guys, at least in my opinion. I already had the intention of having a good female pal if i ever need companion. If cannot find, i don't mind being alone either. However, i had 3 qns below: 

a) whenever by chance, i happen to catch a guy looking at me, i was always the first to look away because it felt so awkward. Even when guys do try to approach me for a convo, i simply cannot talk so i don't make any effort to talk. I don't bother either because i don't intend to make friends with any guys since i really don't know how to talk to them. In other words, don't know and don't care. My parents warned me that if i had zero guy friends, i had a high chance of getting cheated by bad guys who only wish to take advantage of me. How true is this statement? The guys here seems decent though.

b) whenever i walk along the streets or to/from NUS, i always stare at my phone and refused to look at people because i do not want to end up seeing people whom i might know because i felt lazy to smile or greet people so if i could i would avoid that. I do not even know who is in my module cohort because i simply go lecture just to gain knowledge so i don't care who is in my cohort. Can i just continue the way i am simply because i feel so comfortable by keeping to myself?

c) obviously i had never gotten into a relationship before because i know falling in love is to be vulnerable. You have to be prepared to get hurt. Of course there are happy endings but i do not like to enter anything that is uncertain. This is also part of the reason why i never wish to be friends with any guys so as to make sure i have zero chance of developing feelings for anyone. Don't even ask me to try even once because i will not. Is this a wise move? 

Perhaps i should provide some info about my family background. I am the only child so naturally my parents are very protective of me. I do not have to work just to earn my own money, so the only time i ever worked was for 3 months as i wish to clear an internship module. In fact, i appear so innocent that many people thought i was still in high school. So far, i had been able to get almost anything i wanted. For now, i felt so unmotivated to learn to talk to people because i felt too comfortable being by myself. 

I wonder if there's is anyone in similar situation as me or used to be like me. If there is, please do share your experiences on another post if that is more comfortable to you? 

Also, is there any correlation between my family background and how i dislike socialising?

Please don't flame me as i genuinely wish to hear some views and perhaps some advice on how to make myself motivated to learn to socialise... Thanks.

I dreamt about you last night. 6 years after you walked out of that door, telling me you can't do this anymore. Best April's Fool joke played on me - a dream about you.

I dreamt that you came back to me, to my arms. I dreamt that we continued, or we started over. We were together. We had a future. We had a family. We had each other.

I woke up. Trying to replay the dream in my mind. Trying to recall every single moment of that fantasy. Us. Together. You always did call me stupid for letting my dreams affect me so deeply. But as reality hits me, and I prepare for the day, a drop of tear escaped my eyes. Unintentionally. I didn't even have enough time to hold it back. The harsh reality that like all April's Fool joke, it is a joke. You would never come back. Like your final words: there is no more us.
Perhaps the most heartbreaking thing is the fact that neither of us was wrong. Neither of us were the demanding party, or the childish one. In fact we were both too  mature that we understood how both of us couldn't have a future together. 
Nothing went wrong. Because it was never right to begin with. We werent compatible. But I was convinced I could make it work. But I couldn't convince you. And as i lay on my bed now, thinking about you,  looking through our photos together, typing this. I wonder if i will dream of you again tonight. I am grateful seeing you in my dreams. For you will always be in my heart and memories.

Every day since that night, I doubted if I could ever love someone as much as I loved you. Or if I could even love again at all.

And like every cheesy romance movie: I will choose it all again if I had a choice.
Sleepy. I close my eyes. I cry. As I remember the day I first met you. How we got lost and met on the bus. The words I first told you. And the words that I always told you out of the blue, during our dates, and the night you walked out of my life. Do you remember?
"Did I ever tell you how lucky was I to have met you?"
Goodbye my pris-cess

Ever since I saw zootopia, going to the Utown fairprice has felt exactly like this:

I am a year 1 girl here and I really need help! So for the past few months I have been suspecting my BF is cheating on me. He always WhatsApp girls behind my back and when I ask to look at the messages, he refuses to show them. So yesterday I used his phone while he was asleep to access his WhatsApp. His WhatsApp kept crashing and I can't open it. I updated the app but it still doesn't work. Then I tried WhatsApp on my phone, I faced a similar problem. Anybody knows how to fix this issue?? Thanks!!

Hey guys, anyone knows how to download lecture videos from IVLE so can watch offline? Thanks~

I know I'm good looking, I have confidence in my looks. Or so I thought. Cos if I really did, why do I see really nice and good looking guys and think about how he's never going to be mine cos he'd never go for a girl like me..
-
 
I know I don't have the right to be angry in the first place. I don't own you, perhaps never will. But my apologies are sincere. And my feelings are real. I guess your distance means I must give up right? I would, but please give me time. We were close and you started shaking up my world. But now by keeping your distance away from me, you're doubling the force. See you tomorrow. 
-
 
I really don't like it when people keep adding to be honest when they speak or chat. It sounds like they are very arrogant. Like they need to be honest to tell you something because you probably won't understand if they tell you normally. When someone keep using to be honest, usually I would want to honestly tell them to shut up, because to be honest they suck.

I need some advice and comfort. I went through a breakup recently and I spend my days being miserable and hopeless. I am able to distract myself at school or work, but when I go home or about to sleep or just waking up, I'm overwhelmed by fear and loneliness. I used to spend every weekend with my SO and now in the weekend, I even feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience cuz I sometimes found myself looking up and realising I'm all alone in my room. It's strange cuz I'm not used to being all alone during the weekends. It makes me feel so lonely. 
-
 
Oftentimes, especially when I'm at the receiving end, I feel something is not right, however I cannot immediately express it out.

Sometimes I get a case of "staircase wit". "Hah, if only I said this then, they would have shut up and shown themselves the door". But I tell myself that it's no use to be witty, or even argumentative.

More importantly is that when some time have passed, and I analyse the situation, I often find that their argument is full of flaws. I never tell them, because it's already over (yes, I've actually effectively  forgotten all concrete details or examples such that I cannot recall any at the moment, only the 'meta' analysis that their argument was flawed), and I don't think they're interested or receptive. It's kinda useless though, even though you can confirm you weren't wrong way after the fact. It's like knowing the answer to a question after the exams.

Should I try to respond faster (even if I can't think quickly), or just continue to 'suck it up' and be bullied rarely, since I avoid conflict most of the time anyway? Sometimes tired.

This OP is a nervous wreck. Everyone is getting offers one by one while I'm just waiting for a phone call or email on DA... The wait is torturous

Hey, you.

I love you.

Here's to a lasting relationship ahead, my partner in committing bad pun crimes. :)
-
 
To a  silent reader here who contacted me a few months back for relationship and sexual advice, thanks for just deleting and blocking me off WhatsApp and Facebook after you've chatted and asked me all the questions on your mind. You're a nice person but the way you act towards me now is nothing short of shit. 

All the best. At least I know we're on different sides now. 
-
 
 You're conflating "incompatible with many" and "not good enough". I'm only interested in people who can keep up.

My life is never smooth. Everything I want, no matter how hard I try, I usually don't get it.

All of the girls I like do not reciprocate my feelings for them. I am 25 years old and never had a girlfriend, not even a close female friend. And sadly, they are not even gracious at all. After the rejection, they deliberately avoided me like the plague. Yea, say all you want about the benefits of being a single and all, but personally, I want to find someone I love and who loves me just as much to spend my life with.

I wanted to study business at university, I worked very hard for my 'A' levels. In fact, I did well for prelims. But unfortunately during my 'A' levels, my father passed away and it deeply affected me. And most unfortunately, the GP questions which came out are totally out of my grasp. I passed my A levels but the only option for me is engineering, but I disliked it. I considered to study business in a private university but they do not allow me the financial benefits a local university would. And since my family is not well-off, I don't have a choice.

I really try to love whatever I am studying. However maths and physics isn't my strong suit and interest, and obviously this is important in engineering. And I wanted to change course, but my CAP must be good in order for the faculty to accept my transfer. But my grades are below average. I feel stuck.

Any internships I apply to, I got rejected. I realized that internship is not really for students to learn, although that's what those companies claim to be doing. That's a myth. In reality, internships are either for companies to look for cheap labour or find potential talents to work them. I am willing to be either if they can offer me the chance at all. But after the interviews, I do not hear from them.

My part time job as a retail staff is tough as well. Whenever I work, my supervisor finds trouble with me. It is not constructive criticism to help me improve myself, but it is outright sarcasm and bullying. And when I asked the other staffs if the supervisor treats them the same way, they disagreed with me and said the supervisor is a very nice person. I really think something is wrong with me.

My relationship with my mother and brother is bad. I am always trying to bring them together for outings or meals to bond our family together. However, they are usually busy or not interested at all. I cannot change them. It really hurts me to see other families spending time with each other but mine doesn't. 

I know there are plenty of opportunities out there. But I am just so unlucky that whatever I want to pursue, it always fail. I have the opposite of the midas touch, everything I touch turns into rust. Maybe I should lower my expectations on others and on myself? Yes I tried. But guess what? When I lower my expectations, the real results are often even below those low expectations. I just can't get anything right even though I try very hard.

I am a physically unattractive short person and I cannot articulate myself very well. And I believe people will judge me for that. Even if I try to dress nicely, my peers sarcastically joke I am going for a date, even though they know I don't have a girlfriend. It's very hurtful and even though I am a guy, I have feelings as well. And I am a human. Although I am not useful to you, and I don't have anything special to offer you, I have dreams and aspirations for a happy life too like the rest of you. Please don't treat me like a lesser being. Please at least give me a chance to try before saying no :(

So...I've known this guy for close to a month now. We don't text everyday though we used to at the start. The first time we met we had a really good chat over lunch and realised we have a lot of common interests and ideals. We even made a pact (sort of) to hang out more after our exams are over. It felt like a really good start.

Owing to my interest in him, obviously I hoped to see him more before that. However, this is where it all kinda goes wrong. I've plucked up the courage and attempted to ask him out...twice, only to be rejected as he would always have something on. He takes forever to reply texts as well. 

I have thought of giving the whole thing up since he's so uninterested. The rational side of me says to bail before I become further invested (a guy who raises so many red flags is so not worth it) while the emotional side of me knows that I still bear feelings for him which makes moving on a little harder than expected. After all, it is hard to meet someone whom you share the same frequency with and could click so well with so much potential. 

And yet, I do wonder what have I ever done to push him away. How is it that such a promising start would beget such a seemingly tragic end? Did I get all the signals wrong? It makes zero sense to me. To persist or to move on - can't seem to decide sigh :(

my neighbour is moving on to her 3rd boyfriend in 3 years. i just saw them walking back to their room. my heart burnt with jealousy as they laughed and chatted so happily. i dont understand why is life so unfair to me. i just want this one person, and yet i cant even make that intention clear to him. while i am waiting so stupidly for this one person, she is having the time of her life with three different guys. i just wish that tomorrow when i wake up, i will somehow be blessed with the thick skin of my neighbour's and i will be able to tell him what i need to say... 
-
 
those people that say that getting out of a friend zone is easy clearly hasn't tried getting out of a friend zone with an ex :( how???
-
 
Guys, if you like a girl, will you be interested in everything she says? Or at least will you care enough to feign interest? Will you be smiling all the time she is talking to you? Will you wait for her to catch up with your long stride? Will you try to figure out smt to say when there are awkward moments of silence? Or you just set aside some time for her think that she knows your heart? This is not a blame, I'm just wondering. 
-
 
I feel like my past is holding me back from having a boyfriend. 
I'm green, but due to how my dad is treating me and my mum, I have an innate fear that any relationship I embark on would end in pain.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with feeling this way? I do have a few close guy friends, but I just can't 'see' them in that way...
I DO want to get attached one day but I honestly can't see myself letting anyone in :(
-
 
After a date with my crush today, I felt that there are so many smarter things that I could have said. And I was slightly nervous around him that it was a bit awkward. Would this be a turn-off for guys if they find that the girl they like cannot keep up with their conversation?:/
-
 
how do you know for sure that a guy has zero interest in you? there is this guy who used to be interested in me but as i was going through a really difficult time, i didnt treat him very well (not that i abuse him or anything of course) and now i think he has moved on? help anyone?
-
 
These few days I have been wondering, what is a life? Is having a SO a life? I am attached. But recently we quarrelled. The reason was, he wants his life back. I was thinking, the fact that we are together, building a relationship together, isn't this a life? It seems like, I do not have a 'life' outside my r/s with him? Well I go to school, friends in school, outside school, maybe sometimes people would ask me out, but I would reject cause I was having a 'life' with my SO. He said, 'get a life', I want my life back. I know the concept on giving space even you are in a relationship. But what is, a 'life'? Please enlighten me guys? 
-
 
What should I do if I dislike my boyfriend's sister? Should I tell him? Part of me died whenever I had to "talk" to her. I guess a relationship does not revolve around the two of us, sadly both of our families are involved. :( Sigh..
-
 
I'm quite interested in a guy but recently he sent me a yellow heartshape and even explained that yellow symbolises friendship... But he also started calling me babe. I'm so confused right now? Did I get friend zoned or not
-
 
This goes out to all those who feel like they like someone and don't know whether or not to tell them. I read so many NUSWhisperers saying that they are scared they'll get rejected and such like... I'm just gonna say that you might as well do it. There's no harm done if the other party knows because even if they don't actually like you back, you guys really don't have to make it awkward y'know. There's really nothing to lose. In my case, I liked someone who's an introvert. I really didn't know whether the feelings were mutual but I just said it and he told me he's really thankful I said it. You may say this is a one off case but seriously, the time in Uni is short and if you really like them just go say hi, it doesn't kill you to say hi. You never know what may happen :)
-
 
Now that there is only 3 weeks left to my entire school life, sometime I wished that I have fought harder for you. I still remember knowing you since Year 1. We got closer, but somehow you chose to distance yourself from me, knowing that I liked you. We distanced, got close again somehow, and then distanced again when you left for Exchange. Now that I am going to graduate, I just regret that I did not fight enough for you. Sometimes I just wish that things would return to how they were in the past. Instead of the awkward silence whenever I see you. 

Certain things were just not meant to be, but you will always occupy an important part of my heart.
-
 
Does it mean anything when I feel happier being with my FB than with someone whom I have been going out with for a while? 

Don't get me wrong, I genuinely like the latter, and I don't really give two hoots about the former. But it just feels so good to be with someone even when I know that both of us are only in it for the sex. He actually treats me a lot better than the potential guy, just so you know. 
-
 
when i was younger, i used to laugh at people who do silly stuff to hurt themselves (slit their wrist, overdose on sleeping pills or worse) for unrequited love. i reckon this will never happen to me ever, because i am smarter than them.
yet now i feel so fucking helpless when my feelings towards this bastard is just left hanging, neither rejected directly nor reciprocated. I am dead certain that i did not misread the signs of attraction. but it just stops there. i don't understand why. why do nice guys just fall miraculously on my friends, and i have to struggle so hard and still not get what i want? and furthermore he used to play mind games with me, making me jealous on purpose, what kind of reaction is he trying to get? he so twisted in the mind and i am so trapped. i wanted to end this shit so i kind of confessed and he didn't even give me a fucking response. I wish he would directly reject me and stop encouraging my advances, because it is really hurting me. many nights i cry myself to sleep because i feel so dumb for liking someone that is really not worth it.  other nights i immerse in my memories with him. this emotional instability is taking a toll on my life. my schoolwork is lacking behind and my friendships are breaking apart because of my mood swings. right now i really feel like throwing myself off the building and see if this can induce any sort of remorse in him.

After knowing your female friend for almost four years by now, you finally get to know her better and understand that she is actually an extreme 贱人 in nature
-
 
To  
I feel that you should go ahead and pursue her :) what is past is past, so don't bring it into your present & possibly future w her.
From the way how you don't wish to repeat the "happenings" with her, you obviously care about her.
Perhaps the reason why she had shown less interest is becos she may feel that you're not serious about her, or even seeing her as a fling like the wild girls in the past (if you had told her about them). So be more obvious about what you want with her, more clear that you're interested in her. 
And if she doesn't like you, it will show (extreme slow replies or ignore msges, reject going out, try to avoid you etc). 
If she likes you, it also will show (willing to go out, reply your msges quickly, cares about you etc). 
If she doesn't like you, at least you tried your best to chase her anyway :) 
If she likes you, all the best!

6 months into NUS and I am very disappointed here. Honestly what I was promised differs so much from reality. For example, I have already spent half a year here in NUS but I have yet to have a chance to sit on a grass patch with my multicultural group of friends, each holding a laptop/notebook/sketchbook and smiling at one another. I came to NUS exactly for such experience, guess life is full of disappointment.

OP  , are we talking about each other? 

I really really like him. Especially recently, he's been annoying me quite a bit. At the end of the day, however, I still really really like him. 

"I guess all I can do now is to cherish whatever time is left of the days when I could still see her everyday." 
Like you, I can only cherish whatever time there is left when I can see him everyday, as our exchange is coming to an end. Tell me, are you on exchange with me in the US, are we talking about each other? 

If we're not, I still hope that OP will find a happy resolution. Maybe she really really likes you too? 
-
 
Is it possible for text someone all day, every day, and not fall in love? Has any platonic friends managed so?
-
 
when a guy tried to chase you but you aren't sure of your feelings (whether u r interested or not), is it fair for the guy to continue to chase you or ask the guy to give up (for wasting his time, if in the end, you end up not liking the guy). I'm lost AF.

Will girls date a broken guy? Broken as in a guy who has low self esteem after many failed relationships.
-
 
I really really like her. Sometimes I get so emotionally affected by her, I don't even know what to do with myself. But all i did was to make her annoyed and angry. I did nothing for her. I used to get jealous over the smallest things but these days I just felt I was being so silly. I really shouldn't expect anything when I don't even deserve it. I guess all I can do now is to cherish whatever time is left of the days when I could still see her everyday.

Do any of you CS guys notice, when you ask another CS guy whether he is going to do FYP, such question is also implicitly asking whether or not his CAP is more than 4.5 =.=
-
 
I am OP of . Thanks for all the encouragements! Regarding whether if she express interest in being friends, how do I tell? The only observation I can describe is she seems aloof towards me when we are in group but normal when she is with me alone. She doesn't initiate conversation with me while in group but does so with others. She did talk to me when not in group though. And I haven't texted her for days now.

Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice.

A freshie in FASS intending to major in Global Studies, I chose this path against the wishes of my parents, whom wanted me to major in something more "prestigious"
like Business or Accounting instead. I was never really the artsy type but Global Studies seemed like an upcoming major that would be increasingly relevant, so I thought i should try challenging myself to do something that I wasn't that great in. (And tbh, maybe this is a stereotype, but I didn't exactly want to stay in the lab, or do repetitive and continuous business presentations throughout my 4 years in uni.) 

I guess the problem now is that I am feeling some doubt over my future. People around me kept asking me why I chose to study arts when my score was good enough to bring me to what they think are "better faculties", and my extended family just keep going on and on about how an arts degree is worthless. My grades just make me feel even more depressed and worthless, and I find myself sighing and questioning myself what is life (lol), feeling unmotivated most of the time. 

In short, I am just confused and don't know how I should go about life now. Sorry if my train of thought is random or confusing; I can't really express my emotions well in words and I'm just feeling sian now while looking for a place to write all this down.

Any advice please? )):

@ In my experience, it's code for "I want people to think I am not shallow. Actual depth might varies". It does not really matter in the inital stage of dating.

Also in my experience, actually discuss those stuff are not gonna help building a rapport. Ok, let me explain: once you are very familiar with each other, like being in a relationship, seeing each other day in day out, blah blah, those topics are a nice change of pace. You can pass hours, and hours doing it. Occasionally you will fight (and hopefully make-up sex, some of the most awesome sex out there). But in the initial stage, talk about yourself, for herself. Personal stuff. It builds rapport.

And there's deep rapport. It's after you two are already past the getting to know part, quite comfortable with one another, find each others' company enjoyable and fun, etc .... This is when you break out and start on the kinds of things that happened in your past that kinda make you into the person today. Like past relationships, parents, familiy, etc ... Future aspirations, personal philosophies on love, deepest fear and insecurity, etc ... This is in the relationship territory. If you tend to talk like this, it has a relationship vibe to it. If you keep everything light and fun, it might be just a causal thing, a hookup of sorts, but once you dwell into these things, it's kinda an exclusive, love, relationship thing. It can be a bit confusing.

Whoops, I wrote a bit too much. Well, I've meant to write a small guide to dating. Too lazy to actually start writing, despite already drafting out in my head. I'll settle for shorter writings.
-
 
Recently I got together with a guy I like. The thing is, it's getting quite monotonous and it feels one sided on my end. 

Is this because he has gone back to his 'usual', non chasing state but is still interested in me? Or is did he lose interest in me in such a short period of time? 

So confused and hurt.
-
 
I don't know what I am doing with my life. At 24 years old I am so emotionally stunted that I have never had a SO nor had sex before. The closest thing to intimacy was just a kiss with a guy.

...and I am a guy. A straight guy.
-
 
Seriously what is it with people trying to steal other people's HT topics? Do you really think that others don't know what you're trying to do? 
-
 
I got out of my shyness and have the courage to speak to the girl I am interested in. Even though it feels like there's a great chance, I had to give up on her just because she's too strong headed (or probably protecting herself?). I am totally clueless how to even proceed on. Maybe leaving her alone is the best choice.

 I feel you man. 

I picked up a sport in JC and played for almost 6 years before injury derailed everything. Well, I was only ever an amateur at my sport at my peak, but I had dreams and I had passion too. One year ago I tore my left ACL - complete tear too. Had it reconstructed and went through physiotherapy religiously. Plenty of "suggestion" from my parents that I give up this sport for good. But 7 months later I was overly optimistic, I was impatient, and I went to play a match. Guess what, I partially tore the graft and a bit of meniscus too. So I decided to lay off for a while longer. So this year I thought, perhaps I can start again slowly, and so I did. Going back to light trainings once a week, and everything was going well for a few weeks. But life sucks and shit happens. Three weeks ago I tore my right ACL at a training. While I was slightly mentally prepared that I could possibly tear the left again, this was completely unexpected and I am beyond devastated. And I still had to contend with I-told-you-so's from my parents, which I have to quietly suck up because they're footing my bills.

What's my point here? I don't really know. I can't offer anything actually useful. I too know that sympathy and well wishes don't heal ACLs. I won't pretend that everything's going to be fine - it's not. Having something that has been a major part of your life suddenly taken away hurts like hell. In my quiet moments the rage and the feeling of helplessness consumes me. I guess if you were or are still passionate about your sport, you could still play it recreationally or maybe even coach; I reckon you still have at least 1.5 good ACLs. Me, I'm out for good. With or without surgery for the right ACL, the risk is way too high for me to ever play again at any level. 

I could've made it big. I also could've remained mediocre. But now I will never know.

I know guys like to hang out with girls who use makeup and find them pretty. Sometimes I feel like I can't compete with other girls if I don't put makeup. But just a question for the guys, won't it be weird if one day you see the regular pretty girl bare faced? What are the thoughts that go through your mind and what are your honest opinions  of those who don't use makeup (during normal times too) at all

Hi everyone. I'm evegreen and I'm toying with the idea of setting up a Tinder account. No, I'm not desperate, but things have to start somewhere, right? However, I still have some reservations. I'm inexperienced, afraid of meeting those with bad intentions, and well. Any advice for a naive noob like me? I'm a girl.

Hi guys, I am just wondering if any girls had successfully gotten out of the friendzone? I read that most guys would consider dating their female friends and they are either attracted to you or not. I am torn between just walking away and waiting (foolish of me I know). How often do the miracle of "guy realizes girl is there all along and falls in love" kind of thing happen in real life anyway?
Feeling kinda sad now, would appreciate if no trolls :'(

You know what really hurts? Being around you, pretending that I don't have any feelings for you. Being there for you whenever you needed me. You fell sick? Here's some herbal tea and lozenges and tons of "are you feeling better?" messages. Nervous for an interview? Here's some comforting words and lots of encouragement. Issues at home? Here's my listening ear. Problems with your FYP? Here's my advice and help. Cute girl you met at a module? Here's my insights on the female.  You quarrelled with your best friend? Here's me trying to patch things up for you guys. Often I wonder if life is treating you well. But I bet you never wondered if I am well. I can only blame myself for being so foolishly in love with you. Someone who will never love me back.

Hello . Thanks for your suggestions on why I probably am still single. These are indeed possible reasons for why someone can still be single. They don't all apply to me completely, but I know that you're simply suggesting various reasons in general, so I don't have to explain myself.

I'm sorry to hear about your experience with the ladies at your previous workplace. I have also been with good-looking friends who get a lot of attention. You sound a bit bitter about it so I hope you won't hold this unhappiness as you go about your life.

The main point I want to bring up regarding your comment is that there might be more reasons why someone is single. (I'm not talking about myself, but in general. Some may apply to me.)
1, Social circle. A lot of my very nice single friends who are nice to people around them, just have no one they are interested in their social circle, and no one made a move on them. 
2, Expectations too high. You talked about expectations of looks. There can be other expectations that become barriers, e.g. personality, values, hobbies, beliefs. 
3, Lack of interest in relationships/marriage when younger. 
4, Conservative upbringing, which makes one feel like going on dates is a huge thing so the person tends to not be very open to dating.
5, Low self-confidence/no confidence of being able to get married. Lack of confidence makes you restrict your own socialising, and you don't dare take action when you like someone. Also, someone lacking in confidence is less attractive, from a psychological point of view. I think.
6, Personality when younger. I was from a girls' school and a lot of girls were quite non-feminine and sporty and rough, which was cool then. All single then. Hard to attract guys if the girls are too boyish. Some are still boyish and attached, some became attached after becoming a bit more ladylike. Maybe this is a reason too.
7. Luck. Sometimes you like a person but the person doesn't like you back. 

I have a small problem with you mentioning the overweight part. You kind of implied that someone overweight is unattractive and unpleasant (correct me if I'm wrong). I think attractiveness is a holistic thing - personality, looks, character also factor in attraction. I have found an overweight person attractive before because of his awesome personality and cute face haha. If someone's weight factors solely in determining the chances of being attached, then this is pretty shallow (just like your female coworkers) right?

All the best to everyone out there looking for a companion.

To , thanks for that well worded reply. I would just like to point out that I was speaking in generalities. I do have close and wonderful platonic Singaporean female friends, whom I treasure and respect. 

However, broadly speaking, I personally feel that a sizeable number of Singaporean girls (esp those in local universities) are close minded and insensitive to the needs of others. I have many examples to write about. Not just my own but my friends. I shall just talk about one, my own personal experience. I had a female friend whom I was interested in, and we were talking almost every other night. Once, she asked me for help with her job applications - I was lucky, I managed to snag a job even before graduation. I decided to help her out and went out of my way to do so. Before you call me out on pretending to be a nice guy, let me caveat my response by saying 1. I don't think nor will I ever claim I am a nice guy, 2. As long as you ask nicely, and it's within my means, I would be willing to help, doesn't matter girl or guy... So I helped her out with her applications, and even went through some interviewing tips etc. 

Not so long after, I asked her out for a friendly cup of coffee. Instead of being mature about it, she did this "Oh, you're too good! You're too wonderful for me" with tons of smiley emoticons. It was so contrived and fake, and I believe many guys here know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. I shrugged it off and said "Ok, no worries, have a good day!". I thought that she was cool with my answer because she behaved normally for a bit after my reply. I didn't contact her till a while later just to wish her well on her birthday. But nope, not a single reply from her, she just went all ghost on me from that point on. 

And when you contrast that with say foreign girls, it's very very different. There are a few points I like to address here. I believe that you attempted to put up a dichotomy of sorts to somehow argue that Singaporean girls are more educated and so should be entitled more (?). I don't wish to address the second bit, you can feel free to believe that if you want :) . But even when controlling for education (meaning the foreign girl is equally educated, maybe even from NUS), foreign girls are typically more grateful and willing to give local guys a chance. Let me give one example. My friend is dating this girl from a developing country. He was sending her home in his car and in his car, there were some used tissues stuck in some of the chair rest. Without saying a word, she took them out one by one and threw them away. She said that's the least she should do as a passenger. It might not mean much in terms of dollars and cents but it goes to show what kind of character she has. Grateful, appreciative, simple minded even. Are those the traits you think are somehow secondary to "educated and pragmatic"? 

Btw, you would be right to say that it is completely within the rights of the Singaporean girl -as above- to treat me how she has, and I have absolutely no ownership on her actions. Yup, I agree with that. When the ball is in my court, it's also within my right to reject girls like that, right?  

Anyhow, this isn't meant to be about me. As I have said to my fellow Singaporean guys, go out and try dating other girls from other countries and do a cross comparison for yourself. Just be careful of posting it publicly on NUS whispers.. because hint hint, it's social suicide :)

Peace.

This is a shout out to all the evergreen guys in NUS. I used to think it was me, and that maybe if I had a better personality, I would have been able to get a Singaporean girl as my gf. While I have gone on dates with some, it didn't lead to anywhere. I had more rejections than dates to be fair. However, after going on exchange, I realized that I was misled into thinking that being "unwanted" in Singapore means you're unwanted globally. Throughout my time in exchange, I was able to date girls from many nationalities, korean, taiwan etc. When I came back, it was back to the same old, same old. 

One thing I realized is that a good number of foreign girls are actually very open to date local men. They might even come from developing countries like Vietnam and Indon but that shouldn't be an issue if you truly like her. In my personal view, I hope I don't get flamed for this but.. I think that Singaporean girls tend to be pretty close minded. Unlike girls from many of the places I have travelled to, they would rarely if ever give chances to MOST guys for first dates. To them, it's akin to asking them to marry you, the whole "wanting to know you better" line doesn't fly here. It's how buff you are, how good looking you are, how much social clout you have. Don't believe all the tinder stories on dating.. They tend to be the exception rather than the rule. I thought I was having it bad.. but a lot of my single guy friends have confided in me that they were shot down pretty badly. And a lot of the time, it ends with the girl becoming a complete stranger, as though asking her out is some sin that you have committed.

To put a long story short, Singaporean guys who are still single, open your eyes, and be willing to date girls from other nationalities. You might really be surprised.

I would like to add on to  

Im a singaporean guy and most people regard me as nice and all, ive had alot of trouble dating singaporean girls in the past largely due to the kind of expectations they have. I feel that many singaporean girls have spolit expectations, but it really isnt their fault. Guys in general have spolit them for all of us. 

Maybe because of social media proliferation and stories of tinder and perhaps even feminism, singaporean girls expect certain traits of an ideal guy, eg, someone who plans big birthdays and anniversaries, perfect buff bodies, perceived as cool amongst our peers, spend alot on her etc, which they have gotten before! Because it is relatively easy to fake these things in the short term, especially during the courting phase. Which is why girls want to "chase" to never end, or say that their boyfriends "changed" once they gotten together, and start to be drawn to new guys who seem to be more their ideal again(new guys courting mode). These guys havent changed, they just became themselves again.

I never gotten around to pretend or meet these expectations, i chose to be myself when i date, it was not enough. I often ended up friendzoned or end up in a situation where the girl loses interest after awhile. I always thought it was me, something wrong with me, so i started being the "ideal guy", i drove my parents car to pick her up, spent hundreds on her birthday presents, did "cool stuff" like joining parties and basically did things i normally didnt do, i was a douche. It worked, it was easier to connect with girls with my new "status", i dated afew for awhile but i realised it was an unsustainable lifestyle, not so much about the cost but i hated not being myself. So i went back to doing so.

Everything changed when i went on exchange, it seems Singaporean guys are incredibly popular and demanded amongst foreign girls. They often say we are not Male Chauvinists, we are more considerate and more mature than the equivalent foreign guy counterparts. They also like the fact we undergone NS and work alot harder to "chase" girls too. I personally found it disturbing how other foreign guys treat women, if girls ever thought singaporean guys were oppressive, they should visit other countries, even the first world ones like japan, korea. It opened my mind to many things, i also realised these girls were very realistic and not living in a constant princess-like fantasy. They wanted to find a guy with an honest character, who was hard-working and shared certain interests. So was i.

Fast forward, I met my girlfriend there and we've been dating a couple of years now, shes applying for her EP here now and we hope to get married within 2-3 years.

I dont know if im right or completely wrong, but this has been my genuine experience. I dont think singaporean girls did anything wrong, i think that due to many factors, their expectations in general has risen alot quicker than guys can keep up with. But everyone has the right to set their own expectations.

My advice to fellow guys facing similar situations, keep your eyes open, there are many amazing girls around us even in NUS, those studying here from ASEAN, those here on exchange, and they too are looking for someone realistic and honest.

From your behaviour yesterday, I have come to realize that you were never fond of me. Your actions though subtle implied that you found it bothersome to help me even when I needed it.

When I think about it, I realize that it may have been my fault. I must have underestimated the amount of energy required for you to bring an extra sheet of 70gsm paper to the department office, maybe carrying an extra piece of paper consumes a bigger fraction of your daily energy consumption than it does mine. Look, I'm not asking you to walk an extra mile, I'm simply asking you to hand my assignment in as you hand in yours. Such a simple request and yet you had to show your reluctance to help me.

It makes me wonder if you really do consider me as a friend. Maybe I didn't get the hint... I was never your friend, was I? Well, you can rest assured that I will NEVER ask for your help again in the future unless circumstance dictates otherwise. Even then, you will always be my final resort, the lesser of many evils.

Take this confession as the end of our friendship. I don't need you and I hope I will never have to be closely associated with you anymore. We may still see each other during classes almost every single day of the week, sit together and talk, but I will never help you against my own convenience as I have done before. 

My only regret is that I didn't see this coming earlier.

I've been reading some confessions on 'racial preferences' when it comes to dating and I thought I'd share my opinion. I'm Chinese, an ex-NUS student and gay. I work in the military as a uniformed personnel and for the most part, at work, I'm closeted. I've to be for obvious reasons. For the last five years, I've been with a Malay boy. We live together now and like me, he works in public service. I met him on Grindr - an app gay guys use to meet other gay guys - and for the first week, we kept our conversation to within the app. When we finally met for a date, halfway through it, he asked, "You don't mind that I'm Malay?" I said no. I genuinely found him attractive. And he was smart and driven, and he spoke about his work with lower-income groups with great conviction and passion. I found that charming.

When it comes to my dating life, I happen to have physical preferences. I like lean fit boys. I like big eyes and sharp jaws. I like someone who's sporty and tall. Race, for me, was a non-issue although I must admit that I've been with more Chinese boys than Malay ones. He was the third Malay guy I've gone on a date with but the first I saw a future and a life with. For me, it's simple. As long as you fit my physical preferences and I think of you to be someone worth pursuing, I will make the chase and not beat around the bush with regards to my intentions. If I want to fuck someone, I will say so. If I want to be in a relationship with a guy, I will go to great lengths to woo him.

Over the years in our relationship, we've had some difficult conversations. One of these happened to revolve around the insecurity he had built over the years being Malay and gay. One night, while we were watching Bridget Jones after dinner at my place, he confessed something to me. He told me of his experience growing up Malay and gay. He said that he had this deep attraction for Chinese boys and for a long time, he wouldn't date anyone else but a Chinese. 

At the time, when I messaged him, he had only started seeing other non-Chinese boys and he thought I was a troll. That night at my place, I asked him, "Why? Why this preference?" He related to me the environment he grew up in. In school, he had more Chinese friends than Malay or Indian ones; naturally, over the years, his school crushes were always Chinese boys. He watched a lot of Taiwanese dramas - Meteor Garden happens to be his favourite (ewww) - and he had built this idea in his head that he would find a Chinese boy to settle with for the long-term. He grew up not liking what he saw in the mirror - his tanned skin which I happen to find really, really beautiful - and he felt it to be a limiting factor when it came to dating. He's dealt with a lot of rejection from Chinese guys who preferred other Chinese guys (and he realises as well that he had built an internal racism to his own and that he's been a jerk to other non-Chinese gay guys). For the most part, he dealt with those rejections well, but he quickens to add that at times, he felt his sense of worth and confidence ruined. 

When I talk to some of my Malay and Indian gay friends, they often say the same thing. I noticed they've 'yellow fever' as well. It's a real phenomena especially within the gay circle and it can have damaging effects on someone's psyche. I know it did on my partner. I had to remind him, especially during the first year, that I loved him for all that he was and will be. 

During NUS, I visited San Francisco to visit a friend over the term break. He's an American-born Chinese. I got to know him when he visited Singapore for a holiday. When I told him the issues my boyfriend faced, he said the same thing about himself except now, instead of 'yellow fever', he had a 'white fever'. As a teenager, he grew up attracted to White guys. He preferred dating White over a non-White (he refused to even date a Chinese guy). He told me about the profiles he saw on Grindr and Jackd that said, "No Asians. No Chinks. No blacks. No Indians." It did affect his confidence level when he was a teenager struggling to manoeuvre around the gay scene, but he's grown out of it. He doesn't feel affected anymore by those profiles because he knows exactly his worth. Last I saw on Facebook, he's with a Latino guy now and he seems happy. 

As for my partner, yes, he eventually found a cute Chinese boy - me! - to settle down with but this was unplanned for both of us. I didn't date him because he was Malay. I am with because I saw a future with him. I had a list of attributes that I wanted in a life partner. He doesn't satisfy all of it, but he's perfect for me. Great to have expectations, but expectations can sometimes limit possibilities and love can happen in the least likely scenario.

Personally, I think it's fine to have racial preferences when it comes to your life partner. It's a very individual thing. Cultural similarities do attract. And you should never dictate someone's choices when it comes to a life partner. What's not fine and racist is when your racial preferences are based solely on racial stereotypes you've of that person. If you like someone who's fair skinned, you'll also find attractive a fair-skinned Malay, Indian or Latino or whatever.

I've always believed in what Ellen Degeneres says. We've a short time in this world. Let's just be kind to one another. See from different perspectives; put yourself in different shoes; if you've done that i.e. really put effort into challenging your value system, and you still hold onto it, that's fine but do show empathy for someone who doesn't share your view. If you can't do that, then I guess... my advice for you would be to write a blog and remember to turn off the comment feature.

I have been on three dating apps over the past few months and even though I am still remains as an evergreen guy, I really learn a lot about online dating and will like to share it over here. Online dating is really not suitable for everyone unless you are really a guy who can catch the attention of a girl among the hundreds or thousands of guys that are vying for her attention. Secondly, most girls really don't look at looks (though they look more on your height and physique), they look mostly at a guy's personality and whether he can start and maintain a good and interesting conversation. If you ever find yourself stuck, it means both of you don't match. However, that does not mean your profile picture is not important. It tells a lot about your personality. Lastly, when you are on these sites, you have to accept the fact that the probability of finding your significant other over these sites are still very low (can go google on the statistics, btw there are a lot more guys than girls on these sites). Girls still prefer the traditional way of finding their significant others as it may not be very safe meeting someone online and it is hard to tell someone's true colour online. Having said that, guys, please dont feel so let down. Online dating is really more than just dating, you learn a lot more about yourself (and improve on yourself) and the opposite gender and I am still in the process of learning.

Wondering about this for many years already...
Do people actually get aroused when they see attractive people in normal situations? I hear people talking about "sexy"/"hot" but I never experienced such a feeling.

To  That is because the meaning in the term GG has evolved over the years in the era of online gaming... It was normally used as compliment or show appreciation at the end of games; but because it started to get so popularized, it started to also signify the end of a game - more often implying or predicting a coming lost rather than a win. So, when people describes something as GG, it describes a seemingly futuristic "end"/"lost case". This is the age of the internet we live in! :)

Ever had someone who was obviously into you, started all the conversations, kept it going everyday and you replied too but only saw the person as a friend? And over time the person realised yeah this was only going to be friendship. But now the messages are about how's she seeing person x, person y. And the things she mentioned was good about you last time now she makes it sound negative. What are such ppl trying to do?

I just woke up from a nightmare. You were in it. 

It:
I was in one of the labs, doing my work, when it happens, that you, and some unnamed boyfriend entered the lab. I overheard your converstation, and your boyfriend left you to do your work. 

In a moment of foolishness, a moment of courage, I mustered all I could, and took the initiative to talk to you. "Hey, it's been a while." You replied, with a simple, "Hey," and went back to doing your work. 

"How have you been?" 

And the conversation went on with a short series of short replies. "Look, I see that you're busy, just wanted to apologise..."

And we started quarreling. I let everything out. 

I am very sorry, that initially, I pushed you to someone whom I thought, would be able to provide a better future, than if you're with me. I threw attitude problems, etc., and ended up, by alienating myself, you ended up with the person, who still broke up with you.

I am very sorry, that after that, I took the convenient excuse, to chase my grades that weren't there. I worked hard, but I never held anything in my hands. 

I AM SO SORRY, that while you were undergoing difficult times, I was never there for you, chasing something that was never there, when I could have been beside you, even as a friend.

I am sorry, yet again, that I simply cannot face you anymore. I cannot try to fake a smile if I ever talk to you again. I actively ignored you, even if you tried to say hi. I am so sorry. 

If anything, someone snatched my phone the other day, and messaged you, to apologise on my behalf, to clear a bit of load off me, at least, I think.

I again, took the convenient exit; I feel all these, but you do not know that. You don't see me around anymore, and very much less talk to me. You're living a better life already, I hope. I apologise for this, but you won't know.

I wish, that this nightmare was real, because if it was, I would be a lot happier, because at least, I am with you, little birder.

From,
A person who summitted a mountain, but never could get over people.

I've been noticing this very pretty Korean exchange girl in my lectures. Her attractiveness is seriously on another level and she's easily the hottest girl in the whole LT. I just wished I could somehow get to know her but there's probably no possibility of getting together anyway .... :(
-
 
To  If you aren't afraid to show your interest in her, then just talk to her about anything. If she feels the same way as you, she'll try to not let the conversation turn awkward! Then see if she ever initiates a conversation. If she does, there might be a chance that she feels the same way as you do! (:

I cried when we broke up. 7 years later I cried when I receive a wedding invitation to her wedding. It was not because I was still not over her, but because I realize something even more grieving.

Out of curiosity when I got the invite, I google search the groom’s name (no idea why I google instead of facebook at that point) and I came across a blog. It was my ex’s blog. I backtrack her posts and realize that 5 years after we broke up she was still not over me. I took about the same time to try to get over her too. There were times when I wanted to contact her again but I was just could not lower my pride to do so because after all she initiated the broke up.

In your exact words: I will tell you I love you again if you want me to. We could have had it all. Don’t think you will ever read this but I wish you a happy marriage.

Enrolling into NUS soon (i took a gap year)

Am a really introverted girl who is considering joining the orientation camps.
But I really hate the hazing process, the games where everyone just throws their face together and supposedly bond. My older female cousin even told me of how some guys tried to take advantage of her. How is the girl to guy ratio? I am entering FASS

Can everyone (or anyone reading this), can to share your best and worst experiences in the camps?
Also, is it like any orientation camps? Or are there any special traditions? 
Will there be another orientation camp once we enter halls too?

Please share! Either by a confession reply or comment. Thanks!

I saw so many posts of "oh he's so fat and nerdy yet got a gf while the buff, gymn everyday me got nothing" complaints. It's simple guys: that guy is doing something right, and you don't. Whatever you are doing right now don't work. So suck it up.

But fret not. I'll show you what you are doing wrong, and how to fix it. I'll try to write a dating guide for young men in the next few days or so. Based completely on my own life. Sorry can't do jack for girls. My advice for them? Somewhere out there, there's a straight guy who will fuck you.

My credentials, I'm not a Pick Up Artist type, first off. I found their life styles and goal pathetic and creepy, though they have skills, and I respect them for that; in the same way that the Desert Fox respected the Desert Rats while trying to kill them. But let's say ever since I graduated, in Aug 2011, I only spent 5 months being single. No V-day alone since then. I'm getting married some time at the end of this year. So I guess I'm doing sth right. I had discussions and chats with my fiancee on what she, and girls in general find guys attractive; and I'll throw in some extras. I'm in no way physically attractive. I'm not particularly handsome, I don't go to the gym, I don't diet, and I get fat easily. Nor I am that rich. Comfortable living, yes; but partially because I'm a cheapskate and I save a lot.

But let me tell you that I won't be so good at telling you how to FIND and ATTRACT a girl initially. Why? I forgot how I did it. I spent way more time being with someone than chasing someone, so I can definitely tell you more on the keeping part than the chasing part. Trust me when I say that keeping is harder than finding.

And guess what, it's free. It pains me to see good young boys (yes, that who you undergrads look like to me) getting their knickers in a twist over getting their dick wet. This kind of advice typically cost you money, ok. Enough to get you comatose by sex with hookers for weeks.

 It is just that you exist outside their framework of how people should generally behave. Naturally,it makes them uncomfortable to be associated with you at the moment. 

Give them some (a lot,actually) time to warm up, and realise that, you're not as bad as they perceived you to be. 

Take it from a guy who does a lot of quirky stuff.

He is from one of the blk at PGP, and has been toying around with my feelings. Telling me he love me. Then, being cold to me. Please, if we already settled what we have talked about, then just keep to yours promises. Stop flipping your words and said you have no time for me and yourself. When you can go cycling at Corney island and watch friends play badminton. Please just stop disturbing me. Thanks. If he continues to be like that, I think I will get depression.

It's pretty hurtful when you ask someone u trusted to help you with something, and the next thing you realized they've blocked you. If you didn't want to do it, you could have just said it instead of being all passive aggressive. I'm glad to have seen your true colors and yep, although it's hurtful, I think I can live without a fake friend like you. Can't believe I never saw through that fake facade of yours for years

OP of  here. 

Turns out both of us were really busy despite our efforts to schedule a date. But we kept chatting everyday and she asked me out for brunch (such a cool girl to ask a guy right?)

The thing is she intends to bring her dog along. So quick question, what are the restaurant/cafe policies regarding pets? Any pet friendly restaurant and cafes to recommend? Any points to take note regarding dogs? I don't really interact with dogs. The last time I interacted with a dog I was really stiff @.@

Just some random question:
1. Do any of you feel that JC days were the best? Back then, we all share our notes and teach one another. Over here, some people are really selfish with knowledge. And then these people are shameless to 'consult' us when they are in doubt seriously.. For example, how to calculate probability in ST2131 and then this person be like.."can calculate.. in the notes..*quickly turn away and find other topics so that he/she can move away from answering you*" Then, when you ask the lecturer something.. this person be like "what did you ask the lecturer? Oh.. so what is the answer? Oh.. Why? can you explain?" After explaining... this person continues.."Oh.. is this all the lecturer said? "  ya.... " you sure?" 

2. What are the characteristics of a toxic friend? How to 'break up' with the toxic person? Do toxic people have genuine friends? 

3. Do you have a friend who always creates opportunity for herself/himself to get closer to the guy/girl they MAY BE interested in? But when other people try to ship them together, he/she will always deny and and apparently "hate being teased by these people" ? Then after the teasing, this friend will mention about this "teasing" thing again and again and it's obvious he/she enjoyed being teased. I'm in year 2 now and this person haven't settled down with any of the potential mate/victim? And this friend don't feel tired after 2 years but i'm tired of hearing man...

If your girlfriend is talking to this guy until very late at night almost everyday, and when you ask her who is she talking to she say it's her friends. If her conscience is clear and there's nothing to hide why can't she be honest with you and say she's talking to the guy? You are okay and you are not stopping her from talking to her friends as you believe everyone has the right to. If it's the case where your girlfriend is afraid that you may be misunderstood if she tell you, isn't this worse since she knows you will misunderstand but she still continue to talk with the guy? Are you right to think this way or are you overthinking and being overly sensitive?

Hi, I am someone who regularly unfriend people on Facebook, insta and other social media etc. 

I unfriend people because they are probably people who i don't really know, only met ONCE through camps (tricky~) or other events. (might have advantage in networking, up to your discretion)

& i don't see any harm in doing it. Because firstly, i feel weird looking at feeds of people who i only saw once.
Secondly, i will feel weird FOR the people who i only met once. looking at MY feeds (through just timeline, not because stalking). 
Thirdly, you wonder if people who you don't really know are just kaypohs.

Now i learnt my lesson, never give my social media accounts that easily for such situation that i have to unfriend them for privacy sake.

& For those who get unfriended... Don't think too much. I do get unfriended too. But really, you only need to focus on people who mean to you. (which you don't even need the use of social media to interact anyway) Take those who unfriended you as people who you don't need in your life.

Xx

Recently I found out that the number of friends on my Facebook has decreased. With my "analytical skills".. somehow I know who are the ones that have "unfriended" me on FB. Maybe because I do not have a large number of friends on FB hence it is kinda easy for me to find out which friends "disappear" from my friends list. 

It is kinda sad to find out... I wonder why do they randomly just unfriended me? I am not someone who post nasty/rants/disgusting posts etc. I am those who don't usually post much stuff on FB. I can still find their account on FB hence, it means they have unfriended me (Not their account being deactivated). Anyway, I am just puzzled by their actions. Like we were classmates/coursemates etc.. there wasn't any arguments or conflicts between us... but just suddenly they aren't my friend on FB?

At first, I thought could it be that they accidentally clicked the "unfriend" button? But couldn't be right? Or maybe it is possible? haha. Anyway, this matter did not bother me much already...Just felt puzzled and *why??* (I'm not those social media addict. I just felt that when a person "unfriended" you on FB, It felt like they did not want to have any personal contact with you again in future.. which kinda makes me feel upset? I mean probably not gonna be any chance to keep in touch again. *Or maybe I'm being too sensitive..*)

Does anyone encounter such situation too?

 You've said something I've been saying and want to say now. Effective communication. Maybe you know who I am in real life. Maybe. After all, what's in front of me is only a screen.

Here's how I think the text kills:
1) Face-to-face interaction (FTF): There's a face attached to the conversation.
Text: In the worst case scenarios, there isn't, but in some, there is.
Note: You want to know who you're talking to and not have to guess although you may get it 9/10 times right. Unless you are wanting to talk to a random stranger. Things don't get pretty even if that's 1/10 time when you don't be skeptical and commit to the person's identity together with what he or she has said.

2) FTF: There's speech, and with that comes tone
Text: There's no speech, no tone, but only words.
Note: Tone plays a very important part in conversations. Someone with the same words can have a straight face, be smiling, or be angry. Tone helps us understand the other party's mood, and hence, their attitude towards us. Their attitude towards us helps us understand the intention behind their words and the meaning of those words. What do you get from text? The best you get is emojis and maybe a few gifs, and I think we all know not to trust those. To be sure, people fake their tones in FTF interactions as well, but those are less common and you get to cross-check with other cues being presented. Also, words help us to read mood as well, but in this aspect, FTF interaction is way better than texts where correct words are less readily chosen (keep one's sensitivity constant).

3) FTF: There's body language, including facial expressions.
Text: There isn't body language.
Note: The cues we get from body language is somewhat different from tones but they ultimately help us comprehend the meaning behind those words. It's one of those factors that help you cross-check with the information you get from tones of speech. Not just that, but the actions themselves convey meaning. Again, they're all subjected to misinterpretation and false signals. But even if you are talking to a well-trained evil doer and you are extremely bad at picking up cues from body language, I'm sure FTF interactions do better than texts (no body language), most of the time anyway.

4) FTF: Instantaneous.
Text: Not instantaneous.
Note: Texts are not instantaneous, although the technology might be. That's why you have people, me included, who reply at a later time. Some because they are busy or because they want to spend more time with a better crafted message, or for some other reasons. And there's nothing wrong with the latter, just as some people prefer to make sure that their words are appropriate in the context they're in before they speak. But what happens in the interval for the party waiting to receive a reply? Thoughts start to wonder (constantly check your phone for new messages is a sign), and that's bad if you commit to your thoughts. This is detrimental in several ways, especially emotionally. I've been there. That's just one aspect of spontaneity. I think most people find that overall, texting is extremely tiring or at least more tiring than just talking, and needless to say, things get worse for texts. How many people actually prefer sending and reading huge chunk of texts? Another pro of spontaneity is that everything gets cleared up on the spot. Anything that you don't understand about what the other party is saying or has said, or events that are occurring or has occurred gets clarified readily. More understanding and less "unnecessary" thoughts, and whatever that leads after.

With technology, there are always better alternatives than texts, than the worst kind of texts, besides FTF interactions. There may be various reasons especially in our hectic life that we have to do less with FTF interactions, but my thoughts are that, always try to get the best form of communication. This applies regardless of whether or not there's a conflict. Worse yet is when there isn't a clear understanding of what kind of person the other party is and all the cons of texts that has been mentioned above gets amplified.

That's what I can come up with for now. Maybe there's a better guide out there online and if that's the case, sorry for wasting your time. Maybe readers just think I'm an a**hole but that's not important now. Thanks for reading this and best wishes to everyone.

What does it mean when a guy is cold to me on WhatsApp but rather sweet or flirts with me in person with or without others around? Can someone enlighten me?

Evergreen dude here. I have been looking out for a girlfriend since forever, but haven't had any luck so far because I simply don't know how to express interest the right way, nor do I know how to gauge a girls interest in me. 
Now my social circle is getting smaller, since I am already graduating and my female friends are either attached or engaged, and I often hang out with only guys now, so I have absolutely no female friends to ask out at all.

I am also shy, so randomly approaching strangers for dates is close to impossible for me. I have also tried apps like tinder, but most girls on there are just to validate themselves with likes and just ignore all of my messages.

Some of you might say go volunteer, go join some activities outside, go to church to meet girls. But often times the duration that you can interact with them is very little, and being the shy guy like me, to interact and converse properly with a stranger is hard enough, let alone an attractive girl, who is most probably attached anyway. Also, they are always with friends, so when I go this events I will just be a loner at the corner anyway..

I think I really need a step by step approach on how to get girls out to date without being desperate. Any ladies men willing to give advice?
-
 
Why do I suddenly lose all my funny nature and cool persona in front of the girl I like?

I think I'm above average looking person with a likeable personal character. I know there are girls who kind of like me... but why God why, my mind goes complete blank when I'm on freaking first date with her?

Now I so wanna cry every day.

 I have faced this obstacle before in my very first relationship. I hope to get this to your boyfriend and all other confused guys out there facing a similar issue because it's the formula to a long lasting relationship (NOT all girls).

Back then, the picture was roughly this:
1. Don't show care and concern: X
(Proceed to 2.)
2. Show care and concern: X
(The man thinks to himself for instance: If 1. and 2. are both wrong, what exactly is wrong? Maybe the form of my expression of care and concern is wrong. But how exactly is asking how her day was any different from other forms of expression of care and concern? Okay, maybe I'm really wrong. Proceeds to 3.)
3. Show a particular way of care and concern: ✓?

That's the wrong model guys. X. Because she may simply say, as I've always heard from my ex back then: "Now I tell you then you do it?" Do you then continue to try to comprehend the situation? No. X. There's only one answer and one answer only, and that is, "I'm sorry."

The last time I saw him was on Saturday. He said something hurtful that made me want to weep. I made my way home as quickly as possible; I laid down and gave myself over to sleep.

I woke up and the days flew by. It is Friday now and I have not felt a single thing since that night, except fatigue; everyday, after work, I head home and just lie on the bed and I fall asleep.

We have not had a proper conversation since Saturday. He had long given up on communicating with me and I don't blame him. There is simply nothing to say. Beyond my few pitiful and necessary attempts at work, I had not been able to engage anyone in conversation for the past week.

So, this is how the end of 4 years looks like. Why don't I feel a thing?

How do you guys move on? No troll here. This hurts so badly everyday I don't even now when all these crap are going to cease

Hi, I'm currently also facing the same situation as ... On top of that my girlfriend was also touchy with the guy during our overseas trip. She said this is nothing and she just treats him as a close friend. Is this acceptable? I really don't want to see this relationship goes up in smoke as I like her very much. What should I do?

Really need advice on this. Thanks!
-
 
This guy keeps telling me about his knee and stomach problems. But, he can play badminton last week and captain ball this week, with his hall friends. He eats supper with them as well. If he can do all these, then he shouldn't keep emphasizing on those pain so much, everyday. I can understand if he is hurt here and there, but if he is not even taking care of his body till it recovers, then he shouldnt talk about it everyday. Sorry, i just could not take it anymore.

To , I would love to be your friend if you don't mind my being from FoE :)
I know exactly how you feel. Hang in there, girl!

Just something that I really needed to get off my chest + ask for some advice :/
There's a guy in my clique that I really like, and he's really upz so I know for sure he wouldn't like an average girl like me. On days when he compliment random chiobus we see around school, I feel really depressed and just wallow in self-pity... I wish I could be pretty to so he can notice me. I mean, I know he isn't superficial; he's the kind who thinks about a relationship very deeply and very thoroughly before getting into one. But sometimes, I just wish I could be a little bit more attractive to him, so he could notice me more... 
But that's all in the past. Nowadays, I hang around him all the time because I want to stop getting all those butterflies in my stomach whenever I see him. Maybe if I kept seeing you I'll be "desensitised", and just see you as a bro. I really hope that day comes soon because I imagine that you'll be very disturbed by me liking you... I'm sure you will find it creepy that I hang around you while I like you. I'm sorry that I couldn't control my feelings better :(
Even after I have convinced myself that this is a good and right thing to do, on some nights like this, I stare into space and my heart is filled with sadness and regret. Why can't I be that pretty girl who makes your head turn? Why couldn't I have met you earlier and have more opportunities to impress you? Why can't I have a chance too...?
Sorry, in the end just kinda became ranting :/ I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is effective... Has anyone tried to forget your "liking" for someone like this? How long does it take? And if I'm really not his type, would he be very disgusted when he realises that I liked him? If that's the case, I'm find a way to convince myself to screw off far far away from him :'(
Thanks so much in advance everyone, thanks for reading my annoying rant and all the best for midterms :)

Whenever a boy says that girl is so pretty, others will say she already have a boyfriend.

Having a boyfriend and being pretty isn't mutually exclusive. In fact, it is usually in union

People assume that a guy like a girl just because he think he is pretty. This shows that male are superficial creature and can like a girl just because he find her pretty. This make sense because according to the YouTube video Why Sexy is Sexy, beauty is a language that convey health and fertility. It is a male's instinct to find a fertile woman to give birth to alot of offspring to  ensure the survival of homo sapien. 

Man cannot be friend with the woman he find attractive. Most people just assumed the guy wanted to be that girl's boyfriend instead of just friend.

小新post No 2: Besides his family, 小新's friends are really cute too. I actually shipped 正南and妮妮together when they grow up. The bromance between 小新and 风间 is soooo funny. And 阿呆is so reliable. Who do you like the most in the group? 
I think as we grow older, we will start to realize that what we want in life is just a few friends that will stay by our side to share moments of joy and sadness together.  #小新迷。

I am an evergreen shy girl. Whenever I am around the guy I like, I cannot act or talk like we do on text. I really want to talk to him but I cannot even talk properly. What do I do?

I am from NTU. Not long ago, I have gotten to know a girl from NUS biz from some event. 
At first we started hitting off quite well. We texted each other everyday, from morning till night. And then we started going out for study date and movie date. She was very sweet to me, and i started telling her that i like her and stuffs, although she didnt reciprocate, she still continue texting me and going out with me.
However, being over stressful by my workload recently, i was not very understanding when she fell sick, and have multiple small arguments with her that i have regretted. And now she is starting to ignore and treating me very coldly. 
Guys, any advice how to 挽回 this relationship? And if you are reading this, please give me another chance..

At this age (I am approaching my mid-twenties), I have started to invest less in friendships, i.e. I tend to be less emotionally invested nowadays. Not saying that I advocate insincerity, but perhaps more discretion when it comes to determining who stays in one's social circle of trustworthy and dependable friends. And in some cases, the duration which you have known someone does not matter. Someone you have known for a twelve years may turn out to be a friendship vampire/frenemy while another person whom you have known for three years may actually be a kindred spirit. So keep an open heart yup and be rational. It's quite contradictory  but I don't know how to better describe it. 

I have had bad experiences in the past where close friends treated me like a venting outlet, going on and on their problems whenever we met up. Usually such things went on for hours at a time. And they would go on and on about the same issues quite unapologetically like a broken record. I was unaffected at first, thinking that it was my responsibility to lend a listening ear but over an extended period of time, I found myself drained and weary while the other party felt better after each 'conversation'. I felt like a sponge sopping up all the negative energy in their life and those 'friendship vampires' were taking up my time and energy which I could have set aside for more productive endeavours so to speak... Even when I needed a listening ear, the conversation would somehow end up about them -- yes they did hear me out and gave me advice and stuff, but it seemed as though their issues always took precedence and had to be dealt with first. In the end I really couldn't take it any longer and decided to distance myself away from them. We are all still on good terms but I have put them on the back-burner. They are no longer the people I would think of first when I want to hang out with friends. 

I have far fewer friends now but at least I do not have that negativity in my life and I have more time for the people who truly care for me (my family and relatives, my bf and a couple of close friends). I find myself more positive too, and a reason why I have more time is because I do not have to deal with their texts any longer. Their rants used to continue on WA even after our meet-ups for hours straight and I would have to respond to them lest they question me and I end up feeling guilty for doing otherwise. I actually prefer having acquaintances now because it is just so much easier to handle how much you invest in the relationship. There is more freedom in how much you wanna divulge and keep to yourself. Those 'friends' of mine expected me to share details of my personal life with them because 'we [had] known each other for so long' and they would make me feel guilty for not keeping them updated. Even when I got to know my Bf, they expected me to fill them in with all the details. And they probed when I refused and induced guilt in me. So. I could have handled it more firmly but I didn't have the maturity back then. In retrospect I should have been more outspoken but now I know better. 

Yeah I know this post is pretty circular but hopefully it provides some kind of relatability for the people out there who are experiencing the same thing? Adulthood is a very transitionary period of our lives and many things change, including our relationships with friends. People who used to be 'best friends' realise that they are actually drifting apart (and sometimes for the better really) and acquaintances start to establish strong friendship bonds. And to be honest.... I honestly don't think that there is a need to verbally state who are your 'best friends' -- I mean, we are adults and most of the time, we just know, by intuition, and the thing is, usually the other party gets it too. If there is a need to verbally reaffirm your status, then perhaps there are issues to be dealt with, issues which have been overlooked for a long time. But please - don't 旧事重提(bring up old issues from the past - sometimes it is the breaking point of a friendship. Bringing up bad things which happened NINE years ago in SEC 3 (?!?!?!) when we were immature and impulsive in the midst of a dinner with good food and wine on a weekend isn't exactly the best way to 'clarify' things with your friends-- not even to your 'best friend'!!! (Ehhh.... Best Friend doesn't mean you can just shoot your mouth like that right hahaha) To me it just shows how much that person harbours grudges (记仇) and it really pisses off the other party. It really dampens the mood so even if you MUST do it, do it with discretion and gentleness? Perhaps you could share your thoughts here :)

Hmmm lastly, these issues are inevitable so take it easy yup? We grow up, our personalities change and so do our friends. A few younger cousins shared with me their friendship woes last weekend so I thought I should share my experiences just in case some people are struggling win similar issues. It may be difficult for a while but honestly, it works out well in the end as Long as you treat people the way you want to be treated. :) jiayou everyone!! :D

if my bf tells me he doesn't know if we can last, it's perfectly fine of me to be concerned right?

i have no idea what to do about this.

To  I'm a shy girl and usually when I sense that he's looking at me, I tuck my hair behind my ear, also occasionally I give a sweet smile that is almost mysterious. My friend who knows my crush also noticed that my voice also tend to get more soft when speaking to him compared to my normal tone.

I have a crush on my best friend. The problem is how can I tell if this feeling is romantic or not, or if it's just a one-sided crush? I don't want to risk our friendship over this, because for now I'm content with just being friends and spending time with her.  Yet at the same time I do not want to look back later and regret my decision of not asking her out. Can someone advice me on how to confront these feelings of mine? 
-
 
I am two years into this relationship with my second gf. We both had one relationship before, and both of us had sex with our previous partners.

Honestly, I guess both of us are regretful over what we did. And certainly, both of us are pretty uncomfortable with each other previous sexual encounters.... 

Although we already queued for bto (she's in final sem), we now don't intend to be intimate before we get married... It's not that we don't want, it is simply something we want to reserve for later. 

Girls and boys, I am not sure how many posts about having FwBs here are troll or sincere. While I do know and respect my friends who venture around, they are all cool, you should never have sex with random friends simply because it seems common on this portal. There can be fake posts from people who wish to spread the misconception.

I'm in love with my 1-year girlfriend but not physically attracted to her. Meanwhile there are prettier girls who are showing some interest in me. I'm thinking about the likelihood of regret if I marry my girlfriend and when love finally fades. She has a great personality and treats me extremely well. But marriage is a life long decision...

I really really want to hug you right now. Why aren't you mine already?
-
 
To , and anyone else trying to woo someone, just ask them out. Couple dates should be larger in proportion to group dates. A girl constantly being asked out alone would probably suspect you like her. 
To make it more obvious, always make time for her and spend as much time as you can together. Take every opportunity to let her know what you like about her.
Otherwise just TELL HER YOU LIKE HER. If you fail to do this, be prepared to enter the friendzone.

Is it a good idea to unfriend someone on facebook? Guy AK has been posting non-stop about how pretty his new girlfriend for about a month now. Furthermore now he even posts about staying faithful to her and how she means the world to him and would never break her heart. I mean c'mon dude, these things are quite obvious in a relationship and should be just between her and you. If you always need to reassure her that you are a one woman's man, then probably you sort out these trust issues with her. Guys and girls, am I wrong to say this and shld i just confront the guy about his stupid lovey-dovey posts and then probably unfriend him if he is still reluctant?
-
 
I got to know this really cool girl through an online dating app and we've been texting for about a month now. We have a lot of common interests and seem to click really well - at least online anyway - and as such I would like to meet up with her. 

However, I figured there's a problem: Having texted so frequently for some time now, it's like we know a lot about each other's lives already. I'm afraid that if we meet in real life we might run out of things to talk about. 

Any seasoned daters or even players can share some advice? I really don't want to screw this up; I feel that we could at least be very good friends.
-
 
I was the one who submitted  "If my boyfriend lied to me about talking to a girl, is it dumping worthy?". I guess I should elaborate on my situation. Because I don't think I'm "paranoid".

What I found out was my boyfriend was talking to this girl from his work and suggesting they meet up. Sometimes she wouldn't reply and he would text her again to initiate conversations. Before finding this out I had a bad feeling about their friendship so I asked him about it, but he said they weren't close and they didn't talk or text at all. Then I found out.

So.

Sometimes it gets really lonely. I've long come to terms with the ambiguous feeling of weight in my heart. I long to 'open' up, to be the funny guy I used to be. Back then, I was sociable and good with jokes. I miss the old me, and occasionally take up that persona with birthday gatherings and outings with secondary school classmates. However, the bubbly me was draining. I start to close up after several instances of social rejections. Most were not explicit, but rather feelings disappointment and regret would hit me. 

After the 2 years in NS, everything is no longer the same. Time seemed to froze and I can't communicate on the same level anymore. The quiet me is now associated with always having something on my mind and being perceived as having matured. I hated this extreme. I would act like the 13yo me in front of my family. It feels as if I'm trying to find a balance in all these dispositions. Everything was ok until my mum chided me for being so childish on one occasion. It hurts only after I realized the inner me has literally no where to go. The rest stops seem to be at polarized locations, and my personality just tries to fit in. 

Now I just feel like stop trying. I would avoid emotional conversations with close friends by changing the topic or appear immature to annoy the h*ll out of them. I wear dark clothing on a daily basis, and cut my hair only when someone comments on how untidy I look. I try to avoid social gatherings with people I'm not close with, and freak out in a group of people whom I don't even know the names of. It's like a part of me just shuts down, leaving the rest to deal with the mess.  

Even in group projects with allocated members, I would always appear very enthusiastic at the start. Then I would realize how pointless it would be since everyone else has their priorities, and I appear to have none. All it takes is a trigger, like the Prof rejecting our chosen article to base our project on. I take every setback as a sign that I should stop trying. Every time I try to step out, I just sink lower.

I'm evergreen. Stopped trying after one bad experience when I was 16. I can no longer initiate conversations without any purpose. No more "How's your day?", no more "ah so stress". I'm becoming a recluse, an emotional deviant.

I wonder what has changed. I know I've to come to terms with it. It gets so tiring I would sleep for half the day. I hate it but I've to appear strong in front of people I love. I hate to have so much time on my hands. I hate myself for not trying harder, and I know I've myself to blame. Talking to people on an emotional level creeps me out, because I know I'm an emotional wreck. I don't want to hurt anyone when I implode. Sorry to waste your time.

If you wanna know for sure who a genuine person is, find someone who doesnt dress up or put makeup. These people dont need physical adornments or alterations to make them feel better about themselves. 

Also cos theyre lazy and they are not hiding that. Therefore genuine af.

I just got involved with a new FB. Unlike my previous ones, this guy is really doting of me and he makes me miss having a boyfriend.  

And I have to say, it feels good to know that I can just look into someone's eyes and give a kiss I enjoy for someone to do things for me - not related to sex. 

Speaking of the prevalence of people with FB, I do have a few friends who have / have had FBs. Some of whom are  younger, some overseas, some of another race. Perhaps birds of the same feathers do flock together.

I am an evergreen guy in Year 2. I started liking this girl last year and made efforts to get to know her better. She's introverted, so it took her a while to open up. I think I am her only male friend.

She enjoys my company and trusts me, but because I haven't dropped any hints, she treats me as a normal friend.

I know that I'm supposed to be brave and all, but the fear of rejection seems too big for my ego to handle. 

I'm afraid that things will get awkward if she rejects me (she's in some of my classes), but yet I know that attraction has an "expiry period" too.. What should I do?
-
 
Recently I've been noticing my friend keeps hanging out with this guy from her course. The thing is that she's attached to another mutual friend of mine and I feel as though she is too close and touchy with this new guy. I'm a girl by the way and no I do not like her boyfriend. He is just a close friend of mine whom I do not want to see hurt. What should I do?
-
 


i don't think you are my friend, but you sure do explain for him well enough.

i don't know though... because this only began to happen recently. or maybe i feel it more starkly recently.

it does affect me even tho you explained it in a "it's not you, it's me" way. well what do you want us to do? can we still text you? if you're not going to reply... what is the point... & will it stress you out even more?

maybe it's just a balance of expectations. but i was just hoping... that you'd text me a huge chunk of encouragements just like last time. lol. 

i really don't know how else to reach you... & all the replies i get from you now are just... i don't really know how to reply sigh.

I was in love with her forever. I just didn't know it until third year.

The first time I laid eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Her freckles, her scarlet hair, the way she carried herself.

Too bad she chose to consort with my mortal enemy.

Our feud went back generations; it was only natural I despised him. And I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why she would befriend  him - by all accounts, she was everything he could never be. Popular. Brilliant. Radiant.

And so I squashed down my feelings for her. For even though I fell, bewitched, every time I looked deep into those blazing eyes, my rivalry with him was more important than a stupid crush, right?

And then, years later, I understood.

It was love.

She rejected me at first, and, looking back, it makes sense. Obviously. I kinda let my 'jock' status run to my head a little, and that bothered her. So I cleaned up my act (cleaner than HE could possibly get) and she finally let me be with her, in all her glory.

And we made love.

And we made a baby.

And here's the best part: my little boy has her eyes. Her gorgeous green eyes.
-
 
the feeling sucks when many other girls like my crush as well. it doesn't help at all when i am so ugly and introverted. i see people making bold moves to get him and yet i cant do anything because im just too scared. I simply wish for more guys like my crush to exist because i cant compete with any of those girls. i am certainly going to be eliminated by natural selection.

Are most Muslims male circumcised in Singapore? I tried to look it up the net, and got something along the lines of: Those born in the 1990s are circumcised. After 2000, lesser statistics of circumcision. I even found out that female circumcision is prevalent in Singapore! 

Genuinely curious but awkward to ask my friends. Anyone knows? 
-
 
to , I was in the exact situation as you a while ago. and eventually, I decided to let it go. We have talked it over many many times, but at the end of the day we decided that maybe we will be happier without trying to change each other. It was a long relationship, and we were together for more than 8 years. We thought we were each other's 'happily-ever-after', but it didn't work out in the end. You will feel that it's a pity to give up, but maybe... it's the only way that both of you will feel happier... 
Nevertheless, please talk it through. Take separation as a last resort. The world needs more love.

Need your advice guys. There is this girl that I am very close with the previous semester. However, due to varying workload ( as we are in a different course ) we drifted apart and see each other lesser this semester.  During the Valentine's Day period, she presented me with a flower, so what do you think her main intention was?  

P.S She joins one of the organisation I conduct as well and we are close friends btw.  #Dazedandconfused

Have been talking to a girl online. I have asked her out on a date because I like talking to her. She agreed. However after looking at her photos, I am having second thoughts. I know its super jerk of me but she just isn't physically attractive to me. I have a feeling she likes me. Do I owe her this date or should I pull a slow fade?

Fk man she would feel so hurt knowing that I am not as enthusiastic as before after looking through her photos. FML. Advices please.

So recently I heard that if in chat people just reply with one emoticon, they are telling you to shut up. I recall all those icon that my friends type in chat. I think some are funny, some very encouraging, some cheering me up a lot. It turns out all of them are trying to tell me to stfu? :(

I am hurting so much because I think I'm about to hurt my boyfriend... He loves me very very much and I love him too, but our personalities are too different and I don't see me being happy with him in the long run. To me, he is the best and sweetest guy out there but I can't go on like this... We've talked about it a lot but at the end of the day, I can't make him change who he is and he can't make me change who I am.. Not really seeking advice cos I'm not sure if there's any useful advice for me anyway, just wanted to get it off my chest

Wow why is it whenever I told my friends I have a crush. The first question they ask is does she have a bf? Gosh do you all really think that I'm the sort that snatches people's gf? Or do you all think that I'm fated to get unrequited love?

I have a friend who is a really unhappy person even though she always puts on a front and pretends to be happy. Even though I do not know what her problems are, I would like to help her on some ways. Any idea how I can help?

To the OP of confession ,

You might not know me, or you might do. I am one of the regular contributors of comments on NUSWhispers, and coming across your confession post my heart broke a little more inside for you. Your mental strength to even compose yourself enough to write what you wrote, without malice of exposing the architects of your betrayal is something I both admire, and yet at the same time add rage towards your friend and now-ex that had wronged you in the most heinous manner possible. 

I have only dated once in my life. Wasn't as long as yours, heck it wasn't even as long as what most people would have dated on average. I was with my ex for the three to four months before I left Singapore for university overseas. For someone who admittedly was not blessed with luck in love, she meant everything to me back when I was a more turbulent and tempestuous being. For someone who had been planning to leave Singapore, study overseas and never return, she gave me reason once again to hope for a future with someone here in Singapore, someone whom I could share my life and heart and love with. 

Slightly more than a week after I arrived at my university, what had started out auspiciously as our budding LDR suddenly went sour. For no reason my ex ghosted me on all communication channels. Whatsapp, Facebook, phone calls, everything. My mind went into overdrive and I nearly went mad with worry over her safety and our relationship. I still remember vividly the afternoon that I was in university attending events for Freshers' Week when her Whatsapp message came through. She said that she had found out right after I left Singapore than she was pregnant with my child, from our last night spent together in the same bed. We had done it only twice in our relationship, and according to her words against all protection we both took she still struck the biological jackpot and got pregnant. I was shellshocked to read next that she ghosted me the entire week because she was pondering her decision to make, and that the very morning she Whatsapped me she had just come back from the clinic where she had induced the abortion, and with that she broke up with me. 

Two hours after I received the message I had booked the first flight back home that I could. Five hours after the message was read I was on the train to the airport. No phone calls went through. No messages went answered or even read. I called my parents and broke down on the phone to my dad, and to his credit he did not tell my mother the terrible incident, and fully supported me to fly back home to see what support I could give for my ex, or failing that how best to end the relationship on a proper footing. My train got delayed, and my flight left early, so I ended up staying overnight at the airport hotel before catching the first flight back the next morning. I had fallen badly ill throughout this time, and my family doctor whom I subsequently visited when I returned home said he would have grounded me from flying had he seen to me in the country from which I flew from.

When I arrived back at Changi Airport I tried to contact my ex again, and when I failed I did the only thing I thought an honourable man should do. I called her mother and tried to find out where her daughter was. She was surprised that I was suddenly back in Singapore until I confessed to her everything my ex told me. I guess you could call it foolish honour on my part, I genuinely thought that I'd offer myself up, physically and mentally and emotionally for whatever punishment that was to await me from her parents, if it meant that I could somehow see my ex again and find out the truth of the matter. But it was not to be. 

My ex sending me off at the airport proved to be the last time I'd ever see her face again. After their own personal discussions both my ex's parents called me back. Far from the anger I  expected to receive from them, their responses were very much the opposite. They thanked me for being an honourable man who would fly back from two continents away to attempt taking responsibility for their daughter, but that they couldn't persuade their daughter to see me one last time and end things right. In the mother's words "our family does not want anything more to do with you, so I thank you for being a good partner to my daughter for the past few months, and that you fly back and complete your education. Leave my daughter and this relationship behind, forget that we ever existed." And promptly after I returned back to university, my ex's family and friends all blocked and deleted me off every single avenue of contact, online or through the phone. 

The clincher of all this was that when I returned back to visit last summer, I got into contact once more with a mutual friend of me and my ex. And she finally told me what I had suspected all along as I dealt with the emotional turmoil of a breakup so bad alone in a foreign country. My ex had never been pregnant, the friend told me. She thought I would be like most guys who would be scared off with talks of pregnancy by their hands, and that fundamentally she decided to break up after we started our LDR because she was paranoid that I would not be able to resist the temptation of foreign girls compared to her waiting for me back home. So I lost my first proper relationship and the girl I loved, to her paranoia and a lousy lie of a reason that left me emotionally wrecked for the rest of the year to come. 

So, OP of confession , I thought that with your courage of sharing your breakup on NUSWhispers that I'd share mine as well. Might not be comparable to yours in terms of magnitude (god knows I didn't even get to a first anniversary, much less BTO talk), but I believe our stories though different share a similar trauma. The rage and despair you feel now must be unimaginable and almost unsurvivable. No words will comfort you, no gestures will warm you. You will be playing over everything in the past you shared with your cheating ex and castigating yourself on what you did wrong, and what you could have changed. But as someone who took almost a year to move on significantly (and not even fully) I can tell you this. Time will heal you, whether you believe it does or not. Do not blame yourself, because the last thing you need now is to bring yourself down when others have given you such a crushing blow that few will ever receive in similar fashion. I hope you will have better fortune and mental fortitude to deal with the emotional scars you must bear with such pain now, than I had with my own wounds. I'm still fighting every day to move on, to live on and love and feel again after all the trauma that I had gone through. We all will have to, you and I both and others out there who have similar stories to share. But know that you are not alone, you will never be alone, and that what support I did not receive back in my darkest hours I am offering mine to you when you need it most now. I do not want you to come out of everything as badly or worse than how I came out of my own breakup. There are enough people in the world who are irreparably hurt emotionally, you deserve so much better than the cheating ex and traitorous friend of yours. 

Keep breathing, keep fighting, keep living, don't stop hoping. We are the ones who have to go through hell and high water because of our love for the wrong people in our lives, but I believe that Fate will ultimately prove kind to us and give us back what we've lost. If you're still wondering who I am after reading all this that I've written, I'm the only comment contributor on NUSWhispers who is currently studying in the UK. Talk to me, message me, I will always have time for you and I will always have your back. 

Never forget, never regret. Stay strong brother.

 It might just be me but I would honestly find it hard to accept if my boyfriend wasn't one. Individual preferences I guess.

Girl you promised to stay thru thick&thin with me. Did 4 years of dates mean nothing to you?
Friend, you saw me at my lowest. We knew each other for 7 years.

And today I lost them both.
ladies and gentleman, I just found out that my girlfriend has secretly been in love with my best friend for- (wait for it) - the entire length of our relationship.
Getting together with me was , i quote " in a bid to get closer to [best friend's name] "

It gets better:
They were together and she has been cheating on me for a year now.

And here is the climax:
I didn't find out.
She finally confessed, when I proposed.

Yes 
Proposed. 
Not with a ring, but the singaporean way of introducing the idea of applying for a BTO.

And now you two don't return my calls, texts and avoid me when I see you down the hall.

I don't even have the time to be mad. I barely just digested all this shit.
Like the times when you said you were sick but your friends said they saw you outside. 
I thought that was just a white lie.
Or the times when you said you were at home and I was at your doorstep surprising you but turns out you were outside (with him?) and you just settled me down with a jkjk (;

I am a guy. I have lust. I have urges.
But more than that, I had respect for you. for you and your wishes.
Abstinence you said. 
Not ready you said.
Fine, I said.

And then you went on to tell me that day (dear readers, did i mention she broke up with me over the phone?)
(no it wasn't a call, it was whatssap. Then she blocked me), THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IT WITH HIM FOR - I quote yet again - "quite a number of times" !?!?!

Dear audience, ain't this wonderful?

I have had it. 
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't wanna call you out.
I gave you face which is why I didn't wanna make a fuss in the canteen the other day when I confronted you.
But you can't avoid me forever.

And up until now, all I wanna know, and all I was ever thinking,  is why....

p.s. considered placing a screenshot of the long long message but
1) it is too long and the screenshot of the entire message is 5 pictures
2) she uses unique spellings that would have been a dead giveaway to her identity.

Need advice from u guys.

I have a very fit & handsome roommate who does well in his studies and sports. Being in the same room as him, I seem to grow to like him. The uncontrollable part  is he sleep naked and i cannot control myself as he is really hot and sexy. Spotted him with erection a few times at night and I really feel like touching him. Feel like 'eating' him. But is wrong of me if i do that. 
-
 
To  I am not sure if that post was about me and I hope it is. If it is and you are reading this, I have deleted your number in my phone because it is too damn hard to stop texting you. Maybe drop me a text and we will see if we can work something out? 
-
 
Thinking about you again G. The past month has been terrible. I literally couldn't get you off my mind. Thoughts of you surface everywhere at any time; in the middle of a seminar; while I'm on the bus; the list goes on. I wished that you would text me. It's terrible. I miss you. I haven't been feeling so down for three weeks now, which is a good sign, but maybe because I'm getting busier and tried a lot harder to keep you out of my mind. 

I wonder if you are happy now? Have you rekindled that happiness that you ran away from? I wished I could ask about your life, 但是自从那一天开始，我已经失去了问侯你的权利。只要是我做的事，即使你不那么觉得，我自己也会觉得我做的都还是因为我喜欢你。妳大概也是这样觉得吧，因为我和妳都很少聊了，妳觉得我只是随便说喜欢你试一试罢了，其实根本都没有很喜欢妳。过后我表现得不是很在乎，没有被影响到，但都是我想装出一副不是很在意的态度，和往常一样。我选择不要发短讯给妳了，不是因为我根本不喜欢你，而是因为我觉得我在妳心目中没有很重要，就算是朋友也比不上妳那些很要好的朋友，所以不要耽误你的时间。回来的第一个月我从事情的来龙去脉就看得出这一点了。

现在说什么都没有用了。我只是希望妳能幸福快乐。你要和妳一起去寻找幸福快乐的人不是我，那没关系。我只希望你能找回那个可以给你幸福快乐的人。喜欢一个人不需要占有，只要她快乐，我就满足了。I want you to be happy more than anything in the world.

Yesterday while I was having dinner with my family and my sister's Boyfriend, I noticed something which really troubled me. 
At the dinner, we were seated as such so that the couple could be given as much privacy as possible without being conscious of our existence. 
However, once we were seated and orders were taken, both of them just whipped out their phones and did whatever they were doing on the phone before the food came. There were no words exchanged between my Sister and her Boyfriend throughout. My sister's eyes were glued to her phone, texting and visiting social media sites. Her Boyfriend was not much better. He was continually playing his game and not even once he bothered to look up at my sis. Even after the food came, they just went back to using their phones while eating the food. My parents were puzzled as it was the first time we went dinner with her Boyfriend tagging along, and they had assumed that they would want to be left alone to "lovey dovey". How wrong my dad was lol. 
The entire dinner took about 1.5 hours. My parents soon noticed that there was no conversation going on between the couple. Even after my parents initiated a conversation to get the couple to start talking, it was futile as it was evident that whatever they were doing on their phones took a greater priority. My Dad even commented after the dinner " even after 40 years of marriage with your Mother, I still can talk to her with more frequency than those 2 just now". 
I don't know whether it is me or what, but I have been seeing such incidents on a frequent basis nowadays. Whenever I go to cafes with my friends(I'm single), more often than not I see couples using their phones more than interacting with each other. I know social media sites can be attractive but you can always access it all the time when your SO is not around right?? Whereas one usually meets their Boyfriend/Girlfriend for 3-4 hours for a date? So why can't one just put aside his/her phone for those 3-4 hours and spend it fully with their loved one? If 3-4 hours is too long, surely not using the phone during the course of a meal (which is like 1.5 hours at most? ) at all is reasonable right? 
I feel that as a sign of respect for your SO, one should give him/her your full attention whenever they are out on a date. Maybe I'm wrong about this because I'm still single, but the thought of myself doing this with my future girlfriend...it doesn't feel right. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong...it's just my opinion! Cheers

I don't know if you follow this page but if you read this, I just want to say that I'm terribly sorry I didn't give you a chance. I really like you a lot as a person and maybe as a partner too but I didn't want to lead you on because I have commitment issues and at that point in time, I was still in love with someone else. I still want to thank you for calling me during your exam period even though you were supposed to be studying and I want to thank you for being my listening ear during that period of time. If I did agree to meeting you the other time, we could have spent Valentine's day this year together. But I guess you would have already found someone else by now. One thing I don't understand though, is why you would give up so easily when you claimed that you liked me that much? Anyways, my life is really messed up now and I really want to talk to you so please, if you read this, give me a call.. 
-
 
I stayed away from you not because I was angry at you or I hated the sight of you. I stayed away from you hoping that you will feel happier without me around. You always looked either troubled or angry when you see me. I don't even understand why you would sometimes mumble your words when you talk to me. A long time ago, when I held that door for you, you were trying to tell me something but you mumbled to yourself again. I regretted not asking you what you were trying to say. That was the last time you talked to me. I really wanted you to know this but I guess you probably wouldn't have heard me out anyway.

That awkward moment when you openly flirt with your friend as a joke until one day you realise you like this person but you're too far deep in the friend zone

Anyone in a current LDR, can you post about how you manage it and make it work? May potentially enter one, frankly a little unsure of what to expect, and would like some advice to make things work. Thanks.

Just gonna come out and say this first: I'm not pushing for any ideas or whatnot, just here to say something to whoever wants to read it, after seeing all the posts on NS. 

Additional spoiler alert - Do not read this if you are:
1. Someone who liked NS or feels the need to tell everyone how much they loved it/ why this country needs it.
2. Someone who feel NS  or the govt has wronged them in some way.

To the above: Don't read this, my views are my own and there is no need for you to take time out of your life to read, comment and construct an intellectually-sounding, fact-quoting wall of words to justify your stand to me. I am but a random confessor. Honestly. Don't read and don't comment. I'm not going to read the reactions to this post anyway. I just wanted to say something that I have kept within my heart for some time. And don't hijack this post to tell everyone how patriotic/honorable you are or how whatever I am doing is bad/ pressing for anti-/pro- govt propaganda. Probably no one cares much for what you, or I, have to say within minutes of reading.  

So I bid you, scroll past this, all ye who art honorable, all ye who within doth dwell bitterness. These words are for my catharsis and mine alone. There is no place for you here. Reading this will just get you worked up for naught, they are not worth your time. Your energies are better focused elsewhere. 

And so, on to what I would like to say:

Truth: 2 years is 2 years. I will never get it back again. I did/do my best to make the most of it, but I will never get it back again. Were there things I wish I had done better? No. I like to think i did my best in those 2 years. There were good and bad times, but nonetheless, it was time i can never get back again. 

So, to those who felt it was not wasted and still stubbornly read on, good on you. Move along. Same to those who will spout anti-NS rhetoric. You and I, we will not meet, either in a clash of words or in a verbal battle. I have said my part and I will move on from hence forth. Wasted/not wasted, they are both subjective. I won't judge you for whatever reason you felt that it was either. You have the right to feel the way you feel. Just as I do not have the right to tell you if you are right or wrong, you have no right to do so here. Just as my thoughts are my own, your thoughts are your own. 

To those like me, who simply felt that part of their lives were wasted, I can empathize. Don't let it eat you up. Just keep it inside as a reminder/motivation for whatever you are working towards. And know that you are not alone. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise and don't let anyone fan the bitterness into something that will continue to burn us inside till the day we die. 

Hold this like a silent whisper of affirmation, close to your heart. And rest easy, knowing you are not alone. 

That is all. Thank you for listening to the words I have been wanting to say for a long time.

 to each his own. Personally I would prefer a boy/girl to mature together with me. It is fine if both of us do not know how to handle some issues but the thing is that we work things out together. There will be a problem in the future if theres a big difference in maturity. Right now, you are still very focus on what he can provide to you but can you do the same to him?
-
 
to that guy who never gave me a straight answer:

tell me the truth
don't make me wait too long
you have to prove
that i shouldn't move on

because seriously, it sucks to be waiting on the other line. and i'm pretty sure you're familiar with the feeling too.

Hi 

Yes it's normal. Women have sexual desires too. When I was single, I settled my needs by having a lot of casual sex. Now I am in a relationship and having regular sex but I sometimes crave sex with other people, either for variety or just because it's not enough.
-
 
After being in a few relationships, I've come to the conclusion that people often break up over compatibility issues. But the truth is, compatibility is overhyped. Why do I say so? I think the real underlying reason is respect. There can be a couple as different as day and night or introvert/extrovert,  but as long as they respect their differences for eg the extrovert respecting the introvert's wish of not wanting to go for a party. And being able to communicate that understanding well. We can have couples that are "not compatible" thriving. It's a pity that I only realised this after a few failed relationship. Looking back, although there might be varying levels of "compatibility" if one would just have respect for their partners, there wouldn't be breakup everywhere. Anybody here agrees??

With all these NS talk, I am wondering how many guys lost their virginity during NS? Especially with reference to . I heard from my guy friends that they are always given out condoms for overseas exercise and they can take any number they want, even if they dont take, they will be passed 2 of it. Then, a bunch of guys will gather to find those dirty "massage parlour" together. Is it true that many guys go for them? Or probably more of regulars?
-
 
My girlfriend caught me screenshotting pictures of girls in bikini @ instagram to send to my friend. Now she's angry at me? Surely she should have expected this, since 70% of who i'm following @ insta are hot girls. I'm not even cheating on her, how can i convince her to not be so sensitive?
-
 
Before I enlisted into NS, I thought I will lose my virginity for all sorts of reasons. so happy I am still a virgin even till now.
-
 
OP of  here... Thanks for all the comments.. I just want to be clear here that as I have said, although I am not into this fetish, I would not mind doing it at home as we do get a chance to be intimate after that. So basically, what he did was totally a mood killer. I have spoken to him and he thought that I had the fetish as well saying, "why did you do it at home then". I did not know what to say and just hung up. I have sent him a message and gave a time out. Should I really continue? I can't let him go. But what if he does this again? Certain things are meant to be done in private and kept there.

Before you deride this as someone being stuck up...

How far are friendships like business? You make friends with people whom you think will help you. Either emotionally (when you're down), physically (to safeguard), or for connections (jobs, raising money).

Sometimes you want to make friends with someone not so much for him/her, but his/her friends. This is using someone as a connection hub. At some point in time you hope to decouple this hub person and directly be friends with the real targets of interest in his/her group if you can sustain it.

Sometimes you also make friends with someone who is not that promising because he or she could be great in the future. You help him/her be great in return for help.

But sometimes, we also cut loss-making friendships. Friends who cannot serve any interest because they are really of no value get cut. For instance, if a "friend" is so down and out and cannot help himself or herself, what is the point in helping him/her if he or she cannot even be self-secure?

Sometimes you can even just hold onto a friendship not because he or she is likeable, but you would rather have a semi-cordial relationship and figure out what his/her intentions are before he/she turns against you.

Eventually I hope to have a hub of very high-yield friends. :)
-
 
to  its normal for guys to have fetish. I think he still love you very much. For example, I will slap my gf in front of her friends and we all know its just for fun. But does that mean I do not love her? No, I love her very much. Your boyfriend is normal.

To poster of ,
I also have gone through a period of time where I was excessively worried abput my future and depressed over the apparent meaninglessness of life. I believe it is a form of existential crisis / anxiety.

What is important is for you to realise that feeling lost is the start of understanding yourself and what you value in life. There is no need for you to worry. You are still young and there is no urgency for you to make any big change to your life. There are people who experience something similar in their fourties in what is known as a midlife crisis. So, instead of being worried, you should be happy that you are reflecting on your life at this age.

You say you used to live a life with meaning but now you have nothing to live for. Try to remember the things you enjoyed doing and you will realise that these are the things that make your life meaningful. You are right that there is no ideal path or purpose that applies to everyone. Instead of being afraid and worried, take it as an oppurtunity for you to explore and try new things. There is no such thing as taking a wrong path and living your life in regret. You can also talk to your friends as they might understand you in ways that you don't know yourself.

Also, don't let one relationship make you give up on everything. Not everyone is superficial as you believe. Even if you insist that romantic love is superficial, there are still a million other things that can make life meaningful.

As for your question about romantic love, it is true that romantic love is a form of attachment in the sense that one desires reciprocation and fear the loss of the other person. But it can also be a form of altruism and compassion when you care for someone. In Buddhism (though I might be wrong), I think the view is that attachment is a double edge sword in that it leads both to happiness and suffering. That said, I don't believe that we must lead an ascetic life and free ourselves from all attachment. In fact, the Buddhist view of romantic love is different depending on the school of thought you subscribe to with some accepting it as a natural part of life. While I am not a Christian, I see no conflict between the buddhist view of attachment and the view that love is a gift from god. It may be the case that both are focusing on different aspects of  romantic love, buddhism on attachment and desire, while Christians on the compassion and altruism that love entails. I think what is important is not to judge prematurely based on limited observations and to always experience things with an open heart. Many things can only be learnt through personal experience.

That's all. Don't worry too much and take things slowly. All the best!

If you feel like you need to do something for your crush then go for it! Don't bother asking anyone for advice because everyone is different and their advice isn't likely to work for you.

If your friend tells you shit like he/she isn't into you/want to reject you, please don't believe it, it will make you lose confidence and not strive for something that is potentially there. Because your friend isn't him/her and only him/her will know the answer.

If your friend tells you to give up/move on/there are many fishes out there, don't believe it either! You are the one who knows who you want. You know the person you want is irreplaceable. 

Ultimately you want your crush to fall for you because of who you are and what you do. You wouldn't want him/her to fall for a stupid puppet acting on people's order.

If you love someone, go for it. If you need a sign, this is it.

After reading countless of nus whispers, posts of regrets, girls , boys , sexual history , dilemmas and whats not , i decided to share my advice on basic relationship issues.This benefit both gender so please read with an open mind. if you disagree, i openly accept any criticism in the comments. i am doing this to educate YOU so that you can protect yourself from playboys or playgirls. 

Rule of thumb in BGR. A VERY SHORT GUIDE
* ALWAYS TRUST YOUR GUT FEELING - COMMON RULE

Girls- this would benefit you more , your body is precious.. please dont let any guys take advantage of you, always think it through
1. First dates, please do not agree to go drinking or clubbing! obviously if you are looking for a boyfriend/husband material.. even if the guy is extremely good looking, it sounds too good to be true no? obvious trap is obvious? even if it worked out, do you foresee yourself getting heartbreaks from his night activities? 
2. Never date a bad boy hope to change him into a good boy .. unless of course he is WILLING to do it for you by himself. lets face the truth , nothing goes well when its forceful. what do you get in the long run?
3. If he never ask you to be his Girlfriend, you are not! DONT ASSUME! Ask and clear the cloud before it escalates further *ahem sexual activities* just because you kiss and hold hands does't mean your TOGETHER. He might even have the idea that you are willingly agreeing to satisfied his sexual needs if you do not clear the situation. boohoo at the end of the road, who's to lose? NOT HIM!!!!
4. He asks you to go to his house already within the first few dates . come on , 21st century, you expect this to be a clean night with u sleeping on the bed and him on the floor? if he asks you to go back to his place , HIGH CHANCES he just want your body. Again , who is at the losing end? make a guess :)
Unspoken Playboy Moves - Fuck,Throw,Repeat . Come on girls, youre not that DUMB!
5. Engaging in unprotected sexual activities. This is a no brainer. Here's the ugly truth , there are MANY boys/men in your school who visited red light districts *prostitutes* and mind you , some of them may look like the average nerd or the ridiculously good looking guy beside your table. this is awfully true as i have heard and personally knew people who had sexual history with prostitutes and yet their girlfriends have no knowledge of it at all! Poor girls!
it could be anyone, does't matter if its students in NUS or NTU or even SIM. so please play safe and use a CONDOM if you really really really really want to do it. Most of them commonly break their "virgin experience" during their national service period . so unless you want some of the disease in your body.. please talk about it with your partner first about the sexual history if necessary. Communication is the key to a healthy relationship ! 
6. He broke up with you and you feel like you have to distress and get rid of sadness.. you go clubbing and drinking sessions hoping to make yourself feel better.. feel cheap. NO! how are you going to explain to your future boyfriend/husbands your actions? if he broke up with you , its his loss for losing a great girlfriend! whats your loss? NOTHING! you stand to gain because you got yourself another chance at finding that great guy u always wanted! you should be celebrating with a good dinner with your girlfriends instead of going to the MEAT MARKET. (CLUBBING AKA MEAT MARKET). its more fresh than your local grocery stores where guys would go there to grope girls who dress sexy for free. Yummy :) FREE AND EASY, WHERE TO GET THIS KIND OF GOOD DEAL?
And if you hoping to get his attention by going heavy clubbing (your exbf) , you watched too much korean dramas. Hes enjoying his time with his new girl and care nothing about you. who is to lose? :)
2 type of girls - Smart (do things with thinking , self love) / Stupid ( do things without rational thinking , like to make herself look cheap.. which are you ?

Guys-  Dating and wooing
1. Know when to give up - If the girl you like does't like you and no matter how hard you try to impress her and she isnt.. give up and go to the next.
2. Girls love having people giving her attention (makes her feel wanted ) - dont get this in a wrong way. if subconsciously, you knew she already rejected you countless time,aka no to your invitation and always busy , but still maintaining daily contact through texts..asking you to entertain her. Dude your not getting anywhere, the only place your going is into the TEXT BUDDY ZONE and guess who becomes her lover in the end ? not you ! unless you got will of steel to keep this up for a few more years
3. Get some balls and make the first move. Please , you will not exist here reading my post if your father is like you sitting around and expect a girl to drop out of the sky into his arms. Be like your old man and get some confidence! what you will get if you get rejected? a temporary pain.
what will you get if you dont try? a lifetime of regret !
go think about it , pfff
4. Dont be desperate, girls can sense your desperation from miles away. so try but dont TRY HARD. dont act like jerk or smarty pants to impress her, you will probably turn her off.. 

thats all , if you have any questions ,ask in the comments

i asked my crush out on valentines day. she claims that she is busy so now we are meeting this friday. talk about priorities... 
-
 
Pardon me if this is weird, but I'm feeling awful because one of my old teammates is following all other teammates on insta but me :( The fact that she doesn't like me is not my problem. The problem is I feel so unlikeable and I hate myself for being affected by such a petty thing
-
 
to , i.e. the guy/girl who said "a guy who truly love you wouldnt hold your hand and make out with you on the first- two meetup"... wtf don't cock block leh. hahaha. btw, must be fun living in a square box huh

in all seriousness though, this is not a complete measure of "love". some people just tend to be a bit more passionate than others ;)

He was the first person I ever liked and he turned out to be a total f*boy

I liked him because he was such a witty soul. So, it started out with texting and all. We started talking late into the nights and hung out a few times. There were days he would put food outside my door or paste random little post sticks on my table when I am in class. 

So I thought maybe I should wait out for your next move, however, I found out from other people that he texts a lot of girls and does the same to them. Right now, he's attached when all these were happening just about longer than a month ago.

So yep, now I am a wreck and how do I even move on from liking someone that much.

@  

You have 2 choices: 

1) confess to him, risk the friendship. He either accepts you or rejects you. Either way you get closure. 

2) keep your feelings and live forever with the regret of "what if i told him.." 

I chose the former and no doubt, it jeopardized the friendship a little. But at least, i was true to my feelings and made a move to try. Nobody can tell you whether to confess or not, it all boils down to weighing your options and deciding what matters the most to you: The friendship, or the "what ifs". 

Anything can happen. Stay strong! Fate is a rather peculiar thing. 
If its meant to be, you can not confess and you will end up with him. 
If its not meant to be, it does not matter how many times you confess or how much effort and feelings you put in to appear 'desirable'.. It just simply will not work out.

Met this person during this elective mod I took last semester. Didn't really have the chance to talk to him but somehow I managed to add him on Facebook, which made me super happy. However, although I really have a massive interest in him and want to get to know him better, I can never summon the courage to speak to him as we are both male and he doesn't look gay at all. In the end, I did what has to be done as nothing will ever happen and that is to remove him as a friend. Deep inside me, if there's a chance, I would really wish to know him better and understand him more.

oh please stop being selfish. If you're "introverted" and dont like doing what your peers do for socialising, then you can hardly blame them when they dont get you. This is reality. Yes you may be a deep and charming and whatever, but if nobody knows you, nobody is going to care. 

You cant expect people to want to get to know you when you're so "boring" what.

We are in love with each other. But there is much conflict occurring on a frequent basis. I have cried more in these past 9 months of the relationship than I have in my entire life. In fact, we quarrel almost every week. Before we started, I was an optimistic and driven person, and mood swings were hardly present. I still am a driven person but I am no longer my past cheerful self. 

To sum it up, we have very different interests, very different values, and very different goals in life. It might have been better if we have a little more similarity in any of the one aspects. We have tried communicating extensively but we still cannot find a middle ground in all three aspects... On his side, he always wants to hold on to this relationship. For me, I cannot imagine how this relationship will ever work in the long term. Yet it hurts too much for me to say "It's over". If anyone has any advice, please share.

Mom: honey how are you doing today??
me: uhh fine. got lots of assignments though so kinda stress
mom: oh honey I know it's hard
me: nah I can handle it. Thanks
mom: you can tell me
me: uhhhh?? what?
mom: It's VALENTINES DAY. you must miss him. All those memories. All the time you spent together. All those valentines days together. And this year you're alone. 
me: ohhhh. erm. Mom remember I did the breaking up? I'm happy I'm not spending Vday with him. 
mom: i know but i miss him....

Sometimes I think my mom isn't over my ex.

There's a guy I like, I want to confess though I am definitely sure that he doesn't like me that way. our conversations are quite one sided in text, with me trying to find a topic and hoping he replies. He says he doesn't like small talk. should I even try to confess? I'm starting to get along with his friends, so it's quite likely we would be doing projects together in the coming semesters. it would be awkward if he rejects me...  maybe just give up?

As an asexual and aromantic girl I laugh at all those sad singles during V-day. But then for the rest of the year... ;_;

What is valentine when you can open a can of coke, eat bak kwa, lie down on the sofa and watch tv? As an evergreen, no doubt I want to be in a relationship. But after a week of work and activities, all I want to do is to be in my own world.

X is a student from another local uni. People usually see X as a driven, smart, rational, and hardworking student. But what they do not know is this. 

X is in a relationship with a guy over a decade older than her. It happened by chance. As he is her very first boyfriend, she fell madly in love with him. However, this guy is mentally unstable and he has admitted this. Although X loves him a lot, X is also very, very tired of the emotional drama.

Ready for the plot twist? He has a PhD.

So i need some opinions about my situation now:

I have been talking to this guy everyday for awhile. He messages me good morning texts, asks me how's my day and what I am doing etc. However, he hasn't made any move to ask me out, and the mixed signals are making me very confused? So is he interested or not? I'm afraid he may just be a very friendly guy and I am thinking too much into things.

Which makes me a little annoyed cos guys, if you are not interested, why do you have to send such texts and lead the girls on? I mean, do guys tell their problems to every girl they meet? cos this guy does tell me his problems and I am starting to like him a little. For those who would say, why don't you make the move then? Well, its because I don't know what he is thinking and I am afraid to jeopardize this friendship because I know how awkward it can get later on.

There is this guy whom got close to my girlfriend because his girlfriend is overseas for SEP for a year. I hate how close they are getting but i don't want to seem as being unreasonable about it. but i really hope he would just back off and leave her alone. what should i do? My gf thinks that there is nothing wrong with what she's doing and she's not cheating on me too but I just can't help but to feel really annoyed. Advice please!

I know I'm a bastard, but...I've managed to secure 2 dates for V-day. One will be a potential girlfriend. But I'm not sure which one to choose, and which one to reject. Hence I decided to crowdsource my dilemma:

Shall I go for the girl with:

a) hot and sexy i.e. C-cup boobs, great curves; or
b) not so hot and sexy, but very loving and kind?

Honestly, I'm fed up with the bunch of friends and whispherers who keeps posting stuff about how no one understands what an extroverted introvert is.

Pleeease. You're just being a normal person. It's entirely Normal for a person to feel tired after talking with people for an hour at a party. You don't possess introverted superpowers like being able to stay at home doing work/hobby for an entire month without needing to talk to another person to relieve stress.

And if you find it strange why other people can continue talking for hours. It's more likely because their sucking their thumbs and putting up with you, and not going around facebook complaining about how tired they're actually feeling.

Either you tell us face to face that you're feeling tired during our gatherings, or you jolly well put up with it. We had already allocated time to meet up with you, so how do you think we feel when we get home and see you complaining about it on facebook?

does height really matter for a guy in finding a partner? i know i am short, standing at around 165 to 170 range but this is really affecting me too much. can girls please share your thoughts?

I really hate socialising. And there are a few reasons how I've come to this.
In JC, I was pretty much known by everyone in school. Not trying to show off or anything here; I was involved in a lot of "unofficial" cca's, projects, and events so I was able to maintain a very close relationship with all of my classmates. I led a social project with 20++ members, all of whom I personally convinced and inspired. I wasn't the fun-popular type, but people came to me and told me their deep secrets and worries. I was good at listening, and people needed that, as they were facing exams and stressful mugging nights.
But after those years, I realised that nothing was left for me. When I socialised in the past, I would never look at the benefits; people seemed happy when I listened to them, sympathised with them, gave advice, and crack a few jokes along the way. And I enjoyed making them happy. Before coming to uni, all I realised was that there was no time left for me. I knew nothing about myself and didn't even have enough self-esteem. I was skilled at earning trust, and I was partially doing this by bringing myself down.
So when I came to uni at last, I started dreading those socialising sessions. It's not that I don't have any friends; I still have a number of people I can really trust, and I feel proud of myself for already having formed those relationships after only one semester of uni life. But I hate it when we have to stand up, 'network', and talk about superficial matters. I'm tired of asking people how their mods this sem are. I've already asked the question, "how was your break?" too many times. I really don't get the importance of those networking, socialising sessions. People say you should know as many people as possible because they can potentially help you in the future, but that feels too fake. So now I have a tendency of drawing a line between those I consider as deep relationships and those I don't.
So this sem, I've started to do a lot of things alone. I would meet my close friends everyday for a few hours, and Skype with those who are abroad for another hour or so, but I leave all the rest to myself. Excluding the time I spend talking to people during classes, since I have some great classmates this sem. And I've started to enjoy that. I love walking to classes alone and watching people on the way, paying attention to the weather and thinking about how I'm going to spend the day. I love spending some time everyday to read and do some extra studying for my major (by the way, I'm kind of in love with my major right now, which is also another reason I've come to like playing solo). I love thinking to myself, and I don't see a reason to share it verbally all the time. And when I would have hard times, or when my like-minded friends have problems, I would listen to them or talk to them for long hours. But I would spend all those 'petty' and in-between hours alone.
But I think the social stigma on solo-play is kind of a big pressure for me. I really love my life; I love the balance, and I've never felt lonely, living a life like this. (In the past, when I would socialise with everyone and have NO time to myself, then I would feel truly lonely.) I have the best friends in my life right now, and I simply cannot describe how close I feel to them. However, the way other people see me is very difficult to handle. They see me as a unsociable, shy person, which is in fact a personality created by choice. I wish I had the nerve to ignore all these judgemental views, but I can't mainly because I'm surrounded by a lot of people who care significantly about their sociability. How can I endure this? Am I living my life the right way? If I'm happy and satisfied, isn't that all that's important?

Somehow I feel relieved and slightly happier (as sadistic as that sounds) when I see posts about how people are feeling lonely or not having much friends. Im actually now convinced that there are lonely people in nus, and im not the only lonely soul here. Seeing everyone in groups makes me feel really sian that I just want to escape to somewhere quieter sometimes. 
Being an introvert, I find it hard to sustain my friendships. People come, people go; just friends for the season. It’s quite sad, looking back at the past and realise a lot of the people you once interacted more with have all moved on. Funny enough, most of my remaining (few) friends are extroverts and have their own bigger groups of friends. It has come to the point where I don’t feel like meeting anymore new people and form a bond with them, cuz I know it is just going to be a passing memory. It doesn’t help with my low self esteem - that im not good enough, not humorous enough, not fun enough for people to want me in their lives. 
Im so lonely, but somehow ive learnt to embrace the silence. I’m getting by.

I go for paid massage and other... "intimate" services once in a while to fulfill my urges, is it really so wrong to do so? I can't be the only one... right?

 I having the opposite problem. People been deleting me from Facebook and social excluding me. If this goes on, I will be mentally ill and might turn violent

, Me too :( Especially when my friends are all very pretty, I don't even want to look in the mirror for 1 sec. My bf also thinks I'm not pretty . A bit self-conscious when I'm out with him/friends, but I'm good when I'm alone ;D
-
 
I am with my girlfriend for around a year now. Sometimes I wonder if she is really happy being with me. She claims to be happy with me, but I feel that another guy in my group seems to be more suited for her, in terms of personality and interests. She is also interested in talking to him, and appears very happy talking to him too. Am I reading too much into it, or is she looking at an alternative?
-
 
I think i am an overly paranoid guy. I worry a lot about what others think of me especially those whom i don't know well. Like after talking to him/her over a short conversation i always keep thinking did i say anything wrong? did i say anything which would make him think i'm weird? etc etc. Also, on whatsapp when i'm texting the girl i sort of like, i would constantly be fretting about whether i said anything rude or that would piss her off if she takes a while to reply, especially if she blue ticks my messages. I can't help how i feel cos that's just the way i am but i desperately want to just be free of all these negative and paranoid thoughts. Any advice?

Dear guys who are looking to ask girls out for V day.. Do try not to be wishy washy about it. I've had guys hinting and asking in a teasing manner/ asking to meet and not following up.. It is not that I am being fussy, but sincerity will go a long way.. =)
-
 
I genuinely feel that I am ugly. I won't even look at myself in the mirror in the toilet. I would look down and wash my hands and get out ASAP. No matter how some of my friends said I am cute I still feel that I am ugly. I don't think I have self-esteem issue because I would think I am quite confident and can hold conversation with other people. 

Anyone else has this problem?

Every CNY is emo-sessions for me for the past several years. I always barely say anything. My parents, aunts and uncles are getting older, and don't look healthy. Yeah, even on normal days I don't say anything, don't do anything...yet I'm afraid that they will go suddenly without me saying anything to them..I am a very big dumbass.

Did you ever just come to this sudden realisation that your friendship is pretty much pointless? That you were just used all this while and nothing was ever reciprocated. Not that every favour had to be returned.But it would have felt good to be appreciated once in a while... I just woke up one day, having absolute no desire to sustain this friendship. I was always there for them but they were never there for me. My passive aggressive nature didn't quite aid me in this situation either. I never knew how to tell them how I felt. I was so afraid of coming off as sensitive and weak. Hence it resulted in continuous ignoring on my part. Ignoring calls, texts, SM notifications until they finally gave up. Oh and did I mention that these texts and calls were them requiring some sort of 'assistance' from me? To make things worse, I haven't made friends in Uni either. It took me quite a while to recover. I still have no friends. Zero friends to be exact. I was lonely for a while. But now I'm just alone. There's a huge difference! Being lonely gave me a chance to embrace solitude, which is being alone. It's a chance for you to examine who you really are. A chance for you to work on yourself. Feeding off other people's energy most of the time leaves you with so little time to reflect on your wants. I'm not telling everyone to cut off ties nor am I saying there's anything wrong with being an extrovert! Nothing wrong with socialising either. If you have great friends, treasure them! And if you need people around you most of the time, that's completely fine too! I know it doesn't relate to my situation, but it really upsets me to see those 'I'm so lonely posts', especially when V day is nearing. Take this time to work on yourself. Learn from past relationships and embrace this time you have for yourself! As cliché as it sounds, you do need to love yourself before you want to love someone else. And these posts just show that you don't. Stop dwelling in self pity. It got me no where. It hurts but you have to move on. Good luck! There's nothing wrong with being alone!

Been using tinder for a few weeks now and I have this conundrum. Currently I'm chatting with two girls whom I feel have potential, like the chemistry is good and the vibes are good. Girl A has a very similar personality as myself, while Girl B has a different personality but we share so many common interests that it's really uncanny. I'm probably thinking too far ahead, but if there came I a time I had to choose one to date exclusively, which girl would be the better choice? I know it's unfair to label one as "better", but I can't think of a more appropriate word. Just looking for some friendly opinions here :)

PS. Assuming the signals from both were positive and I did eventually choose one, is it bad that I have to let one down? As though I led her on. Because I'd feel bad about that.
-
 
 Because there is a difference between outright rejection versus not giving a definite answer? Don't some girls sometimes do this too? Instead of outright rejection, she may say that she wants to know the guy more first. From what you're saying it seems to me that the guy wants to date w/o having given you a definite answer and w/o wanting to enter a r/s with you proper. I think it depends on the guy (as different persons have different mindsets when it comes to dating and entering a r/s) and you need to question his motive. Here are some possible reasons I can come up with: he thinks that he doesn't have feelings for you or is unsure of them at the moment, yet sees you as a potential partner; he isn't ready for a r/s due to psychological or whatever other reasons; he wants to lead you on; he doesn't mind dating anyone or getting to know someone more as the opposite party might eventually be his future partner; he is looking for benefits while wanting to avoid responsibilities and commitments (as in a r/s).

Here's what I would do if I were you. First, I would get a clear answer and explanation (w/o misunderstandings) of 1. how he really feels for you right now and 2. why does he want to date you, followed by asking myself if I can trust his answer. Finally, I will think if I really should date him given my own mindset and what I think I know to be true thus far.

Seeing all these posts about Valentine's day, crushes and relationships make me sad. I have never had a crush on anyone but I do feel a momentary attraction if someone does an exceptionally kind thing or knows about eccentric things. I am pretty certain no one has ever had a crush on me either. Sometimes, I fear that the status quo will be the same forever and I will never love romantically. :(
-
 
Hi guys! My boyfriend and I are each other's first love. However, i have slept with 2 other guys before (my dates, i was young and foolish) whereas he has not. We love each other very much but i worry that he will be curious to "try out" what it feels like with other girls etc. Any advice on this??
-
 
Luckily Valentine's Day is on a Sunday this year, lower chance of feeling sad from seeing all the happy couples.

I don't like friends who rant on others. Just because you are angry, doesn't mean that you can just say mean things. Who knows you were angry? Who knows you would be insulted by what we said? If you are really pissed, keep quiet. Because we are not the ones that made you angry. 
-
 
Is there such a thing as not loving someone romantically, but still wanting to put in effort to ensure that he/she is happy, kinda like a guardian angel?

Well, I feel like I have such a guardian angel (& yep I like this person romantically & this person knows though doesn't reciprocate), yet I don't know if whatever this person does is just what normal friends do... 

This person is really very nice to me. I just want to say, thank you for everything. During the important/tough times in my life, you were always there. Thank you for appearing whenever I ask. Thank you for being such a nice companion. 

Though I know this will not last forever, but thank you for still protecting my heart for now, whether you mean to or not. 
-
 
 What?!? Is it because guys like the challenge and would see the female as more precious/valuable? Are these claims even justified? Even if that is true, what if the guy is a serious weirdo like myself and is an anomaly?

I think not wanting him back only makes him reflect. Same for girls likewise. I think there needs to be at least some minimal interaction yet not total interaction to get him attracted (if he can even be attracted to you) but at the same time not let him be too comfortable to stop reflecting or take you for granted. For instance, sitting in front of him and turning to show him your side profile etc. If there's not even any interaction i.e. doesn't even see you in person, doesn't chat and if he's too engaged in his commitments, I think he's a goner over time. :'(

I kinda love how in Singapore, Chinese New Year is always before Valentine's Day. Because if it weren't, people will be starting to talk about V-day way before and through this festive period! Being a 25 years old forever single guy, could you imagine the horror if that were to happen? Your mood will be sour for more than 2 weeks! Your eyes will probably roll out of their sockets after seeing so many couples being all disgustingly lovey-dovey up until the dreaded V-day, and will probably puke out a couple of buckets more from all the additional disgusting energy you will feel without the CNY buffer.

Chinese New Year: The saviour of the mental stability and health of lonely men and women ever since the birth of Mother China

My birthday is around the corner!
For me, I just want my birthday to be meaningful! I rather have letters & cards packed full of words dedicated to me than an LV bag... Haha.

Also, I would love to spend time with people I really care about... (And whether they feel the same is another matter). Yet, I feel that if it becomes a burden to them & they are doing it out of obligation & guilt... I rather not impose it on them (though I will be sad of course). Anyone feels the same?

Can anyone teach me how to woo a girl that I barely know? 

A little background: I see her about once a week or fortnight during cca, but during and after I got no chance to talk to her and get to know her much. I haven't talked to her before because I am quite shy and introverted, but she seems to be a shy girl also, doesn't really talk much or interact much with people, similar to me. She seems happy when she talks to someone she knows well however. Sometimes she will glance at me, and will avert her gaze when I catch her doing so. Does this mean anything?

I am a dating newbie here never dated before. Tried to ask out and chase a friend of mine before but got shot down and burnt quite badly. So I am kinda having very low confidence around girls now :(

Any advice will be welcome

I've been with my boyfriend for less than a year so this is going to be our first valentines day together. I was hoping that he will bring me out on a special date on vday but he told me he doesnt see why vday should be special :( he does bring me out quite often and he treats me well but i do want vday to be special. i tried to tell him i like the idea of vday but now i scared i sound like a silly girl in love so i stopped hinting to him that i want to do something special with him this year. Am i too silly or is he too realistic and practical?

I have friends who lost their home, have abusive parents or even lost their parents. Heck, I've known someone who witnessed her own dad murdering her own mom.

Bottom line: stop your self-pity with your first world problems. Go do some CIP and be thankful at how fortunate you are.

Hi, I just saw a post about dialects and noticed that quite a few people responded positively to a dialect. I was thus wondering if perhaps we could set up an interest group to promote dialect learning and dialect sharing or sth along those lines. Anyone interested?

Is it bad to be a bit of a patriot?

I keep saying that even if this country didn't conscript, I would have volunteered to enlist anyway. Having gone in, served my 2 years and gone out, my feeling hasn't changed, for what it is worth. I do feel bad, however, that SNAFU truly applies to the armed forces, and that it feels as if we who served were superfluous and forgotten. For better or for worse, for the chiong suas and kengsters, serving felt like something to be proud of, and it tears me up inside to see it, and the people above, below or alongside, for what all of it really is.

I'm curious to see how our country would fare in a hot war, and maybe feel a bit the hero doing my part. However wrong it truly is, for there is no denying that war is hell both tragic and farcical.

Part of me resents this country and the service for the way I felt from it, but I still take pride for being the boot on the ground, that I could stand up and be counted. Why didn't I sign on? But why would I? I can't answer this to myself rightly, the pride mixes with the cynicism.

I love this country, and I feel bad that doing my time didn't feel as good as I hoped, as I thought it could.

I don't want to be a forgotten serviceman

hey. it was never you. Sorry. i was talking about breaking up with my best friend, and i guess you got caught up thinking it was you. my friends are helping me through it, and i'm stronger now. i'm working hard at what i do too, and it's cathartic. even though you always troll me for it. she's cute i guess, just like a kid. gfi man. and say hi next time? promise i will be nice. posting this here because i don't have your current number. 

Admin, be a dear and post this please. thank you

I had always believed in love (or at least attraction) at first sight. But after meeting you, it seems like feelings do change... And it kills me a little everyday that we're not talking.

Why no girl in engin eva approach me:(?? I am probably a wallflower and I don't even think any girl from my course notices me. The irony is that my females friends from other faculty would tell me that I am cute and would sometime flirt with me. Is it just that engin girls are more conservative? It does not help that my personality seems cold and would always disappear after lectures. 

Engineering really make guys feel unwanted. And if you are introverted say GG to your non existence dating life. Im already prepared to buy a blow up doll to spend my life with.

You know when you're dating someone and you know you're on the verge on being ghosted, but that person still message you once in a while? Omg just stop texting me altogether and let me heal my broken ghosted soul, you asshole! Or at least tell me that you're not interested anymore and are dating someone else.  Have some respect for people! I really hate people who ghost >:(

Recollection:

While dining at the UTown dining hall today, I met a 'marvellous' girl by the name of Y. I know her and now have escapades with her in the east, but I didn't realise Y now lives in the residential college.

Here's the story.

I liked Y when Y was still attached to another guy, who we can call D. As far I know Y, she was a dominatrix and was overpowering D. I used to allow D to confide in me over Y. D would say that, for all of his skills, he could find no way to satisfy Y. So I tried to teach him a few tricks, but deep down, I was curious about Y.

Fast-forward to the day of fun: we had cider. Then we had some wine. And then she was saying that I was weak. I then challenged her to whisky. She accepted. I demanded she drink first. Y then promptly enslaved her life to me. Poor her. She was begging me literally to take her home, which I did, and accompanied her for the night. She was ridiculously hard to resist and I thought D was so damn lucky; she was smart, witty and had the sexual drive and attraction to turn any guy on and mad.

One day, Y suddenly confided in me with regards to D. She asked me whether D was completely committed to her. Confused (pretentiously), I asked, how so. She then spilled all about her "needs", and the more she said, the more I was shocked. Shocked because she was really like a guy more than a girl: having sexual needs that needed to be gratified, and that D just won't cut it.

Then she suddenly asked... P, should I break with D? In return, I know you actually like me very much.

Skipping all the details, according to her, I gave her the best night possible, but now that I glance at her, I am myself sometimes afraid. Each time we see each other for dinners, it almost always ends up in me staying overnight at her house without D knowing.

A few weeks ago, I heard Y and D having the most serious argument in a while. The problem? D confided in me again, that Y said that thrice a week was insufficient. D contended that his FYP meant that he couldn't meet Y as often as he would like, but Y would have nothing of that. I was conflicted because I was already involved should Y and D break up. Yet I like Y, and we have already got sexual.

Admittedly I am afraid myself, meeting her twice a week is already beginning to be slightly taxing even though she is still quite a desirable girl, except her almost insatiable desire for something normally men would want more.

I didn't say hi to her for fear that I'd spend a night in the residential college when I could have been studying. You see, I don't always have condoms with me.

With all these confessions about guys texting patterns, what do you make of a guy who reply you once (or on really rare occassion... at most 3 times) a day? He is not cutting the conversation but just becoming less frequent. I know he is not interested in me but we don't meet so why are we still chatting on a daily basis? 
-
 
Saw a recent post from about how guys text. What if the guy replies immediately once he sees the message (e.g blue ticks), and engages actively on conversing (e.g not one word replies). Yet whenever he says he will talk later (cos working,busy etc),  he doesn't start the conversation again. The initiating of conversation is pretty equal between us but I dont know if I should start the conversation again since he was the one who said he will talk to me after and ended the conversation. I'm scared he isn't interested and im just bothering him
-
 
I'm not sure if this is a girl school thing but how do you express yourself to a guy that you are interested in him/like him more than a friend? I can talk perfectly fine to guys I see as friends but when I like someone I just get sooo shy in front of him I don't even talk to him/ acknowldge his presence first. He will think I'm giving him the cold shoulder right? What should I do?
-
 
This buddy of mine brings his new girlfriend everywhere he goes, and at our last gathering, it was pretty obvious she was a little overwhelmed by all the unfamiliar faces.

I don't get it, do dudes usually do this just to show off their girlfriends to all their buddies? Like a trophy? Am I doing it wrong by not fusing myself with my girlfriend and sticking to her 24/7?

So I've seen a lot of people confessing that they do not know what a guy is thinking through their texting habits. Firstly, if you think he isn't interested then you're most probably right. If a guy likes a girl, he would go that extra mile to reply her messages as soon as he can and he will not do funny things like reading your message and then go offline before replying you much later. And as for the initiating conversation part, if it's you who's always initiating the conversation, he doesn't like you. Simple as. I mean he could like you if he tries to keep the conversation going. But if he keeps wanting to end the conversation by giving you shitty replies, then you should probably stop bothering him and move on with life. I know it's hard to accept that someone you adore so much doesn't like you back, but this is the cold hard truth. You should move on to better things in life that are worthy of your time.

Note to self: (and maybe other girls who are going through break ups)
I promise you I will stop blaming myself. I promise you I will start getting my shit together. I promise you I will stop stalking my ex's life and start living my own. I promise you I will be better than I ever be. Not because of anybody else but because I am going to start taking care of myself.

Hi everyone I'm in need of some advice. I've been texting this guy I really like, and I'm always the one who initiates the conversation. He replies but never tries to continue the conversation by asking questions or sound interested. And also, he will read my message and not reply sometimes until I text him again. Does this mean he is not interested in me or is he just a bad texter?

Advice to those trying to enter a relationship:
1) Don't give up, keep trying
2) Romance does not drop from the sky; it takes effort

Trust me, I failed several times before I got into a good and stable relationship now. I did embarrassing things, like confessions on V-Day. I experienced lots of awkward moments pursuing girls. I cried after rejections, feeling lonely, miserable and depressed. But I emerged stronger, more resilient and more confident. Most importantly, remember that your crushes / people who rejected you are also human. If they reject you, it's NOT about you. They might have different priorities or needs, and not because they don't exactly like you or even dislike you. And don't overly romanticize them (or hate those who rejected you too much). Always pick yourself up, and tell yourself that at least you have fallen in love before, and have tried.

need some advice here pls ): 

I have a crush on this guy and although there should be chances of seeing him, I haven't been seeing him at all probably due to timetable clash.. Even on whatsapp when I try to start a convo with him he can come online but just don't reply my message like grey ticking it >< there is no convo at all even though I'm just trying to talk to him as a friend! I don't feel like whatsapping him anymore as it will be despo.. is that a sign that he isn't interested in me at all??? What should I do to get closer to him? I can talk to him when I see him at least for a while but now that I don't see him I felt disappointed ): howhow 

-lost evergreen girl here ><

People say that time heal wounds. Even you said that and believed it yourself. But I could not; its just me bearing the pain and getting used to it. Getting used to looking only at the pictures we had, going through the memories time and again. I tried putting you down, deleting the photos, forgetting you but I can't. It was a lost battle. I had to have our photos in my phone so whenever I felt alone and depressed I could see your face. I tried not to interfere with your new life over there but I needed your advice and words. I could not bear not talking to you in less than a month. I was deprived of such care and words but you came and you gave me what I needed. But now it seems like you moved on to care for another person and you forgot who you left behind. 

You asked if I am religious. No, because no gods can explain to me why they make fun and deprive me of what was rightfully mine. No, don't give me the bullshit that its a test for my love for any god or it was a path to make me grow. I have seen people who are born with a silver spoon, with love and care both of us were deprived of. They are matured in their thinking too. If I need a god, that is you, whom have provided so much in my life during those times. But since you turned away, I do not have a reason to believe in any religion anymore.

To guys out there, if your girlfriend asks you to change a bad habit of yours such as smoking, playing games, etc. will you consider it? 
Given she is logical and rational and level headed in her approach will you guys appreciate her thought and give it a go? 

I mean, I know sometimes when you're in a relationship you're meant to be accepting and try to tolerate their shortcomings but sometimes when you are witnessing your other half wasting his life away we gotta do something!!! 
Just wanted to know what you guys think??? 

(~~~~||||~~~~)

Anyone knows how to date an evergreen girl? I mean she's obviously new to this dating stuff and i don't know if she would be uncomfortable going out with another guy and stuff like that. Also, are there any signs that I should look out for as to whether she's looking for a relationship? Or perhaps she wants to be single by choice?
-
 
I'm an exchange student. I like this girl, who is a full time student here. If I was here full time also I would love the opportunity to date her. But alas the situation is shit because I'm leaving end of this sem. Just sad to have found someone like her and know that it will never be. 
-
 
I wonder.
I wonder if I can sustain in solitude.
I wonder if others can fill the gaps within me.
I wonder if even if others can fill the gaps within me, if such occurrence will ever occur to me.
I wonder if I can survive in this cold and harsh world alone, being the idiot I already am.
I wonder if I should still be wondering on what I had previously wondered upon.
I wonder why you are still wondering.
-
 
Admin, I hope you don't filter this out.

Anyway, I can't go into much details if not it would pretty much reveal.

Well, there's this thing bothering me for some time and more so, this week. Between me and this guy, we have interest for another but no, we didn't get together. At least not now. The thing is, his ex lingers ard me alot. Like we have mutual friends etc. And I have seen her once. But she doesn't know me, obviously. It bothers me because, I think she is a seemingly more sociable and likeable person than me(stalked) and I know their rshp was quite a "big thing". 

Sorry, just need to rant. Is it to feel bothered if you keep seeing(social med or literally) for your potential bf's ex?
-
 
To , 

No you won't be set free from your so-called shackles. You'll be guilty for life for making a girl end her own life. Please bring her to see a counsellor for her own sake or at least have the damn courtesy to initiate a proper breakup and set the poor girl free, because she clearly don't deserve an asshole like you. 
-
 
I hope this doesn't sound mean or anything, just some personal thoughts.

I honestly want to get into a relationship. I mean I have dated and they didn't work out. I know I am definitely slightly above average looking and sometimes (this is where I hope I am not crossing the line) I wonder how some people with really bad personalities or "not as socially deemed" good looking can get attach.

I guess I am still an evergreen and I am so tired of waiting for the "right" guy to come along... Any advice or consolation or anything of that sort?
-
 
I notice lots of confessions about sex.

I understand the conflict.

But what if the conflict within me is simply the question of me just "wanting to be a good person" and trying to dispel the evilness from within my heart?

Regarding NUS bus drivers. I know that they aren't the happiest bunch of people. But are they allowed to tell students to be quiet?

We weren't being particularly noisy, normal chatting noise level I guess. Furthermore this is a school bus right? When he signed up for the job, don't tell me he expected silence?

Just to elaborate. There wasn't any incident that justified the need for silence at that time, nor were there any mitigating factors for consideration.

I met my gf during orientation, and we got together later. However I also like another girl from my major. I think she also has positive feelings towards me. I wonder if it's possible to have the best of both worlds. Would girls accept this arrangement?
-
 
Would like some advice on the situation.
So I've been going out with this guy for a few times these two months. I've started to really like him and thought that we may become something more. However, recently I saw him out with another girl. He definitely saw me but just ignored me and quickly walked away with the girl, not holding hands or anything. I don't want to ask who that girl is because I don't want to sound so clingy or possessive, and I do understand that he has the right to see other people since we're not anything anyway. But the mixed signals are really getting to me. Can any guys shed some light about this? I have a feeling that I'm being played or am the "other woman" though. And yet he still texts me good morning and whatnot. If this is true, I need someone with an accurate perspective to tell me so that I know it's not all in my head.

Im a muslim student in a research group that tends to have group lunches for special occasions. As we all know, having a muslim in the group means you'll have to go to somewhere halal. Since im the first muslim the group has (at least since a long time), naturally, they've never considered this. Now that I'm a part of them, i feel guilty of having them to search for a halal restaurant every time we're planning for a group lunch. I also have trouble rejecting such lunch invitations cos... well, i don't think it's very nice... As an introvert, I have absolutely no problems with not being included for such gatherings. In fact, i will feel better if they're free to actually choose whichever restaurant they please. Yet, everyone's always so nice that it doesn't feel right...

I have a handful of close friends who are participating actively in a cca and are working as part time tuition teacher at the same time. I am already in a cca, but not exactly active, meaning not vying for leadership roles or things like that. Just a really normal member. Personally I don't think I can manage my time well enough to juggle responsibilities a leader would have to carry and commitments to be made if I were to work. I want a change in my lifestyle. Should I spend more time on cca or spend time gathering more work experience? Or is it just me who can't handle study, work and cca all together.

we used to be pretty close platonic friends, in fact you were the first person i felt comfortable sharing a few deeply personal issues with. meetups were exciting. a few years later you found a boyfriend and i was very happy for you. well i thought we could stay good friends.

not exactly sure what happened in the following months. i might have said something that offended you, or maybe it is just a harmless cause of desiring to spend more time with the love of your life, or maybe you're inundated with work. your replies to me were increasingly nonchalant, and you'd take full days to get back to me. we used to share common interests, but those interests don't seem to affect you anymore.

nonetheless you still have other interests which give meaning to your life even till now. so i'm genuinely still very happy to see you enjoying life with all these hobbies and with your significant other. honestly though, i am starting to feel irrelevant to your life, though you are still very much relevant to my life.

the signs that everything said above is legit have been pretty consistent. i promise that upon clicking "submit" i will, as the friend i've always been, give you the space to be yourself and be happy with life. i will not bug you with what used to be our common interests anymore, neither will i initiate a conversation unless necessary, but please let me know if you need anything because i'll oblige anytime! finally do not worry about me at all, because i have many things to look forward to in life as well. there ain't no time for me to submerge in a cesspool of loneliness.

Do guys find a girl A (who is always alone for classes, lunch) less attractive than girl B (who is always with her clique), say their looks are both above average?

Or find girl A, who is slightly above average, to be less attractive than average girl B just because she is always alone?
-
 
somehow i  starting to feel myself dying slowly on the inside. i've been through too many hurtful experiences regarding friendship (i don't even know if the problem lies in me or what) and that has made me lose faith in people in general and somehow now i feel less and less wanting to make friends or maintain friendships with people because i just don't want to get hurt anymore. occasionally i see people on snapchat having fun with their friends while i'm just at home with no one to jio/no one to talk to and i do sometimes feel lonely. worse is that i already know the rhetorics to this problem, which are things like talk to more people have less distrust in people share with more people but the problem is like i felt like i've given up on those solutions too? day in and day out i feel like i've been reduced to just machines to carry out daily mundane tasks or to get something done and i feel like there's isnt much meaning to life (not suicidal but just feeling like life no longer has anything exciting to look forward to anymore)

sorry just had to rant.

How open are you to being introduced by friends who has friends who are interested in you? Personally it makes me uncomfy as i prefer to approach or "hunt" on targets i like rather than being introduced to people who are interested in me but dunno me... i m too old fashioned i guess...
-
 
What do you do when the one person you want to talk to is ignoring you? You browse NUSWhispers for hours on end hoping that just maybe you'll read something from them. 
-
 
I used to read NUSWhispers quite regularly, but not anymore. This is largely due to a handful of frequent commentators whom I've realized to be extremely toxic. Toxic in the sense of "toxic friends that everyone advises you to cut out of your life".

A common trait among these commentators is how they like to show off. Be it their assumed-to-be-correct liberal views against a conservative, their apparent abundance of sexual experience against a first-timer, their presumed intellectual prowess against a slightly dull student, or their self-proclaimed Very Successful Life against a struggling soul, without fail, their comments will appear to be giving advice, but between the lines subtly belittling the OP while stroking their own ego.

I hope to never meet these people in real life. 
-
 
Uhm...

If you want a person to go away, don't avoid him outright. Instead, just act natural. The more unnatural you act, the more I actually mind you. 

I understand that somehow or rather, things have become awkward as friends, but if you would want to avoid me, just be natural, really - I will just fade away, like many other acquaintances before me.

Trust me when I am typing here, that I am making a conscious effort to avoid you as well. I do not have a social media account, and I don't want to ask for your number for no apparent legit reason(that's a bit creepy to me).

If you act unnaturally, you are showing and emphasizing that you mind my presence. Don't do that. Take it from me. It's bad for your mental health, fretting over something that is unconfirmed. I do not want to end on bad terms on your side either.

I'll admit it, I liked you. Given that I have only known you for around half a sem, I really hoped to make an effort to know you better, to decide on things.

Unfortunately, because I fumbled, and became very nervous, I acted like such a despo in front of you, and made it so damned obvious as daylight that I was after you. That should more or less be the cause of your avoiding me, I hope.

I do not know if you'll even come across this, but all I can say is, not to worry. I will not disturb you again.
-
 
How do you distinguish between dating someone and hooking up with someone? I've been seeing this guy for a few times and sometimes we just go out for dinner and sometimes we hook up, so I've always assumed that we are just acquaintances hanging out. We don't see each other that often because we're both busy with work. Just recently, he asked me along to his friend's birthday gathering and that confused me. I mean, would you bring an acquaintance/hook-up to meet your friends? I'm currently not seeing anyone but I'm not very sure about him, and I'd never asked because I don't think I have any right to ask him that. It's his own business on who he wants to date anyway. I'm just confused about his actions and my own feelings. What do you all think of this situation?

I hate my gf's bff. She is a terrible influence, always trying to convince her to drink and go clubbing. what should i do?
-
 
Many of my friends and I(average looking)have never had a bf and also can't seem to find one?? :( like 0 guys are interested. i have been joining ccas and stuff to get to meet new people but there's just no one suitable, and it kind of defeats the purpose to continually join more stuff with the intention of finding a bf. I know this sounds despo but I don't want to be forever alone till I'm old:'( doesn't help that I'm in fass and people say it's gonna be even harder to meet someone in the workplace... 
-
 
Would love some advice from the guys. 

I am texting this guy regularly. We chat on another social media platform... I can see whether he read my message a not. He take ages to reply sometimes. But i know for a fact that he was online on whatsapp (last seen.. i am a stalker, i know). So basically he can be active on other platforms but yet not reply me. What does it mean? Is he just busy? Or hes delaying his responses to me? I am sick of waiting for his replies sometimes. But i like him a lot.. so despite me telling myself no, i should stop texting him, i still do it. 
-
 
There's this girl I know who looks just slightly above average, but loves to lead guys on. She is disillusioned to the fact that these guys are attracted to her by the way she intentionally behaves towards them, and not because she is particularly attractive or desirable. Also, she loves pretending like she's single, loves attracting different guys and leading them on and changing boyfriends again and again. It probably makes her feel good to see guys chase her blindly. 

If you're so insecure, fix yourself first. It may not be obvious to you but it's obvious to everyone else you are seeking some kind of validation through the number of guys you attract. Your actions are revolting to some of us guys who can see through the pretence. Also, you're too skinny to the bones that sometimes it hurts my eyes to look at you.

But seriously, given that you have to settle down for good someday, do some soul searching and ask yourself why you seek that kind of validation. It's unhealthy in the long run and I don't think any guy in this world can live with a girl with this kind of problem.
-
 
Am i overthinking or what? 
The story goes like this: He asked me out to catch up after so long ever since i rejected him few years back. And we subsequently went out a few times together. He even came to attend my event straight after his bookout and was expecting a meal together or something?? but i already had another date with a friend. 
And now, he shows much concerns to my problems...

Any advice?
-
 
I cant stand it.

All these guys in relationships who post stuff about texting other girls, wanting to date them, BUT have a girlfriend. WHAT?????!!!!! you already have a girlfriend, why the f*** are you even texting her? Your eyes should only be for your girlfriend and no one else. NO ONE. If you really want to text her, then you don't deserve your girlfriend. Break up with her. Its only fair. I get super pissed off at guys who cant keep their junk in their pants. F***ing bastards who spoil the majority of guys names'. 
-
 
Here's a question for the guys- what boundaries should a girl have when making friends with a guy to ensure that it remains purely platonic? I do not wish to lead anyone on. Thanks!
-
 
I know times are bad but...

Dear Ver_...
U r pretty. We don't talk...but I like u. But I'm starting over. Please don't be angry. I don't know.

@15223 everything you said struck a chord and feels familiar to me. Just hang in there, you're not alone. I'll be your friend if you want to :) we'll figure out a way to get in touch if you are interested!
-
 
When reading NUSWhispers, I often come across confessions which sound like they could have been from my friends. Sometimes they even describe my own thoughts so accurately that I wonder if I accidentally posted it in my sleep or something. 

What's sad is that I secretly wish some confessions were from certain people in my life. E.g. when an OP says he likes a girl, I'd fantasize that he might actually be my crush - and God forbid - talking about me. The possibility is near zero la but I guess this is one aspect of anonymity that makes it so addictive!
-
 
I thought things were done when my ex and I broke up. That we will go our separate ways to let ourselves heal, and when we were ready, we might be friends again. It was supposedly not a bad break up.

But right now she's spreading so much false information about me, exaggerating and dramatizing the things that I did, or in some cases I didn't even do those things but she said I did.

And she also has, among her friends, accused me of spreading false rumours about her when I haven't. The thing is we don't even have mutual friends whom I'm close to, so she couldn't have known what I told my close friends. We are from different faculties, so our closest friends don't mix. And mind you, I never spoke ill of her, and never accused her of anything or slandered her when talking to my friends about the breakup.

So now I'm being portrayed as the bad guy and she as the victim, when I never did anything wrong. With her big mouth (yes rude but sorry not sorry), her whole faculty probably thinks very badly of me.

What am I supposed to do?
-
 
To  and anyone yearning and pining for someone else,
Over-dependency on a certain person is kind of like addiction. Try watching this short (4min) video from 1:46 (or from the beginning :) ) for some good advice!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-g5V27Jyus#t=1m46s

Have more friends and connections: the more relationships you have, the less attachment you have to any one person. To start getting rid of attachment, go and try new things! Finding a passion/hobby will take your focus off that certain someone/something.

Best of luck!
-
 
Be passive, caring for someone from afar, and etc is silly. 

Like what a certain poster has mentioned previously something along the line of there is no such thing as "Like girl, confess to girl, get attached and go on dates". Movie/drama-esque perspectives do not work most of the time. I have fallen into the cycle in my university days too. 

"Man Up" is a pretty decent movie though, as they have certain positive messages like "putting yourself out there" and "the list of compatibilities is no guarantee" even though the ending is still unrealistic.

If you find someone attractive, talk to her and interact with her more, ask her out 1-1 (if you are too humji, 1-1 interaction in group setting shall be your stepping stones first) before deciding if you really like her. As much as it feels like love, your feelings are infatuation and her unmatched goodness is simply a collage of your fragments of imagination. Anyway, independence and assertive are sexy, so don't be an emotional clingy vine plant.

Recently, I had asked someone out for dinner. I only had a few interactions with her (and it totaled less than 15mins). She is cute, seems sporty, sounds intelligent, works hard, and is ang mo pai. I am very cheena, but I am drawn to amp females. Don't ask me why, I had failed to answer my friends that question every time. 

I am feeling nervous as this is the first time which I had asked a stranger out, and I had been out of the dating life for quite a while. It was a real struggle before I finally man up to ask her out. I'm pleasantly surprised that she agreed. Looking forward to knowing her better. :D 

Best Regards,
BSG

P.S I am not Bill, so I won't be appearing too often. I had a bit of free time for this month, which is why I posted more. Good luck to anyone who is job searching, studying hard, falling in and out of love. If you are facing setbacks, keep faith that you will emerge eventually as many people had gone through the same cycle and moved on in the end.

Once I know of a guy-girl pair who were quite compatible with each other. The trouble was that the guy (call him X) is attached to another girl (call her Y) while the girl (call her S), well, was more than willing to go for the guy as a good friend.

S once asked me what she should do to get X. At that time, almost everyone except X and a guy called P himself realised Y was a douchebag. P was more than happy for a one-night-stand with Y, so a thought went through my head, why not fulfil P and Y as well as X and S?

I am not sure if what I did was right; X was somewhat alright with S, and with more wine it became obvious that X and I found each other attractive. A few touches and a drive back to one of the NUS residences meant a good night spent for X and S. The same for P and Y, except that Y was not so willing and was rather blur with the whole event. P, however, was more than eager with his new discovery.

I really don't know if fulfilling two and a half person's request at the expense of half a person and monster was a good idea. But Y was really a dominatrix in her time; she would force X to give her pleasure. X would often complain to me that Y was demanding he go to her house every day for pleasure.

I told him X that he had to sort it out by himself, but then S could "nudge" him with I since S was willing. But S was super young and just graduated from JC, and so there was a significant age gap. S said yes and X said whatever.

Y still has little idea what happened to her. I admit, though, she deserves whatever she gets for the horrible things Y did to my friends.

Emotions are my biggest weakness.

I get easily annoyed, angered, stressed out, anxious, depressed. I care too much what people think. I don't want to care, I do not want to feel left out or to feel like a pathetic loser anymore. In my head I know that I would be a stronger person if I were less emotional. But how do I change the way my brain or heart operates (Wherever emotions stem from, I don't know. Psych students would you like to weigh in on this)? How can I switch off my emotions? How can I just get through this life in a calm and rational manner?

Help. Please help me. I have had enough of being emotional and needy.

Who here has been blue ticked in whatsapp group when you jio-ing people (and no one replied)? 

Who here always fall into the jio leader or the whatsapp group is dead? 

*slowly raises hand*

Would it be justifiable for a guy who is attached to a girl yet imagines sex with another girl who is not his gf, saying that his gf never allows sex before marriage?
-
 
Most of the girls in my jc class are already attached while a large portion of the guys remain evergreen. Sometimes, I really wish I am a girl. It seems so much easier that way and I may even be spoilt by choice.

If say, you realise that your  current gf/bf was once involved in an intimate (including sexual) affair as the 3rd party between a married couple. But the affair ended before you both got together. How would you feel?

For me, I have the urge of cheating on her/him because I want to know what's so fun of cheating and why did she/he want to get involved. She/he said she/he had never loved that married guy/girl, it was all due to a moment of curiosity. The affair lasted for almost a year. Was it very exciting, like keeping a big ass secret from everybody and doing things without anybody knowing? Was it very fun?!

Yes, I'm an asshole who can't move on after knowing that she/he is such a person. Without a little sense of moral and principle, doing things which she/he know is wrong and might hurt the relationship between that married couple. But why... 

But it's not in my character to do bad things behind my partner's back. I can't even bring myself to initiate a non-work related conversation with another girl/guy. I'm conservative, so I can't fully accept the fact that my partner was involved in the intimate affair... 

She/he gets pissed off when I accidentally bring it up or ask more questions. This has always been in my mind every single day. I need to find a closure on this issue. It's driving me nuts and fantasizing of cheating on her with other girls.

What should I do? Its easy to say, let go of the past and move on, people change, now all that matters is she/he love you, etc etc. I tried all the above but I can't...
-
 
I need final advice guys. 
Just found out from my friends that my bf has been doing the following, after being attached with me:
1) when out female colleagues, he joked that his di*k is big. 
2) told one attached female colleague to tell him when she breaks up. And that he's a better guy. 
3) texting female friends to hang out one to one. (Inclusive of girl mentioned in pt 2)
4) in front of me, not considering my feeling, puts arm around girls when taking pic with them. When I told him that I'm not comfortable, he said he will keep doing it, and I will get used to it. Because if she's a close friend, he will continue to do that. Problem is, he has alot of 'close' female friends. 
5) when random girls whom he doesn't know, chats with him, he replies. 

I feel like he doesn't respect me as his girlfriend. He hasn't full fledged cheated (yet), but is this a dealbreaker already? I'm so worn out being worried and troubled with his behavior which I cannot make sense of. To me these things should come so naturally without having the gf needing to say, if you really care for her. Guys your input please. Girls as well of course. 
-
 
I wonder, do people usually delete or block their ex from their social media and phone? 

I just deleted all forms of contacts, and i have to say, it feels as breathtakingly awesome as standing on top of Mt Fuji with the wind blowing on your face. #sorrybadanalogy

Of course, i'd understand why some don't delete their ex completely from their lives. But when it ended really sourly, i don't see the point of not erasing all trace of that person from your contact list. 
-
 
 I know you're not referring to me, but I know someone who has a crush on me and I have feelings for them too. I'm just waiting for them to just say something.

Don't be like me. Quit the waiting game, and just do it. :)
-
 
How would you guys feel if a girl asks you out on a date, like a straight-up date? I'm a girl and I want to ask someone out. I'm not afraid of rejection nor will I get sad over the rejection, just that I'll be a bit annoyed if the guy think he's too good for me or that I'm desperate for him and all the egoistic stuff. Should I go ahead to ask him out? I'm not desperate for a relationship or anything, I just want to find out more about him.
-
 
i have been in a long committed relationship. I fully intend to marry my current gf. However, she refuses to engage in fellatio, even though i am more than willing to go down on her. Before marriage i would just want to find out once how getting a blowjob is like, and am considering getting a fl. I fully know its a bad idea on so many levels, and am thinking clearly enough to stay away. But my resolve is being chipped away. Please tell me what to do
-
 
 I share the exact same feeling as you. In the end, I engaged a FL to blow me, but it was protected. Only once did I do it unprotected, but only for a few seconds before I stopped her. I don't know how to get my gf to agree to blow me, sigh.

Got a strong weird feeling and looked through my gf's phone and found out that she cheated on me with her ex over Dec. I should be angry, but I'm feeling numb inside because that boy cheated on her more than 2 year ago and wrecked her emotionally for 6+ month. I thought she was much better than this.

It took another man (who's a much better man than me) to heal her back, but he left her cos she still have some issues. And somewhere down the road, I picked her and all her pieces up, and tried to put them back together. I may fail, but every attempt came from my heart. 

Yet, I don't effing understand: Why would she go back to him? Why would she inflict that same pain on someone? I'm sitting here lost. No idea how to broach the topic with her because it'll become an argument that it's my fault to peek.

 Yes, it probably is. Just tell him you need to rest and do it manually in the mean time. Tell him you came and suck him off while resting for bonus points.

I'm currently dating a few guys and they are all either smart or have potentially good careers, while I'm stuck in one place trying to get my shit together. I feel really inferior because I'm not moving towards a career with big bucks and I'm still trying to figure out my life. I'm afraid that my mediocre career/studies will be an embarrassment to my future partner. I'm so insecure about this that I don't dare to go beyond the dating phase with any of the guys.

Is it normal for close friends of the opposite gender to hold hands? My ex used to tell me holding hands is only for couples but I think it's fine? What do you guys think? 
-
 
I have become so dependent on my boyfriend to the point that I feel totally insecure when he is not physically by my side. I have few friends and now, almost no friend that I can share my troubles with. 
What should I do to feel alright even if he is not by my side? 
It is becoming a huge problem as I worry about a lot of  things. Without him, I feel anxious or empty. Due to his other commitments, we will have even lesser time together in the new semester. In addition, it will become a ldr when I go on exchange, while he go on a summer programme. What should I do?

I was here a while back confessing how sad it was to end the year with you losing our friendship, and me, losing my mind.

Then came our clique outing, you appeared out of nowhere and started talking to me again out of the blue, normally, as if nothing negative between us ever happened. As if my heart remained intact, never broken. Then we started texting, and the next minute - you unsurprisingly disappeared again.

I'm really, really tired of all these leaving me hanging situations. You don't get to decide when you'd like to talk to me, to your whims and fancies. You don't get to decide if the medication works on me or not. You don't get to decide my mood. Stop, just leave me alone. Leave us alone. For the last time, I dug out our photos and I couldn't help but noticed that you used to laugh so much more genuinely and happily, before you knew me (or even when we first knew each other). As our friendship grew closer, your smile went fader.

I used to think it's really stupid when one says if you really have feelings for someone, you don't need to own that someone but just hope for that person to be happy. I never understood that, I even questioned such a saying - claiming that it probably wasn't even true love to begin with. Now I know how wrong I was then - I truly want you to be happy. And for that to happen, I have to withdraw from your life - by force or otherwise, permanently. Even if it means putting everything to an end, it has to happen. I will watch you from afar, or wherever else that may be, hoping that you find your true happiness and I'll be really glad (from wherever I may be) when that happens.

Nights, and goodbye. You gonna welcome a 2016 without any presence and thoughts of me.

I honestly don't know what I'm confessing about but I just wish to share my story before the semester starts next week. 

After my break up from a long term relationship, my male friends from my lecture gang who were all single immediately pestered and bugged me to install those dating apps on my phone. Initially I was like -.-. But out of boredom I installed those apps( yes including letterbox) to play around since I realised I had a lot of free time after being single again. Tbh, most of the girls on those dating apps were obviously using fake or heavily photoshopped profiles of themselves as their DP.  Having an ex who had the ability to manipulate make-up and body posture to make herself look more attractive made me more wary of those Super "chio" profiles on those dating apps. After a while, I grew disillusioned and uninstalled all of them. 

Anyway, feeling super bored and lonely, I decided to chat up my jc friends (who were all guys) and we went for a drink together at a  restaurant bar. One of them decided that a dick-fest was too boring and decided to "call in some chicks". Somehow, from a group of 4 guys, it became a party of 9. One of the girls that came along immediately caught my eye. In my eyes, she was really attractive and maybe perhaps bored being single for a while, I decided to chat her up. I found out afterwards that she was my friend's friend's friend(work that out yourself) 
Long story short, we clicked well and we exchanged numbers before we parted for the night. My guy friends decided to go clubbing with the girls(including her) while I went home to sleep. For those who want to know why I didn't go along , of course I was tempted to follow along to get to know the girl better along the way, but at the same time I was terribly tired and felt a bit sick. 

After that night, I initiated a conversation and things progressed very smoothly for quite some time(Being in a previous Long term relationship really helps one understand girls much better lol). After texting a while, we found out that we really clicked quite well. Importantly, we were the same age and still both studying, me in NUS while she was private Uni. Therefore, somehow, we were able to relate to each other quite well. We started going on one-on-one lunch/dinner dates as well as outings to GBTB and Coney Island just to name a few. We were still unofficial then. After a while, I was sure that it was the right time to confess to her and that I was so confident that she would agree to be my girlfriend. Then one day my friend(who was part of the group that night I met her) dropped me a bombshell. One morning out of the blue he texted me something  along the lines of " hey bro, I'm so sorry to say this but I can confirm its true, the girl you have been going out with is a social escort"( I altered the actual text as saying it would give away my identity lol). I didn't believe it, I asked for evidence, and immediately he sent me images/screenshots as proof. I shall not discuss the images in detail here as it would be inappropriate. There were other things discussed but I shall stop here. From the evidence he provided, it was impossible for me to deny that she wasn't a social escort. Naturally of course I was extremely heartbroken. It was more painful than rejection. It was the feeling of being "cuckolded" or "戴绿帽”. I took a while to calm down, gather my thoughts, and I called her to meet to talk about something urgent. From her response, I reckoned that she thought I was going to confess to her, since I managed to calm myself down to speak to her in my normal tone. 

We met outside the MRT station. I brought her to a quiet corner since I didn't want anything nasty to happen when I broke the news to her. From her demeanour and expression, I guessed she thought I was going to confess to her lol. (Quiet corner and everything). When I broke the news to her that I found out about her "job", her expression immediately changed. It was a very long and emotional talk so to summarise what happened: She said that she was planning to tell me about it once she knew I could be trusted with her secret. She said she had really cut down a lot of her "work" after meeting me. She asked me if I still wanted to be with her. She kept apologising and crying. I said I wasn't planning to break up with her at that time I found out. I said that I was heartbroken but I didn't want to end things like that immediately. She cried a lot. 
I immediately felt guilty when I saw that she started crying uncontrollably. That was when I knew I really liked her a lot. Then I made a decision that I don't know whether I will regret in the future. I said something like " I really like you, and I don't mind what you did in the past, if I ask you to become my Girlfriend, will you become exclusive to me only? That's all I ask for. " Of course many things were said after that but basically she agreed to be my girlfriend and promised to stop her social escort job immediately. 

Till now, we are still a couple and are going strong. However, there is still a bit of awkwardness between us especially when we try to get intimate. Therefore, our relationship has never progressed beyond normal kissing/hugging /holding hands. Neither of us has suggested to each other about the more "intimate stuff" so far.  I am happy with the status quo and I guess she is too.

Personally, I believe that if you really like a person, you would accept him/her despite their past. If they love you, they would willingly change for you too. I believed that she would change for me, so I gave her that chance. To all the singles who are dating, it doesn't matter what your partner did before he/she got together with you. What  matters is what he/she does in the present and in the future. That will be the true gauge of their commitment to you. 

Ps:  I know she often reads NUS whispers. I love you HANNY.

To  and , I think it's possible for people in r/s to be intrigued by someone else, afterall that's how you get together with your partner. IMHO, if you really love your partner, you'll try to keep a distance from the other person/avoid doing stuff that will upset your partner, and not simply leave it to fate.  What does leaving to fate even mean? You toss a coin to decide if you want to go out with that person? You're not Dent. Just, put yourself in your partner's shoes...... Nonetheless, if you decide to fall deeper, I don't think you deserve your partner..?

My boyfriend is a nice decent dude and we have been together for a very long time. We have went through many ups and downs in our relationship and we are in the comfortable and potentially marriageable stage. I'm grateful for what he has done for me, supporting me and helping me to shape my character. However, after being in a stable relationship for quite long, I still wonder if there's someone out there who is more suitable for me. I crave for the excitement of meeting new guys, the butterfly in my stomach feeling I get from flirtatious moves made by other guys. On and off, there are guys who made me feel this way but the feeling dies when they gradually moved on and stop having contact with me. Recently, it happened again and the feeling is stronger than ever. He is a guy who I admire a lot because of his unique character and both of us has quite some chemistry. According to other friends and my observations, he might have some interest in me too. I have a really big crush on him this time and it's hard to persuade myself to walk out of it since the feeling is mutual. My boyfriend is still loving and nice and there is no reason for me to break up with him. I'm not sure if I should give up this relationship which has come so far since I have become more interested in this other guy or should I just remain status quo and let the guy slip by. :'( Please give me some advice on this because it is really tormenting me.

i was rejected at the 1.5month mark since I known her and its has been nearly 3 months thereafter and I still miss her dearly. We are both at different countries now and I hope my feelings for her will fade away and then decide whether we could be friends again. Initially after rejection I thought I would be happy just being friends because I feel so ease with her (her too) but it was not. Different expectations of the friendships has led to misery for me and I don’t think she realises it. I did not talk to her about it because it is not her fault that I can’t help to want something more out from the friendship. 

I told her I need to distant myself and she said she understand. The day when I left and gave her my well-wishes I knew it could be the very last time I talk to her. I do not know what will happen in the future and I have no doubt we could connect at a very personal level even after a long time but I am afraid of getting too close to her once again when I am finally over her. 

Why do you have to make me feel this way? I am not a needy guy and like you, would prefer most of our time alone or with friends who understand us. You probably do not read NUSWhispers but I want you to know that I do not regret meeting you 037. It is such a shame because we could really become good friends if not for my romantic feelings. Please take care of yourself over there and don’t be too trusting. Sorry I can no longer give you advices or provide a listening ear. I hate myself for not being a genuine friend and I will not be that guy to stay on and let resentment brew. 

I will find you when I feel that I am emotionally ready 037:(

Guys, what are the chances of getting back with your ex? 6 months on and I am still not over him. During the course of our relationship, I did many things that he didn't like (not infidelity )that ultimately led to the demise of our relationship. When we broke up, he said that he forgives me for all those things that I have done. It has been 6 months and I still really like him. He is still single and I am thinking of getting him back? We still keep in contact. Do I have a chance?

Well well hello , 

the first time I read your response I’m like “woah gong simi”. your english very good, I like. “Mature”, “original jokes” and prep “small gifts”, woah seh, date me maybe? JOKING lah hahaa.

On a serious note, I do see your point. Naive perhaps. Or you can say I’m playing hard to get, but then this is not really the case. Of course my rule doesn’t apply to every men, and maybe I have sent the wrong signal to fellow friends who are thinking of applying my technique of “reject-first-then-observe”. By “observing”, I mean to still be friends and get to know the person better. The thing is, how about “rejection” after dating then (ie get dumped eventually)? My chiobu hedonist kaki will tell you "never mind", and would just date anyway, which I find unfair to the one “hunting" while she’s the one calling the shot.

Essentially, we don’t want to reject the wrong species, don’t want to NOT reject the wrong species (double negation, ie we want to reject the wrong species), we don’t want to date out of pity (ie just date lahh) and so on. So how sia??? Cannot this cannot that. Well, I guess the answer to “reject or don’t reject” is “it depends” lor. It depends on who the girl is looking for in the first place. If I want a guy with mature thinking, and someone whom I don’t know very well appears to be quite mature, then I really don’t mind trying out a few dates. If he’s a little childish to begin with (or “seems" to just want to get out of the evergreen circle, or he “seems” to just want to have some fun etc), I’ll apply my rule. This is just me lah hor. After all, who we think we like may not be complete after all. We may be attracted to someone with traits we didn't know we like. We all have different taste in men/women, so there’s really no fixed rule. And after observing I find that the guy is really really not bad, I think I’ll be the one chasing him. Not hoping that he’s still loyal and whatnot, but a sincere attraction.  

-from a girl who is still waiting for a gentleman to appear, maybe she should tweak her rule a little bit

I need some help/advice. I've been going out with a girl recently. I really do like her and wanna explore possibilities of a relationship in the future. The only thing is I don't know if she feels the same way, or is also looking for a relationship (still too early to ask her me thinks). 

Anyway, I don't know what's wrong with me but I find myself constantly checking our whatsapp convo. I notice she'll come online for a while then go offline without reading my text (still grey ticks). It's only like maybe an hour to maybe 3 hours later that there will be blue ticks, and even after the blue ticks she only replies like 15-20 mins later. And everytime during this period while waiting for her reply i would be having paranoid thoughts and asking myself questions like did i say anything wrong in my previous text to her? Is our current conversation too lame that she cant be bothered to reply? Am i that far down in her priority list? 

A lot of people say i overthink stuff and that her long response time could be that she's busy or something, but i can't help but think she's not that interested in me or doesn't want a relationship. But during the few times i went out with her she was pretty sweet and nice, but could that be due to her just being polite? I noticed that her whatsapp replies tended to take longer ever since we went out for dinner on sunday. So naturally i keep thinking did i do/say anything wrong during dinner? Is her long replies a way of saying that "i don't want to go out with you anymore"?  etc etc etc.

Is there anything i can do to banish all these negative thoughts? I know that i'm probably obsessed over her but i really can't help it. Her long replies are making things even worse and it's killing me inside =(

 If you don't want your friend who texts you at that kind of timing, can I have her?
-
 
I confessed to my crush.

Big mistake!

The feeling wasn't mutual. She had been avoiding me ever since. I regretted my decision.

If I can turn back time, I wouldn't have confessed to her. Rather, I will try to keep my intention mysterious and interact with her more and confessing only when I see signs of interest.

So today, I happened to glance through screenshots of our old conversations.

Do you still remember those conversations where we'd talk about our various game obsessions? How we bonded over Portal 2, and how we used to say that Fallout 4's never gonna come out until we're 50 (heh, how wrong we were.)? I still remember I'd watch you play and die multiple times on Dark Souls. You'd get so frustrated that at one point you even nitpicked that sigh-like sound the game makes when you die. It was pretty hilarious.

Do you still remember those cheesy romantic messages we used to send each other? Man, you were so fucking smooth with your words back then...and to be honest, you still are now. I don't think I could ever match up to that. You were so quick-witted, knowing how to make a witty romantic remark in response to an innocuous statement. I guess that's one of the things that made me fall for you back then.

I still remember that night I felt so down in the dumps that I was pretty inconsolable. You got so worried that you even messaged my younger sibling to check up on me. You stayed up all night reassuring me that everything's eventually bound to work out, and cracked those jokes that made me grin despite all the tears. I still recall jokingly telling you to "cut it out, I'm supposed to be crying!"

But I suppose all good things must come to an end. It's been almost a year since we broke up.

I don't think you'll ever know how everything suddenly felt like it shattered and lost its colour when you told me that maybe we should break up. You told me that "maybe I wasn't good enough as a girlfriend", and those words still echo through my head up to this day. 

And yet somehow, looking back to everything I've gone through this year after we've broken up, I feel that maybe this breakup was a good thing.

After you've said those words, I've started to reevaluate my life. I'm not perfect, but it doesn't mean I can't be better. I've decided to change myself for the better. Maybe I did it in the hopes that we might get back together (we never did). Or maybe I did it as a sort of spiteful show that I can do fine without you. Whatever the case may be, after a year of figuring out what I needed to improve about myself and actually doing something about it, I've never felt so assured of myself for a long time.

I've found my own happiness once again. I used to rely on you so much to make myself happy, and that was a mistake on my part.  I used to complain about the boring life I had - in fact, I did nothing but send complaints your way. It's actually no wonder you've grown tired of me and broke it off. Now I'm slowly easing back into doing things I used to love, and I'm actually pretty overwhelmed with the amount of things I wanna do. 

I won't deny the fact that I still long for that feeling I used to have when we were still together, and that I still long for how things used to be. But I also feel like I've moved on, and I'm ready to take on another adventure - in singlehood or otherwise.

So in the end, I wanna thank you. You definitely won't be able to read this, since you're busy with your own life now and our friendly messages have slowly decreased in frequency. I'll never forget all the things you've done for me, and all the memories that we've had. I thank you for being the best boyfriend I've had so far. I don't think I'd ever find somebody to replace that part in my heart, even though I know I'll find the man who's really the one for me sometime in the future.

Most of all, I thank you for letting me go.

I wish you all the best, my dearest A.

I am diff from the OP of  I clearly loves my bf more than he does of me. Well, we have had quite a number of BIG FIGHTS and all these fights resulted in him initiating a break up from me but we are still together till today cos I kept holding him back promising that things will be better. He's still nice to me and all but he has mentioned that we should check whether we are suitable for each other when the time comes for us to consider marriage. it's clear that he's not sure if we are suitable for marriage due to all our fights. we are 1.5 years old together. it has quite an impact on me too, constantly thinking that he doesn't love me enough as I was always the one holding back...when boys did too much of the initiating breakups and girls did too much of the holding back... who wants to be in a r/s when you are uncertain if you wanna be walking down the aisle with him or her?

I have seen lots of people cheat on their significant others in NUS, especially during exchange. There seems to be some unsaid rule about not reporting/letting their significant others know (?)

In reply to . I know how that feels. The best way is to break the ice and have an understanding with them that you are different from them. You don't have to fit in, just be yourself and who knows, despite the differences, you would be really close friends. :) 
-
 
I perfectly agree with confessor of . 

I don't have any close groups of friends from my major although it's pretty clique-y. I used to have one but some thing happened so I've become a lone ranger. I know my parents who worked hard to put me through Uni would want to attend the ceremony and I know I should because of them. 

But sometimes I stay up at night thinking of ways to make myself seem less loser-ish. I don't want my parents to know I have no friends in Uni and that their son is nothing but someone that's pretty much a loner.

Currently seeing a beta orbiter (physically + socially) with multiple unresolved emotional issues, studies best described as "low impact mental exercises". None of this really bothers me because I have enough confidence and security to power an entire damn family. Also I'm sick of fuckboys playin you dig? However I do realize that I might have to introduce him to my high achieving tribe where I have close to apex predator status, and I'd rather get into a minor motor accident than have to face the pity and disapproval from "the big reveal". Is this worth pursuing? Because despite the trash talk he is really quite a wonderful person and I don't wanna start a new fire that I can't put out for him, ya feel?

Something like .
We have been friends for 4-5 years, were in college together. Now whenever we meet, he keeps throwing casual hints at how he used to observe me when we were in college, he likes when I laugh, and that he used to have dreams about us being a couple..but then immediately laughs off as if it's just all in the past.
This one time, we were out for dinner and his friend called for something. After the call, he told me jokingly that his friend was just wishing him good luck for the date. And then I asked him is this a date, and AGAIN he just laughed off and changed the topic. (So even I am not clear when is a dinner 'date' or 'just dinner'?)
So he keeps doing this. Throwing random hints that he likes me, and cares for me..but when I try to talk further on this, he becomes non-interested. I am super confused. 
He is a great guy, and a very dear friend. I am very fond of him and dating him would be great, but I don't know if that's what he wants. I also feel that talking to him about this might make things awkward between us, but then this uncertainty isn't working for either of us. I am a girl who keeps things simple and clear. I think the next time he does this, I'll ask him straight about this.
What do you all think? Any suggestions/advice/your take on this?

Lately, I have seen some posts on nuswhispers regarding people discussing about height issues, ego etc.
 
Well, let me give you my personal opinions on what I think about this.

Even as a guy with average height, I must admit that sometimes I do have this kind of thoughts, such as whether the girl I like will end up taller than me in heels, whether I will feel sian when an amazon with heels walk past me, etc etc. ( I know some guys do feel that way too ).

But think carefully. If you really like a girl, you shouldnt be bothered by this height difference stuff. Also, if that girl really likes you and is a girl with mature thinking,I believe she wouldnt mind that height difference. A true relationship works when both sides really understand each other and ignore the trivial differences. Why do you want to care what other people think of when you 2 walk side by side? If you 2 really like each other, it would be as though both of you are in your own world, where others are invisible right?

As for the other case where guys feel hurt getting towered by girls in heels, you need to ask yourself this. Is it important? There are sheet tons of tall girls in Singapore and you cant expect yourself to get affected everytime a tall girl walks past right? You are yourself and shouldnt be affected by such trivial issues. I believe there is a girl out there (with the ideal kind of height)who will like you for who you are, so you shouldnt be bothered by the rest of the amazons.

In case some of you vertically challenged guys need some ego boost, here are some facts that you might want to consider. There are in fact short people who are successful in real life, as elites of the society. 

As long as you put in effort, I dont see why you cant end up on the top tier of the social ladder, and eventually command people who are much taller than you? You may be the shortest in the clique, but once you open that golden mouth of yours, I dont see why those people wont just shut their mouth and listen to you with due respect yeah? (No offence to the tall people)

Moreover with success, I believe a girl will have that 安全感to woo you instead of you doing the work,because some girls do want their partner to be financially stable. (What good is a tall and buff guy who flirts everyday without a life ambition?)

Once you secure that relationship, you can proceed to make her like you for your character and who you are.

In conclusion (Well I have said alot and pardon my Engrish...), short guys, you are not alone and please be confident of yourself and take note of the aforementioned scenarios. With a great ambition and successful career, a 4 foot guy can also be seen as a 8 foot guy ;) ! 

(Hope you dont filter this admin, it can help some people wake up their idea)

I don't think I want to attend my graduation although I think my parents would like to attend it. This is because I would feel out of place and upset because I'm not sure who I can hang out with during the ceremony, highlighting the sad fact that I did not manage to make many good friends. Until now I don't really have any close friends in university. Actually the majority of people I come into contact with seem quite superficial and like to hang out in large groups, talk about the latest gossip and about people and I found out that I was sort of backstabbed by a friend I thought could be trusted. The pressure and rat race of wanting to do well it seems cause people to turn really ugly and deceitful. For the few that I find genuine, I don't really have many opportunities to keep in touch with them as I always seem to be with different people every semester. Also they seem to already have their own gang. I think another main reason is because my personality is quite different from the majority of those in my faculty but this can't be helped. 
Though this is the case I still regret perhaps not trying to understand these people better and maybe put in more effort in getting to know more people. I believe it would also have benefited me a lot academically. I often hear about test banks circulating and people working together in groups to do online tests and I found out that I could easily have retrieved a past midterm paper from others for practice because it was actually returned to students the last time and it was not posted for practice for my batch. How naive I was to think that I could do well with my own effort and beat the bell curve. 
Well I think I will just try my best this upcoming semester to gain more friends. I still have one more chance to have the "best years of my life" apparently.

General Tips for lovelorn NUS guys: One of the more constant type of posts I see here is the sad rejected guy lamenting his unjust deprivation of love by enigmatic women who appear to be equally interested in the guy, only to confine him cruelly in the friend-zone when he confesses. The outcome is painful for both parties (and for me to see such unnecessary emotional hurt), but it can be avoided. Here are some tips from bro to bros (ladies feel free to constructively criticise)

1. Pre-First-Date Confessions are for the movies and serials. They don't belong to real life dating.

movies: [attraction] -> [interaction] -> [confession] -> [first date] -> [happily ever after]

real life: [attraction] -> [interaction] -> [ask on a date] -> [first date] -> [many more dates] -> [confession/ "the Talk"] -> [exclusivity]

2. Be honest of your intentions, don't pretend to be just a friend
instead of asking ambiguously "wanna hang out/ eat dinner?" like any of her other platonic friends might do, make it clear that you are not looking to just 'be a friend' if that truly is the case. Don't waste her time by acting like a friend when your "friendship" would crumble without promises of romance. But of course, "making it clear" does not mean "I love you and I want you to have my babies" confession style...

"If you're not already attached, could I take you out to dinner sometime?"
This makes your intentions very clear, without being too direct and pressuring. (usually... see point 4)

3. Accept Rejection like a Gentleman
Another lie we are fed by movies and serials is that a man's effort (despite his initial unattractiveness to the woman) should always be rewarded by a woman's affections eventually. Misogynist bullshit. It's ultimately her decision, and if she says no, stop bothering her and move on.

And no, this is not because its some sneaky way to gain her respect and admiration in the hopes of asking her out again. It is because you respect her decision. Period.

4. Women are not like standardised locks to be picked with a secret manual

One of my close female friends prefers to be strictly platonic friends for months before any romantic hints and doesn't like the pressure of going on on "official dates" even with guys she finds attractive. For every 10 girls harassed by suitors and stalkers, 1 girl would find her true love in a guy who persistently chased her despite rejection for a year. Each individual is different, and these tips, while applying to most people, are not laws or rules that apply to all people. Keep an open mind.

Good luck, 
-A below average guy (in terms of wealth, looks and fashion sense) with an above average dating life

My friends keep on giving me opportunities to find soulmates. Given my age, it is probably time to look for a partner as well. I thank them for wanting to help me, and mentally I have been trying to push to be much more open to do things I almost never do before.

I think finding friends from different circles for me is easy. I make friends extremely easily. Acquaintances, extremely easy too. Just open up and speak up. Except that none of these groups are marriageable age. However, among those of marriageable age, groups can discredit me even before I make any half-decent move, such as asking for a meal out.

The trouble is, I think I am still traumatised from a bad romance one year ago. I am still feeling the pain from the chain of events that happened which led to the loss of crush, friends and admittedly, as much as I like to pretend that I am strong and emotionally unaffected, I think I am still visibly shaken.

I just sense the darkness in me grow bit by bit, and each time I try to seek "counselling" from my friends they give up on me because all I just want to do is to explain my situation fully so that they can help better, but they make me sound like I'm a useless bastard.

I have no idea why but I find it really difficult to commit to anyone. I do admit I get lonely at times and even thought about settling down. I've also gone on a couple dates but every time I get to know a person better (like almost getting into a relationship), I'll feel like breaking up or cutting the person off really soon. What should I do?? Do I have some commitment  issues or do I just like the chase?
-
 
In the past few years I have not done many things right. But as far as possible in situations that involve others I try my best not to let anyone down. With situations concerning myself alone I fall far short

I hope to have better self control in 2016. I hope to find some inspirations to push myself to wherever in future. I hope to recover from my sinister habits which have consumed my soul. And I hope to find solace in an ever bleak and ever changing world. 

To all those feeling down or have some resolutions, new year seems like the right time to start because it feels like a cleanslate. But always remember if you fall, everyday we wake up is another chance make us feel better about ourselves.

2016 is already beginning to slip into my life but I wonder what is there in life for me. I know I am fortunate in many ways, but the most important thing to me, companionship, has never been there no matter how I hard I try.

Let me start off with my looks. I am probably below average looking, and got told by enough people that I am ugly to believe that it's true. Companies have directly told me that I was rejected because the jobs require the person to meet clients and my looks don't cut it. My friends have also told me that it's difficult for others to break any ice when my looks don't make a good first impressions. You know at camps where people go around trading numbers? I'm that person who others never bothered asking. 

As if heavens is playing a prank on me, I have skin that is sensitive to heat and sweat (and dear Singapore always has plenty of those). When I start feeling hot or sweat, my scalp and occasionally my back itches terribly. And no matter how much I resist, the discomfort will show on my face and eventually I end up scratching like a monkey. I have seen a dermatologist for it, and the only advice he could give me is that for a permanent solution I should migrate to a place with cooler climate, and that medications can only do so much. That's why I am terribly afraid to go out into the sun and only hang out at night.

Personality wise, I am an introvert. I am the kind who feels like I am being a burden if I just approach others with the intentions of making friends (and they'd probably think I am creepy too), so I will sit at the canteen tables alone frequently, hoping someone would notice and come up and make friends with me. I guess it doesn't help being a male in this case. Also, as a person with limited social energy, I spend it  on a few people who appreciates it and intensely while at it. I am the kind of friend who is loyal to a fault, and who would pick up a call at 3am and rush over if the person needs me. But in return, I also expect them to do the same for me. But for most people who are extroverts, such a friendship is too intense and eventually it fades off when I feel the other party isn't giving enough. In fact I don't think I have found any of such friends in NUS. Which begs the question, do I even have people consider me as a friend in NUS.

I am the kind of person who would spend like a year just knowing someone just to decide if the person is compatible. However it always end up that if I ask them out after that one year, things get awkward and the friendship that has been built up over a year disappears in flash. That's why it feels like there's so much to lose. 

I don't need hundreds of people in my life, I just need a few who would always be there to have my back along with a special someone that I would give the world for. But it seems like there's nobody in my life. Is such a life worth living on? I've hinted that I need help a few times, but no one ever gets it or notices. I am just afraid that if I ask for help directly and I don't get it, that will be the last straw for me.

If you're dating someone, but not officially in a relationship yet, is it okay to look for friends with benefits?

I am dating this lady for awhile now. Although we are not officially gf bf yet, but recently I found out that she has a friend with benefit even now. They even met up last week for the benefit purposes.
I am not angry because she is not longer a virgin etc, infact I think can't be angry since we are not even in a relationship. I myself is not a virgin too, but I only have sex when I am in a relationship (might be a traditional thinking). So saying this, yes, I am abit uncomfortable about it.

I have not asked her about it. What should I do?

Question: So my bf confessed to me whilst he was still attached with his ex. I didn't accept of course, stating this is wrong but eventually he broke up and came to me. I gave him a chance and started a rs with him after 3 weeks of dating. 
So here comes his past biting. So me being the more innocent one, our common friends  (we've got quite a few) warned him not to play with my feelings and to warn me about him. So I found out that when he was attached with his ex, he visited dirty places to play when he went overseas. How far he went I don't know. But a few of our friends who went with him told me that he's not the kind of guy for me becoz he's the playboy type. 
So far 6 months into the rs, he has been great to me, faithful and all. But I just don't feel secure in the rs. Now there's still love, what happens when that fades? His character is such that when he speaks he's the flirty type and the things people tell me about him, makes me think whether I see a future with him or not. If he's the playboy type, who am I to say I have the power to make him change, make him loyal?
I dunno what to do . My friends say I'm just waiting for things to happen so that I can  move on. Should I continue to give us a chance, or let go?

Can a couple without much common interest get along well? I am afraid I will ran out of topic with her.
-
 
i needed some reassurance on what i am doing. I have known this girl whom i can really connect for nearly half a year but was rejected at the two months mark. I thought i could be friend with her and after awhile of awkwardness and silence, we were back to being close as before. Subconsiouly I was trying to be nice and hoping she would find how a great guy i was in the future(i know that sucks but i cannot help being nice to her)

however there is one incident which really hurt me because of the different expectations in this friendship. I am sure she doesnt know it or meant it and it could be a small matter as seen by outsiders. On one day While I was always trlling her about my travelling stories, she did not even bother to tell me she would be travelling e next day until i found out about it on facebook. I was still consoling her the day before when she complained that her parents do not allow her to go. I know she is not obligated to inform me but I still feel angry and stupid.

I know she only see me as a good friend but i feel that i am less important to her than she is to me. I used to text her everyday and it feels like i am the one who always tries to continuethe conversation. I am pretty tired of it but I do feel that she cares about me. She is a simple and not an expressive girl. I have tried to distance myself and stop replying to her texts. Hopefully my feelings will fade and i could be a genuine friendto her. Am i doing the right thing? Or should I continue texting her and being nice to her? I can tank these hurts. Although its painful but i would normally feel better after a few days. I am not too sure what is my threshold.

Sometimes I really wonder if anyone can be trusted in a relationship. 

I am a girl who appears soft-spoken and decent but yet I cheated.  On a crazy night out,  I succumbed to temptation and had a romp with one of my friends.  All this while I'm attached with a boyfriend waiting for me at home.  I feel guilty and afraid to be discovered but what can I do?  I just act all sweet and nice to my boyfriend and pretend nothing ever happened. 

The guy I cheated with appears so nice and sweet to his girlfriend but yet with me he was a beast.  No sign of guilt or any hesitation. He didn't just stop at physical cheating too.  Emotionally he reiterated how he likes me for my character and loves spending time with me. 

Maybe we are just really horrible people. But I find it increasingly common for people to cheat while maintaining a facade of normality.  Perhaps people have better acting skills these days.  It's scary.

Question here, what makes you feel loved in a relationship? Out of the 5 love languages, what if your SO shows their love that just isn't yours, do you just deal with it or do you ask them to change or....?
-
 
I thought I had given up on finding someone who I would be willing to settle down with. Then I met a girl I would gladly wife. But she's approaching the end of her exchange and we won't see each other for a long time. Sometimes I just want to smack life in the face.
-
 
Im a girl who has many guy friends , some of which we can hit off really well. However, im quite a cyber person , i can talk a lot on whatsapp and online platforms but irl , im actually shy and reserved. Sometimes, i will start to like my 'online' guy friends romantically but i know they don't feel the same. Its quite sad really , having many close guy friends... but tbh, i want a bf. People always tell me that i have a nice personality and im a very decent girl who is brought up really well. (Low maintenance and am a very family person)  is it that hard to get someone to like me romantically? :(
-
 
 I completely agree with you. I am an evergreen girl and I don't have any restrictions for a potential boyfriend such as looks, height etc. I just want a guy with a good personality, who loves me a lot, responsible and who will be financially stable in future. 

I will not torture him by making him carry my shopping bags or make him wait for hours while I wear make up. I wouldn't mind helping him if he has a lot of things to carry. Because I believe in a relationship, we are equals. I will trust him and respect his freedom, allow him to go out with friends and have his own life, at the same time showering him with a lot of love and care. 

I don't believe in gender stereotypes like guys always need to pay for dates and such stuff. I have done internships in the past and I hope to fulfil my career aspirations one day, so I would gladly pay for our dates to celebrate special occasions like his birthday.

Alas, I have been rejected more than once already. I don't know what's wrong with me. I guess I don't deserve to be loved. :'(

Guys talk about being friend-zoned, while i'm here being bro-zoned.. I told myself to never fall for any of these guys because i'm just a "bro" to them. 

I guess its because i'm tomboyish. My ex-boyfriend once told me his friends said that i am tom-boyish. I started wearing dresses since then whenever we went out. But i still prefer oversized shirts and shorts.

And.. I have more guy friends than girl friends. 
i only have 2 cliques of girl-friends but usually we talk about make up, which i barely know. However, I can click with their boyfriends instantaneously especially when we talk about how awesome Warriors is playing and how disappointing Man U is  - can LVG be sacked already? :(

Anyway, this has caused some problems with 1 friend of mine. His girlfriend is incredibly jealous and gives me the side eye whenever he's not looking. Trust me, i'm not even a threat to her because i'm in t-shirt and shorts/jeans all the time. Like, she wear pretty dresses and makeup, why should she feel threatened? I really tried making friends with her but yeah.. 

I don't know what am i ranting about - being single for 2 years and spending christmas alone? being too tomboyish? thats just my actual self. I like sports and i don't like makeup. is there any guy who likes a girl like that? please give me hope that i won't be single forever.

To OP of 14165. 

To share with you, I was like you previously. Went for circumcision because my GF like me to be cut as she don't like the look when I am not cut. To cut long story short, went for the surgery at a ripe old age of 24 years old for my GF sake. After surgery is another good 1 week of suffering. End up we broke up and there goes my skin. Cut dick bring about inconvenience and the pleasure is not there and you need lube if u wish to pcc else it can be painful.  Well I learnt to live with it but my advice to you is think twice thick thrice before u cut. 

I think my bro out there who are cut Can relate to how I feel. 
-
 
Well, hope this will not get filtered out, would like to seek opinion and advice from the guys, I am intending to go for circumcision as my gf prefer me to be cut. Should I?
-
 
 I know  already gave you advice but just want to agree as well! The pain is different for different girls. My boyfriend and I tried a few times but it was so painful I told him to stop. I asked advice from my girlfriends and they told me theirs wasn't painful. Eventually we persevered through my first time, and it was so painful I was kind of tearing, and we took about 30min. I couldn't enjoy it and I just felt like I kept needing to pee.

Even now, the penetration is sometimes painful, to the point where I can go from aroused to zero if he keeps going in and out, but the pain is less, and it gets better with time. If your boyfriend is caring he'll just take it slow with you and stop if you need to. Good luck! :)
-
 
 I don't know what that condition is, but I honestly suspect it is just the normal pain that some girls can expect when having sex for the first time. Different girls have different bodies and pain tolerance levels and obviously his size matters, etc. 

My first time was EXCRUCIATING. He actually took an hour to penetrate me completely, and this was after going real slow and being lubed up. Granted, he was huge. But it was also the first time I was being stretched out, so pain is inevitable. I was shrieking, struggling, sweating up a storm and whimpering throughout, ocassionally even asking him to pause because the burn was too much. I remember yelling in frustration, "How far in is it?!" And he was like, "Err...just the tip?" 

I was sore for a few days after and we didnt do anything then while I healed. 

The second time was still very painful, but it took a MUCH shorter time. So you can feel the improvement, so to speak. Third time, no pain whatsoever. I even asked him to go faster, and he was so surprised he laughed. 

And subsequently after, my sex life as I know it has never been the same again. :)

My point is, maybe you're feeling the same way I do. Maybe you just have to grit your teeth and pull through the first one or two painful times as you get stretched out. Make sure he goes slow and is well lubed (because you sure as hell aint gonna be wet in that much pain). All the best.

To  Hello! This is #laoniang. Thank you for the compliment. But I would have to politely decline your invitation to meetup. Have a nice day!
-
 

I was in the same boat too. I think it depends. I usually don't like initiating conversations, especially with someone I just met because I don't want to come across as annoying/burdensome. Generally it's because I'm not sure of what the other party thinks of me. 
But once the other party starts the conversation, I'd definitely try to reply, (plus because sometimes I've been waiting as well). 
-
 
I can do small talk with anyone, but find it difficult to move beyond it to more meaningful conversation, the kind that really connects you to that person. I see so many people who can just talk about things, which aren't as shallow as other people, or just everyday happenings. Any advice?
-
 
I don't have any good friends in NUS.

What I mean to say is, I know people who are friendly towards me, will work on projects, talk about homework, and discuss ideas. If I say hi to them, they will smile and wave back. So, I guess I only have colleagues.

However, as soon as school is out, all of them disappear. Nobody wants to meet up and chill. Want to watch Star Wars? They have already planned it with their girlfriends, or just other friends. Want to go to this place? Sorry, I'm busy. Can't make it. Hey, check out this piece of news; sorry, I'm not interested.

Actually, I don't have any friends at all. In NS, nobody in my section has come to NUS. From my JC class, only a couple of girls came to NUS, and you know what NS does to these relationships. A few went to NTU, and other universities. The people I used to be very close with, simply drifted away. So now I go everywhere and do everything alone.

I could join a club, but I have no particularly strong interest in anything outside of the major I'm studying. It seems that nobody I know is in it for the interest and academia; the people I know are just here to earn that piece of B.S. paper. They generally don't want to talk about it outside school, so I don't really have anything to say to them.

So here I am, alone in the evening, writing this on my laptop over fast food dinner, and maybe someone will read it. Maybe you will say something nice, maybe you will say something nasty; but as long as someone has seen it, that makes me happier.
-
 
I can't shake off the feeling that my boyfriend is cheating on me. I snoop on his phone every now and then but I find nothing. However I did find certain other disturbing things (not porn) on his phone that perhaps cause this feeling. I've brought it up to him before but he simply tells me I'm being needy and insecure but doesn't reassure me. I overread into the things he say to the point where I myself am no longer sure if I'm overreading or not. Please advise.
-
 
Talking about evergreen. I am never green. Or at least green for a few months then red again. I am trying my best to stay single. That is my goal. But it is harder than you think. When you have more than one person trying to get your attention and in the end you somehow get involved in things. I think it is also partly my fault. I do fall in love easily. Not because I am love addict or something. I just wear my heart on my sleeves which means I get hurt easily. I just recently broke up. And I am so determined to be single at least a year. But...I have three people expressing their interests now. And they all asked me for dates. Two I politely said no but they kept trying. So I am just friendly with them. And they are really trying. Sending me texts everyday. Calling me (which is pretty crazy!!!!). One I went on a friendly date. I didn't like him in romantic sense. But he seems like the guy I could be friends with. I dunno if I am being too nice or too friendly but I don't have the heart in me to reject them so harshly or ignore them. I feel that it is not polite. But I wanna remain single. And I am scared if these people keep trying too hard and I give them a chance to get to know each other, there is a danger of falling in love. After all, they are not all bad. Fun personalities, caring and kind and bonus, attractive.  Interesting people. It just sucks I am not ready now. But at the same time, I don want to lose their friendship. Haiz, advice pls? 

-
 
I am chasing this girl for two months and I am in a dilemma whether to continue seeing her. She is someone that is nice and sweet in general but I feel that she listens to her friends excessively. She told me stories about her previous relationships and how her friends advised her on this and that. Listening to her stories made me feel as though she did not commit herself into those relationships. Has anyone dated such girls? 

-
 
Re: 
Being fat is so frustrating. You have people who keep asking you to eat less. Whenever I hear people losing weight, I feel so jealous that they can lose weight so easily. ( though I do not wish to be skinny, just want to hit that healthy weight range )

The worst part is when people pick on you just because you look weak and incompetent. I get annoyed when people tell me that they can easily outrun me or that they let me off just because I look unfit. Wth you already picked on me, then you let me off as if I cannot also be physically capable? 

I exercise 3x/week minimum. I eat fewer than 2000 calories per day. I can out run my slim friends. I can swim farther, I can do more burgess, more pull ups, more push ups. My body weight is my concern, not yours. 
-
 
My closest female friend ever has just gotten back her N level results. She missed out on PFP by 2 pts, and can either go to sec 5 or ite. As im worried she will mix with bad company in ite like how she did in secondary school as i cannot always watch over, i tried telling her to take the sec 5 o lvl route. Similarly, her brother thought the same as me, but her sister thought otherwise to go to ITE. Her parents dont give a shit. 

However, she insists on going to ITE to take business and go on with law in poly.

What do you guys think? Please help me by commenting bwlo which you think its best for me to convince her! Thank you

#datingstoriesbylaoniang

Laoniang is experiencing some inertia when it comes to writing this series of dating stories. How many more stories do you all want to hear? If you’re getting bored, I’ll just skip to the end. Please let me know. Anyway..….here’s one for the road.

4. The Gentleman

“Hello!” I said with a wave, as I walked up to Glenn. He was taller than I expected and had a boyish face.

“Hi!” he replied with a smile. “Where do you want to go for coffee?”

“I don’t know, I’m fine with anything really.” I shrugged, looking towards him for suggestions.

“Okay, let’s go to Dean and Deluca then. Their coffee’s not bad.”

Prior to our date, I had talked to Glenn for a month on WhatsApp. From our month-long conversation, I could tell that he was a very down to earth guy. He was family and friend-oriented, loved travelling and had a stable job. I really enjoyed talking to him, as I knew that he wasn’t trying to impress me or pretend to be some nice guy. This was really who he was. Naturally I was very nervous to meet him. After such a long build-up, after wondering what he was like in real life for such a long time, it was time to finally 
a) Have my expectations shattered 
b) Be blown away by Glenn in real life

We entered D&D and looked around for a table. Once we found one, he pulled out the chair for me with a smile. Not a weird smile. It was a genuine smile. The kind that moves from your lips to your cheeks, reaching the eyes. I know this sounds cringe-worthy, but in that moment, I felt shy. When a guy treats you like a princess through simple gestures of chivalry, it’s a wonderful feeling. Who doesn’t like being treated like a precious gem?

At the counter, I intentionally stood behind him so that he wouldn’t get to pay for my coffee. He very smoothly asked for my order before paying for his and paid for our orders together. I insisted on paying him back, trying to slide a ten dollar note towards him but failed.

“I’m already working, you’re still in school. Let me pay,” he said with smiling eyes, pushing back my note.

We talked about travelling, music, our friends and family, school, work. It was a well rounded conversation. He told me about his travels in New York. But despite him being such a nice and well-mannered guy with good principles, I did not feel any strong chemistry as we talked over coffee. You know what I’m talking about? How at some points in life, you meet people that you just click with and want to be friends with for a long time. The chemistry comes naturally, both parties feel it, both parties treasure the relationship and want to fortify it. It just wasn’t like that with Glenn and I felt disappointed. Chemistry is so important. When it’s not there, you just know it. You can’t force someone out of the friendzone. Some people just don’t fit well together romantically.

After the date, Glenn and I still talked to each other on WhatsApp. I did not want to lead him on, so I friendzoned him.

“I like you as a friend, Glenn. I’m sorry that we did not work out romantically though,” I typed apologetically. I turned off my phone, hid it in my closet and walked away. Half an hour later, I gingerly retrieved my phone to read his reply.

To my surprise, Glenn replied in an objective and positive tone.
“Thank you for telling me that. I’m surprised you told me so directly though, most girls are not as bold as you are. It would be nice if they were more forward! You’re a sweet girl and I’d love to remain friends,” he replied.

Till this day, Glenn and I remain friends. I’m glad I met him. Glenn taught me that chivalrous guys still exist. Glenn taught me about myself, that I like chivalrous men very much as good manners go a long way in life. Glenn is a type of guy that I would bring home to meet my parents. 

The little things go a long way. Something as small as holding open a door for another, pulling out the chair for something, paying for coffee – all these are small gestures that speak of a person’s character. Do these things and also look out for these things in others, in your pursuit of love.

 Till the next story, LN.

Who do you guys turn to talk about relationship problems when your partner doesn't like that you talk to others about your relationship.

The amount of pain I feel when my bf does smth even when he knows that I will not like it. 
-
 
Recently i have a few friends that got attached. These came as surprises to me because i didn't even know that they love or even like their new bfs. we have had heart to heart talks about guys and they didnt even mention any of those guys. this makes me feel that they will just accept anyone (they dont even like) that confess to them because they are afraid of being left on the shelf. I understand that feeling when someone confess to you. you feel important, special and wanted. but all these feelings are not love! it is just an ego-booster! i feel that it is rather irresponsible of them to accept these guys just because they want the attention and they will just leave them if the one appears in the near future.

,
Seriously? You don't deserve your girlfriend at all! She saves it for you, (assuming she eventually marries you) and you're cheating behind her back?! The most outrageous thing is you don't even seem to be guilty at all!!

Relationship is about trust. Yes, some guys can be sexually needy, but do they ALL cheat on their girlfriends????? You don't respect your girlfriend at all. You don't love her. She deserves better. 

Your "totally in love with" makes me feel disgusted.
-
 
They say University is the place to get a bf, but I guess it wont be easy for that to happen in a faculty dominated by girls. What's worse is that I am totally inactive on social media (I don't enjoy posting about my life) , joined a cca dominated by girls, and have girlfriends that are really low profile too (in real life and social media). It's my final year in NUS now, and they say, it will be harder to find the right one when I'm swamped with work in the future. This is depressing, especially during this festive period.
-
 
Tldr: this post only directed to one person so I guess everyone else should skip this if you feel that nobody wants to tell you anything HAHAHA lol

Gonna post this here because I don't think there's a better way to get through to you??? I've been thinking and trying to piece everything together and I finally found the closure that I needed. I guess I told you my decision a week ago and to be honest, bulk of it was based on gut feeling, intuition and most importantly past experience that things will not work out in the long run. Remember I told you I had many question marks in my head? Yes now that I have the space and clarity to think carefully I realised why I actually made that decision. And I've realised it's actually so much more than just religious issues. Sorry I didn't have the time to think through all this carefully during the sem because I was so busy studying??? Like how I didn't notice you were into me to begin with LOL so dense my gosh. You said you were looking for someone supportive in everything you do. I cannot be that person and I'm sorry. 

We talked a lot about whether we want to wait for each other since we loved each other but I'm here to tell you, 放弃吧. And you should never change for me even though I may have made it sound like I wanted you to change - sorry again, but I did feel your sincerity tho. There will be someone out there who will love you for who you are and most importantly the things you do, someone who will fulfill all 4/4 of your criterias and you totally deserve her.

I will always be real to you and if you really want to find out the other reasons why I will tell you, but ask me in 6 months time ok, since we both agreed to distant ourselves. Hope you're doing fine now.

I think I've dropped enough hints (*hint hint*) to let you know this confession is for YOU plus this is the way I always type so you should know. I laugh in caps, HAHAHA.

No hard feelings, even after everything that has happened. I hope you don't hate me too.

I'm a 20 y/o evergreen girl, and I've been talking to this guy who is 3 years older than me. I've been asked out by several guys these few years, but I'm very introverted and somehow I just find it really difficult to get close to people, especially those whom I know have an interest in me - it's almost like a reflex for me to push them away.

We started off as friends, started talking randomly one day and we've been talking every day since for about 3 months now, and this is the first time I've ever wanted to see and talk to a guy as much as him. He makes me smile even when he isn't around, and he makes me laugh even when I feel like I'm having the worst day of my life. 

But I can't say for sure that I'm in love. Infatuated maybe, but not in love. How could I be?

I've been struggling with depression for 2 years (it's on and off now) and there are some days when bouts of depression will just suddenly hit me. Some days I feel like they're the best of my life, but at night for no reason at all, I think about how worthless I am and that I want to kill myself. The sad part is that he has never been there for me.

Whenever I show hints of unhappiness or looking like I need some cheering up, he avoids me and pretends he can't tell. His replies become shorter, as though he doesn't want to talk and it just hurts me sometimes. He just can't seem to talk feelings.

Yet, I'm desperately trying to convince myself otherwise. I tell myself, you haven't known him long enough yet for him to want to be there for you. He's afraid of showing he cares too much. But he makes you so happy during other times - do you really want to give him up? I say, give him a few more months. Maybe then he'd know better. But am I just deluding myself? 

My gut tells me he isnt the one (though my heart believes otherwise, of course.) The truth is, I'm scared. I don't know if I will ever find anyone who makes me as happy as he does anymore. But with my condition, I can't just have a "fair-weather boyfriend". I don't know how to feel anymore. 

Am I just being paranoid and jumping to conclusions to soon? Or should I pull away before any damage can be done to either of us?

I'm currently in a company with a high turnover rate. My boyfriend has been asking me about my career plans because he feels that this company is not going to be a conducive workplace for me to grow. He says things like 'Do u want to remain in your role forever and be a nobody or do u want to be an achiever?'. Thing is, for me, I feel that currently I have been given chances in my company, that many have not had, and there are still things I can do and learn in my company. He says that I'm not looking far, all I can see is what I'm going to do tomorrow, and not planning for the future. I admit I don't have a solid career plan laid out yet, so I feel like he's putting so much expectations on me and questioning my decisions while I've been nothing but supportive of his career decisions. And so these talks with him are not really unpleasant and he thinks he that I'm being petty that I'm not really happy when we talk about this. Any advice?

I got cheated on. 

I should have realised- how he always made sure his phone was angled perfectly so I couldn't see who he was texting, how he disappeared for hours at a time with no explanation, how he wasn't okay with public displays of affection and was never okay with calling me his girlfriend. He would always walk really close to me but we would never hold hands. He would call me terms of endearment but I only received text messages when he felt like it. 

I thought I was special.

We've ended things and sometimes I see him walking around campus with different girls. It's a different girl every two or so days. Sometimes they walk really close, brushing shoulders, other times they're touching each other here and there. 

I know he makes these girls feel special- like they're the only one he cares about, but I wish they knew the truth. I don't have the guts to talk to them, but I am genuinely concerned for them. This guy forcefully took my first kiss, touched me without my consent and toyed with my feelings. I came out of that relationship broken and I don't want this to happen to other girls as well.

I'm an attached girl but my boyfriend isnt in my clique in school because our timetables clash a lot. i spend more time with my friends within that clique than my boyfriend and i realised one of the guys in the clique likes me and i think i might like him too, is this feeling fleeting? :( should i be worried?

Please teach me how to not feel anxious each time my boyfriend goes out clubbing without me? When he goes, I get very scared of something happening. Worse, something happening and him not telling me/me not finding out. Clubs in general seem to me like places people go to hook up, where attached people pretend they're single.

I know people will say to just "trust him". But he broke my trust once (though not girl-related) when he lied about something else.

 I recognize that this is a fault of mine. Please teach or advise me how not to feel this way? :( :(

i have a problem albeit not as important as the possibility of Donald Trump becoming a dictator in the world's history. The problem is I am pretty. It is quite embarrassing to praise oneself but it is the truth acknowledged by many friends and people so to those who are rolling their eyes, skip this confession please. Thank you. I think being pretty is a curse in disguise. Guys seem to be attracted to my looks and do not really try to get to know the me inside. In my past relationships, I feel like I am being treated like a trophy or a conquest. And it is sickening. I am tired of it. I am tired of attracting wrong attention. (I don't  wear skimpy clothes, not that kind of attention). And I don't know how to tell if a guy is simply attracted to my looks or my personality. I have been hurt like this more than once and this is making me scared of dating or giving chances to potential boyfriends. And this amounts to major trust issues which are not exactly helping me in relationships. And now I want to stop dating or just give up on finding love. I am just going to be a hermit and get CAP 5 next semester. I swear I am giving up on guys. Waste of my time and my brain cells.

I now have three guys in my life. 

The first dude is the one I truly want. He is generous, ambitious and hardworking. I can see the potential in him though may not have the best start in life. However, I do feel his interest dwindling. He is no longer as affectionate as he used to be, though he still cares for me very much, and I could tell that he was willing to accommodate my requests whenever I sound out that could do better in some specific aspects. His drive is both a bane and boon to me. As much as I like his motivation, I would very much prefer that he spends more time with me like he did before. It hurts me greatly to see that I am not as important to him as I used to be. And I am very much aware that I am in no position to demand more than what he has been giving. 

Guy two on the other hand, is extremely sweet. He is very much unlike guy one in all aspects. He does not possess the drive to excel, even though he was given more to start off with. And unlike One's dwindling effort, Two has been nothing but nicer to me over time. I don't have any space left in my heart to even attempt to accommodate Two, for One has been taking up the space for a very long time now. 

And there's Three, who is just a little short of being an ass. I don't like him much He has been trying to get me to go to his place for while now. I have been tempted to accede to his request a few times now, and to nobody's surprise, One is usually the cause of the problem.

A month ago, an incident happened at work that made me realise I cannot stay at the company any further. Now i find myself dreading work and dragging myself out of my bed every morning. I feel that this job is taking a huge toll on my mental health each passing day but I also have bills to pay. What should I do?

It takes courage to ask a girl on a date, rejection is just part and parcel of life. Choose to face it and it will make a person stronger, choose to deny it and it will make a person weaker.  You don't only have one shot, instead you have multiple shots.  
-
 
Do guys generally land a verdict in the beginning on whether they will like a girl or not, or is it possible for their feelings to develop over time as they spend more time together (even if he mentioned before that he will never like the girl)?
-
 
I have a boyfriend but my best friend might be the one for me. My boyfriend and I don't have much chemistry although he's sweet to me. But there are a lot of compatibility issues that are hard to overcome and he doesn't seem aware of them. My best friend and I are in sync on so many levels- we think alike, share the same views, can have long intellectual conversations and share laughs but I'm not attracted to him physically. I love him as a friend but he likes me more than that I know. I don't know if I should stick with my boyfriend or be with my friend. Maybe it's just better to be alone.

So I was rejected by a girl. (Basically I was friendzoned) I can still see her during some classes for one more semester. Should I work harder to attract her or should I avoid her as much as possible? There will be opportunities for me to talk to her but I can choose not to if I want. I don't think I stand a chance to be with her considering how deep I'm in the friendzone but at the same time I find it really hard to let go of this chance. (Even if it's a 1% chance)

What's with all the confessions talking about ppls longing for a person who made a choice to walk away from you? 

Like obviously they no longer want to be part of your life anymore so stop spending your own time and energy on thinking about those people. 

Yea I know it's hard but come on guys/ girls, have some self respect and self value. You guys are worth so much more than that. 
Let it go, love yourself and don't let them occupy your heart and mind anymore. They left. They are gone and they will not return. 
Turn the page, Build a bridge, the analogies goes on and on. 

Stop making yourself anymore worthless than you are already are. 
Sorry for the blunt words, but someone got to say it and I'll be the bad guy here who will knock this truth into everyone's head.

You survived years living by yourself without that person so you can definitely get yourself back up. 
Stop hoping and start living for yourself.

Thanks I'm out.

I cant even tell whether I like him as a best guy friend or a crush :o I care about him a lot and like to know more about him but I'm confused whether that's just like super best friend love or I'm interested in him..

I give up. I think I will never find a soulmate. To all those who will say be patient etc well I have waited long enough. I am a girl by the way. Maybe my looks are a turn off. Maybe I am the designated ugly girl in the group. I joined tinder and other dating apps and have yet to receive a reply from anyone and its been weeks. (i have been swiping right btw) I guess I am just meant to be single for life :(

I've been hurt in my previous relationship that lasted more than a year. I realised my then-boyfriend didn't love me the whole time but neither of us initiated a break up. I hung on to him but he hurt me (emotionally and verbally) in the end and eventually we drifted apart. Now, I have an amazing boyfriend and we've been together for 6 months. He is great and I have every reason to trust him, but sometimes I just get so afraid that he'll hurt me although I know he won't. He's not a rebound or anything, I was single for almost a year before finding him. Is this relationship anxiety/insecurity? How do I get over it? I have fallen so hard in love without knowing it and I'm so afraid at the same time... My boyfriend has done all he can to try and convince me that he won't hurt me, but the negative thoughts and feelings keep coming :(

My crush stopped watching my snapchat videos and stopped liking my Facebook pics after I confessed to her. :'(

My boyfriend just told me he started watching girls on webcam. I never had an issue with porn, weve always been very open and watch it together... but webcam shows.... its such a different story. He can actually interact with them, and the fact that its "live broadcast" makes it so much more personal and intimate...
The worst part is that I cant even explain why it upsets me so much???
Do guys ever fall for girls on webcam??? Am i overthinking???

Being a partner for someone with depression is crazily tough. 

He has been having a relapse lately and all my spare time is spent worrying about him and doing my best to do my part in caring for him. Worst part is nobody understands it. People assume he is doing this on purpose to hurt me. No. He wouldnt hurt me like this if he could help it. He has never ever done anything to hurt me unless he is in relapse. 

People think i got myself into this situation and thus i deserve no pity. I dont want any pity. I need support. I need care. I just need people to understand and see him for the amazing person he is who is just battling this illness right now. I need someone to tell me this is temporary. He will get better with time and he will go back to be the amazing guy i fell in love with. I dont need people telling me to leave.

Once upon a time, there was a girl who liked a guy and his laughter was a question she wanted to spend her life answering. He was cute , smart,funny, and has his own legion of followers. They could spend hours talking about anything under the moon. But with each moment passing, she hasn't a clue if she's really the one meant to find the answer .

11. And am I really wondering if I'm on an one-way road towards depression? Yes.

Been together with my SO for about two months now. I consider myself selectively conservative as my personal belief is no premarital sex, and my SO is aware of it and respects my wishes. However, I recently learnt that my SO is not a virgin (though he told me otherwise before we got together). Furthermore, SO is very open to any form of physical contact with his female friends (sleeping on the same bed, hugging). While I understand all physical contact does not have any ulterior motives backing it, I can't help but feel uneasy about this whole situation, and I don't know if it is even appropriate or necessary to broach this topic since it might just be my insecurities. Any advice?

Many students have come forward to say that they have gone through the similar experience as the OP who is going through an abortion. And it is important that we all girls have to learn to protect our bodies and try our best from reaching a point in making a tough decision such as abortion. We should be well knowledged about the preventions if we are going to be sexually active. I am not some expert at this subject but I would like to give some tips to girls out there. Download a period calendar. Regularly key in your period. It will calculate your fertile window and your average cycle length. Do not have sex during your fertility window. Even with condom. Try to stay away from sex during this period. And at other times when you have sex, if condom breaks or leaks, quickly go get plan B emergency pill within 24 hours. If you really want to feel more safe, consult a doctor and get birth control pills and use it with condom to have maximum protection. Or you can just stay away from intercourse. Abstinence till you both are sure and mature in your relationship. You don't have to have intercourse to have a healthy sexual relationship. There are many other ways to please a partner. Talk it out with your Boyfriend and he will understand your concerns and paranoia if he loves you.

 It is probably impossible because I doubt he would even know about NUSwhispers, but you really sound like my Prince. 

Throughout this whole time, I have been waiting for a text from you.

 People choose to do different things in life. Sometimes these are the things which really separate us from each other. 

We tattoo our tits, pierce our nipples, turn gay, lesbian, have an abortion (or not). But why are you trying to guilt trip people who went for abortions? Because you did not, and you think it's wrong? 

Calm down man. Maybe what you did was the best thing for your situation, but that doesn't mean it would have been the best thing for the other OPs. This type of thing does not have a unique solution.

Have any of you felt like some people do things for you, because they feel like they are supposed to(like relatives)? Or they(friends) know how lonely you are so they think they're doing you a favour by going out with you or organising a party for you. Not out of care or love but just pity. I feel extremely uncomfortable in situations like this. Don't they realise that by doing all this, you're making me feel a lot worst?

You look so cute when you smile. When you talk about your project or about cars. When your friends tease you or when you see food. When you are trying to stay awake in lectures or even when you are dead tired camping in the lab to do your project. 
This semester has been tiring for me, But whenever I feel tired or lost, somehow looking at you and your passion gives me the energy and drive to keep carrying on. But I guess I won't get to see you anymore next sem as I'll be on IA while you would still be stuck in the lab doing your project. I think I like you, and I guess your friends sense it before I knew it myself. And was sorry I didn't handle all the teasing all that well. 

But with you being so busy with your work and me going to try out new projects, I guess it won't even go anywhere. Just happy seeing your smiling face once in a while, so please post on snapchat more often ahah. It sucks that I won't get to see you almost everyday and that I couldn't be a closer friend to you.

 I've been camping at level 6 of CLB for this semester and I've noticed this rather tall, bespectacled and pretty (Korean/SNSD pretty) girl around. However, she tends to study with a guy (can't remember if it's always the same one) but I guess it's natural for a pretty girl to be surrounded by guys! Anyway, if you happen to be referring to me (I'm not sure how to handle being referenced as having a similar look to Justin Bieber though), I'll definitely still be hanging around level 6 at CLB! Hope to see you there next semester! :)

Hey op of , I understand that you are going through a really tough time and it would be great if you can involve your bf for support. It is important that you know that you have done nothing wrong. And I wish you the best. I would love to talk to you and offer you some advice and support if there is some way for us to get in touch? Meanwhile, take care. Abortion at an early fetal age is pretty straightforward. So don't worry too much.

Two persons : him and him. Both are now the toxic in my life. Hurting one, but couldn't bear the fact that I have to hurt him. Trying not to hurt another, but have to hurt him nonetheless. 

Yes, I am a cheater. And it is the skeleton in my closet. One of them knows, the other doesn't.

All it took was just a hug, and I felt the comfort and warmth I've longed for. I allowed him to kiss me, just because I want to be loved the way he does now. Oh, how I've longed for it!

And him? He wonders why we broke up so abruptly. 

I know you have opinions on cheaters. Yes, you who won't understand the pain of being under-appreciated again and again, the sleepless nights, the struggles to change into someone he wanted but just couldn't do it well enough (and we end up quarreling), the endless insecurities of being with him, and the countless times I cried. 

I just want to be loved.

 I read your long post and let me tell you, please do not feel guilty for sharing this and do write part B. It will make you feel better. You must be having a lot of courage to be able to describe your sad feelings in words and share it. Also, no need to look for likes. Your worth does not depend on them. Write what you feel like and don't care so much about what other people think. There are some people (like me) who read your post but are too shy to like because they wouldn't want to reveal their identity.

I have been in your situation before. Exactly like that. From your text messages, I feel that you were normal friends earlier but after a certain point, you began to sound pushy, especially when you asked whether she got your message. She is not into you. It is  painful to accept, but you have to accept it. She may have figured out that you like her and she doesn't want to lead you on, so she avoids you. Girls are quite sensitive at noticing these things.

I know you feel sad because she prefers J over you. It has NOTHING to do with you dude. It didn't work out because there was no chemistry. Don't try to analyse further. Don't compare yourself with J in terms of wealth, looks etc. You are what you are and that is what makes you unique. Someday some girl will love you for who you are and accept your financial status.

Reduce contact with A. Don't text her so often. Let it go and move on. It is painful but you need to accept the reality. You have better things in store for yourself. This is not the end of the world. She wasn't the right one. Not saying she is good or bad, she just wasn't the one for you. Leave it to fate. Love will come and find you. You don't have to chase it. It will be very obvious when you love a girl and she loves you back and it will happen someday. Just don't lose hope. :)

In the meantime, don't feel sad about having crushes. It is very normal and it adds to your experience. Remember, the pain that doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In the future, you will recall these memories and pat yourself on the back for having the strength to overcome disappointments in life.

Sometimes i really wonder why people are so quick to judge people even before they know them . I am together with this Indian classmate of mine for 2 years. My mother always gave that stereotypical sentence of " Indian men will beat their wives" and " his mum will never accept you" Which is extremely untrue and discriminatory, He has been the sweetest guy on earth, who will always take trouble to drop me off at my doorstep and waited for my text before driving off. He will help out at family events as well and always treated me with care and respect. However, we do have out occasional fights as well, and she will immediately go " See his temper is so bad, typical". What nonsense, every couples have fights, not just a certain race. She was always going on about why i could not find a Chinese guy and she is also embarrassed about the fact that my boyfriend is Indian. Even during Chinese new year visits, she will always avoid the topic of boyfriends with my relatives, " just because he is Indian". Hey c'mon guys , race doesn't ever make anyone inferior period. Your attitude makes you inferior.And my boyfriend is a gem.

Reply to 
Three years ago, my mom said similar things to me too. Back then, my bf was still studying an engineering course, not having a spectacular GPA(he was in NTU), but I was getting pretty good results in my JC back then. He had no idea of where his future lies. He said he might want to take some fitness training teaching course and become a private trainer next time. He was just very uncertain of what he's gonna become in future. To make things worse, we came from very very different family background too. My family is considered wealthy? But he has divorced parents and his parent not earning 1/5 of what my dad brought in every month. Do no take my wrongly, just want to lay the background out to let you know how different we were, but I had never ever looked down on my bf. I do not believe in 门当户对 but what's more important is, a couple needs to have similar future aspects.

My mom told me not to be so serious. She thought my bf didn't seem like a reliable nor responsible person. She did not foresee us having a good future together. She thought he would not be able to take care of me(especially financially). We stayed in private properties ever since young, but my bf stays in a HDB flat. She told me, I would never get used to staying in such a small flat without all the facilities and bigger space and luxurious feeling. She was very very skeptical and it really broke my heart when she told me that. She had her points and I had to agree with her whatever flaws she mentioned about my bf were absolutely right. However, I had faith in my bf.

Three years later today, my bf got a scholarship and signed on. He is earning more than 4K per month now and I am very proud of his achievements. His family background is still the same but again, that's not important to me. His mom loves me and treats me very well. My mom has changed her view to him and unofficially agreed on my decision to take him as my future spouse.

I just want to say, the condition now may not be well but if you have faith in your bf, things will only get better. All the best!

I had an interview a few weeks back, and I would like to share something that really struck a chord in me.

It was a skype interview for a career opportunity overseas. The interviewer asked me a very interesting question: "share with me a life lesson that you have learnt in university. I do not want to hear those standard 'teamwork' or 'time management', tell me something more personal. Don't worry, it doesn't have to be work-related." After clarifying what he wanted, I took a minute to think about it and this is what I to shared (or almost).

I learnt about hate. 
I learnt how people fight with one another over CAP, over the bell curve, at the canteen to queue up, boarding the ever-crowded NUS shuttle bus. I hated them. 
I learnt to hate certain professors for their style of teaching. I've learnt to hate certain modules as their content is incredibly dry and boring. 
I've seen how cliques break apart. I've seen how friends become enemies due to hate. I've seen how couples become strangers due to hate (a lot in fact). I've seen how people backstab one another just to get the better of one another. I've seen how people avoid one another because they hate another.
I've learnt to hate the flaws of our education system. I've learnt to hate the NUS negative academic environment and pressures. I've learnt to hate people and things around me.

Bringing this hate out of university, it becomes a reality in the working world. We fight with our colleagues for results, to prove that we are better, we hate them if we lose. We hate having to pretend to like our colleagues even though we dislike them.
We hate fighting with all other people to get to/from work. We hate the social pressures of having to 'fit-in'. 
We hate our bosses because we feel that they are unreasonable or terrible leaders. We hate the working pressures to keep your job. We hate having to meet the KPIs set by our bosses. 
This hate that I learn from university, it simulates the working world. This hate drives us. It pushes us to outdo one another, but at the same time it demotivates us. This hate, is powerful.

But at the same time, I learnt about love.
I love how people, just strangers, come together at the start of their university lives to become friends, forming cliques and going through hardship together. I love how lively and vibrant the university is with activities happening all around. I love the freedom when it comes to studying. I love the fact that I have the opportunity to have fun with my friends everyday at school. I love how NUS provides convenient transportation services despite the overdemand at peak periods. I love how we are all driven to perform our best during examination. I love the cheap and delicious food in NUS. I love the people around me, looking past their flaw and seeing their beauty, their sincerity and friendliness. I love seeing how people find love in school, a few of them (seniors) are engaged/married now. I love the fact that we are one of the most recognised education systems in the world.
I've learnt to love people and things around me.

This love. I will love it if I have the courage and ability to apply this to my future career. Will I be able to? Will I love my job? Will I love my colleagues and boss? How powerful can this love be? Only time will time.

I believe most of us hate readily, but I urge everyone to try and love as well. It seems to be easier to be a hater than a lover. A simple act of commenting on NUSWhispers, how many of you are haters and how many of your are lovers? 
How many of us will be able to say that we love more than we hate? I know I myself cannot say for sure. What about you? Do think about this and reflect and share your story if you want to. You never know if one day someone asks you this question for interview!

She is called #.

Recently I got to know #. She was quite beautiful. I gained an interest in her looks and personality.

Two weeks passed and # actually asked if I fell for her. I answered yes. She said she'd only allow me to continue the relationship if I give her "one good night of fun".

I haven't exactly asked her what it means, but I've no idea.

Please help.

I am sick and tired of being the bottom of my friend's list. Every time i ask him to do something with me, he always seems to have an excuse to not be able to make it. I feel like i'm completely not even regarded as a friend, that he will gladly meet with his other friends but not me, rather play games than do anything with me. He's rude and never admits he's wrong. Or if he did, he always gives the "i'm just not this kind of person, so dont expect anything from me" kind of answer. 

I know i should stop contacting him completely, but i dont have much other friends. Tell me how do i get over him and make healthier friends? Esp now that i've alr graduated. Please keep your witty and mean comments to yourself, i am already feeling down as it is.

Well said. Then again, some girls love being 清高 by saying that they have saved it blablabla. Like as if it was such a big deal. 

Its already the 20th century, who cares whether you saved it or not. People lead different lives so stop putting yourself at a high pedestal by saying "oh im so ashamed but phew i didnt lose it, but i did other things". 

IMO, virginity is not only just about the hymen. If a girl has done any kind of sex e.g oral, heavy petting etc, you are already not a virgin. 

Saving your hymen does not mean anything. At the same time, losing your hymen does not mean anything bad either. It just means that they have loved and lost, or that they love their current partner and want to take it to the next stage.

Sure, you should not pressure a girl to give you her first time, but if it happens, it will happen. Virginity is just a social construct to prevent people from overpopulating. Before such constructs, people married at age 15/16. 

Nuff said.

Well the thing is, how physically closer can you be with someone other than sex? How more "open" emotionally and physically can you be?

Personally, I keep it because I believe that I want to share it only with one person whom I love and who loves me so much that we have promised to commit to each other through thick and thin to the end ( i'm one of those who do not believe in divorce). Why would I share a special moment with someone who does not reach that level of closeness? I think that kind of love that requires commitment deserves to be celebrated. Our culture often describes love as merely a feeling or emotion. I think love is more than that.

Also, even if the notion that "sex/ vitginity is valuable" is a social construct, so what? what's wrong with that?( I do not think it is, though, I think it is there for a reason) Why can't I keep some part of me special and reserved? A VIP room is special because people set aside a special area for special people, and only certain people can come in. It makes it special. Why can't we reserve sex for a special person who deserve it? Sure we can save other moments, i guess, though as of now i can't think of anything better. 

Based on experience, I regretted that I kissed my ex. I shared a moment with someone that I barely talk to now. I do not regret it to the point that I see myself as not pure anymore etc etc or that it affects my self-esteem etc. Just that I wished I did not easily share that intimate moment with someone in the heat of the moment. Probably because I want to see it as more than just physical pleasure and I think it is an expression of love (and I think love requires commitment)

On the topic of rape, I agree that a raped woman is not of less value than a virgin. I know the pain and shame is extremely hard to bear with, but demeaning sex/ virginity is not the answer. Like, even children who do not even understand what sex means are traumatised by sexual abuse. Their tendency is to avoid the rapist. They sure do not like it. It is natural to feel sad/traumatised when you are sexually abused. 
Just like when people are slashed, they bleed, they feel pain. 
Would we say that "it's okay,the cut will heal anyway " and do nothing? 
No, we should recognise that it is a painful experience and try as much as we can to heal them, though we cant do it completely. There will still be unsightly scars that make them want to hide at home
People who look down on the victims are like those who mock the slash victim because of the physical scars.
 It is unsightly, maybe. We might have to admit that rape victims might have emotional scars that affects them.
Instead of dismissing their pain, we should show compassion, understanding and empathy. Each of us are broken in some ways anyway.

Do you choose the person you really want but run the risk of rejection or choose the one who loves you a lot but you know you will not love as much as the one you really want?

If you are wondering how I'm doing, yes, I'm doing well these days.

They always say... When you meet someone new, you forget the hurt from the past? Once upon a time, you were the one who helped me heal. Now, someone else has taken your place.

One year later, I am happier. I, too, hope you are in a good place. :) 

NUS holds a lot of memories for me. Even after graduation, it brings people together, coincidentally. I'm thankful for this.

We were together for awhile, though it seemed like we've known each other for ages. 

Even though we've had to part ways, and I'm now almost engaged to someone else, I dont regret knowing you, I dont regret any of the things we did together. 

I have always been in the nosexbeforemarriage boat but right now, my only regret is that you will not be my first. It sounds crazy to me, and I know if it really comes down to it I wont actually do it before marriage, but perhaps in a noreligion world, I maybe would. 

Despite not being able to be together because reasons, despite me getting married to someone else, I wish you would be my first. But you cant, and can never be. And i will try to live with that. 

I miss you. And I love you. Always.

My boyfriend got an invite to a wedding recently and he's gonna go by himself. We've just got together for a few months so im not sure if i should expect him to bring me along? Does it mean anything if he doesn't invite me or am i thinking too much lol

Hi Yao, I met you on Letterbox last week. We chatted a little while but you 'disappeared' after that. Hopefully its due to finals revision... 
Just wanna let you know that you have a very sweet look. My heart melts when i see your smile. Im hoping that we can speak to each other again....

There is nothing wrong for couples to celebrate monthiversaries. I, as an evergreen "celebrate" my monthiversaries or sometimes weeklysaries of being single.

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

Your finals are ending soon.

You are filled with DETERMINATION.

hang in there, guys. :)

Dear op of  , or to whoever needs an opinion on the matter that their bf/gf doesn't allow them to have interaction with the opposite gender. He/She is just your partner for now. Assuming that things doesn't go well and both of you decide to go your separate ways, the person controlling your interaction with the opposite gender is going to hurt your interest in the long run.

Assuming that you are more than likely to get attached after a break up, you will definitely have to know people of the opposite gender and you just eliminated yourself out of the competition by keeping to yourself because you oh so love your current partner so much that you are afraid to hurt his fragile feelings.

To come up with a pragmatic deduction for his actions, he is likely to be knowing more people just in case things turn sour. He will still have other people that he chase after. So why not just do the same thing that your partner is doing?

 No wonder I see so few girls on Letterbox :O and the only reason I go to apps like Tinder or Letterbox is to look at other girls' photos to know roughly where my appearance stands :c

Should i confess to my crush straight away (whom i don't know that well yet)? Or should i bring her out for lunch/dinner to get to know her better then confess?

To 12968.

I was like you. My gf refused and respected her choice. Afterall it would be meaningless if one is forced into it. We all that the hand does substitute the real deal but rather just delays the need. So let me just share with you my solution. I consulted professional help in satisfying my urges. Their services are easily found.

Take your protection, hold your head high and charge into battle. Do what you have to and leave. Dont look back, dont have to let anyone know about it. Satisfy ur needs and done deal. 

Dont have a hook up. It creates unnecessary risk.

Also. Tell your friends you two are still virgins. Nothing to be ashamed off. In fact she will appreciate it. The last thing a girl wants is for her friends to imagine her in bed with her bf.

Forget all the politically correct  advices.  Those people have no idea what's it's like to be stucked in a relationship with no  physical intimacy. 

It's not pleasant and the worst thing,  it's not something that you can fix (if possible).  You'll be miserable your whole life trying to make things work till you start giving up on it.

A girl T has been flirting with me for the past 5-6 months but I did not take any concrete actions and will only flirt back occasionally. I am shy and awkward so I didn't know what to do. She's popular and is always with her very 'outgoing' friends and that is also one of the reasons why I did not approach her. I sort of like her too but theres like no chemistry between her. I always do not know what to say to her when we are alone. 

Whenever I am at her house I would play with her pet dog instead of talking to her cos I dunno what to say. Back when she started flirting with me by saying I am cute etc etc I know I am not. I was a skinny and scrawny dude with zero game. Fast forward now I would think I look very much different because I started working out and taking care of my appearance. Other girls would comment that I am cute but I am still the same zero game guy. 

During the course of time I also fell in love with another girl because we had so much chemistry. I confessed to her and she rejected me. I was devastated. I feel like shit. Girl T has been asking me about my status previously with that girl and I kept telling her we were just friends. I don't even know what I am driving at now. Just confused I guess.

Now that girl T has asked another mutual friend to travel with her instead of me, I don't feel good. Am I selfish? I just wanted to be a good guy and not hurt anyone. Haizz

I had a slight relapse of a health issue/condition. It made me realize the importance of my friends. I mean, my friends had always important to me, but this relapse just heightened that, so I'm chatting and messaging my friends randomly just to say hi and stuff. Of course I didn't tell them about the relapse. I just hope they don't think I'm weird or went into insurance because I suddenly initiated the conversations.

Btw for those critical readers (there are always some), I didn't mention family because they've always been above all else. So cheers.

There are 5 stages to the exam preparation.

"denial", "procrastination", "anxious", "all-nighter" and "whatever".

I skipped right to the last one.

 My boyfriend mathurbates to random variables as well. When I confronted him, he said I am not having stats with him.

Regarding , well, you probably mean well, but have you thought that it might make whoever you're talking to feel really creeped out? I mean, personally if that happens I'd be wondering if you are a psychopath who is out to kill me one day ):

At this time, I know I should focus on exams. But I'm totally distracted from studying :( This is how I am ruining my CAP

To  I am the OP of 

I don't want to brag or anything but i am considered 'popular' (at least in my faculty). I have participated several camps since freshmen year and I got meet really great seniors, friends and freshmen. I am also actively involved in my faculty-based activities. 

But who is to say that a 'popular' friend can't be 'abandoned'? 

Maybe it is because I know many people such that my attention towards my friends are spread thin. I do feel bad as a friend. I was not able to spend time with my friends or give them my attention when it is needed. Sometimes i am overwhelmed by my CCA workload. Sometimes I feel so tired after school that i need some time alone, sometimes i just need my own space. 

BUT there are days when i crave the company of my friends. There are days when I need to share my personal problems with someone that i can trust. But when i look around, there is simply no one that i feel i can talk to. And keeping all my feelings in is really making me feel terrible. Thank you NUSWhispers for this platform. 

And to those who had commented in my first post, thank you all. Unfortunately, I am comforted that I am not the only one feeling this way. People around me all seem to be able to stay close with their old friends. (and no bf because..... i guess i am not ready for one)

tl;dr - my first post is definitely authentic. Popular does not mean that you won't be abandoned. 
-
 
I think CAP is important. Yet I also think it's not everything. I have my friends who think higher CAP = more success in life, and I have friends who think CAP is a worthless number that "all typical Singaporeans just chase for 'cause the government said so". I have disdain for both groups of friends.
-
 
In response to  I just really need to get this out.

 I have a stinging suspicion that your post is not authentic (sorry haha I had to point it out, being cynical and all) 

Which 'abandoned friend' made this post LOL - I'm intrigued by the guilt-inducing way this post was crafted. Well done, just look at that final sentence. And not to mention these excellent bits: "Maybe i'm a selfish person", "Maybe I'm a horrible friend". 

Someone has a grudge against their 'popular' friend...fosho. Who is it? Own up now, haha!

How much of your past relationship(s) should you share with your current partner? If one isn't proud of it, how should one initiate the conversation? Any advice from anyone?

How can you tell whether you are really in love with the person or with the idea that you had of the person? Isn't it difficult for you to not grow to love a person who keeps doing nice things for you?
-
 
Hey , it is great that you are out there socialising, and that you have been proactive in befriending that person of interest (POI). You seem distressed and it is frankly not a good idea to be bogged down by these feelings during such a time- presuming you are a university student with exams imminent.

Perhaps you could cycle back on your focus on "finding the one"...now, and even later when you are about to join the fray again, advisably when you are more ready- emotionally, psychologically and if it's your thing to be, spiritually as well. I don't know you personally but it could be that your eagerness to connect presents itself as desperation, and desperation often doesn't sit well with people- whether you are looking to befriend someone or looking for something more. In more contemporary language, "chill".

Invest in your own potential OP, and harvest your own swag. Find "your thing". Refrain from adopting a fishbowl perspective- you said that ''apparently everyone finds (finding romantic partners) easy''. That sounds very much like a sweeping generalisation- people have different priorities, and if you can scroll through previous whispers you can see that NOT everyone finds it easy. So, ''chill".

You mentioned that POI is avoiding you. Well, perhaps POI does not feel comfortable with your advances, and/or is making an effort to reduce interactions with you because POI is not interested. Respect your POI, everyone has their limits. 

Lastly, your life is NOT worthless. Please do not ever peg your worth on the acceptance of your self by someone else- in ways romantic or otherwise. 

post-script: really disagree with GHY's advice of "acting like you don't care" and/or ''like you rejected them". You and POI are the ones who know most what the fact of the matter is. Don't swaddle your ego further because then not only are you deceiving yourself, you are hindering your growth. 

Be vulnerable. Be sincere. And "chill".

Now go listen to "We are young" by fun. Have fun. Studying.

I'll become a happy butterfly, and ride on the glittering wind
I'll come to see you soon
It's best to forget the unnecessary things
There's no more time to be fooling around

What do you mean, wow wow wow wow wow? I wonder if we'll reach the skies
But, wow wow wow wow wow I don't even know what my plans are for tomorrow

In other words, Digimon Tri is out, in case you've been too busy mugging to realise :')

Why is it that on letterbox, the guy will say hi to me, then I will say hi back, but then after that its dead silence? Is it the app broken or is it they realise i'm ugly. It's been 4 guys like this already :-(((
-
 
Actually quite interested to use letterbox because I found the concept pretty cool, but I'm not exactly looking, which makes it uncomfortable to seemingly expose myself to potential misunderstandings should people I know see my profile. Totally understand the need to show profile pic but really just a personal discomfort 
-
 
I'm attached and I tried out letterbox for fun. As a dating app I know my boyfriend wouldn't approve. But I just wanted to try it out for fun. The first guy that talked to me was a friend of my boyfriend. We talked for awhile before I ran a Facebook check on him. Should I ghost him?

The lack of trust, the lack of knowledge of your true status... even your close friends know nothing of who you really are.

But I've hidden so much from my friends.

I don't want to work like an undercover and continue covering up my life in layers of deception. I can seem happy and smile, and am excellent at deflecting attention away when people probe deeply.

I admit, I have been hurt before. But because of that, I've started to protect myself from even friends. I think people can betray me anytime when it is in their interests. Even when sharing secrets, I share just enough to satisfy them, yet not let them be able to cause significant damage with secrets. Often I place the parts in completely different friend groups so that the probability of piecing together my emotional pent-ups is low enough to not expose me.

I don't want to cover up anymore. Yet I don't want to lose my friends.

Tell me how. I don't know.

I just want to be a good person. I want to start my life afresh.
-
 
People speak of getting together. I'm genuinely happy for them.What I almost never tell people is the pain I am still going through from my breakup one year plus ago. I keep on telling people quite insistently that I am willing to change for them. 

I was rightfully told three things:
1. I need to simplify my thoughts.
2. I need to recover from my pain.
3. I need to start chasing.

I can do all three. I can be more succinct. I can heal emotionally. I can be proactive.

The problem is: I do not even know how to love.

I don't know how to say any sort of sweet nothing; I'm too straightforward. 

If she is pretty, I will say so. If she is sad, I will ask why and find out, but I do not know how and when to place the concern for best effect.

I don't know how to appreciate the fun the common person has. The common finds it fun watching a movie; I find it fun understanding how a movie is created. She finds it fun to play Pokemon; I prefer breaking Pokemon.

I don't know how to understand triviality. She can laugh at a stupid joke, and expect me to laugh at it too. I can laugh, but only because she laughs. She can read a magazine and wow at it, but I will jump straight for a reading material of more value.

She can enjoy music because she likes a singer. I like music that illuminates more than just lyrics or singer, but the context and complex undertones a musical piece brings.

But even these aren't the problem.

I think I am too hurt and numb to even think how to give love to someone who I trust. But the often acrimonious breaks have left me completely devoid of trust. The woulds occasionally re-manifest through seeing her friends who now give me cold stares.

I know I want to love, but I completely lack the energy and skill to do it.

I'm tired. I just want to have a break, but my wounds won't let me.

If you answer the questions for someone on letterbox but didn't click send can the person still see your attempts? I was too shy to send off a letter for this cute guy I was checking out (ok maybe not cute to previous confessors but my type) but he just sent me a letter! Feeling nervous to initiate a chat!

I am evergreen. A lot of girls tried to get to know me, meeting up for lunch and movies but... I can't help to feel like the cat....

My guy friend keeps telling me that I shouldn't give my number out to the guys who ask for it. Not sure if he has any agenda saying that, but it's besides the point as I've kinda friendzoned him since I don't feel like we are compatible.

Anyway, he says that many guys just try their luck, and it's not like they'd 'lose a piece of meat' if they fail, but they'd certainly at least secure a chance to get to know me better if they succeed i.e. minimal loss, possible 'great gain'. On the other hand, I feel like won't they be nervous, uncomfortable and scared of rejection too? When I imagine it being me, it's kinda scary and intimidating to go up to a stranger and hope they don't judge you or think you're weird.. 

I guess it depends on the guy, and it's not like I can accurately judge what kind of person he is, just casting a wide net and approaching many girls periodically or someone who is just intrigued and wants to get to know me personally, on the first impression right? For now I guess I'll still be wary of these guys, since they are really strangers you know nothing about and whether you can trust them or not vs someone you meet in school who I'll at least be able to find out information about more easily. 

Sad thing is, I don't really meet much guys in school since I'm in a major that has a small cohort size and is pretty exclusive. ): Anyway I wonder what motivates guys to approach girls they don't know. I feel like there're loads of pretty girls out there, so there must be something aside from looks that pushes you to go up to one particular girl to make a move? Unless you're the kind who would go up to all of them regardless. Maybe it's the type of look or style that would appeal to you.. I happen to think the girl next door or cute style really attracts loads of guys. Unfortunately I'm not in that category, more of the mature kind. Which I feel is just scaring guys away sigh.. 

Not sure where this confession is going or what point I'm making haha, guess I'll end here. Good luck for finals everyone! Apart from that, this year is coming to an end real soon so make the best out of 2015 while you can~ Hopefully 2016 will fare better in terms of my love life hahaha

Not in nus now. Its a few weeks to my ord. I feel like my life is getting very dull. Boring mundane. Im starting to find no meaning in life. Why am i doing all of this? For what? Its so BORING. I dont like this feeling. It makes suicide seem so plausible. I hope i dont do it though.
-
 
Someone I know just said that 

"In life, we all have that one friend that plays a part at each an every stage of our lives. However, only some are lucky to have the same group of friends at all the stages in their lives. Surely there may have been 'leap stages' for us. But you guys still make me feel lucky to have you in my life until now."

I hop this person understands that it is change that make us strong and help us grow... Perhaps, the one that hasn't grown since we broke up, is you.

sometimes i have already thought through all the logical aspects and i have sorted out my feelings.
i know how i should react, i know what kind of feelings i should have when such things happened.

but at some point in the day, i cant help but to feel sad all over again. when i thought i have gotten over it, i realised i didn't. 
i didn't move on, not even an inch.

my level of sadness should be a decreasing function, it should decrease as the number of days increases.
yet, some point in time i cant help but to think about you, think about things that will never happen.

i know how a person you are,
i know you have found someone else.

you won't be here whenever i need you,
you won't appear on my phone's notification as often as before.

you disappear for hours without replying me, and when you finally replied, you didnt even bother to tell me why you disappeared for hours.
yes, you are not obliged to, and i know that.
that's why it hurts.
i have no rights to ask more, you have no obligations to tell me.
I have to live with it.

in the past, you wanted to see me so badly, squeezing all available time to meet up, staying back in school, having meals together, etc.

now someone else has taken over my job,
but no one is here to take over your role.

i dont wish for more,
but i really want you to hear that
i miss you.. 
alot.

“I thought of all the others who had tried to tie her to the ground and failed. So I resisted showing her the songs and poems I had written, knowing that too much truth can ruin a thing. And if that meant she wasn't entirely mine, what of it? I would be the one she could always return to without fear of recrimination or question. So I did not try to win her and contented myself with playing a beautiful game. But there was always a part of me that hoped for more, and so there was a part of me that was always a fool.”

To 

What is the best way to seek revenge against someone who rejected you?

Imagine one day where you find a girlfriend who is better than your previous crush. You will be so glad that she rejected you then. If not, you wouldn't be able to find your current girlfriend.

Better yet, she had broken up with her boyfriend and think of how different it will be if you were her boyfriend instead.

The best way to seek revenge is to make yourself happy.
-
 
The griddit thing is surprisingly good. Each day I feel like I have something to look forward to and people to chat with. Also didn't expect to find that the guys there could turn out so cute :)
-
 
I'm the guy who wrote . To put it into context, the close group of friends I'm referring to are amongst my oldest friends (7-8 years) and one of them is who I regard as my bestie. But the fear is still there. And I really dread the day they leave me behind, because all of them are achievers of so much more than me. My family is falling apart, my dad just moved out of the house without a word, and I don't think it wise to put more worry on my mum. 
-
 
I vividly remember I once said to you that I'll never ever regret confessing to you. Maybe I was too blind at that time, too optimistic, so naive in thinking I might get together with you. I actually do regret it now. I regret confessing to you because those experiences we had together are so hard to forget now. I tell myself that I'll move on and that it's over and that I don't need you that much actually and it sometimes makes feel happy for awhile. But that feeling is over as soon as I realise how I actually still can't really forget about you. Or maybe I don't actually want to forget about you. Guess it's the mind vs the heart again? Like in ?
-
 
I used to talk to this guy (A) in fb. Being a shy person I only met him once. He was really a nice person tho i didn't trust him (just to be safe + i don't trust ppl that easily) .he confessed and I told him you are going too fast in this. And there were arguments etc etc cos I didn't want to be in a r/s. He eventually found a new gf and then yet he still message me. He apologise and was nice to me. What does that mean?

I just fell out of a relationship of almost 4 years at the start of the year. We were each other's first love. I thought I would have taken forever to get over it. 

The first few months were definitely terrible. For 3 months, I could not help but cry every time i think about it and cry myself to sleep every night. I had trouble concentrating in class whenever my brain chose to think about it again.

The 3 months that followed was better... I started to focus on other things like finals and was kept busy with important things during summer. I thought i was really getting over this.

Everything was fine until July when we met up again. I was conflicted because... i thought i was doing so well but all i really wanted to do was  to give it another shot. But the feeling wasn't mutual.

So after that i was renewed with determination and somehow magically i got much much better. Maybe i finally came to terms with the fact that there is no longer any hope in this relationship.

You'd always hope that it is just you overthinking and things weren't really that bad. That love can conquer all. Only after the relationship do you realise how blinded you were and how many ways the relationship was actually going wrong, and how it was built on unhealthy grounds.

Fast forward to now, i find myself opening up my heart again, although i still find it super scary to be so vulnerable and exposed once more. After all, it took a year or so to completely break down all the walls in the previous relationship. It is still pretty unimaginable to let someone in again, to the deepest corners of your heart and soul, and to potentially be crushed again.

I think I've found someone i am willing to open up to... but i can't help but be terribly afraid. I guess love is always a risk, ya?

I don't know if anyone would be able to relate to this but i just wanted to share this somewhere. No matter what each of you are facing, I wish all the happiness to everyone in the world. :)

I posted previously about wondering if I am slacking. Frankly, I still can't get the guilty feelings out of me. I understand that it happens often but I guess it just feels abnormal during the first time. Yesterday night when my group finally submitted our report through ivle, I had this inner thought that I am thankful for once for no peer evaluation. Previously in JC, I have always been the main contributor for projects and it saddens me now that I cannot contribute. Gosh, I hate arts modules sometimes. Thanks for listening to my rant. No need to comment or anything. Just wanna let some steam out.

 putting her head on his shoulder... isn't that like the least kind of close amongst all the different kinds of close?

Good luck with your finals!

I feel tired, sick of this nightmare. There are people out there who achieve with little effort but I'm those that achieve nothing with maximum effort. Studies, relationship, family etc. Putting in so much effort, I can't even do well in a course that I liked. Putting in so much care and patience, I lost my crush to someone he barely knew for half a year ( I know him for almost 2 years now and we have been through a lot). Putting effort to spend time with my family more, I watch others having fathers teasing them while I lost mine. Life is unfair; you don't get what you always want. I used to believe I am the one in control of my destiny; now I am uncertain. While others are studying hard for their finals, I'm just staring at NUSWhisper page and wishing to graduate. Alas, life is not an equal dice. And whether or not NUSWhisper will post this becomes irrelevant; I just need to rant and escape this nightmare.

I've been with my current girlfriend for 7 years now and I always receive comments like "Wah! How you last so long?" or "You not tired/bored of her yet?" and I am always incredibly incredulous towards their thinking. There isn't really much of a secret formula towards being in a long and lasting relationship - love, commitment, constant effort - but what cause many relationships to fail is not the unawareness of what is necessary, but rather the fact that either/both party fail to deliver it after awhile. It gets tiring to put in constant effort day in day out with the same person when there are so many "better" girls/guys out there, but if she is the right person it shouldn't be difficult at all because all you really want is to constantly make her the happiest she can be.

One other belief I hold true is that if it is something that you feel the need to hide from your SO, then you shouldn't be doing it. You should be able to tell him/her everything and if its something you can't or that you have to delete away then maybe you should consider if what you're doing is right/harmful to the relationship.

As the saying goes: falling in love is easy, staying in love is hard. Personally, I feel that there isn't a need to constantly be on the search for your SO as true love will come looking for you. All the best to everyone be it for matters of the heart or for finals :-)

Do platonic friendship between a single heterosexual guy and a single heterosexual girl really exist? 

Because so far in my lifetime I either: 

1. I either catch feelings or they catch feelings 

2. The only time we don't like each other is when we aren't even close to begin with 

3. We both have partners. 

Otherwise I haven't encountered a close friend of the opposite gender who can be my best friend and b there for me under genuine premises. 
Thoughts pls?

I feel so fucked up, I keep imagining how it would feel like to french kiss my close guy friend. He's not exactly super hot, but he's cute! To me hahahaa. Goshhhhh :/

Everyday I hope that someone will care about me, to initiate conversations and chats with me, hope that someone will at least wish me good morning and good night everyday and ask about my day.
I have many workmates and friends, yet if I do not initiate chats or conversations with them, no one will bother to do so to me unless to ask for help or etc. If I dont start the chats, it can go on for several months without me receiving any texts at all.
I feel so lonely, rejected and left out. What is wrong with me? How do I get others to care about me? Sigh

I used to be the more enthusiastic one in the clique of friends who will initiate and plan gatherings, but it always frustrate me that other members were rather unresponsive on our Whatsapp group. With unresponsive and uninterested replies, the planning was tough but at least they do materialise in the end. Recently I was too busy and our clique had not met for months. A member of the clique voiced that out and everyone agreed to meet. However with no one "taking initiative" and "in charge" this time round, the meeting was eventually cancelled, especially when the venue and time of the meeting was not even confirmed until the very day everyone agreed to meet. Having responded that I would not be meeting them on that supposed date due to other commitments, I can only watch in anguish "behind the scene" through the messages in the Whatsapp group. If only everyone showed a little more interest, responsiveness and effort, then there won't be this kind of awkward cancellation at the last minute that even left a few members angered as well.

Thank you OP . You may not know it but your post appeared just in time for me to snap myself out of a really dark place with my really dark thoughts. Thank you for giving me a timely reality check and stopping me from being stupid. Your post worked wonder.

I have a confession to make. My girlfriend's good friend(let's call her A) and I coincidentally took up the same modules this semester. As a result, we have been attending the same classes together. Needless to say, I ended up spending much more time with A than with my girlfriend (who is working currently). From eating, studying, sitting together in tutorials, doing projects, we are practically doing everything together. To be honest, I really enjoyed her company. Even so, I do update my girlfriend on the stuff I am doing with her and I always make the effort to clear up any insecurities she may have. 
Initially, I did not make much of it as I love my girlfriend a lot and I didn't think much of taking modules with A.

 But after almost spending the semester with A together, I'm getting the feeling that she has somewhat developed some liking towards me. (Btw, my girlfriend doesn't join us for meals and stuff as she graduated a year earlier than me and she's working already.) For example, A recently started writing handcrafted notes for me, saying stuff like "lucky to have you in my life", "loves". I told my girlfriend about the notes but not the content inside it and she told me that A only wrote such notes for her on special occasions such as birthdays. (I have received 2 in 5 weeks already lol). 

Also, I am starting to feel that A is trying to come between me and my girlfriend as she has been texting me stuff to try and sow discord between my girlfriend and I. Her texts to me have been increasingly frequent and bordering on flirtatious. I have been keeping such texts a secret from my girlfriend as I fear her reaction. The problem is that I don't know what to do in such a situation. I feel bad to reveal this to my girlfriend as I don't want her to lose a friend and I still treat her A as my very good friend. 

This situation just became stickier as A just jio-ed me to watch a movie with her this weekend (just the two of us) to "celebrate" going through the end of the semester together. The funny thing was that my girlfriend wasn't invited and neither does she know about this.  A has really become a best friend to me, not just my girlfriend's friend anymore and letting my girlfriend know about this surely would mean the end of our friendship and also A's friendship with my girlfriend. I don't know about my feelings for her but I am certain that given a choice now, I would still choose my girlfriend over A. 

I really don't know how to go about with this, and I know continuing this will only make things so much worse in the long run. Should I maintain the status quo or just tell A to stop flirting with me without letting my gf know about this? Or am I just overthinking and she just treats me as a friend :/

A few questions to couples out there: do you often shower your partner with affection/attention? (e.g. constantly saying how much you like/love the other person, texting each other everyday to talk about your day/ask about the other person's day). How often do you meet up? (especially for the couples who have busy schedules)

My parting letter to you. 

Missing someone is painful. Missing a special moment is even worse.

Today was one of those days. 
Did you know I walked by the park that we once roamed? 

The walks that we embarked on, the funny conversations that we shared, the smile you gave me when I told you a joke. The memories and the pang of emotions bounded to it all crashed upon me when my gaze settled on the footpath that we often liked to walk on. 
 
It was not till then, that I finally realised that I have lost you. 
There is this void inside the cavern of my ribcage that can never be filled. Your absence has left a huge gap in my life. 

Waking up to your messages, seeing your smile in the morning, hearing your voice in the afternoon were all something that I have grown accustomed to over the few years of our friendship but now it is just me and the looming reality that you are not here anymore. 
The realisation that I am going to live the rest of my life without you by my side frightened me. 
...So I ended up tearing up at the park. 

Why am I torturing myself like this? Why can't I just move on? 

Isn't this pathetic? Maybe.... but moving isn't an easy task- no sh*t. 
I am not a computer that can instantly erase all of my feelings nor am I a whiteboard that can wipe out all of my memories with one single stroke. 

Even now despite of it being two months since we last talked, I still struggle to feel less empty, now that you're gone.

 Perhaps the most funny thing is that we were never something to begin with. 
You were not my lover or anywhere close to that, you were just my close friend who eventually left my side. 
You said that leaving me was for my best interest. 
I'm not going to say anything to that because cutting ties with me may have been the right thing to do but it may also been the wrong thing to do.
I don't care. My true purpose in writing this isn't to put any blame on anyone. I just want to say thank you. I wasn't able to thank you last time because I was so wrapped up with my feelings and I don't plan to say it to your face any time soon because I know I might return back to square one, so I am going to take this chance to express my feelings so I can achieve the closure that I have been desperately trying to get. 

J. 
Thank you for accompanying me during my final year. Thank you for teaching me and opening my eyes to this big world. Thank you for giving me something to look back to. Even though we are mere strangers now, I will always remember you. 

J. Do I regret befriending you? Do I regret confessing to you? Do I regret getting so close to you knowing that I might get hurt one day?

The answer is no and I don't think that answer will ever change. 
J. I miss you terribly but I am also ready to move on. It has been a pleasant ride with you while it lasted. 
I guess it is finally time for me to wake up from my dream ay?

 thank you for the memories and I admit sometimes I do question myself whether I have fought hard enough for our friendship that night? 
But maybe our story is at the point of no return. We are so apart now that nothing can be done to amend the gap. 
And So it shall.....

Goodbye J, wish you all the best. Stay Gucci. 

Ur S: h.y

can someone wake me up?
i know i am doing it all wrongly,
i know i am constantly lying to myself.
i know this shouldnt be the way to treat myself,
exposing myself to further damages.

i know what i am in for,
i know i shouldnt.
i know all the logical aspects to it,
but my heart does the call.
my heart erases all the logical decisions that my brain told me to do.
my heart told me otherwise, it told me to do things that are "irrational", my heart and mind are fighting with each other with opposing thoughts.

"you should treat yourself better", the voice in my head said.
"you should hold on longer, maybe better things are arriving", my heart told me.

love has no logic, so most people end up following their heart.
of course, it doesnt mean that those who follows their head don't love that someone at all.
is it because they dont love that someone strong enough? or their determination is not strong enough? or they love themselves more than that special someone?
or they are just doing justice for themselves because if they dont help themselves, then who else will?

but, who is there to help me?
which route to take.

my mind told me: 
"you should know that he isnt serious about you and you have tons of evidences to prove it. he is just treating you as a "spare". he wants you only when he needs you, and he needs you not because he loves you.
you should know love isnt this way. you know he wants your body over your heart. 
he isnt suitable for you. he is constantly destroying you, internally. 
he ditched you the moment he found someone else to replace, but still tries to keep you by his side so that you can always be there when he needs you. but he wont be there whenever you need him. 
you wont have him wholeheartedly, because in his mind, there is someone better, someone whom he wants, not he needs.
simply put, you are there because he has yet found someone to replace you entirely, or maybe he wants more choices to choose from.
stop being silly, stop giving yourself ridiculous excuses to explain his weird behaviour.
you know the outcome, you know the consequences, you know how much tears you have shed and that's enough.
some people arent as good as you imagined, some people exist in your life to destroy you and you should defend yourself."

my heart told me:
"even there is 99% chance that he is a jerk, there is still 1% that he may be serious in me.
if he is really serious about me but i decide to let go first, then i will regret in the future. 
probably he needs more time to think through, probably all this will shed light soon. 
it is okay to get hurt, so hang on. 
you might see the rainbow after the rain."

how?

I'm a guy. I made a really bad decision a long time ago which resulted in my nudes being on the internet. I've tried to request sites to take them down but I always seem  to find them somewhere on the web. Recently I was a Bash contestant and it resulted in the resurfacing of some of my photos. What do I do?

I wonder if it's common in Singapore to not keep in contact with your extended family (cousins, aunts and uncles, grandparents etc.) . I only ever see and talk to them once a year during CNY when the entire clan comes together, and even then interaction is limited at best because I have no idea what is going on in their lives, nor do I have the inclination to find out. Is this normal, or am I simply being a lousy relative?

Recently got dumped with my ex after 3.5 years together. It's my last year in uni and they say when going out to work, you won't be able to find a nice guy or any guys for that matter. Feel very jaded and depressed. My BF was like my best friend and a huge source of support. I don't know what to do anymore. Marriage and having kids together was what I always pictured would happen to us. It's so scary to be all alone. Especially since all my friends are attached or getting married or flying off elsewhere. Feeling so alone and upset that I really can't quite breathe while studying for finals sometimes. How to recover from this? I don't know.

Not going into nitty gritty details as the identities in this rant might be revealed.  

I have a really close guy friend whom I have known for about 3 years. We have impeccable chemistry and we always have lots of fun together. I admit that at times, it feels as though we are dating. But 6 months ago, a close friend of mine got close to him through me. She teases and touches him whenever she has the chance. 
I was blamed by her for being too close to the guy, and ignoring her feelings. But in my point of view, I really felt that I didn't. In fact, I felt that she was seducing my close guy friend and throwing me aside. I tried to shake it off by telling myself that I may be overly sensitive and tried my best to mend the friendship between her and I. 

However, recently during one of a group gathering - she started it again! Almost everyone thought why is she suddenly so close to the guy! And asked if they are dating or something?! When it happened, I thought 'omg, this can't be happening again??!!' 
First, you blame and deny that you have any intention of seducing my guy close friend. Then, you put the blame on me for being too close with him. Now, with everyone's judgement from that day, I think it's safe to say I wasn't too sensitive about what happened previously.

I'm feeling so upset and affected by it. It feels as though I am losing two friends in one go! And I feel like I am being betrayed emotionally by her. 

Should I play dumb, and continue the friendship with her? 
-
 
When my boyfriend goes out with me, he is usually not paying attention or scrolling Instagram to look at pictures of girls. I pretend to not know and give him chance but he continues. And he is always seen texting or distracted. Sick and tired of the shit he gives. He should go f**k himself.
-
 
After entering NUS for about 3 months now, I have finally found the love of my life. Never have I ever feel so loved by someone before.
Entertaining as a comedian, my boyfriend definitely should have taken a degree in mass communication as opposed to civil engineering. Could not believe the awesome feeling from my first sexual experience. No man on Earth can ever make me feel the same way as he did. However, I will most likely try out other man as well, so as to gain experience and boost my confidence. Only after I have tried, will I then know whether he is the best, and that he is fit to be my future husband or not. Just in case you are wondering, his name is the first letter of every sentence from the bottom up!
-
 
I have been texting and talking to this guy frequently and he always tries to initiate conversations. Is this a hint that he likes me or are all guys generally open to talk to females? How do I know if a guy likes me and is chasing me? (I know I should be focusing on studying for finals but this is bugging me and I need to let it off) 
-
 
I'm sooooo stressed up over school in general (year 4 you see). Every time (many times!!! D:< ) I try talking to my BF about it he'll just brush it off or simply laugh it off. Which is just not helping at all. To the point it gets me really annoyed (stress plus additional anger, imagine that!!). Is there some kind of platform (other than here) for all the stressed people out there to come together to talk and support each other through it? Could really use some support from people who actually understand what I'm going through right now. 
-
 
I currently have 5 boys chasing me. It's annoying when you have to keep replying them when you have no interest. How do i reject them without telling them i like girls?

I'm willing to bet most of us are tired of seeing posts about introverts using their introversion as an excuse for not functioning well in project groups, for having crappy resumes, for not putting their best foot forward to pursue their goals, because somehow or rather it is linked to their being shy and awkward around people.

As someone who also identifies as far more introverted than otherwise, I wish people would stop confusing introversion with being shy and being an awkward wreck in social situations, and more importantly, to stop using introversion as a crutch.

To OP of 

Hi OP, i know the feeling of loneliness, at times it is alright, at times it will just hit you at your face. At least for me, when that happen, i will go online and research on things like "should i come out to my friend" etc and the most common advice that i will see is "if they mind, they are not really your friends". Truth to be told, it is not really that simple. We treasure the friendships so much that we are not willing to risk it even though we really want to tell them as we are tired of pretending and we really want them to know the real us. It's not easy to make a decision whether to come out or not. I could share with you my experiences if you want :) But what i would like to share for now,  the safest route would be to tell your closest friend that you have known the longest and is the most comfortable around with. Try to build up experience so that you will not be afraid to come out to people. Up to now, i have received no negative reactions from people although many of them were shocked.

Well, i could be that buddy that you can share your feelings with. I surf nuswhispers every now and then. I don't know if the admin does the "leave contact with me" kind of thing but if you need someone to talk to, just submit a confession :) i'll do my best to reply to you here :)

Through a mod I met this friendly guy. I did the mod alone and he did it with his friends but he never failed to smile at me every time we met. He was the only guy I talked to (actually no one else even smiled at me) from our tutorial except my project group (he was from another group). Tutorials have ended now and I thought we could be friends. But as we walked off from class from our last tutorial last week, all that happened was a "bye". 

- sad tutorial mate :(

To OP  who wrote about being 'ghosted', just want to say that you are not alone in this. My case is even worse, because I was actually attached to the 'ghost' for about 3 months before he disappeared. He's a very nice and sweet bf while we're together. He always said that I have an amazing personality, brought me to many 'atas' places for dinner and drinks,  gave me hugs when I needed it most, bought gifts for my family, even talked about how happy our future family would be, basically giving lots and lots of false hope and got me thinking that he's 'the one'. But then I flew off for a few days, that's when he started being cold, and gradually cut off contacts with me. Before I left, he promised to pick me up at the airport when  I'm back. But in the end he didn't. He also unfriended me on fb and blocked my WA/calls. Anyway similar to yours, I also met my ex on a dating app. I guess it's not a good platform to find a proper SO yeah? There must be a reason why the people there are still single, despite some of them having above average looks and good career. A shoutout to all guys and girls out there who are thinking of 'ghosting' their dates, if you know right from the start that you're not that into them, please don't drop any hint that you're interested and after that disappear like nothing happened. For those already attached, take some time to sit down and talk to your bf/gf about what has gone wrong that leads to your decision to end the relationship. Because being 'ghosted' hurts so so bad. Breaking up sucks, but knowing that you're not even worthy of a proper breakup is a lot worse.
-
 
I am currently single but have been hanging out with 3 ladies. Hanging out as in doing things together, meet one on one, makan, drinks, etc. I am not bf/gf with any of them. 

Would like to ask if this is socially acceptable, or is this considered cheating? Of course, if I become bf/gf with one of the girls, then obviously I will be committed and date exclusively. Any advice?
-
 
I met this guy at an orientation camp and we had been talking a lot for a while such that people in our OG thought that the two of us were going to get together sooner or later. Our interests and viewpoints were similar and we hung out one-on-one a lot for study dates and suppers and those times were really comfortable and enjoyable. However, one day he suddenly got attached with this other girl from another OG who is our mutual friend. Now everytime I see them posting lovey-dovey photos on instagram and facebook, I just get this really sour feeling that it could have been us.. How can I get over this feeling?
-
 
Came to know this girl last semester when we were in the same group for lab. See her during lecture every day. Most of the time she would sit one or few rows behind me. She is always surrounded by her friends. Didn't have any feelings on her until this sem, but didn't dare to approach her directly. The more I see her, the stronger my feeling towards her. Tried messaging her a few times but the conversations always ended within a day. Apart from saying hi, good morning, that's all. I love the smile on her face whenever we say hi to each other.

The sem is coming towards the end and from next sem onwards, we will not have the chance to meet each other easily unless we are taking the same technical elective. Will definitely miss her, but I don't have the courage to approach her again, because if she doesn't have the same feeling on me, it will be very awkward when we see each other again in campus.

The only thing I can tell myself is Love is Mutual. One-sided relationship will not have good ending. Probably this is one-sided, as I don't think she has any feelings on me. But, good to know her in my life, at least I know what is the feeling of liking someone.

If time can returned to last sem, I would have talk to you more during lab. Not sure what will happen next, but hopefully one day I would have that courage to confess to you.
-
 
How do you tell that a close guy friend is treating you like a really good friend/sister or is showing interest in you? Any actions that may allow some inference? Of cos the simplest is to just ask him la but I won't do that till I'm sure that he is dropping signs that he is interested!
-
 
Dear OP of ,
Funny how the same thing actually happened to me last year. The details are a little different (I met him in NUS when he was on exchange, and then I went on exchange to his home country and we got together). What followed after that was more than a year of LDR (with very expensive 2 visits in between, once he visited me and once I did). Now I'm a postgrad student in the same country as he is, although we're in different cities. I have been very fortunate in that he is willing to put in as much, if not more, effort into this relationship as I am. My advice: let it be, and if you can do a postgrad in his country, do it. It will give you time to think. A relationship takes a lot of effort, especially when distance is involved, but it allows for a lot of room for self-improvement and growth. Do not be afraid to be hurt. Do not let go of something that could be wonderful because of fear. After all, you can't stop loving someone just because of geography. Take care.

I wonder what an angel is upto right now...Kinda hate Fridays because I see people excitedly leaving work to their families, but my family is in a land far away, and my heart's resident only lives in my heart. I do multiple projects to get myself so busy that I don't have time to remember her, but yet she returns, infrequently but surely...I am lucky to be doing what I love and being well fed and everything else, but I fell for the wrong girl lol

I will miss you forever, angel. You did hurt me a lot, but your absence hurts me more, so I guess I still like you lol

But after finishing writing this, I will lie down on the couch and imagine you rubbing my forehead and smiling at me. That would make this world a happy place again :D

Am I worrying too much? Sometimes i worry if no one will ever truly like me or find me interesting, or will i even be able to get a partner. People have constantly reassured me that my looks are not an obstacle, my personality is fine, and i just havent met the right one. but what if there wasnt a right one to begin with???? or what if the right one belonged to the past century ? or what if I'm 90 when i meet the right one?  please tell me that these thoughts are not mine and mine alone

Wonder why different faculties seem to have different norms when it comes to dressing. Dont you all find it so uncomfortable to dress up for lessons. Or is it something where the pride you take in your image outweighs the discomfort and time spent on the image itself.

Every time I get an invite out for a meal that I cannot reject (e.g. reunion dinner, family birthdays etc.) I always panic inside, because I know I'll be a total wreck due to anxiety destroying my appetite. It's probably going to be the same cycle again; me looking around for escape, finding excuses to not eat, acting like I'm actually eating when I can't.

It's not that I can't eat out. I somewhat can, in takeaway boxes, although I still gag from time to time for no reason. What I really can't do though, is eat in public areas with massive amounts of people around. Eating on a plate. With people nearby. That scares me, and I don't know why.

I don't want to disappoint anyone, so I just go along with the flow, but I really wished that I just never received any meal invites at all so that people won't know how weak I really am mentally.

People say that you need to want it bad enough to work for it. Guess I'm just not wanting it bad enough, because every time I want to try to break out of this cycle, I crawl back into my shell again, fearing the possible consequences of what may happen.

Has anyone had such issues and overcame it? How did you do it? I really want to know, because I'm slowly starting to lose hope and accept that this is who I will be for the rest of my life.

feel so shitty when these girls post about their guys being too involved with their games to spend time with the girl. I also play games but not to that extent. Why not just give me your girlfriend instead

To the OP of 

I was in the same situation. What I was advised on, was similar to what the comments to your posts were. "if you can like another, you were never really strongly in love with the first one anyway."

The second person, B, was chivalrous, and too, couldn't leave a person like me alone. 

And so after months of going back and forth, I left my JC bf of 2 years, for someone I knew for 4 months.

After honeymoon  period, we both saw flaws in each other, and chided each other about it. Conflicts came, just like most relationship, and there were times our r/s was rocky. 

During one such time, 8 months into our r/s, halfway through settling problems, I brought up the issue of me being pressured into mild sexual abuse in my workplace (stupid tired me at that time didn't realise I could just run away for help). The issue was eating me up inside for more than a month and I had been finding the right time to tell him about it (I wasn't sure how he would react to it.).

He was angry? I'm not sure. His face just turned red and he just started screaming. He asked how can he ever trust me again? I don't even know the answer myself. But inside, I was deeply hurt. 

He had confessed to me one month earlier that he almost left me for another girl because to him she was very hot. There were also many instances where I felt emotionally blackmailed from his actions(long story). And at that time, after talking it through, I forgave him completely.

But this, we were both victims right? Shortly after I had to go to work again, and he sent me to the station, and told me he needed time to think.

There was no reply from him since then. I called him about a week later, only for him to answer "We broke up already, we are finished, you are free to do whatever you want."

This time, I never shed a tear. I simply hung up and carried on my way to work again.

I eventually slowly became friends with my very first bf, I picked up gaming and we have been close friends since. There was never an instance where we deliberated about getting back.

Did I regret breaking up with my first bf? Yes, BUT we were bound to break up anyway. We got together just cause we were close, but we wanted too different things in life, and expected different fundamental things from each other. We just broke at a wrong time.

Did I regret starting a new relationship with this new bf? yes, cause it was only by being close in a r/s with him, that I realised he was very different from the person I thought he was even after spending months with him. I was deeply disappointed in who he really was. Looking back, I was deluded by his words and lonely from my bf's limited time.

To OP: I understand how hard you are trying to reason your heart with your brain, to maintain your initial relationship. 

There is still strong attachments with your first bf. But because of NS, your bf's time is limited, it gets lonely, I know.

And also, 4 months may not be enough to know a new person deeply even if you meet everyday. 

Have you tried talking to your current bf about it?
If he left it up to you, can you hold on a bit longer? 

If I were in the same situation again, I would request for a week of no contact with B. And I would wait until weekend to meet my bf again, at his house to talk it out, don't make any commitment promises. And see his response. 

If he decides to spend what little time he have with you or left it up to you, then I would maintain being friends only with B for one more month at least. During this one month, I would try to understand why am I feeling this conflict. Is he really the type of person I want to spend my life with? Do I really know B deep enough? Or was it because I was just really lonely and he just happened to be there to provide me with company(for both)? Am I even ready to end it with my first bf? If both of them told you that there is someone else that is interested in them, who would you want back more?

When you are ready, make that choice in your best ability, brace your heart and pray. And know that you already made the choice in your best efforts, despite being hurt months later.

Good luck

Hello hello. Sorry no juicy news. Just really need some advice. I got offered NOC Israel today. Although I am really really really excited about doiing NOC, I am having a lot of trouble convincing my mother and I myself have much doubts about going Israel as well due to the geopolitical situation. If anyone knows anybody who went on NOC Israel before or am going, pls comment below I would gladly hear from them. Also anyone else who have advice about the country feel free to share if you care to do so. Thank you!

It feels like cheating is such a common thing. So many stories on here (though perhaps, trolls), so many stories from friends who experienced it first-hand. I wonder if my boyfriend of 3 years have ever cheated on me but I just am ignorant of it.

Would you rather know or be kept in the dark?
-
 
Well, after getting like the previous three posts by me filtered away for some reason, hope this one gets through :/

Nowadays, exams are more frustrating than before. If it's hard, obviously the score won't be good and i'll be depressed. On the other hand, if it's easy, i wonder if the bell curve god will destroy me. Somehow it feels like we are in Westeros. U win or u die. #WinterIsComing

A couple days ago I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years on good terms. With my newfound freedom, I'm seeing the opposite sex in a whole new light. Everyone is attractive. I've had more crushes in these past few days than I did as a 13-year-old. Is this what rebounding feels like? Or is this just freedom?

I've just done one fucked up thing and I seriously regretted it. I've met this girl on tinder and we hit off really well. But the truth is, I'm attached. I know guys, why the hell am I doing on tinder when I'm attached. I've made it clear to my gf that I just wanna make new friends and let her check my messages. Back to this girl, we've chatted for several days and she has such a great character and she would be such a great friend. Until the point that my gf pointed out she might be interested in more than a friendship (I fucked up when I didn't tell her I'm attached from the start). That's when I've decided to confess to her and I'm not surprised that she got pissed. Now that I have learnt my lesson, I've uninstalled tinder. To that girl, I'm terribly sorry for the events leading to this, I know I've fucked up real bad and I don't request for your forgiveness. I'm sorry.

I have 2 options:

1. Ditch the group. I've done my part (though little) and showed group mates who don't hate me that I worked for the report. I will risk 5% participation mark for a poece of mind. I am sick of being ignored, talked over and of not receiving any eye contact from you! Group mate who hates me!

2. Stick with the group till the end (it's one week left anyways) and be comfortably and conveniently silent during the whole process. Will help with writing up the report, and in staying with group, endure being ignored and hated.

Yes, I tell myself it is worth a lesson, not at school, but in life, to work with people who hate you and who you hate. But this is so mentally taxing! Imagine group meetings where the others do the talking without you knowing it or where one of them keep taking over and not assigning you with anything that builds into your contribution! I wanna give up. But I can't

Any advice?

In this day and age, is it ok to ask a girl out for a movie via FB msg, and not make a phone call? Context: I have shown some interest in a girl and she probably knows it. But I don't want to move to fast yet until we are closer.

Recently I discovered that my boyfriend has been texting other girls. Even though he made it clear to those girls that he has a girlfriend, he is the one that is continuing on the conversation with those girls. Also, he will hide those chats whenever I'm around and does not reply those girls until I go off. I know this because I snooped on his phone (it was only once, please don't flame me) and I discovered many things that he has hidden from me. Is this considered a red flag? Should I be worried? I cannot bring it up in an argument because I was the one who snooped on his phone, which puts me in the wrong before we even start arguing. Help please.

Whenever I'm about to do something, I think "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.

Why isn't anyone addressing the mental effects of academic bullying. I used to trust some of the people around me and in turn I always help them in their work. It later turns out that they always take advantage of me. Some of them who always got excellent result will act blur towards me when I consult them regarding my tutorials. When they get almost straight A results, they will always complain that they score so badly when I am constantly scoring below B+ for anything that is graded. It really makes me feel so demoralise and sometimes suicidal. There were a few occasions when I ask them for the due dates for some of the submission and it later turns out that they give me the wrong date. I also start to realise people will only be nice towards you if they need a favour from you. I starting to lost trust in some of the people I once trusted. Saying so much of this, I believe everyone who is studying in NUS are victims of academic bullying but to varying degree. Those who are poor in academic like me suffer the most.

I'm just going to sort out some irrationality bothering me. 
Am I the only one who's increasingly bothered by close friends asking for relationship advice? Though I've episodic manifestations of lusts, all of them conforming to the societal norm of heterosexuality, I've been disgusted by feelings of love and unwilling to explore them.

Am I the only one who enjoys going to lectures alone? Sadly, none of my lectures are webcasts, and class participation for tutorials are graded. Maybe that is a relief for my mental well-being. I'm being rather reclusive since after National Service.

Being a Freshie marks new experiences. I've never experienced panic attacks before NUS. It happened a few times on a weekly basis in the first few weeks, subsided towards recess week, and periodically once every week after week 9. 
Sweaty palms, churning stomach, breathlessness, heart-pounding, fidgeting. I hate it when it happens during a lecture, where I need to find a perfect moment to go out. I'm always sitting at a corner seat, hoping no one sits near me. Sometimes placing my bag on the seat beside me. 
I've suspected it has got to do with my diet, because I've to habitually go to the toilet before every lesson. I'm avoiding meals at crowded times and areas. 
I'm grateful for being able to study here, although I've not told anyone that.

Thank you for reading...

So I noticed this boy in class from the first day of the semester. He's kind of like the brooding, silent type, and it seems like he always likes to wear a singlet that shows off his lean physique. 

And, well, I like to think of myself as popular. I hold exco positions in two clubs, I have quite a name for myself in my home faculty, and I think I'm better looking than the average girl. I've tried to strike up conversation with him before, but it seems that he prefers to keep to himself. I decided to be a bit bold, and get to know this guy by inviting him to my birthday party - along with some of my friends, of course.

I made quite a show of it, asking him to come over in public. He openly rejected me, but then leaned in close -

and told me he'd kill me.

It's been 2 years since my previous relationship, and I discovered what I missed the most about it (or any relationship for that matter). It's the skinship, and no I don't mean the kissing and what not. It's the hand holding, hugging, leaning on each other, simple stuff that you usually see girls do with each other.

Love doesn't have to be both-sided to be beautiful. It is beautiful on its own, whether or not reciprocated.

I met an angel on 13th February of this year and life has not been the same since. She liked me a lot, but mainly because I was kind and helpful. I started to care more but never pushed. I walked her to her hostel every night, I spent late nights working with her in my office and my home, etc...

She also did everything a friend could. She gave me her band. She used to call me 'beta' and comfort me whenever I missed my mom. She used to bite me, etc..

It is sad how she drifted apart. It had a lot to do with what her guy friend who could speak the same language as hers (I could only talk to her in English) and whom she trusted more than me told her. I also got the feeling she was just using me for her work. My friends also started calling her 'bitch'. I was okay with her using me, maybe because I really just liked spending time with her. But yeah, we did drift apart and she started hating me lol

I guess she has found someone new she can love now. I try not to meet her, so I don't know. This is what mutual friends tell me. It is okay, I told her I just want her to be happy anyways, so can't really be selfish now :)

I have stopped chasing girls now. She has converted me into a man. A man which carries her photo with him all the time and cries in the rain sometimes, but a man nevertheless. She did take away a piece of my heart, but it matters much less, because at least I have started to understand the value of my own heart :D

My secret wish is that one day, when she has her cute children, she does let me play with them. I like kids. And then maybe, just maybe, she bites me, ruffles my hair and calls me 'beta'. That would work like a balm :D

I love her too much to not to let her go :))

Saw this on Tumblr:
The “friend zone” and unrequited love are not the same thing. Unrequited love is, “I love you, you don’t love me in that same way, I am sad about that.” The “friend zone” is, “I love you, you don’t love me in that same way, you have therefore wronged me.”

Unrequited love is, “My unilateral crush is my problem.” The “friend zone” is, “My unilateral crush is your problem.”

Agree??

There's this really cool girl called Stacy who always asks me to chill at her place. We'd be watching TV, or hanging by the pool (her family's rich). I think she likes me but the truth is, I really like her mom instead. It's gonna be hard to tell Stacy that I don't want to be her boyfriend but stepdad instead. Her dad walked out a few years ago, so I think I could stand a chance with her mom.

I used to have this very close friend who confessed to me. Now things just became super awkward and I feel awkward to even say hi.

After seeing all these posts about loneliness and relationship issues, I am kind of shocked as to how much I can relate to them. 

For me, I have always been the type of person who compartmentalize my friends, and as such, I always act a little differently around each group of friends to experiment around. As for the reason why I do that, I don't know. But I think it can be attributed to how I have always felt uncomfortable letting people fully into my life. I guess it can also be attributed to how my father always drilled in the notion of 'a fresh new start' every time I had a change in environment.

The persona that I had on ranged from loud uncaring and obnoxious kid in secondary school, to a quiet, seemingly intellectual kid in JC, to a seemingly demanding and confident officer in army, and to my current seemingly shy and awkward dude persona in NUS right now. 

I don't know why I did that, and now I feel drained as hell trying to keep up with all these different 'personalities' around different groups of friends, and sometimes I would just shut myself out from the world altogether, fearing that somehow friends from different groups would come together to discuss about me, and then finding out how different I am to the person that I made them believe to be me.

As a result, I never had a true friend. No one knows the real me. Even I myself am confused as to who I really am. Needless to say I have great difficulty in achieving intimacy in both friendships and with girls, and this have been bogging on my mind so much lately that it has been affecting my studies. I did so badly on my mid terms that I don't think I can ever pull up the grades with my finals.

I don't know what I want to achieve with this post, but I guess I just want to let those of you who feel lonely to know that, you are not alone in this.
-
 
He asked for my number a while ago, but I was shocked and didn't give a reply. I think he also felt awkward so he didn't ask me again. However, now I really regret it because after coming to my senses, I find myself liking him too and I really want to talk to him more. I haven't met him after that though. If I were to meet him again, what should I do? Should I ask for his number?

Hi guys , just a thought , will it be ok if I date a person of a different race ? I am a male  chinese -25 year old  , and the person im attracted to is a 25 -year old indian guy. He is so fit and cute  and cares for me  and what is ur opinion guys ? I am so in love with him , but can this interracial gay love work  over here in this dot  ?  My friends keep being racist and all , but honesty needed guys,.....does chinese-indian gay love happen here ?
-
 
To  This happened to me before and I was really annoyed and quite disgusted initially. Instead of just sitting next to her and saying hi suddenly, be a bit more indirect and ask if there's anyone sitting next to her then start talking by using the lecture's content as a topic? It probably will be less terrifying for her then. It's unlikely for her to fall for you right away so it'll take some time.  Since it's already week 11, if you really want to get to know her then just try? And maybe you guys can study together for finals. Even if it fails you won't have many opportunities outside lecture to meet her again anyway.
-
 
There is this guy that I am starting to fall for and he is the second guy that I ever liked. However, I found out from my friends that he texts quite a handful of girls (not with ill-intentions, just that he converse well with girls). I will end our conversation by not replying because I do not want to fall deeper, however, he will double text and ask me why I did not reply. What does that mean? I don't know if he does that to other girls as well.

Congratz girl! You had single-handedly slain a cold-hearted demon, are you satisfied now? Now I can finally empathized the feelings of all the girls that I had toyed with, over the years. I used to derive great pleasure and sense of accomplishments, when those girls relentlessly begged me to return to them, after being mercilessly dumped by me. 

Karma is a bitch uh? I had let my guard down, and you successfully gave me a taste of my own medicine. Never in my wildest dream, I could ever imagined that you got close to me, in order to plot my demise. Those innocent smiles, those false future that you had described to me and those crocodile tears that you shed for me..... 

If time can be reverse, given a choice I wouldn't choose the playboy life. No matter how many girls I fucked, my heart is still empty and miserable. You came into my life and proved to me that I'm still a human being. Only when you are hugging me, I could sensed my heart beating and that feeling is so warmth. I thought that an angel has appeared to liberate me from my darkness and a demon like me can finally find true happiness. For the first time in my life, I fell in love and I proceed to deleted all my FWBs contacts to devote all my heart to you.

You must have hated me a lot, to be able to deliver this fatal blow to me, so mercilessly. That smile of yours, is it genuine? When you saw my soul being ripped into thousand pieces, are you truly happy? Is this what you really wish for?

My heart is bleeding profusely now and it hurts like hell. But it's perfectly fine! What a great honor to die under your hands =)

Girls, how would you feel if you sat alone in lecture for the whole sem and then suddenly before the lecture start a random guy came up to you, said hi, sat next to you and just started talking? 

Reason i ask this is cos i just started noticing this damn pretty girl sitting alone in lectures for one of my modules. I never noticed her before cos I usually sit with my other friends.  Last week I happened to notice her and saw her sitting alone. Same thing happened today and i think it's safe to assume she's taking the module alone.   Should I just go up to her and say hi? I'm quite reluctant cos i keep thinking maybe there's a reason she wants to sit alone, or what will she think if a random guy just walks up to her and starts chatting. Will she be disgusted or what? I think it's pretty clear that if a guy does that he's trying to hit on her. I also scared she may not be singaporean (although from what I spied her doing on her phone and from her face i think she is). Not discriminating here but I probably won't want a potential gf to be from another country.

Sigh... it's already week 11 and next week i think it's last lecture. Such a pity i never noticed her earlier on in the sem. What should i do????? Or am i just being a despo? Help plz.
-
 
It's funny how you introduced your female friend to me as we are both single. Little do you know that actually you are the one that I secretly hope could be my girlfriend :( You are just so perfect and so ideal. But well, you are attached. I just wish that you are happy. Secretly admirer from far far away
-
 
I feel like an outcast for most of my life. I have quite a bit of acquiantances to whom I will say hi to whenever I see them nowadays, but I actually have very little friends at all.

Before I entered NUS, I was that kid who was really awkward, whom everyone would shun because of my weird antics. Somehow, someway or another I tend to offend people unknowingly, against my best intentions, and this repels people away and drew unwanted verbal and sometimes physical abuse from bullies in the past. I guess I had shitty social skills and emotional intelligence then. Throughout my secondary school to JC, I literally gained zero friends whom I could confide to. Yes, I was THAT weird. 

Thankfully going through 2 years of army had my head smacked hard in a good way, and I managed to be more 'normal' when I entered NUS. Actually, until now I still not sure if I have become 'normal', or that people simply grew out of the way they used to treat me. Though I can tell people definitely treated me better now as compared to in the past when I had zero social skills. I even gained a few friends now. I guess you can say my skills leveled up and I can somewhat connect to people on a superficial level.

However, my loneliness was still there like a gaping hole. Superficial interactions simply isn't enough to fill this gap. I find that I have a severe deficiency in my ability to connect to people on a deeper level, which results in my inability to form meaningful relationships with people, in particular in my endeavor to get a girlfriend. Somehow I have this inability to talk to people about how I really feel, my deepest thoughts about things and my outlook on life. It's like I have this barrier, this unconscious filter that I put up so that whatever I say would be pleasing to the person I am speaking to. But the things that are said are never deep enough to form meaningful connections with the person. The words spoken are politically correct, but never personal nor intimate. I want to get closer to people, but I have no idea how to.

I guess right now I am having some sort of a quarter life crisis right now , with everyone getting attached and some even getting married at my age right now. I still have one more semester left in NUS and I plan to make full use of it, but I have no idea to. Any advice from people who have gone through what I went through? Thanks

Being a flicker-minded guy who likes every pretty girl, i thought I would get over my first rejection quickly but it still hurt so fucking bad. It is not the humiliation or embarrassment or anything. Given a second chance I would still confess knowing I won't be satisfy with the friendship. I don't regret it but I still feel so bad. I just cry myself to sleep everyday. I wish someone I could break down in front of someone but being on exchange now, I have no close friend. 
I fucking hate this feeling. I don't want my crush to feel bad also. It is nobody's fault i understand. I wish I never knew you.

Please allow me rant. To the girl who often appears around CBLC room (might be a member): You look cute, esp with that cute bag of yours. It's not my first time seeing you, but I doubt you will ever notice the not-so-good-looking me. What's more is that you are always together with this same guy or surrounded by a group of guys. I envy how close they are to you. I often wonder why am I not one of them? You might never see this post, but I just want to say, you are my daily dose of happiness. I am not asking much, just hoping that you will notice me someday. Btw, I realised you are often in sleeveless top, do bring a jacket to class :) 

From the guy who is not fated to be your friend

It really hurts when you find out that people you've known for nearly half your life and regarded as your best friends choose to talk badly about you behind your back instead of talking to you about why they are unhappy with you. And it hurts even more when you realise it's because to them, the friendship is so far gone and the differences so great that they don't even think it necessary to try and address them any more.

Now I'm kinda afraid my remaining friends may secretly dislike me too.

How long does it take to mend this wound? 
-
 
I miss you, more than you will ever know. It's been 10 months but I still think of you and of the good times we shared. I'm sorry for all the broken promises I didn't keep, and for all the hurt you have felt and will feel. I will always be responsible for it, now and forever. 

I wish you all the love in the world.

Not too long ago, I got rejected with "you're a really nice guy. But the problem is with me".
I walked away without uttering a word.

I need help or just advice or motivation to get through this remaining one month of school. I'm depressed and its taking its toll on my studies. As much as I hate using it as an excuse, it really did affect me. I can't concentrate, tired all the time. In short, I don't have the mood to do anything. My CAP is sucky and I need to salvage it. I'm afraid that I'm going to get a warning letter after the exams. But I do know if I work hard now, I can make it at least over 2.0. Any advice, motivation would be greatly appreciated. I feel so lost right now...

I kinda wish that my facebook and instagram posts had a "seen by" function. I know I'm being stupid, but I'm starting to get really offended that nobody likes my posts, or they just take a long time to garner up a few likes. After all, everyone is always scrolling through their social media, so it can't be possible that it took them hours to see my post. Being an overthinker, I'm starting to feel that everyone I know hates me - evidenced by the lack of likes. Or maybe I'm completely insignificant to them - is that even worse than being hated? While I'm ready to accept this if this is true, I would just like some closure.

That moment when you find out someone you like is attached...haiz..;(

There are a few cafes which I wish to try the food. Sadly, I got no girlfriend to go with. I tried going alone a few times but seeing so many couples there always make me feel awkward and self-conscious.

Is it wrong for me to like someone else when I'm already in a relationship?

I really love my SO and I plan to marry her in the future (we've been together for more than six years, and I'm really sure she's someone I wanna spend the rest of my life with), but there's this girl whom I've become close friends with, and I really enjoy her company. 

Let's call her C.

C's attached too, but we hang out one-on-one rather often. We've made it clear to each other that we're both attached and should not develop any feelings for each other, but I find it really really difficult to suppress the feelings I get whenever I spend time with C. I look forward to receiving her texts, to our next outing and go out of my way to help her whenever she is in need. I don't, however, feel jealous whenever she talks about her boyfriend, or describes to me how sweet he is to her; I feel glad that she is being treated well.

I would like to believe that I'm only feeling and acting like this because I treat C as a really close platonic friend, but I can't tell if I'm just making excuses for myself. I don't wanna stop being C's close friend either, so I'm just bloody confused. Somebody help please? :(

sometimes i feel like a failure for not going to OCS in NS. My dad is a relatively high rank officer...I don't know if he secretly feels dissapointed that his son isn't of similar status.
-
 
I want to know what's the status between me and the guy I'm supposedly dating but I don't know how to broach this topic. (Point 1)

When it's just me and him, I can definitely feel the sparks and attraction. But when he's with his best friend or we're around my classmates, it's like...either he's being cold towards me(WHY DO GUYS BEHAVE THIS WAY AH? SOMEONE EXPLAIN PLS! Point 2) or I'm ignoring his presence deliberately (but this was in response to him being cold to me, I used to acknowledge him). 

The first few weeks, we used to heshohesho almost daily. But now, it's about once a fortnight and he regularly cancels on me. It feels like schoolwork is interfering between our relationship which is part of the reason why I don't want to be a bitch about the situation. I started feeling insecure after last night. He came, but I didn't and he didn't make sure I did either. I found this mildly humiliating and don't know whether I should continue investing myself in this relationship. (Point 3)

Any advice NUS Kakis?

So there's been something that's been bothering me for a while now. Previously, I was attached to this guy let's call him X. While I was together with him, I still went out for lunches / cafe outings with another guy, let's call him Y. X was aware and not exactly happy, especially since I met Y through Tinder. But I assured him nothing happened between us. Y was also kinda X's friend as they had met each other through a school program in the past. So I guess X didn't feel as pissed since Y was kinda his friend. But then the thing is Y would often make moves towards me, like attempt to hold my hand etc. However I never really let him hold until nearing the end of my relationship with X when we were fighting and on the verge of breaking up. After we broke up, Y somewhat pressured me into giving him a hand job. We were at his house watching movies then I went to take a nap, when I woke up he was holding my hand and like asking me if I wanted to do more. I was unwilling and he asked me to blow him, and like I felt bad??? because I kept saying I didn't want to and then he asked if he could eat me out. I didn't want that either, so in the end I compromised and told him I would give him a hand job, but then he wouldn't be allowed to touch me. So that happened. Afterwards I felt quite pissed about the whole thing because I didn't even want to do any of that, and I stopped talking to him for quite long. But now he has tried to initiate me to go out with him again, and I just give him the excuse that I'm busy with school. Should I just cut off all connections with him? 
-
 
How do I start talking to a guy from the same hostel as me? I see him around at times but we're not in any ccas or comms together (sadly), do not really have any mutual friends, etc. Could it be fate telling me that we're not meant to be? I do really want to at least try though. He is really cute! It's just I don't know how to do it so that it seems 'natural'. Any ideas?
-
 
After getting rejected by my crush, she is behaving cranky and weird. We already agreed to be friends minus the awkwardness. Yes I feel bad but I will feel even worse if I lose the friendship. Can ladies pls share some light what is she thinking?

Is she avoiding me/not replying my texts cos she feels bad about rejecting me? I already plan on telling her that I don't really feel that bad with her rejecting me and she already made it clear that she wants to be friend and I would not have not romantic interests towards her. So stop acting weird around me!! I should be the one embarrassed and awkward man.

went to the oktoberween party at sapore last night and met this gorgeous indian-chinese girl. i really want to ask her out but i am not singaporean and have no idea what local girls expect.. what do local girls like? how should i approach them? she seems like the chic kind. honest advice appreciated.. i don't want to screw this up!
-
 
I think for a guy to confess to a girl, you really need to have the mental preparation that you have at least 80% chance of getting rejected ( for many reasons or may be she is attached) and 20% chance of getting accepted. However, this is not to say you should not attempt to confess. I have friends who got rejected countless times but eventually they still get attached. It requires lots of patience as well as a positive mind set. I have already got rejected close to 10 times ever since I started confessing to my crushes over the last 4 years. Getting rejected hurts a lot but trust me it is temporary only. At least you can move on with life.

To OP of  

Hey, I feel you! In fact, I submitted a similar confession a few months ago about how I attended a camp but failed to make any really good friends, and that I found it hard to click with my OG mates, but it was not posted. Not the point here though. 

Like you, I am very bothered with it, even till now. However, due to my introvert personality, I understand that I am really not a 'camp' person. I attended that camp just to try stuff beyond my comfort zone and hopefully, to make new friends. I definitely tried a lot of new stuff during the camp. Some of my OG mates were nice enough to talk to me, and I even clicked off quite well with some. However, I found it really hard to click with the girls as they seem to have their own clique already, and because I don't spend much time with them for personal reasons, they saw me as this 'very quiet girl'. Subsequently, I didn't manage to make any friends close enough whom i can even ask out for lunch (I tried though, but it was awkward for the other party.)

At first, I felt that i must have done something wrong and gave myself a lot of stress in making new friends. However, I feel that, from the start, my character is not even suitable to be in camps, and that it is sort of not surprising that i don't make any. I joined a CCA which i enjoy and made close friends whom i really treasure. Just wanna press you on and tell you not to give up. If you feel that attending hall and camp activities give you more stress than enjoyment, then i feel that maybe, your character just don't suit them or click with them. Don't force yourself then. There are many other ways for you to make friends. If you tried really hard but that dun work out, then just forget about it, try new ways. Also, you may want to reconsider the way you approach people - is it too awkward for them? Sometimes, i think i tried too hard to act like i was close with them, i feel that this had a backfire effect which made others felt uncomfortable. Go slow and steady! Furthermore, it is only the first semester! Who knows, maybe next week, or even next semester, you can meet really close friends. 

Also, OP, i feel that i may know you and you may be the OG mate whom i clicked off well with LOL. Even if you are not, maybe we can know each other soon if fate allows and confide to each other about such problems. (: Just want to let you know what you are not alone!

So this week will be my first time going to a club with some classmates, I don't dare to tell them it's my first time because I'm afraid of what they might do. Can anyone tell me what to expect? Drinking games? Or just dancing all night? 
-
 
I do not like this module I'm taking. It's to do with gnitekram. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the professor and her tutor (the one is teaching me) are both rather.. oily personalities. I can't describe it. It's just, the image I get in my head is that of brilliantly colored eels with bared fangs. If they bit you, you'd know it but you wouldn't be able to catch them because they'd constantly slip out of your grasp. Why am I taking this module, you may ask? Because it fulfills one of my requirements so I didn't want to drop it and waste a semester.
You people might just be like, 'cool story', but I feel really uncomfortable.
I don't know, I just needed to rant. And don't tell me I'm being imaginative or overly sensitive or that I should go talk to them. Heaven forbid!

I was rejected. I really thought maybe we stood a chance. I really thought so because we enjoy each other company (or so I thought). She just walk into my bubble that easily without effort. You could say bird of the same feathers flock together. I was disappointed and sad. I don’t know if we could still be friends. I don’t think I can take it if she talks about other guys. I really really hope we still can be platonic friends. I might need some time off her. I am bummed about the rejection but it is not really bad. I just feel so sad that she do not feel the same way I feel for her. I do not regret for my decision to confess because sooner or later I have to do it. I need answers. I need to know the status of our relationships and not think constantly whether it is hanging-out or a date.  I really hate falling in love. Nothing good has ever come out of it. I hate the feeling of being super happy one day and depressed the next day. Can’t love be simpler, be less painful?

I am a very introverted person so there are not many girls who could come into my life so easily. I feel really so bad and confused now. I want to break contact with her because I know I will be hurt knowing that I might expect something more than a friendship in the future. But I still want her as a friend because I can say anything to her.  

Why is it so hard to find someone who love each other?

So, I've been feeling pretty down these few weeks because I think my crush does not seem to be liking me back. :( We met through one of our mutual classes this semester and we actually have each other's numbers and fb now. But the thing is, I'm not sure if he just sees me as a friend/classmate, or if he likes me but is shy to approach. Also, he seems like a really popular guy in school and has many friends, but from what I observed most of his friends are guys and i get the impression that he doesn't talk to girls a lot. (Though I could be wrong, since we aren't exactly close friends now) 
Are sociable guys also shy to the person they like? Next week is our last lesson together. Do you guys think it is a good idea to try asking him out to study after next week? At least I can be more sure if he likes/does not like me back and focus on studying after that, and things also won't be so awkward if he rejects, since we have no more classes together.

What should I do? I think I am in love with a prof. Is it alright to date with a prof? I am graduating next yr, should I make a move only after graduation?

Hi people, my crush whom I have known for around 2 months rejected me and we both agree that we should stay as friends. We got along really well and have went for outing/dinners alone before and that is also why I thought maybe I stood a chance. But now that I think of it, 2 months is really short and she has all the reasons to reject me. 

I want to keep the mentality of really just having her as a friend because I think she really understands me but I am afraid of developing feelings towards her. Do you guys know any girls who rejected guy at first but grow to like them after they started to know more and more about the guy?

-
 
I feel like a terrible person. I always promise girls orgasms through sexting and all, but when we eventually meet up for the real thing, I find it really difficult to go down on her. This is because during my overseas exchange last sem, I got badly traumatized in a one night stand when the girl asked me to go down on her and it tasted so fishy and nasty. Ever since then, I had developed a phobia of oral sex. I am even paranoid of how my penis smells after intercourse. Can someone please tell me that not all pussies smell bad? Like what most ppl here say, a guy who does not provide does not deserve. I really hope to eradicate my darkest fears of giving oral sex to a female.

To the dude who once said that all girls are bimbos and can't do proper group work... Guys who do no shit exist too for your info. And sometimes working with girls is more reliable.

Computing guys are desperate to the point of being sexist sometimes. Please, even if I female, I can code without you pretending to help. If I need help, I shall ask, there are plenty of you who will. Your desperation is such a huge turn-off.

Is it just me being surrounded by guys or are those few girls in ME really pretty? Not because they're the minority but they're actually pretty irl. Or ME3 girls, that is. They could be at least above average in FASS. 

One thing about ME is that these girls are always in their cliques of guys that I don't even know how to approach them! There's a cute short hair girl in my lab group but we din even have the chance to talk, and I only got to know her name from stalking the attendance sheet. Any tips for ME guys to know these girls? 
-
 
#rant I know i should not be complaining about this but do you, too, have that group mate that will appreciate/ listen to any other group mates except you? I have one! And he is super annoying. Every time he starts saying about something, and not necessarily about work, he always responds to the other girls in my group, like, stops to listen to what they have to comment, or shows sincerity in wanting to know their opinions. As for me, he just ignores me! Jesus, I cannot wait for this project group to end

HOW TO FIND LOVE ON TINDER
(You don't. Because going into anything with such high expectations will set you up for soul crushing disappointment. Here's some tips to increase your probability of getting some matches anyway.)

1. DO NOT swipe right for all hoping eventually one will match: Tinder algorithm discourage such actions and will not send you your best matches.

2. PROFILE PICTURES (mostly for guys): Please at least show your face. Picture says a thousand words so you want to tell the others that at the very least you are not some socially undesirable creature
(DO)
- Non-selfie, candid photos - look like you have social life and friends like you enough to help you take 
- photos with animals: look caring, animal-lovers can't be psychopaths right?? 
- Travel photos: posing with scenery as background is cute, but iconic landmarks a bit tacky
- posed photo with nice background: make sure it's instagram worthy
- engaged in hobby photo: shows that you are interested in life, also plus points if it is cool (highly recommended)
TIPS: wear collar shirt in your photo (make you look slightly classier without being too douchebag). Suits/ blazers are best.
 
(DO NOT). 
- selfie with room as background: I seldom see a good guy selfie. looks unnatural, also i may imagine you as some otaku who never leaves home 
- group photos: you think i come here to guess wth are you meh???? 
- photos of low quality: dont know kope from which hidden dungeons of the interent, or too poor to get decent camera
- studio/ professional work photo: look like insurance agent what if he want sell me something walao

3. Write something in your profile (both genders): state some interests, or what you think is important to let potential dating partners know, or some open-ended question to invite a conversation. Don't just lazily put your horoscope or some results from personality test and expect people to know all about who are you as a person.

4. Don't just say hi: tell you why are you interested in her as a person -she look like she can be the champion of a spelling bee, and you are a sucker for good spellers? her caption says she can eat all day and you would like to challenge her to buffet meltdown? make it personal, or at the very least, don't make her feel like she's one of the many other matches you are concurrently texting. Ditto for girls - in fact i strongly encourage girls to send the first message if you want a more engaging conversation.

5. Basically if you feel like it's a struggle to think of what to say to the other person, very likely this match is not gonna work out. if you can't even maintain a decent conversation online its gonna be awkward irl.

6. go in tinder with a open heart and mind - you may not find your future spouse, but you can make some new friends. <3 if really cannot then oh well at least it killed some time hahaha. 

REMEMBER! people can sense desperation.

Strategise and maximise your chances; YOU ONLY SWIPE ONCE

This is my second year in NUS and i have been feeling miserable and lonely. University life is too different from JC life. To make it worse, i am an arts student even though my interest and strength lies in Maths. How i wish i am able to turn back time and take up Maths instead. This makes me feel like my arts degree will be useless in future, hence the reluctance to study hard for my arts modules. However, i've scored As for my maths modules (which can only be used as UE). 

My CAP might not be good enough to take honours i think. But to me, even if i did well, i don't see the use of taking honours when i don't see my future job being related to my major.

Any advice on what should i do? I considered taking another Maths degree after getting this degree but its such a waste of time. I should be graduating and working so that my old parents can retire. 

Also, i feel lonely because my friends are all getting attached with boyfriends. I used Tinder, chatted along well with some guys (although i have never met them) but it's so embarrassing if we actually get together and tell people "oh we met on tinder". Hence my reluctance in meeting them.
My circle of friends is small in uni and i haven't met anyone i liked. I made an effort in joining a CCA but its full of girls haha. 

Ok i feel better after ranting..

Hi there, i hope this doesnt get filtered. Recently read that a few OPs are having issues with their mother disapproving of their BF and this seems to be giving them alot of stress and issues. 

Allow me to share my side of the story/POV. I play the role of the BF. When i first dated my gf, i face the same if not more disapproval from her parents. I get comments ranging from "he doesnt look good" to "he isnt even rich, if he doesnt have money why get a gf" to even more ridiculous things like "he must have a motive for dating you". These comments were received mostly in the first 2 years of my r/s. It definitely doesnt feel good. What helped was that my girl fought for me, yes, she argued and quarreled and choose not to accept what her mum had said. However, what i wish to tell you is that you should not be fighting this mission of "change of perception" alone While its important you fight for your relationship, it is also important that the guy is aware of such perceptions. Yes it is unfair, it hurts the ego of the guys, there are guys who takes it negatively and therefore the relationship bursts and breaks. However, if your bf is worth you fighting for, rightfully you should be worth your bf making the same amount of effort too. 

What i did after knowing, was to please her, yes, outrightly please her parents. Buy things over, show the care and concern, bite down the pride and ego, swallow what you have to swallow. Then both of you work together to change her perception. It happened that my gf's mum is extremely stubborn so it would at times be good to get siblings to slowly convince the parents.

I think many times we dont understand the way parents show concern over their children, especially the daughters. Ultimately, daughters are like gems in the family, your parents isnt going to easily hand over a gem to the guy isnt it :) This might help you to understand their actions easier. 

Oh and do always share positive things your bfs did for you, every little surprises, every little gestures. When they see the positivity in you, that you are happier, that there is a future and that you are truely taken care of, they will slowly let go and feel safe that "he can take care of my girl"

Fast forward now, im 5 years into my r/s and planning to continue it into a lifetime long. I am not saying i have the full set of solutions. However, i hope this little thing i have shared will help you guys to feel less stressed.

Lastly, at the end of the tunnel there will always be light! Please have faith! :)

Life is a struggle as a white girl in Singapore. All of the foreign men exclusively chase asian girls, and all of the local men are too scared/shy to talk to us...what are we left with
-
 
I am a guy who is extremely desperate for a relationship but in front of anyone I will act as though I take things naturally as I understand that girls do not like desperate guys. (And guys need their pride) The act was indeed very good to the extent that most of friends thought that I am choosing to remain evergreen. As a guy, I am pretty most guys who has not been through a relationship will act as though they are not desperate but deep down they are actually desperate.

I know I am many years late but can someone tell me what's the purpose of Tumblr and how does it work?? Last night I stumbled upon some of those sg girls xmm tumblr pages. While part of me found it disturbing that people's instagram photos are being "stolen" and posted on these pages, I couldn't stop looking...and eventually I fell further down the rabbit hole into tumblr porn :/ There seems to be a worrying trend of young girls/ladies taking sexy photos or even nudes of themselves and not keeping it very private (seeing as how it has been dug up and posted). I'm really conflicted because I find the source of these images and videos questionable - possibly illegal? - yet I couldn't stop looking, and I feel guilty about that.

Hi, would like to know if there are any successful cases of couples getting back together after a breakup. Recently met my ex and we started talking. Everything seems so normal and feels so comfortable, it was almost as if the breakup didn't happen. Think i'm falling in love all over again, even though moving on from that relationship was the hardest thing i've ever been through. Guess you can never truly get over your first love. 
-
 
, I totally understand what you're going through. With some of my friends, conversation is literally a competition. They can talk over each other for more than a minute without signs of relenting, and only stop when someone tells them to take turns to speak. Every time I talk one of them would definitely interrupt me, and I would just shut down after being interrupted. At one point I didn't even want to talk anymore.

Read online that you could say something like "as I was saying before you rudely interrupted me..." but if you're non-confrontational like me then just learn how to speak more confidently, since its always the people who seem more confident that are heard. Alternatively, you could google or search reddit for more tips, or head to 7cupsoftea to seek advice (these helped me loads). 

If all else fails, get new friends. I'm not kidding. Distance yourself from toxic people who make you feel like shit, and if everyone you know acts this way (like in my case), learn to be alone for awhile before you start hanging out with them again - the situation may not have changed but you'll feel a lot better about yourself knowing that you're not the problem. Good luck, and I hope things get better x

To  I had depression long ago and until today, my family still doesn't know about it. It will turn hell if they know, they are that kind of people who link depression with mentally insane (would probably send me to IMH). I bottled up my feelings, even my opinions are closely regulated to make sure they see the perfect me they wanted. I have a confidante, my best friend, whom I am grateful for. Similarly, OP, look for someone you can trust to confide in. You can start by telling them a little and tell them more as you gain trust in them. And if you really can't trust anyone, vent your opinions in a blog, locked away from everyone's sight. Its the best way to vent sometimes when I don't have my best friend around. Remember, you are not the only one going through this.

I'm not sure where to start.
I met a guy, J, when I was doing volunteer work. J's a volunteer too and has been there for a few years. We got really close then, he would bring me out for supper after the volunteer work weekly / send me home. J also got me an internship at the place he was working. That's when things went out of hand.  When his girlfriend was on summer exchange last year, he will sometimes get a room at a nearby hotel to make out. Other times he would kiss me, hug me and hold my hands in public. He assured me that his gf is total fine with it as she is also doing something similar with a guy from her course. During work, I got closer to one of my colleague, H, and eventually started dating him. That's when J got upset and threatened me that he would destroy H if I got together with H (which i did after i left the job). J made things difficult for H even after I left the job.

I left the job when school started but we are still volunteering at the same place. His then girlfriend (now fiancé) is not aware of all these things that has happened. Should I let her know? 

I have also reported his doings as 'unprofessional' to higher authorities and has resulted in some serious consequences. I don't know if I have done the right thing. All these that has happened is slowly eating me up inside. All I want is to protect H. I have never felt so much hate for someone. So much that I want to destroy him.

i was viewing some instagram profiles when i suddenly stumbled on to this user. He is a friend from my tutorial. Anyway the account is not connected to his facebook and the posts are weird. Most of them looks like cropped versions of his facebook photos and some are half naked photos of him. I have a feeling that someone made this to make fun of him and I dont think that this is a nice thing to do to anyone. However, im not sure if he is aware of it or is he okay with such things. I feel like bringing it up to him but then again it isn't really my business.

I've fallen for this girl in my block... The thing is that she's attached, although this was not known to me and I had been messaging her often for the past few weeks, with her responding positively. I think I have fallen for her pretty badly, and think about her almost all the time, believing that it was mutual. It was only recently that I found out she actually has a boyfriend, when a friend happened to tease her about her single relationship status. At that point, it got pretty awkward, because she became ver silent. It was only after a few days that she kind of hinted that she's actually not single. When I found out, all I can say is I felt disappointed and kind of deceived.

I'm an evergreen and I've never felt this way about a girl before. Like many people, I have trouble deciphering signals of attraction and tbh I'm not sure if she feels the same way towards me, although she displays many many signals. It is so hard to hope since she's attached. She tends to be much friendlier with me than to other guys e.g. turning to talk to me all the time and coming to sit near me. On text, she also tends to initiate conversations even when there's nth much to talk about. It might be wrong since she is attached, but based on our interactions I think she's one of those rare few girls that I am willing to abandon my singlehood for and possibly be with her for the rest of our lives. It's selfish, it's stupid, it's dramatic. I just don't know what to do anymore.

To ,
Tinder is a good place to start. (Unless you're a guy, then it's difficult)
Or if you're lucky enough one of your friends is super open minded and close to u and is willing to give it a shot....good luck!
Or you can always try here at whispers. Interested? ;)
-
 
Is it okay for us to not like a person with low EQ? I mean it's not their fault that they appear so unconsciously mean... but it shouldn't be our fault to be angry at them for being that mean right? I mean, i know a friend who is always bad with interacting with people, i don't blame the other person for being annoyed with my friend? 

Am i being mean if i say my friend deserve it?
-
 
To , i have the exact same issue as you (i re-read your post twice because i can't believe we are facing the exact same situation). Anyway, my mum thinks that my boyfriend is ugly and not presentable. She only met him a few times but without much communication. she always give him a really fierce and black face of disapproving which pains me a lot. i can't bear to let my bf know about it. my mum even asked me to look for other guys because she said "you don't have lack of suitors anyway" i quote. what makes it worse, she is stubborn so it is very difficult to talk to her because she totally shuts me out whenever i tried to speak to her nicely about him. and no i do not want to look for anyone else; we are both very serious in this relationship. 

i don't know how long is this going to take before she accepts him or is she EVER going to... i've been hopeful for the past one year but i am tired, i really am. especially when i go back home with a disapproving look every time she knows that i am out with him. this is hurting our mother-daughter relationship and it serves nothing good to any of us. i don't know what else to do and it is draining my energy till i dread to go back.

My mathematician/programmer boyfriend is unromantic and weird. But it's okay because I'm unromantic too and in the same frequency of weird (which is probably why we get along so well). And I love him for who he is :)

P.s. Anyone knows where to download romantic_bf.deb and normal_bf.deb?

To the guy I just met tonight. I am not sure if u will see this, but u are the man of my dreams. I hope u feel the same about me too :) and I hope there are subsequent meet ups!

To  you should've done the scorched earth policy the moment you broke up! Get rid of everything that reminds you of him (except for 1 or 2 most important photos or letters, and hide those in a box and don't take them out) and don't follow him on social media! You probably prolonged your healing process by continually checking his social media - how to move on like that :( All you can do right now besides that, is be patient with yourself and be open to possibilities. Acceptance takes time, and everyone moves on in their own way. Keep busy, keep improving yourself. Eventually, there will be a day where you realise you're content, and you're free :) It was not a short or easy journey for me but I'm here now and I know you will be too!
-
 
In response to , I would think that if taking a break would be beneficial for you, then by all means you are encouraged to. I took a semester-long LOA before due to personal reasons, and I felt more comfortable and ready to continue my studies when I returned to school after the break. You don't even need to let your friends know and people usually won't ask either. I did feel a little uneasy to be taking in my even-numbered sem when everyone's doing their odd-numbered sem (i.e. My 4th sem in sem 1 this year when people my batch are in their 5th sem), but I realised I was thinking too much because most people will just assume you've been at SEP :)
-
 
I have a question and I hope it'll be posted. So, I was talking to my friend and the guy behind her kind of looked at me and gave this strange expression, like a very small smile? Is that good or bad?
-
 
I hope this doesn't get filtered. I really want to rant this out.

I don't get why this is constantly a recurring issue I face while studying in NUS libraries: people talking at their normal volume without even the slightest effort to lower their volumes

People get even noisier if seated in a group. Like just because they need to discuss something then they think it's okay to be talking relatively loudly, or even have a right to do so? Shouldn't you be moving your stuff outside/toilet area if you have discussion to do?

Is it that hard to be considerate towards your peers?

Everyone thinks that I go to the gym because I wanna hook up chicks in the future. However, the truth is........I'm planing to work as a social escort in the future, if I become a hunk.

To  
This is from a girl's point of view. I suggest you try to get to know her first. Talk to her, initiate meals together or maybe studying together. Once both of you spend more time together it will naturally be more comfortable. Personally if a guy who has never spoken to me before  suddenly confessed, I wouldn't be put off. Although I'd most likely reject BUT suggest for us to start as friends first. It is better for both of you to get to know each other rather than rush into a relationship.
And to be honest try taking the initiative to know the girl, I know of some girls who will never take the first step or show interest even if they do like you. Good luck!

I had sex with my girlfriend last week. It was pleasurable. The thing is i couldnt control myself and i unloaded on her chest. I like the feeling. However i was wondering if this turned girls on?
-
 
To OP ,

How obvious were you? Unless you explicitly told him "I like you" there's a chance that he might not have read your hints (some people are just that blur, myself included hehehe). Just give it a shot! What's the worst that could happen? For all you know, he could be expressing his form of "liking you" as he's too shy to shoot the question himself. If you really like him, just go on ahead and ask :3 All the best!

"Three words, I'm yours"

to guy-who-takes-the-same-class-as-me,

i think you are very charming (-: i admit, i think your looks are above that of the average guy. but that's not why i'm attracted to you. 

from the small number of interactions we've had, i can see that you're smart, you're a hardworker & you've a big kind heart.    

& that smile of yours, it gives me butterflies in my stomach.  

- from a girl wishing she has more courage to ask you out to lunch someday

Im a girl and hv a high sex drive but I dun like talking about it. Im not interested in ons or fwb. I recently brought up the issue to my bf and he told me he was a bit disturbed by it. Nt sure how I should feel about it...pls dun troll, looking for advice..
-
 
To the OP of . Thank you for posting what you did. I'm sorry you had to go through all that but your post is something I really needed. Like you, I'm from a low tier JC, and I've not made any friends for the past year. I sit alone in lectures and I hate it. I've gotten used to it by now, but it still sucks. I thought uni life would be exciting. But it's just the complete opposite.I'm honestly depressed and its affecting my studies. I try to ignore it. But going to school everyday and looking at people in cliques, surrounded by friends while you're all alone is just sad. I will definitely take heart from what you said in your post. Thanks again!
-
 
I would also like to thank the OP of  as I can relate to it. I really needed it because it showed that people who did not do any wrong can still be excluded/bullied. I'm really glad for the post as I couldn't understand why it was so hard to make friends and was excluded e.g. being lied to that someone's car had no space to include me so I had to walk alone, ignored messages asking whether I could sit with them during lectures, even while sitting together they did not really bother talking to me etc. I asked my friends why I was treated so badly and they actually told me to find out what I did wrong. This may make sense but I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong and my friends couldn't suggest anything either. It was really hurtful that i was told to be nicer when I didnt do anything wrong and as I was sure they were determined not to include me in their clique from the outset, they were not welcoming from the start. I'm sure it was also because I was of not much use to them as I was not popular, no connections, not that smart and these are prized things in my faculty. I lost interest in studies feeling bad I couldn't fit in and scored a mediocre CAP but I managed to get a much better CAP the next semester. I would advise people going through this to not be so harsh on yourself, find those less superficial people who will like you for your sincerity and personality and not what you can offer and please don't neglect your studies. In fact try to score well and push them down the bell curve, I suppose they deserve it.

How can I stop being overly-attached? 

My boyfriend complained/hinted to me that I am overly attached, meaning not giving him enough personal time. Maybe it's just me, when I love someone, I would want to be with him as much as possible, see him as often as possible, and I wouldn't mind discarding my other plans or neglecting other less important things just to see him. I find myself constantly thinking about when's the next time we can meet, preparing surprises to make him happy, and spending a long time to think about what to wear. But I think I am suffocating him. It's not like I don't have my own work to do, but when it comes to him... I am just willing to give all I have. So when he doesn't show the same amount of ethusiasm or give the same amount back, I do get a little upset. He said he should not be the centre of my universe.

How can I get over this lonely feeling, and what can I do to change? To not come across as overly-attached?

My SO is on exchange right now and she has been spending all of her spare time taking part in social activities. We whatsapp each other but she hardly replies me because she is occupied with other people. We only have skype sessions about once a month, about an hour long each time. I've tried asking her to make some time for us, but she says she wants to enjoy her exchange. This is a yearlong exchange and I am not sure what's in our future. As a benchmark, we used to have meals about 2-3 times a week, and go somewhere once a week before she left. We also whatsapped quite constantly. Any advice? I understand that being in a LDR often means cutting down some time but I think my girlfriend isn't keen to put in the effort. Am I asking for too much?

Year 4 engine student here. I am already graduating soon and have not found love during the 4 years of study here. I have never had a girlfriend before and so I don't know what it is like to be in a relationship, and I fear that girls don't like inexperienced guys like me. I have had many crushes before, but this fear kept preventing me from approaching them at all. I would think about all the possible ways how the interaction would go wrong with me being such an awkward person and in the end after thinking so long, the moment has passed and I lost the opportunity to talk to her.

Recently, I have been noticing this girl, but I don't really have the chance to spend time with her as we are in different courses and we only see each other once a week during practices, and even during the practices we would not have a chance to interact at all. To this date, I have never even introduced myself to her. I really don't want to keep missing out on opportunities and life like this, and I want to ask her out for a date or something. 

Should I just ask her out? Or should I get to know her better first, by saying hi and making small talk, but wouldn't it be too slow this way considering we won't get much interaction during practices at all?

Hello to all the couples out there! I just want to ask how you and your partner communicated before you two officially got together (still in the wooing phase). Were the texting and meeting up very frequent? Did both of you take the initiative to start conversations or is it mostly one person doing it all the time?
I got closer to an acquaintance a while back and we started texting. We seem to hit off well and I can tell she puts in as much effort as I do to not let our conversations die. We usually reply to each other's WA messages the moment we see them, pretty much like instant messaging, and if something comes up she'll let me know with a ttyl and then resume the conversation later. All the signs are looking good except that she rarely initiates text conversations and I'm usually the one who does it. She has a shy personality so I'm not sure if this is normal or that she's not interested and I shouldn't try to take this to the next level.
Sorry for the wall of text, any constructive input is much appreciated!

Did anyone used NUS's CPS services before? My emotional health isn't exactly that strong and I have been internally debating for 2 years if I should go any try it out. So far in the past, the bad thoughts would fade after a while but nowadays the thought lingers 24/7 in my head even though I am laughing and having a good time with my friends. 

I'm honestly scared that I may be judge for overreacting as honestly sometimes I don't think I'm depressed at all. And I can't ask any of my friends cause of my own personal psychological barriers plus on the outside I am often depicted as the cheerful bimbotic girl. 

Please advice.

This is a letter to my ex and I know you will be reading this. With this break up comes its lessons. Thank you for teaching me how to be independent and to deal with pain/loss. Thank you for teaching me that I need to love myself better first. Thank you for loving me and trying to do everything to make me happy. Truthfully, you have hurt me very deeply and I can't yet find it in me to wish you and your new gf well. Especially since we've been together for 4 years now. Though you still want to be friends, I think I rather not see you again so soon. Maybe in future we will meet again stranger if we should be so lucky.

I've been dating a guy for a few month but I can't keep my attention off another guy i always see in dining hall. He's mixed asian, i think on exchange, and i always see him eating alone at cinnamon dining hall. I'm too shy to talk to him or offer to eat with him, but he always catches me staring at him.

Is it wrong for me to have feelings for another guy even when dating my current boyfriend for so short? Should I approach this guy or would it be considered unfaithful?

This is a legit question and not a troll. Im a girl and im not very good looking but im attracted to this really cute guy. Im not interested in a relationship, only perhaps ONS or on a FWB basis. How do i approach him regarding this? Will he be disgusted and tell the whole world about my proposition? Im quite afraid of what his reaction might be

I can't help but notice that the guys in NUS are rather shy (or at least they appear to be because they tend to "friend zone" girls a lot of the time, maybe they do that to hide their feelings incase the girl is not interested? I don't know) But after 8 weeks, I've seen loads of situations in which the guy drops a hint at the girl and she responds positively but then he retreats and pretends it never happened.   (We have at least 3 years of university, which means at least 1095 days to find the "other half", that's a lot of time for trial and error...BUT I'm not saying to just go around and have a million short term relationships!)  So... that just makes it hard for me to tell whether a guy is interested in me. On somedays, I want to sing aloud to my heart's content (because he gives me an impression that he likes me) and on other days I hope for a thunderstorm so I have a reason to drown my sorrows in my room with a tub of chocolate ice-cream. (Maybe I misinterpreted his actions, maybe I thought too far...) But how am I supposed to tell, if he's doesn't take the first leap of faith???

Advice for guys from a girl's point of view: if you're gonna drop a hint, don't retreat, don't EVER lead a girl on and then just leave her hanging there! (She'll find someone else) And if you're going to take the first step, take a BIG step, if the interest is not mutual, you got nothing to lose, (if she talks about it to her "clique" you sure that's the girl you still want to be with?)

Should one be friends with someone who has feelings for them, without reciprocating them? Is it cruel to continue being friends? Considering that one has to meet them everyday in school, what should be done? Where to draw the line???

Why do so many girls in Singapore have 'not here for hook-ups' or 'no fwb' in their profiles?  Are the men on tinder really creepy here, are the girls prudish, or do they just hope to find someone serious through an app like Tinder?

I usually club with a small group of regular guy friends (I'm a girl). I previously dated one of them but we broke up, but I am still close to the rest of his friends. When we go out to club, I tend to slut it out (dance pretty inappropriately). I've been told by guys in the club that I'm a good dancer (aka dance until damn slut lol). But I don't dance with guys that approach me especially recently. When I first started clubbing this year I did dance with random guys, but for many months now I haven't. I have started to like one of the guys in the group of guy friends (main reason why I reject the guys who approach now). However this guy has seen me dance really slutty with other guys in the past, and I DID date his friend. Is there a chance that I am still viewed as dateable to him? ): Like proper girlfriend not a fling type?

I am that person, who frees up time to listen to others problem. I am that person who tries their best to be there when others need them. I am that person who at times, when required, put others need above their own. I am that person who like everyone else more than everyone else like them. I am that person who feels like a toilet paper (not even a plastic bag) that is thrown away after being used. I don't even know what i am doing wrong. I have never been asked out for a second date. I am rarely asked out on outings with friends. I don't even get asked out for lunch between lectures in school.  Does anyone else out there who feels the same way?

I want to receive treatment for depression. Only thing is, if I really do see a doctor for depression, would it affect my future employment? Will companies look into your past medical history? Even if you do not disclose it, they may find some ways to check you for due diligence before employing you? This is the only thing that is stopping me from visiting a psychiatrist or visit the polyclinic for their psychology services. Advice?

I see myself as a broken, a soul damaged by the trysts of my past. As such I feel like I shouldnt find love because of the fear that the shards of my soul will only hurt another. So much love to give but at what a price.  

I should stop seeing myself like that but deep inside I know that no one will accept my repentance but God. 

For now I will carry on life wearing a hood like a lone gypsy traversing through the cold, taking in the warmth of the experiences I behold every once in a while. 

Id only admire from far. And give my heart to causes I deem will help humanity, not for progress but to give hope to those who have been left behind. 

A life spent yearning but what other choice have I. I am afraid deep inside. 

One day I will bid farewell to those who have loved sheltered and cared for me in one way or another so I can be who I truly am. Beneath the broken shards is a little bird wanting to fly free.

As a musician, I feel like the university accords us less respect than the sportspeople. We don't even get IFG or intervarsity representation, it seems like these things are only given to sportspeople. Am I the only one who feels this way?

Is it normal to not have a personal space between friends, especially between guy and girl? My guy friend brushes against me casually and i realise he doesnt move around that close to the other girls. What is that supposed to mean?

I'm an exceptionally horny guy.

And most definitely really good in bed. Don't NVNT me, if you dare, post below and give me a try. The other girls I've had tell me I'm the best they've had.

But I'm not here to advertise.

you see, not a day goes by where I don't wish I was simply less horny. Or not horny at all. All through my life it's been no joke - I've had to endure uncomfortable erections during all morning assemblies in my secondary school years. It's not like I was looking at girls or fantasising. Heck, I didn't even know what porn was yet (ironically I found out what porn was thanks to a prohibition sign outside the computer lab). I used to stand up to go back to class with awkward boners sticking out of my pants, and was laughed at enough times until I figured out a way to artfully conceal it. 

Ever since I've discovered masturbation, I've had to get myself off at least once a day - or not be able to sleep thanks to the boner. My max was 5 times in a 12 hour span.

But it bothers me. Does anyone know of any anti-aphrodisiacs that exist which simply make people less horny? Seriously, if a reverse-viagra existed, I'd be quite happy to take it. I'd like to enjoy sex, not be forced by my instincts to find partners just to get by.

To make matters worse I'm not exactly good at getting attached either. I'm not the easiest person to live with, and I'm incredibly picky too. Plus there's a super high risk that whoever I get together with simply doesn't have a sex drive as high as mine. I'd hate to think she's just giving in to me rather than enjoying it with me each time.

tips for the ladies. how to tell if a guy likes you. 
1) guy friend always sits next to you in lecture/tutorial amongst other friends/clique, and he sits leaning towards you. i.e him sits leaning like this --> / | <-- you sit straight like this
2) when something funny pops up in his mind, the first thing he does is to ALWAYS turn to you to laugh/joke about it. (even though he has other friends beside him)
3) he subconsicously squares his body to you (open gesture) even when amongst other friends
4) he tries to take pictures of you 'for fun'
5) he leans in to talk to you even under normal circumstances (not whispering)
6) he mirrors your sitting posture/arms position unconsciously
7) he tries to establish body contact by poking, and tapping anywhere else other than the shoulder. e.g forearm, sides, cheek etc

girls, if you like the guy, reciprocate! this is one way to 'hint' back to him by mirroring his actions!

but if you know that this guys already has a girlfriend, you have a problem! please do him and his girlfriend a favour by distancing yourself! applies if you do not like him too, don't lead him on!

You know, it sucks to know you are considered second-choice for someone of the opposite sex. Even when you got into a one-night-stand with her because you picked up on her innuendos before the guy she was crushing on did. 

She's a fresher btw. So is the guy she says reminds her of her BF very much. They're both my close friends, and I protect them both as equally and as much as I can do for people I deem to be in my clique.

What's even more twisted is that she has a boyfriend who's in a LDR with her, and she had been having sexual compatibility issues with him in the past year (Yes there is such a thing as too much stamina, as well as both parties wanting to play submissive). She screwed me and the guy she was crushing on within a week of arriving at uni, and it was through sheer will that all three of us managed to make nice and revert to purely friendship status with her. 

Yet thanks to that one night with her, I'm reminded of my singlehood status all too painfully, as well as my emotional and circumstantial unavailability to dating seriously. Me and her are very much sexually compatible, and I display enough of a separate character of my own as compared to her present BF whose only commonality with her is in terms of gaming that she considers me attractive in my own right. I want a friends-with-benefits with options to go exclusive on her discretion, but I know it's next to impossible because I can't be the bastard to break up her relationship with her BF, as unsatisfactory as it is. 

The stress and tension within me regarding how and if I should press the issue of FwB with her is bad enough that I have had to rub four out every night before I sleep since that one night with her. Considering that I usually rubbed one out every night before bed four is a sure sign of emotional and mental turmoil within me. I'm not sure what my best course of action now is. I can see a non-committed arrangement with her working out perfectly (we acknowledged that we both have similar sexual appetites) however I'm not even sure that it can be done without blowback considering how my male friend is also implicated and how she still has a BF at this point of time. 

Help?

With reference to  - I'm a dude... With reference to  - hang in there. I don't have experience in that, but I do believe time heals most things. I've been hurt before and I remember it felt like I was dying - but I didn't, and I'm still here, and I'm just fine! Just remember you deserve to be happy. I'm sure you will find someone who deserves you.

I've been really troubled over this for the past month or so. How do you know if you truly love someone? Or could it be that you just love having someone around for you?

With reference to , if a person is a vixen and intentionally wants to go all out to get what she ultimately wants, she will act considerate and ask the guy to reconsider his current relationship just so she could get the foolish guy's trust and think that she is really understanding type and at the end of the day, she will be the one the guy chooses. But this does not make her any less of a vixen and a goddamn 3rd party, does it?

My boyfriend becomes very different (like more aggressive and calling names) when making out, is it normal? I feel a little intimidated and also awkward whenever it happens.

I'm a decently attractive girl and pretty much into fashion so I like to dress up to school everyday (I know I know, npnt buttt this is an anonymous site, gimme BOD can?)  from FoE  but I've noticed every engin guy's total lack of interest in me. It's like they don't even notice me. Not just me but like I've noticed generally they tend to have a lack of interest in interacting with girls and prefer to focus their attention elsewhere. There's nothing wrong with that but well guys if you're complaining about being forever alone, this might be why? 

-
 
Cheaters will always be cheaters, 3rd parties will always be 3rd parties. If a vixen is bound to wreck your stable relationship, she will lower herself to a meek sheep, bow to you and tell you to reconsider your relationship so that she can appear in your life 'graciously'

How can I help my friend who has trust issues? He has almost no friends except me because he doesn't not trust anyone. The one closest to him is his mum and she always call him "handsome" in front of other people when he is obviously not. He thinks that he can trust no one because even his mum is lying to him. How can I help?

Just wanted to share some stuff here I don't really tell others about, whether it's to vent off some frustration or to release some tension, hope you guys don't mind. I'm not gonna reveal too much though of course, else I may just expose my identity.

I'm a girl who doesn't really have guy friends. I'm known to be the quiet, mugger kinda girl though I've attended camps and everything when I was a freshie. I display my 'anti-social' side of me in front of people i dont really know, but I'm pretty crazy with my close friends or people I'm comfortable with. I really yearn to have that one friend I can talk to, I can listen to, I can just share anything without being judged. I've met quite a few who said they care but in the end, they didn't really give two shits about me. 

On a side note, no I'm not a mugger, I don't study like weeks in advance. In fact, I procrastinate till I really cannot procrastinate anymore (like the night before). Why? I'm busy playing league (of legends) - anyone wanna play with me can leave your ign in the comments (if this gets posted up) HAHA. But yeah, I pretty much game all the time. Bad habit, I know. 

i just feel this sense of loneliness I can't distract myself away from, and it's really depressing. Just hoping to have that one friend who's willing to listen and be there for me, and likewise, who I'll never dessert when he/she needs me. (:

That's it for my rant. Now to go back to gaming.

I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years and counting now. We have a good relationship built on trust, understanding and compromise, and recently we have been discussing about applying for a flat. But that will not be the agenda for this post.

After being together for so long you just get used to each other. Nothing really surprises you anymore and you can literally read each other like a book. It is especially hard to make special occasions (like birthdays and anniversaries) retain that certain "wow" or X factor that gives you that magical feeling when you first fell in love. I would say most couples would reconcile that with an active sex life, which is virtually non-existent in our relationship. She has certain values which she wishes to adhere to and I respect and honour that. As with most guys, this is an extremely frustrating scenario but having coped with 7 years without resorting to unfaithfulness, I guess you do not need me to tell you what the gameplan is. 

To complicate matters we are on totally different lifepaths now. She's slowly making her own impact in the corporate world while I'm stuck in a lecture theatre trying to figure out what the professor is trying to say. The only time we have for each other is on the weekends, and even so, she may have to work and I feel obliged to devote some time to my readings as well. My family is not very well off compared to hers and in general; I find it imperative to prove myself and to "make it".

As of late things are pretty good, but there are numerous occasions where things can just get real bad real quick. I am good with keeping the relationship in this stage of relative comfort, but I am afraid that this would turn stale as a result of this stagnation. I am probably being very pessimistic about this, but knowing her when shit happens she expects an immediate response and that is what I am extremely horrible at. 

Anyone out there able to help spice things up given the context laid out above?

I'm extremely confused. I have no idea if I'm suffering from mild depression or I've just become plain lazy. I'm in my second year now. I have not made a single friend since. Even my 'hi-bye' friends are a handful or less. I had very high expectations when I came to NUS. I thought I would be able to make a lot of friends, join CCAs and just be very active in school. Never happened. 3 months into Y1S1, I was crying almost every night. I just couldn't stand the thought of being alone. I felt so embarrassed as if everyone was judging me. It became worst in Y1S2. I had no motivation to study. I rarely touched my books. I just didn't feel like going to school anymore. My CAP was very bad. Just passed. I knew I couldn't carry on like this. So I went to see the counsellor when Y2 started. I guess it helped a bit. But I'm not very comfortable with her either. It's just sad when you expected Uni life to be a certain way, but it ended up like this instead. I do procrastinate even in JC. But I always got my work done, memorised etc. But when Uni got so lonely, I just didn't feel like studying anymore. I sleep a lot more now, which is unusual for me. Being alone sucks.

Whats the point of studying in library with your friend(s) if you are so compelled to talk? Even whispers and murmurs are distracting to those who are really studying and want some quietness

I'm an extremely insecure girlfriend and I'm the sort to get jealous when my bf talks to other girls. But recently I find myself masturbating to the thought and image of my bf making out with and touching other girls inappropriately. Tbh I find the scenario quite hot. Is this weird? Does anyone have this experience as well?

I really dont understand how people can move on and love another person so quickly. I have been trying so hard and still no progress.
Its been going 3 years since he left me. Tried all sorts of methods to forget, but they never seemed to work.
Ever since that day, i have been filling my free time with many different activities, hoping to take my mind off him. But everyday there would be something to remind me of him. Stuffed toys, dramas, couples holding hands.. sometimes random memories would come back to me at unexpected timings. He even appears in my dreams regularly.
Tried to tell myself i hate him, he is happy without me, he has moved on and found someone esle, he isnt worth it.. but everytime i think "hey, i think i've made some progress", something has to happen to prove that im still at the starting point. I thought graduating would make things better.. but nop.
Everyone around me thinks im fine. Asking me why i havnt found someone esle, asking if i would like some help in knowing more guys. I would always put on a smile and say let nature take its course. But who am i kidding, even if the best guy were to appear in my life now, i know i will have difficulties accepting him. 
Im not scared of being single for the rest of my life, i totally would have no problems with that.
But i fear at just the thought of not moving on, i fear that i still love him no matter how much i tell myself no. Im really tired of living life like this.

Advice to  I have been through depression myself and also helped others along the way. What I can say is we don't really like advice nor comfort. That sort of 'it is all right everything is ok' is bullshit to us. But what we need, is your listening ear. Initially, we might take a very long time to open up our problems to you. But my friend, through countless persuasion, finally made me confess. There are times that we screw up things, get into a quarrel for some small reasons but be gentle with us, because we are going through tough times. Give us some leeway and sometimes, give us time to be alone. When I had more 'me time', I could sort out some problems on my own and with some help and a great listening ear, gotten over depression a little. To be exact, depression can last very long (mine last almost a year) and certain events can re-trigger depression. Ultimately, it was dangling between resistance and susceptibility. to you, OP, it takes a lot of effort but it is worth it for your brother. Perhaps he will thank you someday. Take care! :)

Anyone get the feeling that your life has gone to shit and continuing to be alive is meaningless? Here's a summary of my life:

Expectation: I'm gonna make a bunch of friends and have a good time in uni!
Reality: No friends, going lesson alone, eating alone.
Expectation: The student population is so big, one day I will find a girlfriend!
Reality: Forever alone. Female friends also don't have. Never even been noticed.
Expectation: I'm gonna join my favourite sport and one day represent the school at IVP or Sunig!
Reality 1: Never made the A team.
Reality 2: Suffered a career-ending injury, probably have to give up the sport for good.
Expectation: With the lack of social life, I should be able to get good grades i.e. at least second upper.
Reality: Nope. Stuck in second lower in final year.

With such a life, how would you even find the will to live? I think the only reason I'm still alive is because I'm too afraid to die. Sigh, such a loser.

The sun has failed to shine again.

Here I am on the mrt home, after a 6-8pm paper. Gastric pain hurts. But the feeling of knowing all those hours were for nought hurts even more. I was prepared to have late lunch so that hunger would not affect me during the paper, have a nap at noon so that I'll be mentally energized. 
It sucks to see that what I've focused on did not come out. I've totally misinterpreted the crucial questions.

My dreams were fragmented with the essay assignment. And now another potential major has bit the dust.

I should've known my calibre when so many classmates failed to get in NUS. Now I know how it feels like when all your interests dissipate one by one. Maybe I'm just really not suitable for this path.

This pond was too big after all.

Hi all! I'm a year 4 undergrad this year and i'm still evergreen! My circle of closer friends are all guys and I'm wondering how i can break out of this evergreen status. I kinda like this girl from a module i'm taking. She is also my project groupmate. She has a nice smile and a personality i like. I really wish to interact more with her out of project and know her more but she has her own friends/coursemates in our project group. It's hard for me to become closer to her. In fact, i even fantasised about her being my girlfriend but i know it's a far fetch thought at the current state i'm in now.

I have a lack of experience in socialising with girls and past unfortunate events have made my cognitive abilities decline over the years. My memory becomes so bad that i don't remember my past experiences very well. Therefore, i always lack content to share with others. This deters me from talking to girls for too long as I'm afraid i would run out of stuff to talk about. I don't really like to expose my inadequacies to them.

Perhaps, the first step is to get to know more female friends and get myself comfortable in interacting with them on a frequent basis. However, i always have the thought that by doing this, i would be kinda like using other girls as a stepping board to the girl i like. I'm at a lost of how to change my current situation of having little female involvement in my life.

In less than a year's time, i will be moving on to the next phase of life...the working life. The chances of having innocent heart to heart interactions with girls would be so much slimmer. Coming back to this girl i like, i think it would be a great pity for me if i just let this potentially awesome friend or even girlfriend slip by just like this. I really wish to at least become her friend but i don't know what to do from here...ahhh...

Since the summer holidays, i've been keeping in touch with my ex bf (after breaking up in dec 2013) and since the start of this sem, i even go out with him on fri/sat nights almost every week because both of us are single (and lonely and bored). It seems possible that we can get back together but after he ORDs in dec, he'll be going to uk for uni, and he might even stay in uk for good if he decides to... I dont believe in LDR as i know im not one who can live with my bf being abroad for so long, and if he doesnt come back then what am i even waiting for? Sigh and there are 2 other guys chasing me, and they both dont know the situation im in with my ex (is this status considered amber??) Besides, both arent my cup of tea in terms of looks  but one has a great personality which i admire... Should i move on from the unhealthy relationship with my ex and give one of the guys a chance? ;( any relevant advice is welcome too!

This has been bothering me for quite some time alr.

After a year tgt, my gf just broke up with me last month because she felt that she felt that we are not suitable and she needed time by herself and worked on herself and loved herself more before she can love someone else. Of course, i was heartbroken but decided to respect her decision and move on and let her go. However, it was more difficult than ever esp when we see each other everyday as we are in the same clique of friends. And she still treats me like what we used to except without any physical contact this time. So, I am really confused now and really dont know what she is thinking now.

Really hope you guys can help me out on this. Much appreciated.

I've always been curious about what a different type of life good-looking guys live. I'm a below average guy, I exercise a bit but I'm not buff at all. Most guys know what kinda life I lead. Nobody takes a second look at us, nobody checks us out, paper bag would be preferred, etc etc. 

It's obvious that good-looking girls get a lot more attention and get hit on a lot. But does the same happen for good-looking guys? Don't need ask for picture because you'll just report to Facebook to delete. :(

To the OPs of  and 
Oh my... When I read the first post, I felt so sad. Then later I saw someone reply, it seems like a lost love. I hope both of you managed or will manage to work it out. If you both currently still have feelings for each other, I hope you are willing to give it another go?

I know I'm just some anonymous person standing at the sidelines, but I hope you two will recover from the heartbreak. All the best.

To OP , one of the strongest crushes in my life turned out to be on a girl who had no ass and no boobs, but had a pretty face. It was her looks that made me first take notice, but it was her smile that made me go crazy. For the record, she caught a lot of attention from other guys' too as I had quite a fair bit of competition.

So, speaking from a personal viewpoint, I really doubt you would have problems attracting guys. That said, as some pointed out in the comments, different guys are attracted to different types of girls. My guys-only cliques can never seem to reach a consensus on how attractive any given girl is. And after a while, we acknowledge the differences and say things like "Eh, this girl not my type, but I think is yours, correct or not?"

Long story short, there are guys who find you attractive physically. And smile more often.

With so many posts on fwb, can someone tell me whr to find them? Like really LOL. I have stong needs now

Is it normal and/or acceptable to fantasise about another person when I am attached, if I have no intention to act upon said fantasy? Does it mean that this I am somehow subconsciously dissatisfied with my current relationship?

I am just wondering what love really is like and how much a couple is willing to sacrifice for each other.

So I'm posting a question to all the couples that are very in love with each other now. Imagine what if one of your partner was found to have a certain illness such as diabetes, would you give up on your partner?

-
 
I feel very sad for my friend. Her jerk ex broke up with her over whatsapp (!!!!) and got together with another girl "a few months later". (The two of them have been talking for the longest time before that) I don't understand why and how the new couple's friends are so supportive of this relationship and ships them like crazy? Walao eh I thought people usually disapprove of this kind of relationships? 

But I'm kind of happy that she's now single, if you know what I mean ;)

Coming from a single parent family, i have always supported my dad lookin for his other half after my mom's passing when I was kid. 

A few months ago, my dad brought someone whom he met from a single parent dating site for dinner. As my dad wanted to make it a casual date, he too extended the invitation to her daughter as well.

The two of us hit it off really well and we often meet up for supper almost twice every week. 

Now that my dad wanted to take the next step with my to be step mother, i'm afraid that the feelings that i've developed for her might not be appropriate in the future if our parents are to move on any further.

What should i do... :(

My friends around me had been chatting and discussing about how they should go about looking for their significant other recently (we are all in our 3rd year of university and still evergreen). Truth is, i am not keen to get into a relationship but i was told by my mom that as a girl, i should not tell anyone, not even my friends that i am intending to stay single as society in general will judge me and think i am weird. Her reason for this were the following

1) people will suspect that i am not straight
2) people will think something is wrong with me mentally, because it was believed that it's is only natural if you feel attracted to the opposite gender and if you have no feelings towards the opposite gender, then you are just weird in people's opinion.
3) worst if by thirties, if a woman is i still evergreen by then, some people might nickname such women "old hag"

Personally the reason i wish to stay single is because i am happy the way i am now and i  see no need to get into relationship. And i read too much stories about how badly a relationship can possibly fail (of course i know there are good ones too). I know that a relationship takes efforts to find and maintain i do not wish to divert my attention to any relationship as i simply wish to give my all to my career. Lastly i felt that if you have good friends who can spend time with you, you don't neccessarily need to get married to be happy.

I am very disappointed with my mom's opinion that a guy can easily tell people he wish to stay single and not be judged, because society believes that a guy no matter how old, can always get married later on as long as he have the money. But for a girl, if you state your intention  to stay single, people judge because a girl have only until her thirties which is the optimal time for her to find a soulmate. Thus if you not "kan cheong" now, then you are weird to not like the opposite gender at this age (21).

Please i wish to hear opinion from you all on why my mom believe all these may happen to a woman, even at such modern times. Is there any truth to what my mom said, like my friends will judge me the moment i say i wish to stay single? And is it true some people in society call women who are still single in their thirties an "old hag"? is it true in general society judge a woman for intending to stay single and not a man? I think it's better to hear from you all the younger generation rather than my mom who's from the older generation...

To  + personal rant

This is probably a little late since your post was like a month ago. But I just want to say that I have an eating disorder too, and I get how you feel. I'm in recovery now and there are days I wake up appalled at just how huge I have gotten. My mind is constantly overwhelmed with food. It ruined me socially too because now I just feel a little awkward around people. No one can ever understand this disorder.

I'm ugly and shy and not good with people. I don't have a boyfriend and I don't think anyone will ever be attracted to a person like me. :( I see all my friends getting attached and finding someone to love them and I really really wish for someone to like and accept my insecurities. But at the same time I feel so undeserving because I am so... flawed.

Anyway, I just wanted you to not give up on life. Let's fight together. Getting up everyday may be hard, but going down willingly is foolish. 

P.SWish we could be friends in real life too because we prolly get each other better.

Is it a good idea to pretend that you already have a boyfriend in order to reject someone? I am quite annoyed by this guy who wants to meet up but I don't want to be mean. Moreover, he hasn't really confessed yet, he just flirted a lot. And he doesn't get my subtle hints that I'm not interested.
-
 
I don't get why some girls expect the guy to be paying for their meals? Me and boyfriend have always gone dutch ever since we started dating 3 years ago. Of course we will treat each other on our monthsaries or anniversaries or just out of the blue. Even though right now I'm working full time and boyfriend is a uni student, I still don't expect him to pay just because he's a guy. And he doesn't expect me to pay just because I have monthly income compared to him. And of course we don't eat expensive eating places or restaurants (subway or fast food is fine with us). If both parties do not have these kind of expectations on each other then going out for meals together won't be such a problem.

I have a friend who chased a girl who was attached, got rejected and is now really angry that she isn't talking to him. what advice can i give to him please?

is it possible for a girl who got friendzoned to get the guy to like her eventually?? is it really time to move on? :(

What do you do for a friend who has the biggest ego in the world?

It's normal to have that jock in a group of friends, or a braniac that seems to know everything, or even someone who's really proud of all their achievements in life so far. 

Here, I've got a friend who has let his ego get to his head. Any attempt to reproach him will only cause him to shut you off as a 'bad' friend. People can only be with him or get lost. 

How do I help such a friend turn around? I would want to think my years of friendship with them should allow me to get to him more easily, but I've seen even childhood friends get abandoned...
-
 
I have been together with my boyfriend for around 2 and a half years.  He has been broaching the topic of applying for for a flat,  and I can tell he is really eager.  However,  on my end,  I am still filled with uncertainty.  As a result,  I have been giving all sorts of excuses such as that we are still too young,  we do not have the finances,  he hasn't proposed, our careers aren't stable yet etc. 

What I'm worried about though is the fact that I know that those reasons I give are not the real reasons.   I am not sure why I feel this way,  but after this period of time,  I still completely don't feel ready to decide on having him for the rest of my life.  Don't get me wrong,  I am serious when I enter into a relationship but to commit to enter the next level is a whole different story. 

Now I am worried -  does this mean I don't love him enough?  If you really love someone,  won't you be eager to spend the rest of your life with that person?

To the OP of 

I came from a family where my mum had mental issues due to my dad's infidelity and there was a lot of physical/emotional violence too. All my life I didn't want to get into a relationship because I was sure there's no such thing as a happy relationship. In the end though I ended up getting attached to someone really quickly after meeting - before telling my partner about the family issues. It only came out slowly over the course of our relationship and it really wasn't easy. In my personal experience at least, I really found my worst fears coming true, that I wasn't able to be "normal" and love my partner as well as I wanted to. My pessimism and own emotional baggage were like a dark cloud hanging over the relationship and I spent lots of time crying on my own over how hopeless and angry I felt, especially since my partner didn't seem to understand why I feel/act/think a certain way. But like in any relationship, communication and compromise is important, and I think if you are both honest about what you want and why, it can only make your relationship stronger. What helped also was that I went to see a counselor (and still see one at least twice a month) - one of the things she said to me was to stop beating myself up for not being "normal". There's really no such thing as "normal" and regardless of the childhood we had, there are people everywhere on the spectrum from manipulative to naive to distant to loving etc. So don't compare yourself to the "normal" people/relationships out there. What matters is between you and your (potential) partner and as long as they are accepting and compatible with you, give it a shot :) 

I guess what I wanted to say is it's really not easy, and while you don't have to force yourself to tell someone about your past immediately, it helps them to understand you and having someone who is willing to make that effort can make the relationship worthwhile :) Sometimes you just have to take the plunge and commit - although I tried to back out of my relationship and I still think about breaking up whenever I can't handle anything, I also remind myself that I don't want the shadow of my parent's relationship to be hanging over my life forever. We all deserve happiness, and you never know who could make you happier than you imagined you could be until you give them that chance. Please don't give up hope!

To OP of . Hi there, I'm kind of the same as you - big inertia to get into a relationship (but at least you have someone interested in you). I'm a guy, average-looking, okay income, drives an average car, had average grades when I was in NUS. I'm also happy with my life right now and I spent a lot of time on my hobbies, doing things alone after work and I thoroughly enjoy this serenity of alone time. My friends tried introducing me their girl friends and I was just so reluctant to meet them not because I'm shy or socially awkward but it's because of this "inertia". So they gave up introducing me girls. Worst part is that the industry I'm working in.. Has little or no girls at all. Truth be told, although there's this big inertia in my mind, deep in my heart, I kind of yearn for someone to be by my side. So what I wanna tell you is..  Give him a try since you're genuine about it. You really wouldn't know if it will end up like before. Uni is the best time to get to know your SO. Don't end up like me lol.

@op if you really had to turn a guy down due to legit reasons but you're actually interested, make plans to reschedule don't just say you're not free. same goes for guys when girls jio them out. if you don't offer alternative when first asked and just reject, any normal person would assume not interested??
-
 
Hi! I have a question for guys (girls, if you think you have the answer, pleae share with me!) The thing is, I am looking forward to a very serious relationship,not one that ultimately leads to marriage, but one that lasts longer than a couple of months and ends with me feeling regretful having been so rash. That's why I always feel unconfortable flirting with guys. I mean, in social events or when I run into guys I know on campus, I would say  just enough. My friend who is a natural charmer will get into talking deep things with guys she just meets, which, if I were her, would feel embarrassed ever mentioning. But my cousin says it's the way girls flirt and I just cannot cope with it. If I am swept away by the moment and talk too much or smile too much, i will feel weirdly guilty for being so unlike me. Guys who I am interested in asked me out once or twice, but I had to decline for legit reasons. I am sooo socially awkward that I never dropped them the hint that I would be happy to join them the next times. They never asked me again. So help me, is it because I turned them down the wrong way that they never called back or is it because they never liked me enough? :(
-
 
I personally find guys from water based ccas to be pretty attractive. I know a number of guys from biathlon, lifeguard swimming and canoe polo and they all tend to be really nice people with slim and toned figures. Makes me want to join one of these CCAs but their trainings are so tough :'(
-
 
I am a girl who appears really 'guai' at first sight.  However,  as people always say,  never judge a book by its cover.  I've in fact had quite an illustrious past. I wouldn't say I have been a complete slut (in fact other than losing my virginity to this guy which I kinda regretted I didn't sleep with another other guy who is not my boyfriend).   However I did have some escapades here and there.   

I occasionally invited guys to my room to stay for the night and we did stuff but short of having sex.  Sounds mild enough but perhaps for someone who looks as guai as me it would be rather unexpected. 

These are all in the past and I had stopped since I met my current boyfriend.   However,  the problem is that I have to bring these secrets with me to my grave. My boyfriend has indicated that he can't stand girls who are easy and he wouldn't be able to take it if he finds out his girlfriend is such a person,  even if that was in the past. 

I really don't wish to lie, but I have no other option.  He will definitely leave me if he knows any of these. 

Guys,  I just want to know,  will you generally be able to accept a girlfriend who was kinda easy in the past?  It's kinda sad that one is not even given the chance to repent isn't it? 
-
 
So I am in a pretty big dilemma. There's this one girl that lives next door to me. I kinda like her but I think she Dosent really see me that way as she does not seem really keen to hang out and all and I don't think I am of the highest priority in her life. Unfortunately  I do have strong feelings for her and this is hurting me a lot to let go. 

At the same time this other girl that I've never met in my life and only online has started talking to me. She is even coming all the way to sg (she lives in Fiji) just to see me and spend days with me. Again may I stress we have never met and we only had online converstations. (But she is a legit person and not a 40 year old creepy guy or something.) somehow this tells me that she likes me for who I amand not just for what I have. I really don't want to lose her under any circumstances at all. 

So my question is how do I let go of the girl I still have somewhat lukewarm feelings for and move on? The most obvious smart thing to do is to get to know this girl comin all the way for me. Please please help me!! Thanks so much.

To , from 

You’ve misunderstood me. 

1) I’m not jealous of people who are in a relationship, I’m jealous of the people who have found love. Judging from the number of confessions about cheating, I think its safe to say that both do not always overlap.

I am also perfectly aware that I should be in a relationship because I like someone, not because I want to feel loved. Hence I’ve been single all my life. If I wanted a relationship in order to feel loved, I would have been in one long ago. I already feel loved even without someone to call a “significant other” – I think many of us forget that love need not be just romantic love. Love from your family, friends, and yourself should mean as much as romantic love. 

2) Do you not read – I’ve never been in a relationship. I did not “join” a relationship to escape some life problems. I don’t depend on someone to be my “pain killer”, I face life’s problems on my own, with the help of people I love. I have hurt someone badly before. It was unintentional on my part, but I can see the hurt I’ve caused him, and I’d do anything to fix the scars I’ve left behind. I guess karma is a bitch, because I got hurt by someone else in return, and I’m only all too familiar with the pain and the tears and the haunting words that just never seem to go away. 

3) I disagree, and still think that it is difficult to find someone you love. I don’t mean infatuation, or just the kind of “yea I like you coz you chio”. I mean the kind of love where you see – and I mean really see – the person for who he is, and love him despite his flaws. The kind of love where you will never think of doing something like cheating, because you just can’t imagine hurting this person. The kind of love where there’s respect, trust, compromise and teamwork.  This takes time to build, and there are a lot of other factors that come into play. Even though many people may be “the one”, it takes a lot to really build a healthy, loving relationship with someone, and I just don’t understand how people who already have that can so carelessly squander it away. 

He/she definitely isn’t the only one who posses these traits, but if you continue having that mindset while being attached, you will never be truly grateful and appreciative of the one who is in front of you. If you are not ready to settle down and want to keep fishing/ having fun, then don’t commit yourself to someone and hurt that person. Don’t be such a selfish asshole.

i think i'm suffering from borderline disorder because jealousy comes to me really strongly and I have no idea where to turn to because how do you tell a friend you're jealous they're hanging out with other new friends without coming across like you're entitled?

Reply to .

I'm 21, and I'm evergreen. I know it's not a nice feeling to have this void in your heart. Being involved in a one-sided love in Secondary school, I convinced myself to reset my priorities, focusing instead on my studies, hobbies, family and friends.

I know that void is still there, and I still feel it inside. But those years of neglect have totally changed my perspectives on Love. I'll avoid even conversation topics on Love, and would convince myself any eye-candy is attached/not interested. When others hesitate to take the first step, I'll just turn my back and walk away.

It's been 5 years, and I'm still learning to love myself. I implore you, please don't lose faith in love. These wounds as a result of not loving is deeper than those cuts you've sustained whilst trying.

I'm starting to wonder if any of my university friends are not merely friends borne from convenience.

I go to lessons with my usual clique every day, and we do tell jokes and make small talk here and there, but by and large my conversations with them are dominated by discussions on lesson topics. Or perhaps more accurately, by them asking me about lesson topics. There's been this growing, nagging feeling at the back of my mind that's become harder and harder to shake off, that maybe I'm more of an accessory to their academic endeavours than an actual friend. Perhaps it's because I've garnered somewhat of a "smart guy" reputation that I can't seem to shake off, but even in JC when all my friends knew that I was coping well academically things were not like this. Of course my JC friends still asked me about homework from time to time, but we could just as easily change topics to music, cartoons, games and pretty much everything under the sun. With my JC friends, it never felt like they approached me just to get tutorial answers. With my uni friends, I really cannot say the same.

Maybe I'm yearning for a simplicity and an innocence that's long gone. Or maybe this is just what happens when all your personality traits get overshadowed by a giant neon sign that says "THIS GUY IS GOOD AT EXAMS."

I miss this guy a lot as a friend but we don't talk anymore. Should I text him? Problem is he has a girlfriend and I'm wondering if it would be weird. 
-
 
I met this guy a few months ago and I thought we could be friends. But after having like two meals together, he started saying things that made me uncomfortable like 'I thought about you when I walked past your secondary school', etc. I wasn't sure if he was interested in me or he was just being overly friendly, but my replies for his messages got much shorter and colder, and sometimes I don't even reply at all. He suggested to hang out several times but I kept saying I was busy. Still, he texts me once in a while, with messages like 'how are you?' and I don't know what to reply. I'm not sure if he really merely treasures me as a friend (he actually confided in me about his problems before and said that he feels comfortable talking to me, so I thought maybe he just needs a friend?), or he is interested. If it is the former, I feel that it is unfair for him if I just end this friendship like this. If it is the latter, I don't want to lead him on as I have absolutely no intention of getting into a relationship with him. What should I do?

to OP of ,

I am the OP of . Sounds like you are doing something that my bf had done, even into the relationship. Just wanted to share my views as the gf that found out. It was distressing and disgusting to know that he is touched by several women who touch hundreds of other men. It is cheating, period. 

If you think that the sleazy massage is just a massage with a bonus and a hj is nothing, imagine this (I have argued about this with my bf and it broke him down). If it is just a hj and earns such quick money I can do it too. Why not, who doesnt want some extra allowance. I just need to use my hands only and he will get it for free, save his money and I earn mine, why not. But if you really treasure her and love her, you wont let her do that, would you. Because it is dirty and betraying herself and you for money. And thats what you had been doing, dirty and betraying her to satisfy your lust with money. Money can buy you the momentary pleasure but the pain that you brought to your love ones lasts forever.  

It may be hard to recover from your addiction but I hope you can stand firm to avoid it at all costs if you want to continue your rs. No women will allow this to happen and will definitely leave a scar that never heals. I still get upset whenever i think back. But i choose to trust him again because he give me his utmost promise to never go again. Would you do so as well for your gf or even future family?
-
 
It baffles me how some guys can accept the friendzone i.e. to stay as friends when their advances have been rejected. It is either romantic, professional (e.g. helpful at work/school), or nothing at all.
Isn't the friendzone a one-sided relationship? I'm not sure if they are overly optimistic, have too much time to waste, or are not confident enough to end it. Maybe someone can help me understand why...

How do you tell if a girl is interested in you? Say if she's overseas now with her group of friends, she would tell me when she is leaving and back at the hotel. Also, this morning she sent me a photo of her before she left the hotel. Am I dense or am I reading too much?

Hi all. I find myself liking this girl who happens to be in one of my classes this semester. I got to know her as we happened to be sitting beside each other. I find that when I am with her, there's always something to talk about. Somehow though, that doesn't seem to be the case on whatsapp, and the few time I texted her, she would take forever to reply, and the convo would eventually die. Initially, I thought that maybe she just wasn't really the type to reply fast on whatsapp, but then I noticed that she replies to her other friends' texts pretty quickly while in class. 

Also, she's not exactly very active on social media, but I saw a few tagged photos of her and another guy. It looks like they might be together, but because the guy has a lot of similar photos with other girls as well, I can't really be sure. My gut feeling tells me that she is though, and even if she isn't, she may not see me that way. Still, I guess I just want to confirm and move on if she is. The thing is, how should I go about it? People always say to ask subtly, for example, "oh so do you bake for your bf", but to me, it feels really obvious/awkward to me?

Advice anyone?

Hi, this is the OP of .
I heard from my colleagues that today this friend of mine came to the building where I am working. He went one floor above my workplace to borrow somethings. In the past, he will then drop by to say hi.
However, he did not do it this time. He has been telling my colleagues that he is worried about me etc. But if this is the case, since we have not met for 6 months, he would have came to say hi (since just one floor below). His gestures are in contradiction to what he tells others.
I suddenly feel that he is such a hypocrite. Hearing this news today, I was reminded of the painful memories of the past of this friendship. I was upset and disappointed but at the same time glad that I made the decision to distance myself and move away.
Very conflicted, confused and hurt :(

Last night, the lights were dim and we got into the mood for kissing. One thing led to another and I was really excited of the prospect of bringing our relationship to the next level after 3 months and 7 days of dating. However everything changed after my boy removed his pants. I found it hard to contain my disappointment and gave an excuse that I am not ready for intercourse yet. In case you are wondering, I am a petite girl and I am afraid that his sexual organ would really pose an obstacle to the progress of our relationship. Readers, please offer advice on how I could solve our problem. I am definitely sure he wouldn't opt for a penis reduction. :(

Both my boyfriend and I are in our third year of medical school. We have been together since the first year. Just a couple of days ago, he broke up with me saying that he can't get past my weight and called me fat. I found out that he was trying to chase this model girl on the side. My self esteem has been shattered and I don't know what to think. I used to be confident in my own skin but I don't think I can be anymore. Why does it have to be because of my looks.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 1 year, 8 months and 27 days ( Sorry i'm an Engineer ). Recently during this reading week, she broke down like she never before and confessed that she went for an abortion. During the May semester break, I was on reservist overseas for a month and she went clubbing. From what she told me, the guy offered to use protection, but she didn't want to as it felt better doing it "raw".

One thing led to another and she was pregnant with someone else's child which led to her going to a private clinic for an abortion. But ever since then, she said she has issues coping with the trauma of going thru the procedure and has guilt related issues due to the taking of an unborn life.

Where do I go from here ? I understand that it is my duty to care as a boyfriend, but I too am in shock over her actions ( not the abortion, the clubbing one ). Seeking some advice from the community. Many thanks in advance
-
 
There's this guy who kind of confessed to me but I did not respond in time. He probably knows that I like him too. But it has been so long already and nothing is happening between us because he is too embarrassed to mention that day again and I don't know how to bring it up. I feel that it is my fault for not responding but his message wasn't that straightforward to begin with and I'm afraid that I have misinterpreted it. 
Any idea on how to get out of this situation?

We met a little more than three years ago - young, clueless and a little too excited to fall in love. We got together anyways, in less than a span of a month. You used to tell me that time shouldn't be a unit of measurement when it comes to love, and that we will be okay.

Our love was on an accelerated programme. We plunged so deeply in love we forgot to pace ourselves. We became reliant, we forgot what it was like to be independent. We always had each other, and that was enough.

But life continued to happen around the bubble we confined ourselves in. School demanded our attention, our friends and family wanted a piece of us, yet we prioritised each other above any other things in life. We meant the world to each other. We relied on each other. Eventually we became responsible for each others rights and wrongs. 

Exhaustion kicked in. We chose to take the shortcut - to blame each other on life's misfortunes and unfairness because it was convenient. All of a sudden I wasn't good enough for you. I became a burden. 

We tried really hard to fill up the cracks that were splitting not just us, but our hearts apart. One step forward, two steps back. We kept going back to the same problems, to our old ways. We exhausted all means to help each other. We fought about anything under the sun. And none of them make sense at this point. But we never truly got over any of them.

The good times used to compensate for the downs. But at this point I am beyond exhausted. I had never once given up, but held on when an old problem arise. But I now question if it's still worthwhile.

there's this guy who I've known for just over 6 months now. he's the sweetest bad boy I've ever met. he does everything I would want my boyfriend to do: takes care of me when I'm high/drunk, pays for meals, little gentlemanly acts like opening doors, allowing me to hide my face in his shoulder when watching horror movies, always ensures he sends me home after we are out late etc. but he's made it 101% clear he's not interested in me romantically or will ever be. I was initially not attracted to him at all but in recent months I think I've started to fall for him. how do I start to see him as nothing more than a bro again? ): he has had a past reputation for being a player/heartbreaker so I know there is no future for us even if he were remotely interested in me (he is 200% not btw). I want to distance myself from him for a while so that I can sort out my feelings for him but I really enjoy spending time with him. what should I do??? ):

I find laughing truthfully so difficult nowadays!! Like firstly, im not easily amused. Secondly, i laugh at people's jokes so that they feel better.

Hi, guys, did you all have any experience of gals who shows sexual interest on you? I am not sure whether I am correct about that. I have rejected those gals who have boyfriends seducing me no matter how persistent are they as I have high moral values. However, I find myself having sexual needs and I have never initiated sex with those intended to have, how shall I go about doing it since I have 0 affair now and I am evergreen because I tend to reject most gals because I only hope to reserve my best with the most compatible person. After seeing the open culture in NUS, I am wondering shall I still be a man with integrity and despite my sexual needs since no gal would care about this, I felt like I am a dump. Can anyone introduce or guide me to have FWB relationships?

It's been almost 5 months since we broke up. It felt so surreal when I finally gathered up the courage to tell you that I can't tolerate your bullshit anymore. Life felt so much lighter since then, I felt FREE. 

The first time I felt a missing gap in my life, was during my holiday in Europe a month after the break up. We had so much plans together - to travel the world, to climb mountains, to dive, to kitesurf etc. The subsequent 2 months passed by rather easily because I did not have the time to think of you, with all the camps that I was involved in. My social life was at its peak. I had outings every other day and more importantly, I was actually having fun without you. I thought that was it, that I was officially over you.

Fast forward to today, I still think about you occasionally and I'd feel strangely wistful. I'm not too sure if those feelings were an indication of remnants of my feelings towards you or that it's natural to feel so sad while thinking about an ex. 

I'm not sure why I chose to write this. Guess I just wanted to let off some steam.. while procrastinating.

I met this guy at the club. He initiated conversation with me on the dance floor and we were just trying to talk to each other over the music. I liked how we focused on the conversation despite being at the club, where many of the other guys just came up to girls all touchy-feely or with the intention to grind them. He asked for the number at the end of it and we have been texting since. I am afraid of falling for him as I have good feelings towards him at the moment and I think he may ask me out soon. All my friends are telling me how guys at clubs are not looking for relationships, and for a guy to ask for a girl's number at a club is a playboy move or something like that. Should I cut contact with him to prevent this from becoming something that will let me get hurt? Because meeting a guy at a club is just... unconventional? :(

I'm almost getting engaged. It isn't official, there isn't any rings though we have looked at some and he hasn't formally asked for my hand in marriage yet. We plan to do so after i've graduated (year 4 now. woot, last year!).

But i think i'm starting to develop feelings for another guy. I feel terribly guilty. Ive been trying to avoid this other guy but we have mutual friends and a few mutual whatsapp groups too. 

And idk if im being paranoid or overthinking things but i think this other guy might feel the same way. 

Crapppp. 

Am I horrrible??? :( :( :(

For now though imma keep trying to stay away from this other guy because i really think my almost fiance is The One. 

HAIZ.

This person has already clearly said to my friend that she will treat her as the second priority but my friend still hold onto the hope of them being best friends again. And it is not helping that this person's parents has asked my friend to continue the friendship...

Hello NUSWhispers community, I didn't really want to post this since the incident happened too long ago, but I fucked up. 2 years ago, my best friend of 10 years approached me for relationship advice. He had suffered from multiple rejections from girls, whereas I was the type who was in the position to reject girls. Naturally, I tried my best to advise him. In short, I told him to grow some balls and go after the girl he wants instead of stalking them everyday online. 

However, that was where I fucked up. Little did I know, that the advice I gave him, led him to harass them in real life. I immediately regret my decision. However, as his best friend, I stood by him and walked him through the entire disciplinary process. 

Fast forward, he is now a wreck, but he's slowly recovering. He has now graduated, and is having difficulties entering into a relationship. 

Did I do the right thing? Should I not have egged him on? I feel bad...

TLDR: Told best friend to grow some balls, friend got rekt.

I have to get this off my chest.

in year 1, i met this awesome OG in hall. they were really great people and i was glad that they were my first group of friends in hall. one of them was my roomie, and long story cut short our personalities clashed and we both made each other pissed. along the way i got attached, and spent most of my time with my bf, while she hung out with the rest of the OG. the distance between me and my OG grew, and one day my OG wanted to plan an overseas trip together. of course i wanted to go, but then they told me that my roomie was awkward with me, hence it was either i went or she went, and they wanted her to go, so i couldnt go. i was devastated, but accepted it. a while later i broke up with my bf and found out he cheated. and right after this news came another news that my OG wanted to plan another trip, and one of them notified me that they were going, not me. i was not allowed to go. at that time i was really devastated, because i just lost the people that meant the most to me in hall. i decided to leave the og chat without saying a word because i felt so suffocated and restricted. it really affected me. i cried every night and couldnt sleep with the lights off. even with the lights on i only fell asleep from exhaustion from crying. it was near exam period and my grades plummeted because i couldnt concentrate. i even cried because i was afraid that i was going into depression. the only reason that i didnt was because of my ever supportive sister. 

fast forward nearly a year later, i am still recovering, but i am writing this to my (ex)OG to explain why i left. i felt that i was being controlled; i was in the OG but couldnt hang out with yall, its like not being in the OG. i also didnt want yall to feel bad every time yall have to decide between siding her or me, because its difficult. but even though i left the chat doesnt mean i want to cut off all ties with all of you. i still would like yall to talk to me as a friend, just not as an OG. we are all in the same activity in hall, so i hope whenever we meet yall will not ignore me. and im really glad that one of them, W, is still such a damn nice ogl and continues to talk to me whenever we see each other. i hope this continues even when the (ex)roomie comes back from SEP. i have already forgiven her, even though she hasnt forgiven me, but it doesnt matter anymore. shes got attached to a guy in the same OG, and although i still think hes too good for her, i would still like to congratulate yall. last long! A, you're a great guy, and your skills in the sport has really improved. take good care of your gf! W, you're the kindest ogl i know, and words cant say how grateful i am. C, i dont see you around much in hall, but thanks for not ignoring me :) since im no longer in the OG i dont keep up with what yall are doing, but i hope everything is well with yall. 

this is like a closure for me, i hope admin can post this, because i dont know what other avenue to use.

I'm a girl in a male dominated school. Not bad looking and pretty likeable. 

But I have been single for a few years now. I don't even have a guy I flirt with! What's wrong with me?

Reply to  
1.  I will dress up nicely if I know I will see this guy on that day
2. I can't stop smiling whenever I look at him
3. I try to sit nearer to him in lecture, or at least somewhere I can see him
4. I asked him a lot questions about himself, because I want to know him more.
5. I hope he can msg me, with whatever reasons, just msg me.

These are still not obvious because I'm still too shy to make it so obvious. But I think you have someone in mind when you asked this question, because you may wish that girl may have dropped you some hints. There are still shy girls like me, so if you really like her, please show her some hints also? or at least, msg her, with whatever reasons, just msg her.

I am a girl who has recently started to get intimate with my boyfriend. He is sexually experienced while I am not so. The first time we did it, it felt pleasurable but for some reason I could not cum. Eventually he had to resort to other ways to make me cum. From past experience, I can hardly attain orgasm from penetration alone. This always frustrates both parties because we can't enjoy sex together. I don't think it is a problem of size cos he is relatively built, nor the technique (we probably tried every technique in the book). Would appreciate some genuine advice on how to overcome this problem:/

To all people discontented with their friendships, let me share with you mine.
There were 4 of us. 
1 is a gambling addict and is always complaining why his girlfriend doesn't give him sex or perform any sexual acts with him. On his birthday, she secretly invited all of us for a surprise party and even worked part-time to buy him a ps4. And she's an awesome cook. (I miss her food) Then he dumped her because she wasn't willing to have sex with him. 

Another one is a vulgar ass who treats his girlfriend like shit. "Aiyo... i saw every part of your body already, what's left to hide?" 
"I'm just gonna take my time and enjoy every part of your body in my room later." Right in front of us (clique). I feel embarrassed enough already, can't imagine how did his girlfriend felt. She is a very humble and hardworking person as circumstances dictate, she met this jerk at her part-time job and is very impressionable. During the last few weeks of our friendship, he shared with me that he's planning to cheat on her by wooing another lady, tossing his gf away like a piece of trash.

The last one is a controlling whiny self-entitled bitch who wants every gatherings, meals, orders to go her way. And she disrespect every other opinions and is always condescending towards others.

I'm glad I am done with these toxic people. I don't even like them that much. At the same time, they should be happy that I did all of them a favour; they got rid of one nonchalant acquaintance who seriously doesn't care about them any longer.

With nuswhispers so entertaining, it looks like I really do not need any close friends in uni. To be honest, I feel like I am spending more time scrolling through nuswhispers than talking to the people around me.

I hope you are my ex and even if you aren't, it is good that you finally understood everything that had transpired and the good times you had . Life will be full of regrets. Try texting him even if he said he blocked you, you may be in for a surprise.

:) Cheers

In light of the many love related posts, I shall break the trend and post a friendship related post here hahas (I hope this will be posted.) I am not he very high or outgoing kind and have a smaller circle of friends whom I really treasure. 
Last week, one of my friends whom I see as my close friend returned from overseas. When I told him that he can always ask me out when he is free so that we can catch up more, he seems surprised and asked me why would I do that, as he is just a friend (I can't really remember what he said but it is along the line of him being shocked that I am actually willing to take time out to chat with him if he asked me to do so). I am really disappointed and sad as it seems that he doesn't see me as a close friend but a 'mere' friend. As a friend, of course I will meet him. Furthermore, when he returned overseas, he did not even tell me about it, and I have to learn about it from his social media platform. I really don't know if I should continue to value this friendship or not. We used to spend a lot of time in school together, but now, I am really suspicious of who or what is important to him. I may sound childish here, but there are a lot of 'hints' that show that I may be not as important to him, shall not reveal it here though, lest I reveal myself. 
As I read the love related posts here, I wonder, is friendship or love more fragile? How do you know when to stop treasuring someone as a close friend?

To  My boyfriend and I have sex all the time. We rarely make love. Sometimes it is the sex that is boring, sometimes it is the making love that is mundane. I don't think it's necessarily making love that's boring. Some days one of us is just off. But we make an effort to try new things all the time. And normally when we make love, it is because he is the one who suggests taking it slow. So I kind of agree that having sex is more fun.

Sometimes I really feel very fake. It's not that I purposely put up a front in front of everybody but I realized I behave differently around different people and at the end of the day, no matter who it is, I end up feeling very drain and tired, even with my family. 
Honestly speaking, when I sit down and question myself about my own personality and behaviors, I have no idea who I am. Being scared of conflicts I am very used putting on different "faces" to please those around me and now I can't even find my own "face". 
I don't dare to commit to anyone for fear that the person who is liked is just another "face" of mine. 

Is this just a phase, as this has been going on for several years already. Please tell me I am not the only one like this.

Never had a boyfriend. Didn't plan to have any in the near future. But recently I realised that a lot of my friends are actually attached. Seriously, we talk about studies all day until I would never guess that they have time to date someone. Heck, I don't even know the names of their boyfriend/girlfriend unless I stalk them on facebook. Now, I kinda wish I had a boyfriend, so that I can say something other else "oh, thats nice" when my friends talk about their other half.
-
 
I'm a tomboy and it's very obvious that I am one. Some of my acquaintances are asking me personal questions like if I am into girls or guys. I mean, I can say I am mostly into girls but I have not come out yet so I repeatedly answered that I like guys. 

However, I am getting closer to this girl and I think I'm falling for her. She's one of the one that knows that "I like guys". How do I approach this? I definitely don't wanna lose her as a friend but I don't know where she stand with having a lesbian friend? Or maybe her sexuality? Hahaha. 

I don't know man. 
Any advice for me?
-
 
Nah. You know what's loneliness? When your friends talk about plans that you're not invited to in front of you. 

When they all go "ok see you there" and don't jio. That's loneliness. That's how you can be alone in an ocean of people.  
-
 
I made a friend and fell for her, unaware that she is attached. Her boyfriend is in my faculty and she's occasionally here. Many times I take the longer route in my faculty just to avoid her. 

It doesn't help that without putting in effort, I tend to associate words, phrases, habits, idiosyncrasies, objects, tunes,  songs, videos and so on with the person(s) who introduced or made an impression of it on me. Now so many more things are associated with her.
-
 
It's so hard going to school sometimes. I don't know if it's a lack of confidence or what, but I just want to avoid seeing people from my previous schools/acquaintances. I know it's bad, but I tend to pretend not see them. I always feel awkward and would try to avoid taking the same route. I even missed a bus once simply cos I don't want to be on the same bus with them. This actually made school life tougher for me on top of all the assignments and stuff. 
How I wish I could open up a little more. But then again, being alone is so much better sometimes.

so i met this particular guy through a mod this sem. after some interaction with him, i realised he has a nice personality. also, i didn't think he was cute at first. but now i'm finding him quite cute heh, appearance- and actions-wise. and i feel this sense of curiosity, like i wanna get to know him more! i don't know if i actually might like this guy, or if i'm just having a crush ! does anyone out there have anything to say that'll help me achieve some clarity :D thanks

Today I chanced upon my ex at Utown who left me for his current girlfriend whom he met at an orientation camp. Suay, I was alone and awkward, just wanna hide and die. They were lovey dovey and all sighs

I am chatting with a girl and I have helped her incredibly in her assignments as her work is part of my hobby and passion.  She is getting an impression I m being too nice to her. I just want to be friends with her so that I have someone to talk to.

I am a foreigner and I spend a lot of my time in my room, barely talking to anyone with almost zero friends. Last sem, I also spent one whole week not talking to anyone, barely speaking few words at canteen to let the food stall uncle/aunty know what I want coz der was no one to talk to. Then I would also cook so that I can save money. Sometimes I get surprised when I listen to my own voice coz it makes me realize I am still alive. 

My question is, what will the girl think If I tell her that I don't have anyone to talk to with almost zero friends?
What would girls in general think of a boy who says like this?
Or am I speaking just to myself in a virtual room as well ?
-
 
Not sure if anyone would share the same situation as me. So far, I have yet to make any friends in my major and I am in year 2 now. I did not go for any orientation camps also. Sometimes I feel lonely when sitting alone for lectures and tutorials. So what should I do?
-
 
My JC friends have their uni friends. I am not that close to my uni friends. I feel lonely, yet I really love alone time. I did well in my studies up till JC. None of the courses seem to interest me. Struggling pretty badly now. Sometimes I really don't know what I am doing with my life.

Hi guys.. I recently travelled with a group of friends, including my boyfriend, and during the trip, many of my male friends were topless and I saw some of them had nice pecs. Surprising because they look a bit skinny. One of them had such nice pecs that it resembled breasts (I am a female bisexual BTW) and it looked so nice that I couldn't resist touching poking it. It was so firm, but soft at the same time. Like breasts but not really. I didn't do anything else because my boyfriend was around. Now sometimes I think about his pecs and imagine groping it. I don't think I'm sexually or romantically attracted to my friend, but his pecs were very fascinating. My boyfriend has a bit of pecs but not as firm and well-defined. I think I just miss touching boobs... :(

I would like to know some of the pickup lines you guys used or know.
A few that I heard of:
"Hello, I'm a thief, and I'm here to steal your heart."
"Do you have a band-aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you."
"On a scale of 1 to 10, you're a 9. I'm the 1 you need."
I find some of them quite lame. Anything cool or heart-fluttering?
I am a girl btw.

I was from Computing, so were my 2 ex-boyfriends. My first ex is some sort of controlling, and he sort of control who I make friends with within the faculty. Basically, for almost 4 years of my uni life, I only kept close contact with a few friends. When we broke up, things ended quite badly, because he got some friends to pursude me about the breakup, and I guess till date many people still have some questions regarding how we broke up (but that's fine, because it doesn't really affect my life right now). We didn't really keep in contact.

My 2nd ex were also from my close group of friends. We got together abruptly and broke up within a few months (he stated that he wasn't ready and sure) so of course I felt hurt. I was already ready to settle into a relationship only for him to tell me that. So for a few months I just hid and cut off contacts with that group of friends, suffering the pain in silence. It took me quite a while and some bit of courage to join back my same group of friends (relationship fail, but friendship stays right), and till date we are still friends. 

After my second breakup, I got closer to another group of friends, also from Computing, and I do join them regularly for dinner and meetups. About a year ago, I started developing this weird feelings about another guy in the same group. He is those introvert type (kinda) and besides seeing each other almost weekly for some common interest group, we barely have any common interest. The interesting thing is, this sort of attracted me, and in fact we still talk quite a fair bit on random things, face to face, not yet on messaging terms. When my friends tried to matchmake us, he doesn't really detest the idea (as oppose to other girls) but I think I am not the type of girl he likes (actually I am quite unsure) and I ever thought of confessing but I also quite treasure the friendship we have between us, and I don't wish that it will turn out like the first two relationships. One side of me wants to work hard to this relationship, and the other side of me wants it status quo. Everyday, I pray for an answer to this problem but I am still unsure. ( I do consider how I felt with other guys before I feel that he is the type of guy I am looking for)

Prof Ben Leong lonely hearts club have any suggestions to this?

I am writing about a friend, who I used to be very close to. We are still friends, just that now we are busier, so we talk less often. 

The other afternoon, I accidentally confessed that I had a huge crush on him back when we were in JC. Our conversation later changed topic and I didn't really want to explain why I became distant from back then even though I thought he might like me. Actually the truth is that I wanted to apologise to him but I had no guts to do so. Back then, I was scared because we have different religious beliefs. (We still do actually.) I was scared it would be a problem. But he told me he used to have a crush on me too. I realised it wasn't really fair to him, that I never gave him a chance to respond to my worries, and decided for him instead. But I wasn't even honest with myself back then, not enough to admit that I was the one who had an issue with it.

I guess this is the only way I am able to apologise right now. Sorry, friend. On the bright side, you deserve better than a coward like me anyway.

I have this female friend whom i knew for near 4 years since the start of university. All these while, we have treated other as close as siblings where we regularly call each other bro and sis. However, i've seem to fall for her recently where i found myself feeling upset over some of her actions or seem to show her more concern than what friends would. I am in a state of dilemma as i dont know what to do. Should i let her know that i've developed feelings for her but yet, risk our friendship or should i just bury the feelings deep within me and let it die off?... 

Advice please.
-
 
I think I'm screwed up. I'm Bi, and currently the ratio of my ex is 4:5; 4 for girls and 5 for guys. How I date is usually to even out this ratio to 1:1. 
So I have been trying to get close to this girl from my faculty, low and behold, I think I have fallen too deep and I think she would be my last one. However I'm quite scared that she won't accept me for who I've been. What should I do?

I have been talking to a guy for 3 mths but we didn't meet before. Now it is too late because some things happened and the first thing he thought if is to burn the bridge. :( I haven't even meet him yet and he is so cute. :(:(:( Oh, and he was from computing before. Prof Ben, how arh?

Is it okay to masturbate while fantasizing to acquaintances or your partner's friends while in a relationship? Purely lust and thinking of them sexually.

Hi guys please help. I need some serious advice on this.

I'm a year 3 student and my JC guy friends have finally joined me in uni (as freshies). These are friends I treasured a lot but ever since their army days, we started drifting apart (while the guys got closer to each other of course) and we tried to sustain our friendship by meeting up over meals every 2 to 3 months. I thought the tradition would continue when they came into uni but they don't bother communicating with me any longer. On top of that, the only time they communicate to me is to express how 'busy' they are. 

I tried reasoning with them how every individual has their own activities and being busy is a part and parcel of life (and even offering some help) but they threw comments back like 'You will never understand how we feel. We have so much of projects and we can barely breathe.' This statement felt quite like an insult; I'm pretty sure that a year 3 would be able to understand how heavy the workload in university and I felt that the statement was quite unfair to me. The problem now is that I don't even have the urge to ask them out or sustain this friendship any longer especially since the countless rejections I've faced when asking them out over a meal. Should I forsake this friendship?

Thanks in advance for any advices.

The 'uh oh' moment when a dude you haven't met in a long time suddenly talks to you, how my heart flutters.

 Oh, he's an insurance agent now...
-
 
 I know exactly how you feel, coming from the perspective of a girl whose boyfriend has had a couple of exes, and some friends with benefits also. It's horrible, and sometimes it's hard to enjoy sex and put away my own insecurities and worries. I guess try and talk about it with your gf? The feelings won't go away for sure but they'll slowly fade (: All the best!!
-
 
To . I'm a female. Umm I usually would assume it as just "hanging out" and not a date unless it was explicitly said. I mean, even if I'm interested in him, I don't really want to assume and think that he is interested in me too. It feels a little presumptuous? And good conversation/1-on-1 dinners happen between friends too. 

Regarding paying for the meal, I might just think the other person is in a good mood/just got paid and thus treating me. I think to remove any confusion, it is best to simply say it. Mikhail's way of "okay it's a date" is a pretty good way of smoothening any awkwardness in trying to transit from "hanging out" to date. You can consider it I guess. 

Umm, I personally think a verbal validation of bf/gf is important. Not so much as a "I need it", but to allow both parties an opportunity to talk about it. I think when people go into a relationship with different expectations (like do I have to contact u everyday, how often shd we go on dates, ways of showing love, etc), misunderstandings/conflicts happen pretty easily. So yea, hope a female's pov will be helpful.

I have recently got into a relationship with a girl. She's my first girlfriend, while I'm her 2nd. Can't help but to feel what this guy posted on another site.

"How much you second guess yourself.
I was 25 when I started my first real romantic relationship, and yes, I was a virgin up until that point. My then SO was much more experienced than I. It surprised me how much it bothered me. It wasn't even a logical thing. Even when you know the person loves you, accepts you, and finds you attractive and awesome you second guess yourself and compare yourself to the people they've been with."

Any way to curb such feelings? 

-
 
Is it just me, or are guys in uni really generally less "serious" than girls. "Less serious" meaning like joking around a lot more, poking fun at each other, and just talking a lot of nonsense when they are together. I mean, it's fun when I hang out with them but sometimes I don't really know how to join in their conversations as i am quite "serious" in nature and i'm also an introvert. It seems like I also put a lot more effort in schoolwork than them too.  Are guys hardworking too but just don't like to show it? Will they think girls like me are boring or is it normal for girls to be like that? (or will they not think anything..?)

Clueless engineering girl
-
 
To . I know how it feels. It doesn't feel good being alone. And not being able to have a conversation with others that last for at least 5 minutes. But at least you are sitting with your friends in lecture right? At least they still sit with you when they see you right? Well..mine don't. We say hi. But we don't interact. I think they see me as a weird person. I went to camps and knew them there. But somehow they clicked but I didn't. 

So you should count yourself lucky. At least there is someone who is there to make you less awkward. For me, haha. I'm used to being alone. 
-
 
To OP don't worry, take small steps each day, you will get better in your socializing skills. Please don't overdo it, you will lose you true self.

As time passes, people will change, your personality, behavior will also change with time. When I was young, I used to be very good at socializing, I know everyone from my cohort, even my siblings' close friends, with friends I even got punished for being a chatterbox. But when I was in secondary school, I only speak to people whom I am closed to. 

OP, practise texting your girl friends is a good idea but before you start doing that do sufficient research to make sure that you are not talking too much to an attached girl. If you want to practice face to face, here's some conversation topics: daily activities, hobbies, weather? , school work, news, gossips? :p if you are close to the other party you can ask about their family, their future, etc. 

Hope it helps!

i'm just an average looking girl. i'm generally cool with the way i look, but sometimes i can't help but envy those good looking girls yknow? cuz they look so effortlessly pretty and have good bodies and all heh. and they're the ones that the opposite sex would usually notice first. face it, everybody craves a little attention from the opposite sex. but oh well (: i guess its best to not compare yourself with other ppl, but just be happy with who u are, and keep on shining and ppl will naturally gravitate towards u (:

Escort from yesterday, to answer questions. No, sex doesn't have to be involved, sometimes clients are just lonely and want to take a girl out for a dinner date. You can turn down any client that you don't like because sex must be consensual. As for STDs and such, I get a full test every few months to be safe. I try to be as safe as possible within this line of work but I do realise the risks and if I really get anything, it will be my own fault. Also, this is just a stint, not a career. I do plan to quit when I've saved up enough. 
For people saying that I'm throwing away my morals, that is fine. Morals are relative. Everyone has a different opinion on moral values, and I will tell any future partners of mine about this. If they can't accept me for it, they are not right for me then.

yeah. so far like all my confessions have been posted, except like only one.

Don't see what those "STOP FILTERING POSTS" buggers are bitchen' about.

To    HI here's another fellow 1.73m girl!! I am also single. Evergreen actually. sucks when everyone tells you that you are model material but you're just actually rotting at home reading NUSWhispers. 
-
 
I hate that i am so sensitive. I can actually feel when someone is just uninterested in carrying on the conversation. It doesn't really matter if that someone is a normal friend. It really hurts when that someone is your best friend or SO. Feeling utterly dejected these days due to studies and i just feel like there is no one to talk to :(
-
 
I spent 3 semesters knowing this girl. Well we were from the same society in NUS. Naturally our interaction was frequent. Yesterday evening, I confessed to her. She was surprised, but told me that she had feelings for me too. However she said she would have to reject me as she wants someone who is academically superior to her. Her rationale was that someone who is academically superior would get a good job, thereby giving her the security that she or rather girls sought after.

I can't even... where do I go from here ?

Prof: Everything is on Wikipedia. I just tell you what to type. 
Thanks ah, but I think a 12 year old kid can tell me that without having to pay 7k a year

tell me, what kind of guy would break up with his gf on her birthday?
-
 
I secretly liked you quite a bit but I never told you. I don't feel any affection from your end, and sometimes you don't seem to care about me at all. I'm very scared that you know how I feel and that's why you're putting distance. And now I'm scared you know how I feel so I'm putting distance. It's all rather silly. 

Anyway you said you're not ready for a relationship and you're enjoying being single (is that a subtle hint that you're not interested in me?) Anyway, I being the evergreen I am, am kinda scared by the idea of a relationship since I feel like I can't match up to your ex and your experiences.  

Oh well. I'm just going to kill these feelings and hope we can even stay as friends.

Why do attached guys and girls always have to bring their partners along for every outing with their own groups of friends? Undeniably, it's good to introduce your so to your friends. But please people, if you already know it is a group outing, do not bring your so along. There's a time and place for everything and leave your dates to the one on ones. Do not even bother asking for "permission" because honestly, no one is as thick skin as you to tell you for fear of ruining the friendship, but it doesn't mean they like your self-initiative to bring your so along for every single group outing. So please, unless you want to appear like an insensitive douche, do not ask buay zi dong questions. 

Stop trying to make your so a part of the group because relationships can never be forced. They will just find this annoying and see your so as being overly sticky which defeats your initial intentions.

My friend told me that when you go for SEP with the opposite gender and if parties on both sides are single, there would be lots of stuff that could happen. Is that true? Anyone has experiences/stories to share?

I'm a slightly unfit freshie in Utown and I'm really interested in learning how to dance. I'm just worried that I'm not physically fit enough to handle it, and everytime I think about gymming, I feel really intimidated by all the buff Team NUS guys. Anybody care to give advice?

This is my first post here and I am not sure whether there will be a second one.

My result is unexpectedly good. Did 2 internships in big companies. Had leadership positions in 3 different CCA. Currently doing FYP with Prof really happy about my project proposal. Part timing in relatively big firm also. (Yaah, for those who like to bash OP who boost this kind of stuff, please by all means bash/bully/comment this post, gladly accept it)
I have some people that I can call friends. Some people even thought that I am their close friends. They share their secrets saying that I am good listener (I'm INFP btw), and never share it with others. They trust me they said. And I never betray their trust.
The only thing is, good listener is not always a good speaker. I will never ever share my story with them.

I still don't know why I want share it here but just want to rant I think

Day: Dad kisses my cheek saying "Have fun in school!" Mom makes me breakfast & sometimes pack my lunch (Don't judge me, I still bring lunch to school okay, mom's cooking is the best!) 

Night: Dad takes out his belt, while saying " I told you not to hang out with XXX/YYY/ZZZ! Make u not focusing on study! Delay ur graduation also! Faster work!" Mom just watches me while drinking her favorite beer. Or sometimes sleeping pills. (Lucky no gambling problems)
Red/blue black, pain, scars everywhere. Lucky they're hidden under my clothes. :)

Probably if I tell my close friend about my story they will just say "You are 24 years old boy leh! Fight back! Report to police! or MSF!"
It's not that easy u know, I love them. but I hate them. And I really hate hating them. But I can't help it. I love and hate them.

Lucky I don't have any siblings. If not I can't imagine them going thru same experience.

Seems my family is the best representative of family in drama/manga/ series . Happy family outside, inside.... oh well.

I used to think that it's normal to have this kind of family. It was only when I was in JC then I realized that my family is an odd one, different from other families. 

I really don't know why I'm sharing this now and in this platform. Just bored and tired I guess... Too tired to run, but still want to run from this reality. 

Yaah, probably my story might not be believable to some people. Too harsh to be true I guess, but I leave it to you all to decide.

Sorry for the long post!
Don't have a potato, coz my father just threw few some at me for coming home quite late and miss dinner  :/

I don't know who to talk to about my break up because all my friends seem to have bigger problems in their lives or are having so much fun with their SO and other new friends. I feel like a freaking burden.
-
 
Don't we all have this friend who scores really well but always claims that he/she is terrible, will fall on the left side of the bell curve, will help you because he/she will confirm score super low?

I have such a friend and I am so conflicted. On one hand, he is great as a friend. On the other hand, I cannot stand it when he keeps claiming he sucks. I cannot do the tutorials while he does them easily even though he proclaimed that the tutorial is "super hard this time". He claims he failed his exams but scores A+ and A while I score B... then when I tell him that I score really low, he claims he is "lucky". Wow, in that case, can I have some of that "luck"?

To OP of ,

People are going to judge, and yes I agree that we'll all be affected by judgements somehow. But it's up to you whether you think that he is worth it. If he is, why give up the opportunity of what could be a lifelong relationship? I have 2 cousins who met their partners in a club, and I would most certainly say that my extended family judged them for that. (Behind their backs of course) They said that the relationships wouldn't last a year. Fast forward 4 years, one couple is still happily together, and another couple just got married this year. If you think he's worth it, go for it. You never know.
-
 
I got many guys hitting on me and flirting with me, but none of them are the genuine kind of guys, and they can be quite superficial (I guess I'm above average in terms of appearance). C'mon, I'm ready for a relationship! I don't want anymore attention, I just want a nice guy who likes me not for my looks, but for my personality. And no, I'm not desperate, just feel let down by the guys I'm attracting.
-
 
So many relationship posts, I figured I could try and give some advice from experience. 
I used to have a crush on a guy in my class back in high school, after three months of secretly liking him I couldn't stand it anymore and straight out confessed. He didn't like me, but being a gr8 guy he was still willing to continue being my friend, even with my stubborn feelings for him.

 So, 1) if you really wanna burst with your feelings for someone, tell them. Pent up feelings are never fun. Even if things get awkward after a while,  try to keep up a (non-despo)  conversation, sooner or later the awkwardness will disappear. 

Don't even talk about being in the friend zone. Hell, you should be glad that you're still friends, if you truly "care about the friendship" rather than trying to get into their pants. If you even start to think about that, take a step back and question your motives about starting a friendship in the first place

Fast forward 2 years of unrequited crush that WONT GO AWAY he started to like me too, and we carefully ventured out into a relationship with each other. 

2)a relationship means being independent together. Learn how to be alone without constantly spamming your crush with messages and expecting a reply. Learn how to spend time alone. It's not a easy thing, but it is so important to be independent, because a rs should not be you relying on someone else to be complete. 

Because I grew a habit to rant to him about my feelings, our disagreements don't usually have a chance to fester into something huge and gross, and we make it a point to meet up every week, especially during the weekends when he books out of camp. 

3)TALK TO EACH OTHER. Communication is so, so important in a rs, and messages aren't enough to convey feelings. If you can call, call. If you can meet up, plan a date. It doesn't have to take up an entire day, just an hour for dinner and enjoying each other's company is enough. Talk out problems face to face. Don't hide your discomforts. But this doesn't mean to blow up at each other JFC, discuss. Nicely. Try to agree on a middle ground if the problem seems to  affect the rs. Remember that you will be one of the greatest support pillars for your so. Act like it. Relationships are never smooth sailing, don't even try to pretend it is. Take challenges as they come together, work through it as a couple. There are so many ways it can go wrong, but as long as you are willing to fight for that one path of happiness, it'll work out. 

And holy shit don't say that "your partner doesn't deserve you, they are much better than you". Don't. By saying that, you are putting your partner on a pedestal, and it's not healthy. You both have flaws, and if you think you are lacking, work to make up for it instead of pushing your partner away when they really want to help you. Grow as a person, and grow together. 
(ps if you think your partner isn't good enough for you, you are a horrible person. Stop it) 

Sorry for the long post, but I hope it helps

Hi, guys. So there's this one girl who I'm currently interested in and would like to know her better. The thing is, I'm am evergreen and personally, I think I am easily anxious and not so sociable and hence, I'm not good at starting and holding conversation with an opposite sex. 

So to those who are already experienced, what are some tips or cues that I can use to make me appear less boring and quiet? Apparently, her best friend told me that she doesn't really appreciate a guy that is too quiet.

I am a year 3 science student and quite a while ago i found my other half. I love his attention and he dotes on me alot, like he will send me home almost everyday, even after his work. 
The thing is, my friends find it annoying when my bf wants to tag along for outings. I mean I can feel it when they became so cold towards us.
Because of these tensions, my close friends became not so close anymore. It feels like I dont have any real friends anymore. I just hope that they will stop being jealous of my lovely bf and stop bad mouthing behind me.

I read the post where the OP got into a relationship with a senior 5 years older. I do acknowledge the difficulties of such a relationship, be it from parents or even from the whole world judging.

I was just wondering: what is the general consensus of guys with regards to dating older girls? Is there a cap on the age gap?

I have been getting close to a guy who's younger... I'm just not so sure whether everything is out of his respect for me as a senior... as a result I'm in a dilemma as to whether to invest more feelings or to take a step back in case I get hurt... Also, some friends would also tell me that if I were to really take a step further, I need to be prepared to be judged by the world.

Our attitudes towards love nowadays are just so full of trepidations huh?

to  I'm actually around 1.73 cm too! Hi-5. That height is pretty rare amongst Singaporean girls (or Asian girls for that matter). Perhaps... guys could be intimidated by that height?? Anyways, what's the point of having a lot of guys chasing after you just for the attention? I'd rather just have one meaningful conversation with one guy/get to know him better. Just wait patiently for the one who would appreciate/love you as you are, or you could try and take the initiative and approach guys! Anyways, I know how you feel. Even though I've had guys approach me, I've never found one that I could really click with.

May I ask how do you girls make a confession to the person you have been secretly liking for years? To tell you the truth, I'm an evergreen and I have zero knowledge on how to confess to my guy friend (I know him for quite a while) without making the situation overly awkward. I mean if it happens that he rejects me, should I laugh it off or thank him for his time? How should I respond? I know it's so silly to ask this. Things may go awry if it turns out that he has no feelings for me, but I do think it's better if I can be honest with my feelings than moping silently, wondering if he feels the same way as me...

How do you differentiate a 'nice guy' from a 'loser'?

The 'nice guy' (imo) usually focus more on books and are more genuine. They tend to be less sociable but deep down inside they are nice people and mean no harm. Most don't dress very well or are very charismatic and tend to be viewed by others as being unpopular and loserish.

On the other hand, the 'bad boys' (and girls) are usually quite nasty and wild, they are not very nice people but they are charismatic, dress well and have a nice body. Such people attract more friends and are very popular in school and all.

So how do everyone view and rectify this matter?. :/

(pls don't give me 'pls be yourself' and 'happy can alrdy' kind of comments because obviously I'm neither happy or fine with status quo.
-
 
My schoolmates always refer to me as the 'popular one'. Just because I am always saying hi to people in school and it seems that there are many people who knows me. However, I actually don't have many friends. Knowing people doesn't mean that you are popular, but my schoolmates doesn't seem to get this point. I have many acquaintances, but I don't even talk to them out of school. I don't have people who I'll text on a regular basis, and I rarely go out with my 'friends'. Genuine conversations? Don't even talk about it.  

So please, don't ever think that that 'popular' schoolmate of yours is lucky and envy him/her for knowing a lot of people. He/she might just be lonely deep inside too.

I have a crush on an average looking girl. She keeps thinking herself as an ugly girl.

I am a bit angry about that because it implies that I have bad taste.

Was reading the confession on LDRs and I'd like share my thoughts too! 

Am currently in year one of LDR (with two more years to go) and yes, it sucks. The 7/8 hour time difference, the weird hours you have to Skype at, the constant lagging of Skype and of course, the physical absence of your partner. Arguments about who's making more time for who begin to surface and when you look at his/her photos travelling to new places, you wish you weren't the one left behind. 

But with all these experiences comes the maturing of your relationship. The physical absence of your partner forces you to be more independent; not only will you have more time for your friends, you'll also have more time to invest in your personal interests. As for Skype, you'll find yourself asking "can you hear me?" more than you imagine but at the same time, laugh at how ridiculous everything is. With enough maturity and understanding, the arguments will soon cease and the next thing you know, you're counting down to the hours you see each other on next Skype. As he/she embarks on their new journeys, you will embark on yours. 

Sure, the road may be unbearable at times but as long as you guys are clear on what your future is, I'd say to give LDR a chance. I was very much against LDR and my friends didn't believe in us either. 

It sucked but at the end of the day, my man's determination to make the relationship work made me to do the same. With ample trust, understanding and love, you'll be that couple who can take pride in being apart but very much together at the same time(: 
-
 
What would be considered 'taking too much initiative'? I think I may like this guy, but I haven't really gotten that close to him. I don't know him well; not even his current relationship status (but my hunch tells me he isn't attached). We only got to know each other through taking a similar module this semester. 
-
 
I'm a girl who enjoys doing adventurous stuffs, solo travelling, hiking, diving and backpacking. As much as I enjoy the current lifestyle of solitude that I'm having, I crave for a companion in life. I don't really wanna settle for any nice guy who's just another couch potato. I want someone who can inspire me to be more adventurous in life. I did come across a few adventurous guys who are kinda cute from time to time. But they just seemed to be players (maybe they're not). And to some, I was seen as a player (but I'm not). Too many times, things just didn't work out for me. There seems to be so much relatable points in those elitedaily and thoughtcatalog posts of "Don't date a man/woman who travels". I wonder if I'll be able to find a life partner. One who is faithful yet adventurous, inspiring me to live a life of memorable expeditions. Till then, I'll continue to travel hard. And hope that I'll meet him one day on the roads.

So we got together before my current bf entered nus. I know he loves me but part of me feels like I shouldn't be with him and it's depriving him of a chance to be with someone else who is better than I am

I am a lesbian but my friends from school doesn't know anything because I know how homophobic they are. I am really tired to be somebody I am not. Why is it so hard to find friends who can be accepting  and not judge? I just need friends that will accept me for who I am. I just need to rant.. :(

If I can't have you as my boyfriend, then I wouldn't want to have you as my friend. It's really painful to see you everyday, knowing that you can't be mine..

I am a engineering guy and I feel inferior about myself among the group of my more “outspoken/hippy” friend from Fass/BIZ. All of them are extremely well-spoken/articulate and often I will not be able to get their references. The similarities I found is that they are knowledgeable with trivials. Because I come from a chinese speaking family, I am not able to converse as naturally as they do and that sort of embarrass me. Would you guys laugh secretly at people who cannot speak good English? 

Maybe I should be more confident of myself.  Nobody talks about science here☹

I was the one who posted  .
I'm really really sorry for not having enough courage to approach any of you. I couldn't find a way to anonymously contact through Facebook.

However I want to thank you all for being willing to hear me out, and honestly seeing about 83 people offering help has already made me feel a lot better than I was yesterday. 

I hope that anyone else who needs a listening ear can contact these wonderful people too.

For OPs of    and other similar posts...

Love isn't for cowards. 

If you feel that you are a right fit with an intended partner, gfi! Be respectful though, and sensitive to that person's thoughts and feelings. Some people might be hurting inside, some might be unsure, some may feel bound to cultural pressure to be "chased"- and some might be really oblivious! 

But that's what communication is for, right? C'mon the usual commenters here have said this enough- don't expect the other party to read your mind.

I have been together with my gf for several years. Apart from her occasional tantrums/pms, there isn't really much to complain about her. Recently, I have found myself to develop liking for another girl whom I haven't talked to in real life. I am unsure if this is a passng infatuation or what. As much as I want to pursue this other girl, I do not want to break my gf's heart. I do not want to have any regret in the future. What should I do?

In school, I always feel a little like a character from The Wizard of Oz, breaking a sweat down the yellow brick road.  On some days, I’m the Cowardly Lion desperate for courage, on some days I’m the Tin Woodman worrying about my missing heart, on an odd day, I’m the Scarecrow wishing I had a brain and on the very worst days, I’m Dorothy and I just want to go home. Today I was Dorothy.

I am an evergreen guy who have never gone after a girl before :( just last week I met a girl in my CCA and I knew she is the one. She looked so cute and sounded so sweet. I got her number and have been talking to her over whatsapp for a week. Though she don't reply often (which i understand she is probably busy), she still replies :) she do ask me questions sometimes to continue the conversation but I am mostly the one initiating :/ Sorry for the long story, but here is my question. How do I go after a girl? :/ When is the right time for me to try to ask her to hangout so she wont find me creepy?
-
 
This is more of a question than a confession...but I always wanted to know what being a typical jerk to girls is like (the type that treats girls badly and makes some of them fall head over heels for.)..as a guy that respects the opposite sex and was raised that way..I'm now seeing that if it's worth benign like that as I feel that maybe I should change. Any solid advise is welcome thanks.

Hi people, need some advice here. I'm an evergreen guy who recently managed to know this wonderful girl. We have went out a few times and we text each other too. In front of her, I don't feel awkward at all and we managed to hit it off really well. From those times that we meet, we managed to get to know each other so much more (her interests, family background etc.) . The messages that we exchanged used to be lengthy, until these past few days it seems that she's trying to avoid me, the replying time between messages seem like eons to me. I don't understand what happened, is she trying to play "hard to get" now? Is this normal while trying to pursue a girl?

Is it normal to suddenly develop feelings for a girl you have known in primary school when previously u didnt back in primary school years?

Sometimes it gets really really lonely in school. It does become a struggle to make friends in school, especially how frightened I am to talk to people. And it takes a while for me to warm up to someone. All I want is somebody to ask me out for lunch or something. Or even a study buddy? Someone or some people I can chill around with.

University life is really a far cry from what I expected. I thought that it will be lots of fun hanging out with people, much like the times I had in Poly. What I didn’t realize was how important it was to go for the camps as a freshman because that’s where all the cliques formed and I missed out because I had to work and pay off my study debts. There are times that I to find a quiet corner to have my meals alone like an introvert.I find that right now, I’m really at my most vocal and friendly as I can be.

I grew accustomed to the quiet in university. Still it wouldn’t hurt to have company once in a while.
-
 
What if I never meet the love of my life? 
I've never been attached to anybody. I don't think any guy ever sees me as a potential romantic interest, probably because of the way I behave- like a hobo. Maybe I should join NUS hobos HAHA. Long story short, everybody around me is either attached or in the process of getting attached, and I feel as lonely and hopeless as ever. Will I ever find someone? What if I found him but let him go? What if I never find him? Btw evergreen here
The assurances of the right person coming along in due time do nothing to assuage my fears. I'm as skeptical as ever.

Guys. Would you look at your girl friend's cleavage? It's hard to resist sometimes.

I am an introvert, and I prefer spending my limited social mana on the people that matter, namely my family and my two best friends.

I am in *a design-related course in SDE* and as much as I expect workload to be heavy, I hate the copious amount of "meeting-up" I have to do with group members whom I'm not close with. Neither am I intending to get close with them because.. I just can't see that happening. They are a bunch of sociable, talkative people. A lot more extroverted than me. They practically look forward to meeting up with one another, even for work. On the other hand, my heart sinks whenever I see another message on Whatsapp going something like, "hey, let's meet up to discuss ______ !"

Sometimes, I feel the urge to suggest to "meet-up" online instead of a physical meeting, but this might make them think I'm a lazybum, and possibly raise it to our profs. Sometimes I just want to tell them hey, I'm an introvert. Can we please don't meet up so often? I know you guys have no problem with meet-ups but to some other people, it's draining and mood-dampening and anxiety-inducing. Please try to understand that what's seemingly effortless, even pleasurable to you, may actually be hell to others. But I'm afraid I'll be blacklisted because of my stupid demands. But seriously, sometimes, communicating online is just as productive as doing so physically. And it saves time and money, so practical! You don't have to worry about forgetting to bring something, because home has all you need.

Speaking of home, I overwhelmingly prefer working at home than in the studio. The studio is an assault on my senses. So much noise, so much discomfort. At home, I am in my element. I can do whatever I want - get food from the fridge, blast my music, rest my legs on the table. At home I am surrounded by familiarity, by the love of family, it's a hotbed for inspiration. And you need inspiration to produce good design. It all goes back to being introverted. Sadly, my studio mates seem to be hinting to me that I should be in studio more often, perhaps implying that I should work harder? Because being seen in the studio means you're working hard? The model student sleeps overnight in the studio? It doesn't help that I do not produce outstanding work; my lack of exceptional quality in my work is now being attributed to being absent in the studio most of the time.

Neither am I saying physical meet-ups should be completely abolished. I know sometimes physical meet-ups are necessary. But I do not want to see your faces all the time. Putting up a smiley front whenever I meet you all is mentally draining. If the work delegation ain't complex, by all means stay at home. You get to save your time and transport costs. I get to save my sanity.

To the op of  I'm the op of . I can never forget the closeness that we had to before he got married. We shared a bed on one overseas trip (I swear we never had sex because we knew we were only friends). But to see him smiling in his sleep and waking up beside him was already itself a gift better than any sex. I feel for you, OP. We had so much interconnection during that short period that we knew what we were thinking.

I could share with him all the depression that I went through because he has been there and could advise me. It was the best time of my life in the short time we had together. I cried everyday after he got married, wondering why I did not confess earlier. Though I know the circumstances was not right (he was on sep, I was in Singapore) but until this day I always blame myself. 

Without him, my depression continued. But  whether he's married or not, I will always love him. Hopefully, someday I can leave this memory without feeling the pain and stabbing of my heart. To me, he is my best temporary gift. To you, OP I'm sure you appreciated a lot too. But that is all you can do for now. Hope we both can overcome this.
-
 
I have met someone who is open-minded, extreme left wing, love to learn general knowledge and other languages. He is also the kindest man i ever know. I fell in love when I first talked to you. Though you are short, not handsome nor popular, even with your long hair now I still fall in to your bubbly laughter. I want to be with you forever but alas you have graduated and married. 

To those nerds out there, there are girls who will chase after you too, not just popular guys. Just have a good character like him. And maybe someone will come by and appreciate your inner beauty. Alas, not for me. :(
-
 
The first time I saw you, I sensed something was different about you..maybe love at first sight? Not only your personality, but your unique perspectives is something I am starting to admire. Though you are closeby, it feels so distant cause of the ogmates whom you always hangout with. How I wish you didn't have that boundary around you...

 hey dear chances are that he won't change. find someone who loves you for you, not the pleasure you can provide

Sincerely,
Someone who has been in a similar situation before

OP of  here.
Ok well, adding on, for the past month when things were still normal, we would normally take pictures together and she would like it on insta. But the photo from the recent outing wasnt along with my other photos which were food from the past 3 days. Just as i thot she will not like anymore of my photos, she actually liked the photo i posted today. As for the messages i sent her, its more of like she replies them at a rate of 1 msg per day compared to last time and its definitely not because shes busy since she was able to talk on a group chat in which both of us are in whenever shes online. So im still puzzled.

To the two business sch dudes talking REALLYYY loudly just beside my table, stop showing off alrdy. Got one pretty girl share table with both of you then talk about going to Google and how fun it is to take CS1010. Dudes she maybe from computing, but no need show off, she obviously not interested in both of you. =_=

In response to a particular comment on  post , it simply tells me something. Some guys are simply ignorant of how a girl may feel when it comes to being ogled at. Obviously the girl must have noticed something amiss before making comments on such things, but yet there is no evidence to proof if this is indeed happening. Some guys must have thought the girl imagine too much (possibly because guys are unlikely to encounter this problem). Worst, i have heard people said that guys ogling at girls is normal and there is nothing wrong. Why does such mentality still exists at this age??

Long post ahead.

Just stumbled upon some lyrics which quite perfectly describes the mess that's been in my mind for some time.
"You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I’d live to see today
You’re still in my mind, but not in my chest
I’m a little worn out since you fucking tore me down
You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought that I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong
I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don’t really need you
I’ll get through the winter without you
Stick with me or don’t stick around at all
I was the boy that was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind and left me all alone to die
I’ll sit on my basement floor, turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I’m down there I’ll know that I won’t be running through your mind"

I'm Guy and she's Girl. Guy is one of the typical confessors here: shy, awkward (especially with females), introverted, antisocial, lack of friends, alone most of the time, etc. With very few female friends, any positive female attention makes his overthinking mind go crazy. Perhaps that's the root of the problem here.
Guy and girl met two years ago. They clicked and soon had a never ending WA convo going on. Guy thinks maybe there's some good chemistry between them. Starts falling for her.  Even mutual friends notice that they're close and stir them. Girl vehemently denies these, making guy wonder if there was ever anything between them at all, or if she was just being normal and friendly. So as you can expect guy keeps his feelings hidden.
Some months later the WA convo starts drying up and they drift apart. Guy accepts that perhaps it was never meant to be and understands that he must move on. WA contact is still intermittent until present day, but guy knows it is nothing more than small talk.

Fast forward half a year later. Guy was in the vicinity of girl at a canteen. They definitely saw each other, but nothing at all happened. Both ended up dao-ing each other. Yet guy still felt the butterflies, and jealousy when friends stir girl with a new man now. But what right does guy have? Guy and girl are like strangers again.

Sigh, I know I must move on, but it seems impossible to find another girl to at least make me overthink about, so that I will forget girl-from-story.

to the OP of 

right about now, i wish i could somehow contact you.  but we're hidden behind this veil of anonymity. 
your story is so scarily similar to mine. i thought i was the only one going through such a ridiculous situation..
its really absurd, and scary how people can change so drastically and so quickly.

but please, keep your faith in guys like me, who strongly believe in staying loyal and faithful. Just like you, i was planning a future with her, everything was going great. but half a year into her job, she left for a guy from her office. to be honest, i too probably cant place my trust in others again. but slowly, i'll still try to, in hopes of finding someone like you.

I met my first true love during our yr 1 engineering freshmen orientation. I was his first love and we dated for nearly 5 years before we broke up a few months ago. 

During the 4 crazy hectic years in engineering, I struggled badly. I really wanted to give up at some points, yet I persisted on with his love and encouragement. He was always there when I needed him. He never had much difficulty, he was really smart and could ace most of his exams.

We were inseparable. People were envious of me because they could tell how much he really loves me. My family and friends approved of him too. They felt that he was sincere, simple and down to earth. He too, was always thinking about marrying me, talking about children, about future. On our fourth year of relationship, I was pretty much set on building a future with him together. But we had to get our career on track first.
Just when things looked rosy, things suddenly went downhill after 1 year into our job after graduation. I went into engineering field, while he found interest in the banking industry. I didn’t think he would be well suited in the banking industry. He is more introverted, and prefer to stay home instead of socialising. I expressed my concern, but also encouraged him to pursue his passion. He was fascinated with the money the banking industry could bring him. I felt that it was good for a guy to be ambitious. However, as the time passes, he started to become nearly obsessed with investments and trading. Not just that. He was hungry for career advancement. He wanted to jump from back office to the front office as quickly as possible. He started to leech on this female colleague who is really popular amongst everyone including the bosses. He became great friends with her, and they went for coffee chats with big bosses to gain connections and all, in hopes of climbing out of the back office one day. 
Their relationship turned from colleagues to good friends within a year. When I found out he has been constantly chatting with her, I told him to stop because it was making me uncomfortable, yet he refused to. This was the first time he refused my plea. I knew then that he has more feelings for her than just a good friend. But he denied. Within just 2 weeks everything fell apart. He confessed to her before he broke up with me. She rejected him. But he broke up with me anyway. He said it’s not me, it’s him. He is lost and he wants to find himself. Later I found out that right after we broke up, he began to actively chase her. 

I don’t know if they are together now. But sometimes I still find it so absurd. That a guy would give up a long term relationship with his soul mate. Yes, even after we broke up, he still called me his soul mate. We never had much problems. We were stable, and just really comfortable with each other. I don’t understand why would anyone give up someone he calls a best friend, confidant and soul mate, without even trying to make this relationship work when he felt that things weren’t right. He never expressed any unhappiness. We hardly ever quarrelled. This abrupt end in relationship is somehow making me lose faith in true love. Because I think we both agree that what we had was true love.

I am just being worried and curious. Is it true that it is very hard or near impossible for guys to find their significant others in the workplace since most girls will have been happily attached or married by then?

Is it okay to date your friend's ex?
Okay maybe not a friend anymore because I dont keep in touch with her after JC. But both of them broke up quite long ago.

Recently I have been talking to her ex because we happen to be in the same uni batch year. Surprisingly enough, he was going to the same faculty as me. We could hit off pretty well. But sometimes thoughts like "he was your (not so close anymore) friend's ex afterall and the both of them remained friends, occasionally talking to each other. So you should not be even thinking about dating him etc"

What should I do

to  Well, i guess i know how you feel. I am in a similar situation as you but I am the one that likes to keep things private. Maybe i can help shed some light into why your bf is feeling that way. As you might already know, there are many different kind of love language. Like physical affection, acts of service,gifting etc. I am almost a non physical affection kind of person, I do not particularly enjoy touching or kissing. I am someone who would show love by doing something that i know my SO would appreciate. From buying food to even just printing notes. On the other hand, my SO is more touchy and likes holding hands and kissing.  But i feel like as long as we both know that we are committed into the relationship, i really see no point in telling the world that you are attached. We should stop seeking assurance and gratification from social media and other people irl. Once you accept that you dont need "approvals" from other irrelevant people, you'll definitely feel happier

Currently feeling lost while stuck in a certain NUSSU club that has a majority of international students from the same country...and word is that they keep letting their friends in. Guys, that's not cool. Give others a chance.

sometimes i wonder if i am anyone's eyecandy or crush.. :x

I am a pretty shy guy (quiet in groups but can be pretty chatty within a small group of close friend).  I sense that a outgoing girl might be interested in me but I am not too sure how and when is the right time to ask her for a date. I am the type of guy who do not know what to say/do in awkward moment and she knows it and has told me that I am too honest. 

When would be a right time to ask her out? Should I be completely comfortable with her first or some awkwardness is fine? It has been months since she first indicated interests (she is quite aggressive at first – at least to me…like openly flirtly with me when with other friends) but I was too shy to do anything and it made me sort of scare of her. But until recently she approach me more like a normal friend and encouraging me to hang out more and that makes me more comfortable with her and we talk more. From time to time, she would still say stuff like I should go to her place more often to hang out which makes me think that she is still somewhat interested in me. 

Another thing I am afraid of is her group of outgoing friend. I cannot click with them because I always feel intimidated around them and I am afraid they will say bad stuff about me. I don’t think they hate me tho. Maybe they will say I don’t suit her? Is it just my insecurities?

I am evergreen so there is no time that seems like the right time to ask for a date. What are your opinions girls and guys??

Really appreciate it.

To the OP of 

Yeah I get that feel too. Happens a lot with institution allocated groupings (e.g. class, OG, CCA batch), because the people aren't necessarily going to get along amazingly together, so they usually break up into smaller cliques that may or may not have inter-clique interaction.

My secondary school CCA batchmates have always been "close" but not all of us really "click" together. Being one of those typical quiet kids, I wasn't very close with them. Even now, 7 years later, the core few will go out for meals, but when I or any of the fringe ones come along, our topics of interest diverge so much that it's just awkward and conversation gets mundane and stilted. It's painful all around.

So, as much as people may say that one's happiness shouldn't be dictated by the presence of other people etc etc, I know that subtle disappointment when you find out that you just don't mean that much to the rest. Another example would be Whatsapp group chat birthday greetings, the difference between that for a core person to a fringe person is obvious.

((Before all the "SO SHALLOW" comments start coming in, I make no excuse other than the fact that humans are undoubtedly social creatures. We seek (crave?) attention. It is unrealistic to expect everyone to survive on zero support.))

However, I have found friends who can really be counted as friends, and they can be counted on one hand. They are those I can trust and rely on. Anyway, to cut the long story short, we were the quiet few who found our voices with each other when no one else would bother to listen. #poetic

As a group gets larger, there's definitely going to be inner and outer circles. Getting in is really hard and tiring, especially if you are an introvert. I suggest finding people you don't have to act with. I know it takes a long period of trial and error, but keep at it okay :) Meanwhile, it would be good to develop your own interests and work on becoming "ambivert." All the best!

///

tl;dr: It happens. Find people on your wavelength, and have fun on the long road.

My bf is my direct junior whom I got to know through CCA and we've been together for quite sometime. Sometimes I just feel like he's using me right from the start. He had requested for all my textbooks, notes and reports. Of course I would have given them to him, but it's just the way he demands for and take them with no thank you, no nothing. Can't help but make me feel that he's gotten together with me for a purpose. Overtime, I also realised he tend to get close to people (I wouldn't call them friends) with academic benefits. It scares me sometimes.

This is a legit question please do not roast me. I think I am falling in love with a slightly plump girl (she’s pretty cute). I have been stalking her old photos and she seemed really cute and hot back then. I am afraid I am liking her for what she could have been and not what she is right now. Another factor is that I feel that she likes me too so that somehow makes me attracted to her? I am pretty shy and she would say that I am cute every now and then.  I would never want to hurt her and I feel pretty shy around her (normally not as much for other girls). Maybe her hinting me that she is interested makes me want to reciprocate? I really don’t know. Am I just in a confused state? I feel really happy when I have a great time with her but incredibly sad if I cannot connect with her during some occasions. She’s pretty sensitive and observant which I like.

But Shes also making me experience a lot of mood swings.Help plz

Sometimes I'm very envious of other slim girls who don't need to do much to stay slim. Even though I eat lesser and healthier than most of my friends while working out more, I'm still not as slim as them. Coupled with the fact that I'm really short too... These remain as my greatest insecurities and contribute greatly to my low self esteem which sometimes get me really depressed. I guess I'm just not the "skinny" type and it's taking me a hard time to come to terms with ):

To all the people asking for advice about liking or even loving someone who is attached:

Run far, far, far away; please do not be the third party. It is better for yourself and the couple as well. My ex had this "good friend" whom I was really really really uncomfortable with, but he continued talking to her (A LOT). In the end, he broke up with me in the most insincere way ever (not even a phone call) and got together with his "good friend". 

You might think that there's nothing wrong with talking to your attached friend whom you have feelings because it's "just friends", but sooner or later, something will happen. 

It's been two years but there are still days when I can't get over it, get over the betrayal (I'm way over him). 

And in case you are wondering, they broke up. It won't last because it might be because he's just looking for someone else and you are "always there".

I've been having serious struggles to fall asleep lately. I will take hours trying to drift into sleep and nonetheless, I'll tuck in at 11PM every night in the hopes of getting a good nights sleep - which of course disappoints me every time. 

The thing is, as I close my eyes and try my best to fall asleep at night, my mind seems to wake up even more. All sorts of thoughts hunt me as my mind gets clearer and clearer - my mind will wonder n think whether slicing the wrist will actly make everything better as some claims to be so. And it frustrates me. It's become so tiring to lie in my bed and it's starting to make me feel so sick and tired of going to bed at night. I think I can say that im afraid of going to sleep. 

Well, eventually I will fall asleep, from the frustration and exhaustion that knocks me out at 6am in the morning. Unfortunately, even this 'hard-earned' sleep wont last long, and ill wake back up at around 8-9am no matter how tired i am. And the day will go by, without a nap as i fear taking a nap would disrupt my sleep at night. I will walk through the day with lingering tiredness, just like a prisoner slowed down by a chain and metal ball shackled to his ankle. 

This has been going on for more than a week now and nothing seems to work. I dont know if the lack of sleep is causing it but I've been having issues with remembering things. For instance, I cant seem to recall the names of my friends i met a day ago, and the things i intended to do the day after. 

I dont know. I just wanna get some help. Feeling helpless about this is not helping me in any way too.

A question to ponder: I wonder if a girl who has a one-sided love for her male friend should take a step back (hides her feelings and acts normally when he is around) as she is too timid to show her keen interest in him for god knows what the reasons are.. People may suggest confessing/hinting him to avoid any possible regrets for life or something. However, she just doesn't have the guts to do and have issues with expressing her affection someone. No doubt from now on, she'll wait or all talk no action while any possible chances with her future love interests slip by since she lacks the courage..
-
 
why is it so difficult to find someone who stays loyal and faithful to their partner. why do people give in so easily to temptations and love another while in a relationship? why do people cheat on their partners?

ive been broken far too many times..i dont know how im ever going to trust people again..but yet, i cant stand the silence in my life. the void she left behind in my heart is far too large to be filled no matter what i do to distract myself. Why does the world have to be such a brutal place.

To begin with, I'm an evergreen guy but not gonna complain about how I can't find a girlfriend etc. I actually find it a lot easier to click with girls than other guys. There are some stuff which girls would listen to better and i find girls generally appreciate htht-moments more. These are also purely platonic, good friendships or bro-ships which I really treasure, without the complications of r/s.

What's the real downer though is when people constantly think you're "hunting" or "casting your net" :/. I get that it's natural to judge, but it doesn't help when people start spreading rumours without even getting to know me first. Needless to say, I don't have the best of reputations.

Perhaps I'm just finding an avenue to rant about how superficial I see society as: Exercising our judgment as we see fit without really affirming anything beforehand, since it doesn't affect the "judge". Thanks for reading this though if you did.

Ps: To evergreen posters who were complaining and making it sound bad about being single, maybe just know there's an opposite end of the evergreen spectrum too. Chill guys, we're barely at quarter life crisis. We'll find somebody eventually.

Hi guys, I'm here for some advice... Hope you guys will help out... I'm a girl and I've been in a relationship for a year. I am a very conservative girl who is actually against pre-marital sex. I am also uncomfortable if my bf gets too touchy (under what I wear and stuff). But unfortunately, my bf is a rather touchy guy and we have tried to talk about this before. He's a guy rather open about intimacy and sex and has done it with his ex before. Things are fine now but he has frankly told me that as time passes, he'll expect more intimacy and I find this hard to cope with. I'm not sure if we were to really stay till the end, can I cope with such a lifestyle? Unfortunately this is an issue bothering me for quite a long period of time. I understand that he's a guy and he has his needs, but perhaps we are kinda on two different sides of the spectrum. While I really think we are compatible in terms of our attitudes towards life and we have endless topics, I don't know if I should end things now to prevent myself from falling deeper or just deal with what's going to come. It's not that I don't want to satisfy him, it's just his appetite might be too much for me to handle. It's not his fault I know. Sometimes I do wish I'm not as conservative as I am.

Since I started school in NUS, my other friends who are currently in poly and ITE seem to be less friendly to me. I don't get it. I know that my intelligence is superior to theirs and I am always helpful to them by pointing out their mistakes and giving them advice so that they can improve and become like me. 

Yesterday I went out with them for supper and I noticed that they kept rolling their eyes at each other when I was explaining to them some new things I learnt in lectures. 

What did I do wrong? Should I dump my group of friends because they are jealous of my intelligence?

I am attracted to him and to me (at least) he seem as though he's self-sufficient, fit, involved. In other words, really up there. Is it weird to say that instead of making advances on him (which i did very subtlely attempted but had no real progression) i feel motivated by him to become a better person? Admitedly, i feel a little out of his league (though he claims to be evergreen) as i feel that i am an.average girl and to me (some of my friends would beg to differ) he is really up there. Some days when i see him around campus esp when i was caught off guard, i will feel so panicky and anxious (is the good kind of feeling though) that warm fuzzy feeling:) maybe one day when i become a better person, when i have better control of my life and if the feeling is mutual we can get to know each other more in depth :)

What does a boy think when asking me if I love him or my ex-bf more after refusing my love? We used to be best friends, and I found it hard to face him, so I just unfriended and blocked him (the common action I always do to walk out of somebody's life). Then he used another account to keep asking me to unblock him and add friend again. 

What should I do now?

I admit I'm not a handsome, not muscular, not rich or smart. I don't know how but I manage to find 2 fwb in my three years in NUS. RVR's toilets, my RVR room, our club room and the male toilet at MPSH are some of the places where we had fun. Having got together with my gf this summer, I hope that I can stop those fwb activities. Though deep down I don't want to disappoint my gf and I love her, I realized I don't have the same level of sex drive on my fwbs for my gf. Please advice me what to do. Do I dont love my gf as much as I think I do?

Do guys get scared off or feel inadequate in front of a girl who's put together, knows what she wants and likes to be independent? And on top of that, a pretty girl as well? I've always believed that it's not about finding two halves that fit but two wholes that can support each other and grow together. I like to have my own space and privacy but I think that sometimes come across as apathy and being antisocial. Somehow most of the guys I've interacted with seem pretty content with just going with the flow without putting much thought into life. In my opinion, most guys in university are still boys, not yet men. (Sorry Ah Boys to Men, NS doesn't really help guys gain that much more maturity and depth, but it does help them look better physically haha) I'm giving up hope finding someone who can appreciate and understand me. I guess I'd rather be a part of the growing trend of educated, career driven and accomplished single women rather than settling for a relationship just for the sake of achieving the end points of marriage and having kids. Anyone else share the same thoughts?

In year 3 now and I unexpectedly made friends with some freshies and suddenly I'm the "cool senpai" who they look up to. I'm okay with being friends with them, but I feel a bit uneasy because I don't think I deserve their "respect". I'm not even good in academics - my CAP is crap.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to have them as friends, but I feel like I'm cheating them or something. But it's not as if being smart is a criteria for being friends, right? I'd be more than happy to share notes or show them around school, but I'd be hopeless in teaching them or giving academic advice. Sometimes, I wished that they didn't notice this senpai.

I posted previously about this guy I met on exchange that I was (and maybe still am) interested in. Some commenters mentioned that his actions suggested that he may be interested in me as well. But as I shared in another post, we stopped communicating after I returned from exchange. He took super long to reply to my messages, saying that he's busy (he said he would be busy until about mid august), although he is quite active on facebook. So I decided to give up because I thought he really didn't have any interest in even developing a friendship.

Recently, we started to email each other again. It started off as my desperate attempt last time to create an opportunity for us to keep in touch, something work-related. Our email conversations are like semi-work-related, some parts are about work and some are like casual, personal topics, like what he's up to, and funny stuff. He made a joke that was a reference to a joke I made over lunch before I left, which I took a while to remember. In our interactions he always remembered our conversations with a lot of detail, which last time I interpreted as him being interested in me, but he probably just has an excellent memory I guess?

So anyway, he said to keep the conversation going over email, and also suggested some other interesting opportunities that we could work on together (as in, legit work stuff). I don't know if he is genuinely interested in me or is just a good networker. But I am also not an extremely valuable resource for his projects.

I'm just super bummed because I had such a hard time getting over him, and now he's being friendly again, and the opportunity is here again. I can't help but wonder if he's interested in me and if I have a chance at all.

And I am not those type that will just tell him that I like him right now, because we aren't even good or regular friends yet. 

WHY IS LIFE SO COMPLICATED! Or probably it's just me complicating things on my end alone.

I think I am near the end of my relationship. At the end we still cannot understand each other. We have talked about this multiple times but it still didn't work out. My partner simply refuses to change. 

On the other hand I always feel sad when thinking of breakup. I imagine we could really become perfect couple..

I think people will never change, after all..

Heh, very interesting reading about rich people with privilege. I am a rich person too, but it didn't use to be this way. My dad abandoned my family before I was born, and my mum and I pretty much scraped by. However some time ago I came into possession of a trust fund from my "dad", apparently out of guilt. After knowing what it is like to feel rich, my resentment at my more well-off friends only became magnified. 

It brings a smile to my face knowing they are still working to make ends meet, whereas I can pretty much live in comfort till the day I die (based on average lifespan of humans) without working at all. Now I just chuckle inwardly whenever I hear their humblebrags.
-
 
I've known this girl for more than a year but we've only started interacting on a more personal level recently and I think I'm falling for her. Assuming I haven't already been friendzoned, how do I drop hints that I like her and ask her out on a romantic date (instead of two friends hanging out)? Should I start with something like having meals together in school?
-
 
I have this pet peeve -- I absolutely hate having people walk right up to me when I'm eating just to ask "what are you eating?" and then stare at the food I'm eating as though analyzing what I'm really having for a few seconds before walking away.

Really? Do you REALLY need to know what I'm eating? I'm not sure if it's just me, but this action irks me so badly (don't know why though). If it was just a glance from far or wasn't made known though, of course I won't have issues with it.

Now this doesn't happen in NUS fortunately, but it happens so damn often at home. Maybe I just feel that meal time is really something private? I dunno.
-
 
I had quite a few close friends last time. But things became different after they entered into relationships. I'm happy for them but as what happens in life, the friendship slowly faded away. Maybe I was wrong about it - they don't treat me as a close friend. But I'm someone who treasures friendship a lot because I know friendship lasts longer than a love relationship Am I weird? Btw, I have a boyfriend. 
Until now I am still feeling sad about the lost friendship. I am hesitant to make friends anymore because I feel that they won't be in my life forever and they don't know really know me as well as my old friends. (my past and etc). I wonder if anyone feels the same as well.
People come and go. I understand that people can't stay forever as they have their own priorities. Perhaps I'm just a possessive idiot.
I know some of you might say that I should talk things out. I guess we tried. But when things don't feel the same anymore, I guess it's time to let go. 
-
 
Need some advice... I am currently going out with this girl (not dating, not together yet). I know its normal for couples to let their partners see their phones and wallet.. But as above, we are not dating/together yet but she still lets me do them... Is this really hinting something?
-
 
To OP ,
What do you think of the opposite happening?
My Ex GF still wants to remain as a friend with me despite insisting that she doesn't love me anymore. Anyone has any take on this matter? She will still message me randomly to get updates on me.

I am mind-screwed.

In response to OP  regarding what it means to be cheating on your partner:
Pretty impressed you actually had a reply post to your first post, seems you're actually appreciative and really looking for advice. I feel that I would like to comment on this because of my own similar experiences.
When I was with my first girlfriend, (ok fine I was probably still young back then) I admit that even with her, I still looked to other girls to fulfil my self esteem, in forms of flirting or whatsoever. I enjoyed talking to numerous girls especially when I know they are interested in talking to me as well. However, it was different in my second relationship. I was no longer interested in 'flirting' with other girls, they no longer make me happier. I know that I do not want to be caught in a situation where I feel stuck; continue these flirting conversations but hiding them from my gf. The flirting conversations no longer serve any purpose at all, other than being a burden to my relationship. And I realised that it had to do with my determination to commit to the two girlfriends at the different points of time. So, maybe you should ask yourself whether you really want this relationship, to really commit to it, and if you really want your current girl? Because the fact that you are asking those questions simply show that you're not sure enough. I am not saying you cannot have female friends, but know your limits. And obviously you already know that your conversations with the girls are flirting, then why would you still do it?

In a fully committed relationship, you should know when and what to put a stop to. The moment you decide to commit in a relationship, other girls shouldn't even enter your mind easily. You also mentioned that it's the girl who flirts with you even though you try to ignore her at times. Do you honestly think that that is a good excuse at all? You mean there is no other way to stop her from flirting other than to flirt back since you already 'tried' to ignore her sometimes. Come on. It's like you had sex with another women and you say oh you didn't mean to but they girl keeps seducing you and you already tried pushing her away. Fact is you succumbed it in the end and that's what counts. If you know what the other girl's intention is, which includes flirting, you should fully know that you should not do it because you are in a relationship, you respect your relationship and your girlfriend, and you know your girlfriend would not like it. "My gf does not know about it" is NOT an excuse much less a reason. Likewise, if a guy wants to get close to your girl obviously on intention, and your girl actually flirts back, would you be alright with it? If you tell me yes, you are actually fine with your girl flirting with other guys then maybe your relationship is unique in a way that you have your own rules, and if so, you can ignore whatever I said.

Otherwise, if you actually still enjoy flirting with other girls, maybe you should reconsider your relationship. Save your girlfriend too, stop wasting her time and love.

guys, what do you think of girls confessing? even if your feelings are platonic towards her, what would you think about her after she had confessed, assuming that y'all were not really close, just friends who occasionally talked via WA and saw each other at family gatherings.

Once, I gone to zouk without wearing my underwear on purpose. The thing was I was hitting off well with a certain team mate of mine that particular day and I got the most awkward pat on the butt when I whispered that I didn't had any underwear on. To be honest, I kind of liked it but too bad, he's attached and I feel bad. Such a cock tease I am.

Hi, i am a freshie in NUS this year and i did not get to stay in hall.. i din't manage to make much friends either.. my jc/sec friends (girls) are all at diff university. I feel really lonely. To make things worse, i  am barely coping with my studies and it does not help that my house is 1hr-1.5hr away from school nd my wifi connection is always down. I feel that my confidence level is going down everyday and it has hit an all time low. There are many cca i want to try but feel so inedaqute to try. Is it normal to feel lost and lonely? Is it normal to feel this way? I have share my concerns with some of my close friends and they did try to help but i feel that me feeling this way constantly have cause them to drift away from me.. i really have no idea how to get out of this and be normal again. I miss the old me.. i think i need hall but i don't know where to get it. I tried hotlines but they do not seem to help i don't know what to do anymore.. i really need help

All the talk about premarital sex got me in deep thoughts about it. TLDR; I DO NOT support it even though you might call me a hypocrite.

I was young and foolish and fell head over heels for a guy that wasn't even mine. He was my best friend, we hung out a lot and I haboured thoughts of getting together all the time. I'd do anything to make him happy even if it hurts that I received no reciprocation or inkling that he's felt the same way, all except sex.

Another friend suggested I should give in to his advances, to which I was (and still am) feverntly against it. But... "anything to make him happy"... right..? Wrong.
We nearly went all the way one night with protection... and we had a scare when that time of the month was delayed. 

We fought and argued so badly because neither one of us was mature enough to even think that such responsibility suddenly thrown upon us was possible. Our friendship was gone in that split second. How much of a coward we both were was demeaning and disgusting. It left us broken.

Sex can be pleasurable, yes. It may seem like the in thing to do because we are seen as more liberal. But from personal experience, I regret it so much. Legal age doesn't equate to maturity, but how one handles being thrown in the deep end of responsibility does.

Marriage does just that. It is a legal public declaration of love between 2 human beings that in sickness or in health, in the good and the bad they will support one another. It's about sacrifice in love. You're responsible for that other human being (and smaller humans in the future) who is probably just as awesome as you.

Yeah sure bgr kinda does that responsibility-thingyums and 'we are mature enough to decide' too, but the moment things grow bad, they break down so much faster without as many consequences, which us why divorces can be really terrible because it tears that very contract built in love for years and torn by 'unsolvable differences'.

It's your choice, I'm not telling you how to live your lives. I'm not judging anyone or else I'd be judged myself. I'm pleading, appealing to those who are keeping yourself for someone who is mature and responsible for you, who loves you (not just the sex). Hope you all find what you're looking for. (Sex or none at all)

losing a relationship u spent 3 and a half years building.. it makes everything u're doing now so meaningless. it makes everything so painful. it makes everything so empty. its incredibly lonely. this agony is indescribable even after 3 days. 
yet all i can do is force a smile in school while im dying inside. seeing other couples causes my heart to writ in pain.  my life revolved around her. everything i did was for her, or for a future with her. now, im just lost. 
so many things in the relationship i could have done better, and maybe that would have changed something. maybe dat would have kept her by my side. but i didnt. you'll only realise a better alternative after you look back at what you have done.  but it's far too late by then.
she was a unique gem. i'll never be able to find someone like her again. i want so badly to reset everything and try again. why did you have to go..

As a freshman, I was looking forward to finding new friends and meeting old ones from my JC. However, this past week has been nothing but a disappointment. All the guys ever talk about are sexual jokes and other immature things like making fun of the lecturer's accent. It's so hard to concentrate in a lecture when the people around me snicker at every word the lecturer says. 

I faced this issue back in JC too, so I had hoped that 2 years of national service would have made them more mature - but I guess I was wrong. Maybe this is due to the fact that I'm in engineering where majority are guys and tend to act silly with one another.

Anyways currently I have given up on making any new friends through lectures and spend my time alone throughout the whole day. I even sneak into lectures early and pray that none of them ever spot or sit near me. 

Anyone else facing the same issue I am? I do enjoy jokes here and there (especially clever ones) but I cannot seem to tolerate these people. Or am I just an anti-fun person?

Sigh, so in a nutshell, this is what happened:

I have been seeing a white guy for the past 1 year. A few days ago, I found out that he has kissed other women since meeting me, and by his own admission, he would have slept with them too had he been more sex-oriented.

Before I go on, I just want to make one thing clear: we were never gf-bf. Because of our age difference and the different stages of life that we're in, we realized after a few months of being together that a proper relationship would never work out.

But... what bothers me is that he was with other women even before we realized that we would never work out as partners. So he was kissing other women and sleeping with me. He went on vacation where he kissed a couple of women (all strangers), and throughout the vacation he was texting me that he missed me etc.

I know men -- and some women too -- are brilliant at compartmentalizing, but how is it possible to be in an intimate relationship and have it mean nothing? I know this wasn't intentional: he had no intention of betraying me. He simply didn't think we were exclusive and that it was okay to "court" me (at that time we hadn't realized that a real relationship wouldn't work) and be with other women too.

This brings me to the following question: what the hell do non-exclusive relationships even mean?

With most Singaporeans (correct me if I'm wrong), if you're sleeping with the person in a non-casual manner, it's already assumed that you're exclusive. If you genuinely care about someone and you're telling them that you miss them etc., and you're actually behaving like you're in a relationship, do the words "be my gf/bf" actually matter?

It seems that with westerners, those words actually mean something. There is no such thing as simply assuming something.

Had I known he was with other women, I would have never ever continued any sort of relation with him.

This was a good, caring man. He wasn't a young, hormonal teenager who just wants to sleep with women. Yet he did this... and somehow he thinks he did nothing wrong.

Is this simply a difference in culture and values? Or am I just overreacting?

Is sexual intimacy a must in relationship? My bf is no longer a virgin, and he said that sexual intimacy is a must before marriage so as to determine if another half will be the one you are marrying in the future as marriage is long term and he does not believe in divorce. How far is this true? Probably he wanted someone who is good in bed to be his wife? I am an inexperience person in relationship and advice is needed.

Can't belive I ran into this super cute Food Science girl again! Hope that I will be able to strike a convo with her the next time I see her :)

I was 18 when I broke up with my long distance boyfriend of close to 2 years. I thought things between us would work out but sadly, it didn't. He cheated on me with another girl in his school and it left me heartbroken. Being upset and irrational, I started dating another guy friend that I had known for a few years after he confessed to me that he liked me. He too had just broken up with his girlfriend, and I suppose we both took each other as rebounds. 

On the second day, he came to fetch me from work and send me home. Things between us seemed fine, until the next day. He came to fetch me from work again, and when we were in the lift, he tried to touch me while we were kissing. I refused and pushed his hands away. But after a while he tried his luck again, but good thing I still had my senses about me and pushed him away again. After this time, I stepped away from him and rushed home by myself. Later that night, he texted me to break up with me. The incident was a traumatic experience that haunted me for a few months, before I finally managed to step out of it with the help of a close friend. From then on, I realised how stupid I had been to get into a rebound relationship without realising its potential to hurt me. 

Thankfully, I was glad that later in life I found someone who truly loved me for who I am. He was the close friend that helped me overcome the trauma. We have been dating for more than a year now and I am living in bliss. He made me recover my confidence in love and I am truly grateful that he came into my life.

To all out there, I hope that no matter what happens in your life, never lose hope.

Hi Guys from NUS. Leave my GF alone.
Actually, it is kind of interesting to hear stories from her on all your advances ... the hilarious pick up lines and attempts to sit next to her during lecture to make small talks.
So perhaps ... I should actually say "keep it coming"!

Amused bf from another Uni

Few years ago, ehen I was a freshie, I was unpopular since I was the stereotypical geeky kid, with only academic smarts as my only plus point. Everything else (looks, EQ, etc.), and I let a female friend leech off my work in NUS because I mistakenly thought she would grow to like me the more I helped her. In the end she got attached to some other guy and I at least had the sense to recognise that I was being used and break off contact with her.

Now, she's apparently been dumped and distraught and is trying to look for me for comfort and schoolwork help again. I bluntly told her I couldn't because my (current) girlfriend would be unhappy. Is it bad that I'm secretly feeling sadistically happy watching how things turned out (well for me and terrible for her) in the end for the both of us?

I want you to know that I liked you since the very first day we met in class. Your strange haircut captured my attention, your thought provoking questions developed my interest for you, and our shared activities and interests fueled my hope of becoming your girlfriend one day. Nonetheless, I knew it would hardly be possible; not because you were taken or you liked someone else, not because of the ethnic difference but because of the fact that I was an exchange student for a short period and eventually I had to leave Singapore. The distance has played its role, we hardly talk now but I am still trying hard to not to think of you… I do know it is over; it ended even before it started. But I want you to know that I will come back for a better start  :)

Just wondering, what is the common consensus on "personal space"? By that, I mean the physical distance another person can be from someone of the opposite gender before it's awkward. Recently there's been this female coursemate (I'm a guy) I'm on good terms with but not THAT close to who would lean over to read the notes/documents I'm reading on a device such that we would be shoulder to shoulder, and our faces around 10-15cm away (or less, I didn't dare to turn and look). It happened on many occasions and she does seem very comfortable with staring at the screens for quite a few minutes while maintaining physical contact. To better understand my situation, I tried to adjust her hair when it was caught by something she casually slung over her neck, and she didn't seem to flinch or react. Not sure if that was helpful in confirming anything though. I haven't been able to observe if she does all that with other guys as well so there isn't some form of comparison I can make. Being an evergreen raised in a rather traditional family, with a conservative mindset, all that felt unnatural to me. Maybe I'm just too socially unaware/awkward to evaluate the situation through my dense skull and sleep deprived brain.
-
 
Recently I concluded that some people will only befriend those of the opposite sex whom they are attracted to and would not mind being sexually intimate :/ 
I suspect some guys befriend because they have an ulterior motive of making the girl fall in love with him one day and if this does not work out the next best thing they can do is to be her friend. Just confused now as to whether the male-female friendships I see are even genuine and doubt my guy friends.
I feel like I'm overreacting if its such a normal thing but makes me worry and feel sad should I become attached in the future if my boyfriend is very close to his female friends because of possible past feelings and flirtations. 
However I suppose since I'm still evergreen and have been considering a relationship I need to find more male "friends". I can see that it is necessary to keep meeting many people who would be my options but deep down I wish I would just meet my first boyfriend soon and he would be the one so I would not have to flirt around, it makes me uncomfortable probably due to my quiet nature :'(

I was with my PHD friend and till now he was still unable to find a work, so to me I think "Is education everything to me" when I was young till now I was rank on the few top in cohort. But realize I was still inexperience at working compared to those who started worked in their younger days like a diploma. I find myself totally a useless, only know study but cannot work. What can I do?

Why do people have fwbs? My partner has had one in the past and it's something I can't seem to get off my mind.

For as long as I can remember having friends, I can remember nobody being really excited or happy to meet me. It's the same regardless of whether it's a one-to-one meet up or group meet ups. Sometimes in the group meet ups I wonder why I'm even there, because I speak maybe only 1% of the time. My opinion is usually moot when it comes to meal or movie choices.

For groups of friends who haven't met in a long time, I'd be the one who proposes a date and venue and initiate the whole idea, but usually I'll be the one who gets spoken to the least and nobody seems to really care when I say something related to their current topic..

I'm single and friends are the only social life I have. But despite this, there's nobody that I talk to frequently and I think even if an accident or mishap happened to me, nobody would know, much less care..

I'm not very talkative or outgoing. 
I'm not good-looking or interesting. 
I'm just as average as average can get. I don't see anything changing in my years ahead, because I don't know how to and I don't think I can face the failure if I tried and nothing worked.
-
 
Girls do go for looks as much as guys do. You don't get to know a person without even a single date materialising.

While there are many others here desperately wanting to experience a relationship, here i am, feeling jaded from all the relationships i've had, feeling jaded from the relationship i'm currently in. I feel nothing regards to love and romance stirs me like it used to anymore. When i see people gushing over sweet marriage proposals, i feel nothing. When i see people post happy photos of them with their significant other, i feel slightly cynical and empty. 

I have no idea when I started feeling this way. Maybe it was when my latest ex whom I loved so deeply, shattered my beliefs of love when he chose to walk away. Maybe it was when i noticed that my current bf has been giving up on the relationship. Maybe it was when I started to give up on myself, give up on the fact that I'm actually capable of loving someone right and in receiving love.

The guy I like is currently overseas on exchange. We chat over Whatsapp everyday. A few days ago, he got really drunk and drunk dialled me. We just talked about random things. Since we're in different countries, he couldn't possibly be phoning me for a booty call, so, what are the reasons for drunk dialling someone? Guys, would you drunk dial a girl you do not like "that way"? 
-
 
 Holy shit I thought I was the only one. I spend insane amounts of time stalking my eye candies as well! And my grades are suffering because of that too. 

However I am a little bit guilty as I am currently in a relationship right now. Although I feel that we are quite connected on an emotional level, the physical connection isn't quite there.. Is it weird for me to prefer fantasizing over photos of guys than to have sex with my bf? Could use some advice too here.
-
 
I wish everyone here asking for advice because their crush takes too long to reply, or gives one-word replies to their messages would read this article: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7936736

He/she just isn't all that interested in you. Move on.

In the early days of 2014, I met you at Mink. We started dating and I gradually fell for you. You were different. You stood out from the crowd. You were beautiful and smart. Guys wanted to be with you, girls wanted to be you. 

We would have worked out but for my inherent insecurities. I was an ordinary boy and you were the popular girl, the one that won the hearts of many pageant guys alike. Despite your evident effort, I couldn't believe that you were serious. I'm sorry that I did not give us a shot because of my fear. My fear of you realizing how out of my league you are. 

Now that you have graduated (and attached), I hope that you'll live a good life and marry well. I love you, I always had. Take care

To: 

Sorry for bringing up the whole nice guy/bad boy debate again, but I just had to say this. There are plenty of girls who go for nice guys. At least 80% of my single female friends look for good traits in a guy. And from personal experience, one particular guy caught my eye because he was a perfect gentleman. Not gonna elaborate further on the details so I dont make myself obvious, but I cannot emphasise this any more, MANY girls look for nice guys. 

P.S I'm starting to doubt your definition of a nice guy. If your idea of a nice guy is the kind of guy who stays in a corner and never talks, never makes any effort to socialise, then that might be the reason. That, or you had a bad experience that threw all the girls in the world into your stereotype of 'mean bitches'. There are plenty of popular, good looking guys that classify as 'nice guys' too. Not saying that girls go for looks (honestly I think guys value looks more than girls in their partner), but I just wanted to address that.
-
 
Basically there are four types of girls:
1) Fuck no- the fat, short and ugly looking ones 
2) Not really- the plain Jane who doesn't really maintain her shape but better looking relative to the ugly girl, but below average nonetheless
3) Yes- the average to a little above average looking ones 
4) Fuck Yes- the gorgeous/cute/sexy/fit ones 

On the other hand, there are also four kinds of guys:
1) Fuck no- the socially awkward, fat and ugly looking ones 
2) Not really- the average looking but college wallflower kind 
3) Yes- the fashionable, tall, sociable, above average looking ones 
4) Fuck Yes- Rich, good looking, smart, charismatic kind

Personally, I think I'm between a 2 and a 3. Most of us singletons are probably in this region in the dating world. Therefore, do things to improve yourself. Read more, go to the gym more often, and be kind and bitch less.

Otherwise, your dream girl/ guy will just and will always be a dream

Today I went out with my crush who's studying in NUS whom I knew from secondary school. And my I am really surprised and heartened at how we've somehow both changed so much and matched up on the same wavelength now after not seeing each other for more than a year or so. Knowing that you are single and receptive to dating, and that we have similar ideas about romance, careers and life in general, I really wonder if it's come full circle for me and my crush. 

However, knowing that I am going overseas again to resume uni in a month's time and not knowing when the next time I come back will be, I wonder if I should take the risk and probe further to gauge your responsiveness to me. Seeing how we managed to stretch a 2-hour coffee session to a 5-hour coffee and dinner session in the end, the chemistry I'm feeling between us is something that seems unreal and I'm really hoping it's not just felt on my side only. 

I guess like they say, you might meet the right person with the right circumstances, but if time refuses to cooperate... *frowns*

Its hard to keep up emotionally with a gf who doesnt show any sign of love.
she doesnt initiate hugs or kisses, she doesnt ever tell me she misses me, she practically doesnt show much interest in me. Yet when i talk to her about it, she says she loves me. But her actions just dont match up.

im getting tired. i just wanted a partner to love and be loved. but the latter doesnt seem to be happening.

To single girls out there:
If you have a close guy friend whom you consider to be a great guy, please consider making him your boyfriend! 

I was an undergrad and I am seriously regretting how I let so many great guys friends go by.. Now that I've graduated it's so much more difficult to find a bf out there in the workplace.

Walked around student life fair just now and was overwhelmed! I wished there were clearer signs for everything, I almost missed on 2 entire sections at the back. 

Many things were familiar, not very different from jc. However, I was very surprised that there were so many religious groups on campus and it seems so open here in NUS!

Pardon my ignorance & pun, but before coming to nus, I read this page religiously and I thought people were very closed off about such issues. So I was very surprised to see that there is even an interfaith group that encourages such discussions and as I went to snoop around the booths people were generally welcoming even though it was quite obvious that I didn't share their religion. 

Happy that I braved the crowds to discover this side of NUS. 

-
 
Though there's no 'end' to the conversation with the guy (I kinda like) that I'm texting, he'd take a long time to reply (around one to three replies on average per day from him). 

Sometimes I reply when his Whatsapp status is online, but it'd still take a few hours or until next day before I get a response. (You may say maybe he wasn't in an appropriate situation to reply - ok)

I know for a fact that he's quite active on Whatsapp at night. But most of the time, even when I send him my reply in the afternoon I still wouldn't receive a reply until the next day.

I KNOW PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT HE MIGHT BE BUSY. OK. I UNDERSTAND. BUT... I can't help but feel like there's a possibility that he doesn't want to talk to me. His tone doesn't 'sound' that way, but his reply frequency vs online presence on Whatsapp does. 

OPINIONS PLEASE.

I seriously don't understand women at all !!! Since you said that you had no feelings for me and threaten to break all contacts with me if I continue to have feelings for you. Why the hell do you still hug me when I'm trying so hard to forget you. When I hug you back, why did you push me away? Why do you call me "dear" ? Why do you always call me in the middle of the night and start crying for no damn reason? Why did you use my photo as your laptop screen saver? Why you get jealous when I talk to other girls and started messing up my belongings?

Yesterday night, you told me that you have decided to choose me. 
Today, you asked me, "who do you think you are, to me?".  

Quit playing games with my heart, I should have known from the start that you are a nightmare dress like a day dream.

Saw my crush holding her boyfriend's hand

I wish I can disfigure her. If I can't have her, no one else can.

Even if her boyfriend don't ditch her despite her disfigured look, I will still feel better because I can at least say I don't like her anymore. She is so ugly.

The game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say.

The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I'm beat
And to another give my seat
For that's the only painless feat.

The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger...watch it grin, but...

A wise man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied 'oh why ask me?'

I thought I could adapt well but I feel so lonely. I can't click with my friends. Every time I go for outings I feel like shit. TBH I don't really see the point of going for those outings anymore because it really does not help me. Especially for dinner outing, i just feel so awkward. I once hid in the toilet for 30minutes because I have nothing to say and everybody is having their small chats. I feel so safe inside the cubicle watching the minutes go by, hoping I can go home soon. 

The few closer friends whom I feel at ease and can talk crap with are gone. These closer friends that I have are also pretty sociable and have lots of friends and it kind of hurts me thinking that I probably won't mean as much to them as they mean to me. I miss y'all so much. I wish I have a dog so I will feel less lonely. At least I can talk to it. Even tho im a hugely introverted and shy person, this feeling of having no friend here is killing me. 

stay strong:((((....all these fleeting emotions are not here to stay...something good will come along. hopefully..fighting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

squeezing in the D1 bus manages to somehow sexually excite and frustrate me at the same time

Its true. If you are shy and quiet in engineering faculty and do not partake in other activities, chances of girls within the faculty noticing you is close to zero. It appears that guys like us are more noticeable to girls from other faculties cos we hate to hang out and socialise, which is very different from the guys in the supposingly more "outgoing" faculties. 

It feels weird and good at the same time that girls are texting and asking me why am I "absent" from group outing or why am I always alone. The shroud of mysteriousness must be driving them crazy lol. I am just a simple guy. I would rather be alone feeling alone than to be with a group of people feeling alone. 
So engineering guys don't be afraid and there is no need to feel desperate. One day someone will notice the hidden gem that is sitting at the corner of the room!

To . Hi there, I just want to tell you that you're not alone. I have been part of big groups and hall groups and I really hate it sometimes. There are too many hi-bye friends and soon you'll realize, they don't matter at all. To be honest, if you're in a whatsapp chat with a group of friends, sometimes they will only respond to the popular kid. The kid who is more kaopei, more funny or what so ever. I too get rejected sometimes but try to find someone in the group you're close to. If you're close to someone in that group, when you suggest something, at least he or she has got your back! It helps! And if they all really reject you, you can go out with him or her! I personally prefer going on 1-1 dates with my bestfriend to chill and talk about life. Instead of going out with 10-20 people talking about nonsense (when really nobody gives a shit what you're talking about, half the time it is about making fun of the joker of the group). 

And yes, learn to love yourself. We all yearn for some form of connection with people but don't rush it. Perhaps you have not met your true friend yet. In the mean time, enjoy a book by yourself or just hang out at a quiet cafe. It can be really nice. Or you can travel! Discover just how beautiful the world is. Few years down the road, you'll realize that your hi-bye friends don't matter.

Sometimes I feel like my bf doesn't understand why his ex affects me so much. Sometimes I feel that doing it with him was a mistake. Sometimes I can ignore everything and move on with life, sometimes I can't. Help ):

Reading the comments to  makes me feel more uncomfortable than the post itself. 

Not everyone has the luck to find someone willing to convert for you. Find the person first and leave religion to the last. How easy to oversimplify the matter. I'm sorry I tried that and my heart was left in pieces. Religion is still a big part of life for many people and not talking about it doesn't not help.

It sucks that as young adults in this religiously diverse campus we don't have a space for us to speak face to face frankly about religion with people who are not the same as you. Tired of listening to friends who tell me it doesn't matter or to pray on it. :(

As a freshie I feel this whole 'traffic light' thing is ridiculous... why don't we just say single/taken/complicated like normal people do?

I am evergreen (and I really am) and have decided that my island home, Singapore will be my girlfriend from now onwards. I am grateful for her and will always protect her till my very last breath. If anyone criticise me, I wont feel offended but if anyone ever make fun of her, I will come after the person and I will. I feel so comfortable and happy with her around me that I will never ever leave her by my side. (Though I may still go for short holidays and SEP but I will miss her badly and will always have her in my mind). I am proud of her progress over the years and she is definitely proud of my achievements. I still have to thanks her for giving me the many chances to succeed. If anyone were to ask me for my traffic light colour from now onwards, I will definitely tell them I am attached to Singapore and don’t ever think of having me leaving her or taking her away from me. If I were to really ever have a girlfriend, I wish she can understand that I will love Singapore more. Last but not least, I will like to wish all Singaporeans a happy national day. I hope to see Singapore (my home and my girlfriend) continue to prosper and progress in the years ahead. Happy 50th birthday Singapore! You have make us all proud to be called Singaporeans and we are thankful of you giving us equal chances to succeed individually.

To  - I used to be the same way, and in some ways, I still am. My problem was that I had too few friends, friends who hated going out, friends who were in relationships, friends who were busy with CCAs, friends who lived I'm another part of campus, or friends I didn't like at all. I used to get quite lonely sometimes, even breaking down and crying occasionally. Whenever I wanted to do something fun, like go out wherever, my friends would decline, and I want confident enough to go alone.

So what has changed?

Well, me.

You have to realize that you cant control what your friends do. You can control what you do, what you say, how you behave. Most of all, you have to learn to love yourself and enjoy your own company. I'm not going to give suggestions like join a club lor, or be more open etc etc. I'm going to tell you what worked for me.

Whenever I felt lonely, I called up my parents or grandparents. Remember, they're probably much lonelier than you and would be overjoyed if you call and talk to them. It feels nice to know that you're loved and needed by someone.

After you've spoken to them, go out for a walk or a run. Best time for introspection.

Next- if you live on campus, go and chill out at the 24 hour lounges/common rooms/Starbucks. You'll be surrounded by people and that decreases loneliness.

I've been part of such groups before, and I hated the experience. If you don't know a lot of people, you're not part of the inside jokes, you feel left out, whatever. At the end of the day, when they Instagram a group photo and tag you, you'll just have an unpleasant recollection of the meetup ( while others think you probably had an awesome time)

I swear, do not trust social media.

Don't worry, you'll be fine.

I developed a serious crush on my female colleague at work. For a few months, I was literally dreaming every other night about her. I was so smitten with her that I started to do things such as filling up her bottle for her before she arrived at her desk every morning etc. 

I was thinking of ways and means to get closer to her. One day, I was tasked organise a company dinner I asked her for help with the intent of trying to get closer to her. Initially, she didn't decline and was kind enough to help in what I asked. However, as the commitments grew, she started to become uncooperative and extremely annoyed with me. She didn't even want to turn up for the dinner on the day itself even though she told the bosses she was helping me. 

I was so angry with her that I told her the bosses were asking for the namelist of those who would not be attending (which was true). But I did it in a manner that must have made her felt threatened. In any case, she did turn up and did her job during the dinner. But thereafter, she left first, leaving me to pack up everything behind.

The day after, and over the past six months, I gave her the cold shoulder because I was really mad with her.

But as time passed, I know I was the one at fault. I got her to help because I was too selfish to care about her feelings. I asked her to help because I wanted to get close to her. How stupid of me! It was also childish of me to give her the cold shoulder when it was all my fault from the beginning.

I want to apologise to her but I don't know how to do it. I want to say sorry not because I want her forgiveness. I don't deserve it anyway.

I want to do so because she deserves my fullest apologies for the crap she had to go through.

Recently i've been talking to a guy more than he would talk to other girls... It seems to me that he's interested and im actually also interested. However, just about 2 months back, he was sort of amber with one girl but i dont know how it actually proceeded :/ should i still continue giving hints that im interested in him even though im unsure of his traffic light status and that girl? 
-
 
I don't get the whole nice guy/bad boy debate. 

I've been with both. I realised the douche was just too tiring and had too much drama to be with (and i had better things to do with my life). The nice guy was always there for me and was always so encouraging with whatever i do so i accepted him and it's been a great 3 years. 

Idk why girls say nice guy too easy so dont wanna be with them. Easy is good what got more time for your work? And parents also happy to see a nice guy? You all like drama with bf and conflict with parents meh?
-
 
I am afraid to fall in love as I get jealous easily. Whenever I see my crush with another guy in a pictures  on Facebook or just walking around with another guy, I automatically give up on her. I can't bring myself to go after anyone because of this despite various hints from more than a few girls. Am I the only one like this or is there something wrong with me?
-
 
I am afraid of making friends and revealing too much about myself. When I talk, I usually talk about studies, or my family, or just laugh along with the others. This is all due to my fear of embarassing myself in front of others. I remember all the silly mistakes I made in the past, and even if my friends just comment lightly or make a joke, their words are still stuck in my memory. I am sure that they have forgotten everything by now, but those embarassing incidents(regardless of how small), still haunt me.

Thus, I find it really hard to make friends whom I can talk a bit more freely to. Even last sem, I only made new friends because of an old classmate I bumped into, and I managed to enter her clique. This sem, I have a number of modules without them. I hope that someone can approach me when I sit alone during lecture, so that I need not be the one to take the first step.

And to those who are mistaking me for trying to find a partner, sorry, I am just looking for a friend.

I gave you everything.
And yet you left me nothing.

I waited for months to have you.
I have tried my very best to chase you.
But you still slipped through my fingers.

All those sleepless nights thinking about you,
I don't even think they matter anymore.

Oh, why do you have to be so hard to get?
Why do you have to be so hot?

With 200 others chasing after you,
Don't you see you only need one who will treat you seriously?

Please, my love.
How I long to embrace you in my arms.

I'm crazy about you

I will cherish you.
I will love you.

Forever and ever.

I will wait for you.
As long as it gets.

SSA1201: Singapore Society module
I may not have you this semester. 
But I will try again for the next.

It doesn't matter how long and hard it takes to bid for you.
I will give all my bidding points just to have you.

Wait for me.
We will be together.

One day

In my click there is only one Singaporean guy. Lets call him Q. He's okay to be with, a little childish and oversensitive but we all get along.

From time to time he always talked about his army life, going into the field and physical training. It was interesting because as foreigners we don't experience this things. Q would always get very motivated when army topics come up. Once a projectmate had to return to the army in the holidays and felt moody. Q got into an argument with him and it got very bad eg insulting the other person as a sissy and not man enough.

The issue is, recently I got to know another person and turns out that the Q is a common friend. It also turns out that they met in the army, and Q only handles paperwork in the army! Q has always been very nice to me, and I can't imagine our click without him. But I can't believe that he lied to us for so long, and so often! I haven't told the rest but now I can't help but feel a little disgusted when he talks about his army life. Can't see him in the same light as well ugh. Just wanted to rant.

When you fall in love with somebody whom you definitely shouldn't fall in love with, what should you do? Stay single forever? Because I just can't work against my morals to accept someone else when I know I can't put my heart into it.

How do you know what's love? I have been together with my girlfriend for 7 going 8 months now and we are getting into the comfortable phase of the relationship already, bordering on boring even, as we may be starting to take each other for granted... When our relationship started, we didn't even have a honeymoon phase because we were so busy. She is a fantastic girl and almost everything that I wanted. But somehow, the relationship lacks something... Something like passion maybe? I think I love this girl; I can see myself happy with her for the rest of my life, but as of yet I could also see myself moving on. I am not sure exactly how to define love and as we are both about to begin on a new phase of life (we both just graduated), I want to clarify this in case we both get hurt... Can anyone advise me if this is normal and how exactly do we know if we are in love, or if the other party loves us?
-
 
It's been so many months since I've realised that I've been led on by this girl.. I really do not understand why she had to do so.. worse part is that I can't get rid of her from my life as we have have so many mutual friends.. everytime i think of how i got played and led on it reminds of how stupid and humiliated I felt.. 

What can I do feel better? Is it even possible to not bear a grudge against her? I really want to leave this tragedic episode of my life behind and move on with a carefree life but i can't seem to do so.. :(

Oh wait! I actually don't have a girlfriend.

What is with all singaporean girls that want an ang moh bf so bad? It saddens me that people would choose their partner just because of their skin colour? can someone explain why this phenomenon is happening?

In the first few week of my work, there is this guy who is rather small built and average looking (but compared to other guys in my department, he is the worst looking). From what i know, he was engaged to his girlfriend. In the first few weeks of my work, he chat to me a bit. However, as the weeks passed, his chat could extend for more than an hour! My work involves doing experiments and as we know, experiments have waiting times that could be long. During those waiting times, i usually work on an assignment given to me by my supervisor but each time he is inside the office with me, i ended up talking to him instead doing my work. The funny thing was whenever other staff are around, he will not talk to me but soon after they left to do their work, he started talking to me again. His topics are never sexual but I talked to him not because i like talking to him but it is only out of politeness. Since i am intending to return to the same workplace in the future, i do not wish to offend anyone there. Only recently, someone in the neighbouring office left and i took the person's desk because i do not wish to stay in the same office as the guy and end up talking and not doing my work. Even though i am in the other office, i can only minimise my talking time. He still came into my new office and talk to other people there, before turning his attention to me again. When i am doing experiments in lab A, he came out, talk to other people a bit and talked to me even when i am conducting experiments. I initially thought he came out as he had experiements to do but no! He ended up talking to me for a long time. I am starting to feel really annoyed as i wish to focus on my experiments. Finally, when i finished my given tasks for the week, i get to follow my supervisor to lab B to watch him conduct interesting experiments. I am aware that the guy's project do not require any equipments from lab B but he brought his stuff and came here anyway. This time i am suspicious that he came simply because i am now in lab B. Over lunch in the pantry, if given the chance, he would sit at the table i was at and try to talk to me again, even though he could easily have joined other staff there. Each time he sees me chatting to my supervisor about random stuff, he would cut in and put in his opinion so i think he is listening to our conversation all the time. And one more thing i caught him many times looking at me and i do not like the way he look at me...it doesn't seem like the normal looking and was rather fixated which makes me uneasy...

Basically what he did makes me dislike him more and more. I do not understand why he behaved in this manner even though he is engaged. The harsh truth is that because he is not good looking, i know for sure i can never end up liking him whatever he does. Personality wise, i do not think he is good either since he can be easily pek chek when doing his own work. Just wondering what do you guys think about this guy? Why does he behave like that towards me even though he is engaged? Is he being a playboy?

I am a 24yo nerdy virgin and on my way to becoming a wizard, and utterly shy where it comes to boy-girl. I've made it a point to save it only for the one I am in love with, though pre-marital is okay for me though. Yes I know I'm weird. 

Just weeks ago within a span of 4 days, 2 separate female friends, one a long-time i've known since forever and another I've known for only a year, hinted to me that they have needs, one even happened at her place with her exhibiting all the body language. Being a person with excellent self-control where it comes to my facial reactions, I acted blur and just told them to go clubbing and they are bound to score a guy home since clubbing is for NSAs. (gonna offend many social clubbers for this but hey, ask a girl to go out to the dance-floor alone and guys will just swarm around her, if that isn't guys trying for NSA then I don't know what to say)

Looking back, I realize i'm weird. If I were to be a normal guy, I might have at the very least, be turned on. But I actually felt a bit shy in both instances. My guy friends are so so normal, especially those who live in hall that have much more experience. They just RAWR and go all the way. But it seems I don't even have 2 heads at all. My brain rules total dominance, and my second head is like a total blur-cock.

Several concerns:
1. I'm worried that the day where my libido peaks, will my brain rule over my dick? I'm not a believer of "do anything don't get caught".

2. If I have a gf in the future and yet I am still in contact with these friends who actually made advances on me, uhm is this wrong? I honestly think they can be good friends. 

3. At the age of 24, I remain relatively unfazed/cold within these situations. Am I really really that abnormal? 

And the crazy thing is I am single and don't even have a girlfriend yet! Why am I thinking so much....

Le friend: I bought new shorts, blue and red color
Le me: Red? I I think it'll be a little too standout for you eh (given the context here that my friend is a shy guy who wants to blend in with the crowd all the time while Im the crazy girl who wants to stand out)
Le friend: *passive agressive mode on*
Le me: er.... what did I do?
Le friend: Can't you just agree with me
Le me: ....

Dude, firstly I'm just offering an advice right there and had no intention to rebut your comment or question your life decision. Secondly, what do you mean can I just agree with you. We are friends because we all are unique in our own ways and we bring our very best to the friendship to help each other grow. If I can't even keep my originality, my own opinion and voice my thoughts out then I wonder why you even need me here, just go clone yourself. Thirdly, you said "it's just a small thing, just pretend to agree with me also can." Exactly, if it's such as small thing why do you have to take my comment with such strong reaction. Just take it lightly, if you like it then okay, if not leave it outside your ears and move on. 

I'm trying to understand and save this friendship. But it's hard because I can't deal with passive agression. Its not evrn the first time I'm requested to "just agree with me". I'm guessing my friend is facing some insecurities problem. What can I do?

Last month, a girl who was my classmate in secondary school suddenly contacted me via Facebook and said she wanted to meet up with me. We've been Facebook friends for a few years, however never did she once interacted with me until now. This is very understandable as we are just acquainted and not very close. So I felt really odd when she invited me to meet up with her out of the blue. She told me she's trying to catch up with some old friends. Okay, she's quite pretty and hot so I agreed to meet up with her. I mean which guy doesn't want to go out with an attractive girl right?  Just Kidding! I do enjoy meeting up with people for their company. 

So we met up and went to eat at McDonald's. We started rhapsodizing about some of the things our class did back then. However sooner than I expected, the reason for her inviting me out became apparent; she began pitching the benefits of some health supplements and wanted me to join some multi-level marketing program. I told her I may not be interested in doing so and she kept persisting and explaining it'll give me better health and a large passive income blah blah blah... Although I love having both health and wealth, but I really couldn't commit my money, time and effort because I've got other priorities to deal with at that moment. I could sense her energy level fell from 200% to 20% after we ended this conversation while moving back to talk about our secondary school class. 

So after that meet-up session, she would mostly give a one word reply such as "Good" or "K" whenever I send her messages to ask how she is doing. The smiley emoticons she once used are gone!!!! D:

Why do acquaintances only contact you when they have a favor to ask for? Is it really that hard to meet a friend just for the sake of establishing a closer bond or perhaps for the mere fun of it? Besides, this is not the first time some acquaintance called me just to ask for a favor and then disappear until he needs another favor again. Why Why Why WHY???? Are friendships really just based on how much the person can benefit you??

That's why I like my dog best.  That little bugger hangs out with me even though I've got nothing much more to offer him other than a simple friendship :D

I'm a new student entering this year, and I've gone through many orientation camps. SCAMP, SOW, and so on. I'm not the sort of person who  likes these kind of events, but I thought it would be good to force myself out of my comfort zone. 

I'm not sure about the results.

Honestly, I didn't enjoy any of them a lot. I couldn't really connect with any of the people in camp. While everyone else was busy talking to each other and enjoying the games I was just trying not to give up on the camp. Ironically, it made me felt horribly lonely despite being surrounded with so many people.

Is there something wrong with me? Why can't I enjoy these?  I've had to keep putting on a facade through each camp so I don't bring down the mood by letting people know what an awful time I was having. It cuts even deeper when everyone tells me that these orientation events are where people make the friends that last them through their school years, and if everything goes how I want I'm going to be here for over four years. I don't even have any wish to keep contacting my OG; it's not their fault, I just don't feel like I bonded with them in any way. Am I doomed to not make any new friends in NUS? Am I the only one who feels this way? I was really looking forward to finally going back to school to make new friends, but now I can only see a bleak future in front. 

Am I doomed to be friendless for the next few years? Please, I want to hear some thoughts.

 Well I guess he's kinda a writer trying to survive. Don't really think he's a top author (although I read some of his stories and enjoyed some of the topics discussed), hence probably leads to what you see in his fb page (I'm not even sure if it is managed by him personally)

He does reply people though, I wrote an email about his book that I felt was good and he gave me a average length reply.

Hey girls out there, just wanna ask how would you react if your BF revealed to you that he tried out with guys before knowing out but that he has since stopped? (and will remain faithful to you) Will you accept it and move on?

This summer has been really crazy for me. (i'm a guy btw)
Right until exams, have I been this normal, evergreen, student doing normal activities etc, with orientation camps to participate in as a senior, internships to do.

But then there is this deep emptiness inside me, it's like even if I have some many people around me, they will never understand me enough. I just feel so drained and I need some avenue to release.

And there you know it, I just did something crazy and stupid.
I went to hookup with guys online for "funXXX", did everything you could do, use those apps out of curiosity. It was fun, but at the same time, there was this sense of guilt inside me. The people close to me found out and they helped me to quit doing this immediately.

I really thankful I didn't contract anything, but I'm already blemished inside, and I will have this deep dark secret that I will carry to my grave. I just wanna live a normal life, find a wife, get married and raise a family. Yeah, and hopefully, God will give me the strength to resist such temptations.

From the previous posts, seems like girls also fall on a bell curve. Nice, "nice" or good guys, it's time to start making your offerings to the bell curve god. 
-
 
Nice guy bad guy? I say f*** em. At the end of the day, the most genuine and charming individual would get the girl.

If you don't get the girl, lick your wounds and evolve. No one likes a self-loathing, self-proclaimed nice guy.
work out, travel and meet more people. Eventually you're gonna meet someone, if you don't, at least you spent your time doing things you love.

-
 
It's not that I want to be a heartbreaker. It's just that everytime I treat a guy friend like a buddy (I'll say things like dude and bro), idk why they will start to like-like me. I thought I drew a damn obvious line already. And no, I don't see it like an ego-booster. I just don't like that we drift apart due to awkwardness. I just need people to stop having romantic notions about me, and I really don't care to have a boyfriend.
-
 
The fact is, nice guys finish last unless they are really lucky. Anyone who says otherwise isn't a 'nice guy'. Girls only want to date and have sex with bad guys. I know a girl who took so long to decide to go on one date because she said I was too nice to her but meanwhile she had 4 one night stands with guys who eventually treated her badly. Moral of the story. Don't be nice. Girls will only want you when they have had all the fun in the world with other guys and are ready to settle down.

I went for a Christian event recently and met lots of new friends there. I like this activity. However, I am not a Christian and the reason I went there in the first place is for free food :P The friend I met there asked me to join the event next time but I feel a bit guilty. So the problem is: should I go for the event next time?

Wow. I thought I was the only one. I feel very repulsed by her after I cum. For awhile at least. Usually I pretend I am sleepy and wanna nap but she keeps trying to talk to me or tickle me etc. Which makes me feel even more repulsed.

Everytime after i had sex with my girlfriend, i feel uninterested and sick of her. It was a temporal feeling. It is not as though i do not love her, i still do very much in fact. Is this common?

I live with the guilt that I could have done something for my friend that night when he killed himself.

I was partying with my friends that evening and had ignored his call. I needed time to myself and away from his depression that was so exhausting to deal with.

I wish I hadn't ignored his call.

I haven't been able to visit his grave without feeling guilt.

I really wonder what do girls think of nerds? Are there actually girls who like to talk and hang out with nerds/geeks? I don't mean the typical stereotype skinny smelly socially-inadequate neckbeards that are associated with the word nerd, but about the normal guy who is very interested in gaming/anime/technical stuff in general (things that girls are not usually interested in).

I'm asking this because I'm really curious. I consider myself a gaming nerd because I spend a lot of time playing video games. I'm playing at a quite hardcore and competitive level so whenever I'm not playing, I would spend my time on gaming forums/reddit and write guides and participate in theorycrafting myself. Basically I eat, sleep and game. I really have very little knowledge about general entertainment stuff, like what's the latest Taylor Swift song or what movie is hot right now, simply because I don't care so much to read about those stuff. Because of that, I have very few female friends because I would not have a common topic to talk to them to keep them interested. This may sound stupid to you but sometimes I wonder if I would ever find a gf that will accept my hobby. (I don't think it's an addiction because I still do fairly well in school and I am working a part time job, so gaming is not my utmost priority, just a hobby). And I don't think I am socially awkward because I had a gf before in JC (but that was kinda silly high school relationship), and currently I have a girl BFF as well, so it's not the case that I can't talk to girls. I'm just wondering should I try to be a guy that knows lots of stuff to be able to make friends with more girls? Frankly I don't like to do that but I may end up being single.

To my dearest girlfriend

Ever since I met you through Angels' and Mortals

I have fallen in love with you

Fate was kind to me

That with my hardest efforts

I finally won over your heart

But after getting you

I didn't appreciate

The luck I had, 

I didn't cherish you well enough.

Many things have happened between us

And we have gone through

Many months of non-stop quarrellings

Because I didn't treasure you well enough

Last week, we stopped talking.

I knew I'm going to lose you

I vowed to change 

I am sorry

And thanks for forgiving me

I won't disappoint you

Again.

sex isn't evil ppl. casual sex with strangers not withstanding, i dont think sex between long time couples is bad. you know, it has been shown that sexually compatible couples are able to get over problems in all other aspects of life better. in other words, couples who have good sex tend to stay together. before getting married, it is best that couples know everything about one another, so how about knowing with you're sexually compatible?

My boyfriend and I love reading week. Its the time we get to study together in school and then have makeout sessions as breaks at secluded areas in school. Once, we even fell asleep in each others arms for quite a while after a very busy day of 'studying'. 

Who says studying isnt fun.

I've been seeing a guy for about 4 months. Recently, he confessed that sometimes, he wishes he could screw other girls. I got really insecure after that and started mirroring his sentiments. (I had a few fwb prior) We got into an argument and he said that he was 'slightly ashamed' of me cause I wasn't stick thin. (I'm average sized) He said a bunch of other hurtful things and I decided to end things off. However, the next day he wanted me back saying I'm everything he's looking for despite my physical flaw. 

He was the one that made me feel what being loved felt like. He accepted my past and previous bad relationships.

So my question now is whether I should take him back.

Advise needed.

How do I get a girlfriend?Do I start by being friend with them? The problem is whenever I tried to ask a girl for her number, she will assumed that I wanted a more than friendship even if I said that I only want to be friend.
-
 
 I guess he was embarrassed. I lost a close female friend not too long ago and I didn't expect her to pop up in the faculty I was in (we are in different faculties). It was too late on hindsight to 'turn back' and run so I 'glazed my eyes' and walked (I think she saw me too and turned away).

As you mention that you feel that he has treated you poorly, you wouldn't have a problem to say 'hi' to him (and I might say I'm impressed, I probably would have ignored/ranted about it). Maybe he does feel to some extent that he treated you poorly? So he felt awkward to see you. It's not an unexpected reaction I feel. It's your call to decide if you want to ask him about it, cause it seems to me that you don't mind being friends with him

I am a freshie who has a festish for girls wearing tank tops! I am a girl as well but I have a boyfriend... Is this cheating? Im physically not aroused with him but I am slightly aroused whenever I am with other female friends.

To 

I have a boyfriend but I find myself attracted to other femme girls as well. I've been feeling this way for a very long time, and it's just so difficult when you don't know what you want exactly. I love my boyfriend for who he is, but I'm always hoping I'll meet a girl who'll be interested in me. However, it's not easy to find femmes who are interested in only femmes, as most of them gives off a "straight" vibe, thus making it even more difficult to approach them. Sigh.

To the pretty, super intelligent, cheerful girl from CEG, I am so attracted to your personality and looks and have a huge crush on you but dare not ask you out because I have no idea whether you are single, attached or have someone in mind, and we're not so close so it's weird to ask you about your love life :'(
-
 
It has been a long time since i felt this way after breaking up with my ex. It's like every time  he look at me when i talk, he's looking through my soul. Even though i just met him, it felt as though we have known each other for years. He usually give off a vibe whereby it seems as though he prefer to keep people at arm's length but i can tell that behind that tough facade lies a very soft side to him. I am greatly attracted and can't stop thinking about him, about his eyes

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m running out of time
Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like your begging for my help
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was telling
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me

I am a freshie that is going to matriculate this year. I have been to a few camps but i feel really out of place and lonely (yes even during the camp itself). Often, i find myself being very quiet and uncomfortable around my camp mates (which is not myself) i don't know why this is happening. Before this, i am really excited about school but know i am really stress and afraid of what is to come.

I met this guy Z during a senior's precamp in NUS. He's tall and good looking and he knows it himself. Anyway he was hitting on me throughout the entire camp and we were texting everyday after the camp. During the actual camp itself, we were pretty touchy and would sleep beside each other in our seperate sleeping bags. I would consider us to be 'dating' and there definitely was something going on, as confirmed by my other house mates.

However, during the camp itself, he jumped from house to house, hitting on selected female freshies the same way he hit on me. When some of the other senior guys asked him about what he was doing, he insisted that he was just being friendly and that we were not dating. He seemed genuinely clueless about it and even tagged me in an Instagram post at the end of the camp.

Anyway, afew weeks ago he crashed our mutual friend's og at a club and was seen to be behaving intimately with a girl freshie. After that, he went for a NUS ambassador programme where he met another girl (a y2 senior) and started hitting on her. We stopped talking ever since then. He is currently overseas taking multiple photos with two girls that he just met there.

I just needed to get this off my chest and you may think that I am exaggerating but I wish I was. I don't understand how such guys can exist and I chose not to believe the multiple things that people have said about you and deciding to trust you instead but I guess I was deeply mistaken. It's so awkward for me to join in our senior's group outings because Z would be there and I'm not ready to face you just yet. I don't understand how you can see this behaviour as okay when it obviously is not. But now at least I see you for the person you are. This is why you have no close friends Z.

I am really cynical about relationships. Whenever I feel like I like someone I ask myself - Do I really like her (in my case) for who she is, or do I just like who I think she is? Would I love her, 10 years down the road, when all the romance and novelty has worn off? 

I then start to imagine myself in situations of conflict with her. Would I still love her and want to stay with her when she is being totally unreasonable, grumpy, jealous, etc? How about when she insults and humiliates me? How about when she doesn't want to listen to whatever you say, and will not relent until you give in? How about when she does something outright disgusting?

Sounds extreme, sounds like I'm too paranoid or exaggerating. Surely this doesn't happen to everyone right? Surely there is a way to work things out right? But that's what's happening with some couples around me, and even among my relatives. My own parents divorced, and for many years, me and my brothers really suffered emotionally. Got me thinking. The things is, no couple would expect that things will turn ugly. All couples get together thinking that they'll be different, that they'll be able to work things out because they love each other. Most, if not all, divorces started out with hopeful, loving couples making a lifelong oath to love each other. 

None of us know what will happen in future. Your partner may have an affair. Maybe bear a grudge against you for one big mistake you made (forgiveness is easier said than done). Over time, things get ugly. There will definitely be something that you will feel disgusted with about your partner over time. Snide remarks, looks of disgust, those 'tsk' noises she makes when you do something she doesn't like, sarcasm. All these kill marriages, and kill you slowly.

Good for those who can last through that and find a reason to keep loving your partner. The harder thing that is out of your control is whether your partner will do that for you as well. 
-
 
Oh MH...it's true that I don't really know you well now, but we used to know each other so well. And the reason why I don't want to message you is because I'm the one who always initiate it and you always end it off without replying the messages. At least have the decency to offer other time we can talk / meet up rather than leaving it like that.

Today, i was asked this question: "Who are your closest friends and what are the commonalities between you and them?"

As everyone started writing down the names of their friends and the commonalities, i felt so pathetic. I didnt even know who i could consider as my close friends, not to even mention the commonalities. 

Ever since uni started, my group of friends just started to drift apart despite being in the same school. We still meet up as a group occasionally, but its very obvious that we are just not as close as we used to be. I know how this is very normal because everyone finds new friends in uni. But me, i guess i can only blame myself for not socializing much in my first year and not joining camps after. 

I get so envious of people who made so many new friends and their uni life just seems so much more fun than mine. I thought i could try and make more friends without joining any activities, but no, everyone was in cliques/groups, it just didnt seem right for me to butt in suddenly. 

"Friendships" affect me a lot especially because I'm not close to my family. But nowadays, i realize that i dont even know who to approach when i just wanna rant about life. Not gonna lie, i feel really lonely. I've tried making friends online (didnt tell anyone about this in case i get judged for being desperate), but to no avail so i gave up. 

Everyone has at least one person to turn to when they feel down, but i dont. Sometimes i just feel like I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life.

To 

I was reading your post together with a friend. While she, and i think many others who have commented, thought that it would be absolutely stupid of you to even ask such a question of whether to still give him a chance or not (and I like many others, if not everyone, think you should not), i understand why to you it isnt so clear cut and obvious. 

I was from poly and since year one of poly ive been hanging with a group of friends, including this particularly guy. 

Over the years in poly, the guy and i grew closer, closer than we were to the rest of the group and by the end of poly, we were basically together. 

I've been a rather religious person, he knows that, and from even before we got together, i thought that he was too. Hence, i was comfortable getting close to him in the first place because I assumed he woul not make any funny moves on me. 

You know what they say about assuming. 

It started with harmless physical contacts like holding hands, and hugging. I wasnt exactly comfortable at this point as I said, i was rather religious and strict about physical contact with the opposite sex (i should probably add that in my religion, physical contact with the opp sex is a strict No-no. You can probably figure out which religion im in now).  But i didnt express it nor told him. I figured and assumed, again, that he wouldnt cross the line with me. 

One day, in a service elevator, he kissed me on the lips. I was shocked, trying to register what was going on, hence i didnt immediately push him away. By the time i did realise what was happening, we have reached our floor, my floor actually, so i went off. I was late for a meeting hence i could only text him of my anger and disappointment while he walked away.

He said sorry and i was weak and i forgave him. I didnt exactly push him away immediately. If i hadnt wanted it to happen, i would have - i reasoned. I blamed myself.

Some time after that, at a very open and public but rather empty spot, he kissed me again. And for the life of me i do not know why i didnt stop him. Perhaps i was enjoying it myself. That would truly have been nobodys fault. But then he started feeling me up (i was wearing a dress). I really had no idea what he was doing. Because the thought of him fingering me had never crossed my mind AT ALL. In fact, i had no idea people did that (i was still rather young and sheltered). By the time he was fingering me i was confused. I didnt stop him. I didnt really know what was going on, and there was a part of me that felt, well, good. 

 When it was over and i 'came to my senses' i cried. In front of him. Like nobodys business. I thought i had just lost my virginity (does that count as losing ones virginity?). 

He tried to get me to stop crying. Kept telling me its okay. Its okay. We're just kids. We dont know better. Its okay. 

Thinking back about it, i think he was more concerned about me crying in public. There were still some people around. 

Youd think after that episode he wouldnt do it again. And if he did, i would have stopped it.

But he did do it again and i never stopped him. Maybe because in the moment i gave in and simply enjoyed it. But when its over and i tell him to stop and he would say sorry, i always end up blaming myself more than i blame him. Which is probably why i never stopped him while it was happening. I blamed myself. 

I left him a few times. But we have a close group of mutual poly friends we always hang with till now. There were times when we didnt speak to each other for weeks, all of those times because i told him i had enough. But  i always end up falling for his sorries and his promises that he is trying his best to be a better, more religious person. And he is. And so am i. I guess we have too much of a history that i cant seem to let him go. 

But , it seems to me that you dont have any reasons to give him anynmore chances or to not cut ties.  You no longer work there at the mall and im guessing you dont have any mutual friends who are close. Please dont be dumb. Delete that a$*h0*! from your life.

I'm a 27 year old Lesbian, and I've always thought I'm just a lesbian. I figured it out when I was about 13, and since then I've never really been attracted to boys at all. I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really.
I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive.
I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing. Her personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen.
She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through. I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears.
The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened.
I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. There was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that.
We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better.
I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. He was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said "what are you doing" "are you sure, you want this." I told him "please, this is what I want", and then he went with it too.
I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, and that's where the two of us had sex. I wasn't drunk, I wasn't intoxicated on anything, I was fully aware, but I have no idea what came over me. I don't know why I reached out and had sex with this man, my friend, when my whole life I've only been sexually attracted to women.
When we woke up in the morning in bed together, we were both a mess. I feel so fucked up, I don't even know what came over me. I'm not even sexually attracted to him, I don't even find him that attractive or good looking.
I really hate to say this, I'm not sure how to say it, but... from a physical point of view it was incredible. My body felt incredible during the sex, he must certainly have known his way around a woman, because I've never felt that way with a woman before. I still don't know how my mind let my body orgasm repeatedly with him. I've orgasmed with my past female partner many times, even multiple orgasms, but this one felt... much better somehow, more powerful.
I don't know what to say about myself. I actually initiated and had sex with a man. But I'm a lesbian. I have no sexual attraction to men at all, I feel nothing sexually towards men. I have no desire to have a relationship with a man, and I still don't. I still know I'm exclusively attracted only to women.
Then how did this happen? Why did I do this? Am I really a lesbian or am I bisexual? Is it normal to feel this way?

A few months ago, my boss told me to worry about my lunch being taken away by foreigners. Then a few weeks back, he asked me what do I think of the future. I said I am anxious about the future. Then he said he is worried that I have such thoughts.

Can I trust such a boss?

Since we are talking about freshie camps. As a freshie, I never understood what good pageants are for. And even as part of an ocomm, I still didn't understand what significance it holds. 
-
 
To add on to post , if the purpose of freshie camps is to help shy/awkward people interact more with the opposite gender, i think the purpose is defeated because the really shy/awkward people are likely to avoid the camps. For instance, in my case, i would have at least joined a camp because i only genuine interest to make new friends, but never because i wish to get a life partner from there. If only camps have the innocent kinds of activities like picnic at nice places or going theme parks to play, as written by OP of this post, i would definitely join camps. The fact that there seems to be "aggressive" pushing for more girl guy interaction totally turns me off from camps. 

Just wondering am i the only one who wish that those "dirty" games be totally abolised from freshie camps or am i just the minority?

P.s i am an evergreen girl who never desired any interaction with the opposite gender so i don't know if i am the only girl who felt this way, therefore i got turned off by the thoughts of "dirty" games in camps.

I dun know when it started. I had a pretty normal childhood when I was younger. My family ( mum, dad and older sis)  would go out together for dinner and holidays. But thing started to change and I can't exactly remember when. I guess most of my childhood are erased from my memory. 

The last family holiday we had was when I was 10. I'm in my early 20s now. The fights got more frequent and scary. To escape from the terror and noise, I would hide in the room. Every time I heard a long thud, I could only imagine if it was a object thrown across the floor during the fight or if someone had been battered. It scare me to find out but it scare me even more to imagine the worst. 

The fight continue through most of my primary school life till secondary school. Maybe because of my home environment and other couple of things the absence of my father. ( I was closer to my dad) I started to cry for no reason in upper primary. I would cry whenever I did not know how to solve a math problem or just suddenly. At first my classmates were shocked that I was crying. But I because it happen every day they got used to it. I lost friend because they were afraid of me crying 

My grades dropped i was refer to counsellors because I was showing disturbing behavior. 

 I manage to get into a secondary near my house but since my dad was absent a lot from home and I was really close to him there was a hole in my heart and because of that I started getting close to older guys. Looking for the 'brotherly' / 'fatherly' figure that I'm yearning for. 

I'm not sure if it is a psychological thing or not but it is an innate nature for the opposite sex to be attracted to each other so girls will get attract to their dad and boys to their mum.

I engage in a lot of reckless behavior, Created havoc in a government area. My parents were called up. My dad told me to stop behaving the way I was but I didn't know what he meant. I didn't know what I did wrong or not. I didn't know why I did what I did. It may seem absurd to some but I had not idea what was wrong from right. I just did what I felt like doing. 
 and self harm just to make myself feel better because their were times when I felt that I wasn't worth it. I almost got retain in secondary 3 and barely make it to N and O levels. 

I met a very good teacher in upper sec and I started looking for him for help. I join all his lessons which piss of his students. I got insulted for joining his class since I was not his student. that teacher was the 'fatherly' figure that I had been looking for. Not only did he teach well, but he encourage me a lot through my sec school life which makes me look for him. I did quite well in the subject he taught me but I did badly in my other subjects. Home was not a condusive place to study in and I would stay in school for as long as I could just so I did t need to go home. 

I grew more mature and with Christian friends and the right support I manage to make it to poly 

My parents got divorce few years back. and even though it is a good thing somehow I can't help but to admire others with a complete family or how some other family would bring their children out for meals. eventhough I'm living with my dad. It feels like im all alone. Throughout my life since secondary school I had been facing very bad panic attacks when facing crowd and started becoming self conscious and due to some past experience I have an aversion to male friends. I still look up to them but I'm afraid that I would give them the wrong impression.

Having felt the effects of divorce first hand, Im not sure if I'm truly able to have a relationship that will last. Why do people get married only to end up getting a divorce. Recently a few of my couples at my church got married and being  at the age when a couple of your friends are getting married/ having a relationship make you want to be in a relationship too.

 But I'm not just looking for a boyfriend nor a husband but a father to my kid. Someone who is willing to be involve in my kids life. 

Love is not just about yourselves but it is putting others before yourself. 

With all the things that I had face. I want to work with kids. Just like how my teachers and counsellors helped me. But im afraid that I will be reminded of my previous rebellious self and that scares me a lot. 

Cause even though things are slightly better im still struggling a lot with anxiety and school work. I'm close to getting kick out of school since I always have to go for appointments and  I have been doing very badly in school but because of the previous experience in sec 3 I'm afraid of looking for lecturers and feel that im wasting their time somehow. I have been mistaken for being aloof because I dun smile and I have that resting bitch face and there are times when I find it hard to do so. 

To any FASS students out there. Is there any requirements to working with kids other than having a degree in a related field?

It was one of those late nights - the kind when waves of sadness just engulf me like a relentless tsunami. The park was dead silent. I picked up a knife and brought it against the translucency of my wrists. Cool metal met my wrist and I dug deep, tracing the length of the vein. Not thin horizontal lines that brush the surface, but a split that caused blood to gush out. I felt my consciousness slowly slipping away and I was certain that the pain would end soon. 

I roused to find myself surrounded by sanitised white walls with a nagging ache in my bandaged forearm. We both knew what happened, but the doctor still asked out of formality. 

"A freak accident," I said, "I fell and tried to regain balance on an exercise bar, but struck upon something sharp on my inner arm instead." 
"Well. You're lucky to be stitched up in time." 

We both knew that was never the outcome I intended for. 

Fast forward to the present - it's been three years. I still don't know what I'm suffering from; I'm afraid to seek help because I don't want the pity of others. I go about my normal daily activities - school, lectures, tutorials, hall activities, sports - behaving like any other person, but I shut my door only to cry myself to sleep every night. The smallest thing is enough to trigger a breakdown, but I force myself to hold it together until I'm alone. 

A counsellor that I once spoke to told me to surround myself with family and friends that could make me happy. I tried, but it always seemed that if I derive my happiness from interactions with a certain person, it would prove that I am incapable of achieving happiness by myself and that it's solely dependent on another being. In terms of relationships, it's hard to love someone who is so unstable, which is why I never blamed any of them when they chose to leave. However, it seems like there is this one guy who has yet to give up. His sincerity is terribly endearing, and the effort he has placed into developing a better relationship between us goes beyond measure. 

He once said this. 
"You're like a cloud of sadness, but because you're always engulfed in all of those negative emotions, it is so easy to make you happy."
I turned to look at him, confused by what he said.
"Yes, I mean it. The smallest thing is enough to turn your entire day around. Other girls ask for the world, you ask for a pebble." 

This phrase has echoed in my mind ever since. I never thought of it that way, but it made me feel a little better about myself. Perhaps all this sadness made it possible for me to derive happiness from small and simple things. But to you, I'm sorry. You deserve much better than a girl who has a mental disorder that seems almost beyond repair. You're going to keep trying, and I'm only going to keep shutting you out, which only makes this unfair to you. I hope you find your happiness in the everlasting smile of another beautiful girl, and I will continue on my way until the darkness finally overwhelms - when these thoughts are put to rest, lost forever - just like how I have lost myself to them.

Is it normal that on the 4th day of work, your co-workers, most of them still don't know your name?

1st day of work I was the only part timer hence I had to do a lot of things on my own. The full timers were very busy, so I just do what I was told. I survived.
2nd day of work I thought I would grow to like the job because I found 2 girls (out of the 4) who were very nice to me and they would talk/fool around with me. It was a Friday, and we were super busy. Yet I quite like it. But sadly, the 2 friends I acquainted with, that day was their last day of work.
3rd day of work I thought I could try and talk to this girl who asked me to replace her once. But it ended up in a way that she talked to this guy first because she found him familiar and they both started talking and somehow I couldn't include myself into their convo. They were nice tho. Just...
4th day, same thing. There were only two part timers, me and this girl, so I thought maybe I could stick to her and talk to her etc. But the moment she entered the kitchen, she already started chatting with the full timers etc. I tried to be around them, hoping that they would ask me questions like "Oh where are you studying? How old are you" etc. Just any question, and then include me in their convo. But no. They just kept talking about this drama that they got hooked on and yeah.. It was kind of a day where time passed so slowly I wish I could die.

Initially I wanted this current job to be a long term thing. Cos it's actually quite flexible: 2-3 days a week, 330-930pm. As long as when school starts and it doesn't clash with my timetable, I can work part time while studying. But the circumstances now....unless they improve...Idk how to find strength to face each working day.
-
 
 I can empathise with you, however my story is a bit different. I made it into OCS, but OOC-ed after the service term (only lasted 3 months in OCS basically). Most people OOC because of injury. "What a waste of your talent! A bright future cut short by an unfortunate injury", you'd say to these people. Me, however, I had no talent, as was quickly apparent. I OOC-ed because I failed the assessments. And I guess this has been haunting me for some time. Imagine all the people who were proud of you for being selected for OCS - your parents and family, your (then-) girlfriend, your friends... Imagine all the people who had faith that you'd make a good officer - your BMT PC and sergeants, your bunk mates and platoon mates... Now I was nothing but a massive disappointment. The service term training qualified me to eventually be promoted to 3SG, yet, it felt empty because I never earned it the same way my spec peers did by going through SCS. Therefore in the hierarchy of officer-spec-man, I couldn't really fit in anywhere. 
At least as a Man, there are shared 'chiongsua' 'man-mode' experiences. There are less responsibilities and worries. You don't have to constantly prove yourself. I suppose I wouldn't mind having your army experience over mine.
Well there's no happy ending here. Don't have many friends now, been single all throughout uni, never took up any leadership positions, don't even have good grades. Whereas many of my peers who were "only" men are doing very well for themselves now. So army is army, you are only ever a Man again during reservist. But outside of that you can be so much more! :)

Guys, shed a light.

Ever since I got attached my best guy friend completely avoids and ignores me. My other guy friends isn't at all like him.  He would still reply his best guy friend(our common friend) while completely ignores mine when we asked the same question. His best guy friend don't know why he acts like that too. Its been a few months and he was never like that before. Why does a guy has to act like that? Childish?

We had been good buddies for the past 3 years and he never confessed or asked me out alone. It was always a group thing. And I helped him with homework and he teaches me sports. Should I just let the friendship thing behind?
-
 
 I had the exact same situation and feelings as , except that instead of continuing on with SCS, I was immediately sent to be a 'Man' as a medic. I felt inferior and that I was a failure, letting my loved ones down since I was probably so bad at leadership that I couldn't even make the cut to be trained as a sergeant (I failed ALL leadership assessments lolol). 

I guess you can say I was "onz" as I am naturally inclined to listen and follow "orders" from superiors. Yet beyond the ranks and formalities (unavoidable since well, army), as long as you were sincere, friendly and willing to open up, there's a certain level of friendliness that people would show towards you as a person. Especially if you didn't hold a high rank. Being a 'man', I personally felt it was easier for me to connect with others.

Even towards sergeants and officers, I was on friendly bro terms with many of them; talking about random stuff here and there before we got down to doing serious work stuff. At times I even used the term "Sir" to poke fun of them, considering how it felt like we were on the same level even with that wide gap in rank.

That aside, army stuff is only relevant when you're in the army. I wasn't a commander back then and I no longer regret it. I thoroughly enjoyed my remaining year in my unit even as a 'Man', interacting with whoever I could and talking cock to kill time. Talking to commanders made me realise we aren't all that different. You see some of them as introverts, shy, wayang, arrogant etc; nobody is perfect. 

I myself feel I'm a leader in my own way within my social circles. I made used of whatever social skills I picked up in army (I was extremely awkward/quiet so I decided to force myself to open up) to make friends in uni. If you want avenues to practise leadership skills, you can join hall/CCAs and run as an exco member. Sure it'll take a while, everybody makes mistakes. But seriously, don't let your army experience hold you back. There's a reason everybody can't wait for the day to shout "ORD LOH" and move on to the next chapter of life.

tl;dr You don't need arrows or a chocolate bar to prove your own worth. Just be a leader in your own way, learn from your mistakes and move on with life. It's more fun that way :).

Just for discussion purpose: will guys be afraid to date girls who are ambitious and have bigger dreams than they do? 
-
 
What would you think of a potential partner if he/she isn't evergreen anymore? Just curious. Is somebody's past a big deal, and would it factor into future relationships?
-
 
Has anyone ever agree to exchange number with random stranger that strike up a friendly conversation with you? (Because that person claim to not have facebook, kakaotalk, line etc.) And if the stranger ask to meet up after a few friendly conversations over text messages with him, should you agree to meet up with him?  Thank you for the advice and reply in advance! 
-
 
I am quite interested in this guy who is attached. I would always make it seem like I friendzoned him but actually I just want him to feel comfortable with me as a friend. But things are getting disappointing when he also friendzoned me (?!?!) I am curious if it is possible for a guy to friendzone a girl... or do they friendzone girls because they are being friendzoned first? Do I also should give up in still thinking that I hv a chance with him..

I'm not a freshman anymore.

In light of the recent LGBT related posts, I'm deciding to give this a shot.

I used to think i'm a straight guy until NS, when I beginning to feel attracted to certain type of guys. I brushed it off initially. As I ended my National Service stint, I worked for a Ad Agency and attended numerous house parties. I realised that I usually ended up hitting off with those who were Transgender as compared to those who were of the opposite gender. In terms of physical attractions, and being emotionally connected to them.

I'm rather confused. I understand that there's an upcoming orientation for LGBT freshman, I was wondering if it would be helpful for me if I joined this event to find out more or at least..try to pin point my sexual preference

Am I .........normal ? Because I prefer having a sexual relationship with a transgender than a female

I'm not someone who's easy to live with. I've never had a relationship that lasted beyond 6 months. I find it really hard to get together with anyone I pursue, and I've only had four girlfriends, and our relationships lasted for 6mth, 7mth, 2mth and 1mth respectively.

Maybe, I'm better off alone. And right now I probably am - the last one pushed me really hard on settling down and kids. I freaked out about all that and I broke up.

But at the same time I really really want to get married, and mainly that's cuz it's the only viable excuse for me to get out of my house. My mom is completely insufferable. There's no way I can move out without also ruining the relationship with my family. the four years I lived in uni, that was a brief and welcome respite, but now i'm back home......

To 
Its the opposite for my case =.= anyway i guess same applies to guys. My bf dislike my male friends especially if I go out with them even though we don't have any body contact nor neither of us flirts with each other. He is constantly worried that I will... meet someone more rich, more handsome, more smart than him and dump him. I don't know where he got the impression I'm someone like that but I think he is describing himself for he say he might leave me if he finds someone better. Dk joking or not also.

Btw his standards of handsome can be different from mine. So maybe you are not uglier than his gf. Once he happened to see me going out with a guy B (guy B has a gf himself, NOT me). His first reaction was he thought he was my brother. After I corrected him he commented he was pretty good looking. I was surprised + laugh and told my bf I will let guy B knows my bf complimented him.

For me, I actually encourage my bf to talk to girls. When he keep telling me he didnt talk to any girls because of his past experience with a controlling ex. The only catch is that he has to tell me if he fall in love with another girl. Then he should gracefully break up with me. I cannot stand two-timers. And its okay to fall in love with someone else. But please don't compare her with me. It's like I'm an item and not a special living girl that you have once loved. Ya haha. Hope that day will never happen.

I post on social media quite a lot. So much, it's actually... Noise. I lose friends on social media more often than not, because of my emotional outbursts, noise-making, etc.. I actually do monitor  the number of friends I have on social media. 

I'm one of those people, whom others come by with the opinion of "hey,there's something wrong with this guy, he's weird, he's irrelevant to me, I don't think I will keep him around any more, I don't think I would want to even be any where near him." I am very aware of it, much, much more than you actually think. 

How so? I actually do review what I post, and think about it,censor it, the next day. 

Now, why would I do that? I can't say this out loud, and most people who have seen me around might have already figured out (or not) by now, that I am very, very lonely. Having problems talking to others, face-to-face, is not helping either. Perhaps, posting noisily on fb was an outlet to generate some faux presence of company to let me think that I am not alone.

Though thank goodness, I do have a single good friend who is patient enough to withstand and see through my behaviour. I don't intend to lose her.

You know what? Forget social media. I think there's a life outside the net that I should be living. 

At least, I hope the sun will be welcoming as it was, many times when I stepped out of the net. 

Well, that's a lot of "I"s, but someday, it will not be about "I" or "me" anymore. I only need a listening ear,so thanks for listening.
-
 
I told a girl(that told me she is busy and isn't looking for a r/s) that i am interested in her but would like to know her more before jumping in further. She didn't reply me anymore too. Why do girls generally ignore a person when they know that the person is interested in them and they have no interest?
-
 
I've never been good at handling relationships. No matter how much effort i put into developing my friendships or relationship, everyone eventually walks out on me. 

It feels so lonely and hollow to be me. All i've ever wanted was to be the best buddy/bf to those close to me. But, I've always just been treated as a puppet - doing only things that others expect of me, saying only things that others want to hear. Failure to do so makes me a defective puppet, easily thrown away and replaced with another.

I really do not understand what im doing wrong. I've been tolerating the fact that most of my efforts i invest is not returned in the slightest - so long as i know that i still have friends around me. But despite all the giving without receiving, it doesnt seem to be enough for anyone. They all still fade away eventually. 

I've got nothing to my name. im not rich, im not smart, im not good looking and i dont have a ripped body to show. All i have is my honesty, and my loyalty. but i guess such things are no longer valued in this day and age..
-
 

I know how you feel. I have absolutely no interest in any of the things you listed out in your post either (I don't know any of the popular English or Chinese Pop songs or either; the only songs I listen to are Anisongs), and none of my friends in NUS share the same interests as me. However, do not restrict the topic of discussion with your peers to just interests alone!  When are your friends are in their own world talking about things that seem alien to you, just listen quietly, or you can even introduce to them what your interests are.
PS. I tried introducing my friends to some Anime, Manga or games like Kancolle, but it didn't work out very well =( But that doesn't stop me from interacting and getting along with them!

Just wanted to add my two cents worth to 's post. Couldn't agree more that there exists a lot more room for improvement in terms of how we perceive and subsequently, choose to interact with people of different racial backgrounds than we are from. I'm disappointed with how some of my friends' have chosen to respond to (friendly and polite) requests they received from joining NUS Chopsticks to hang out and make friends with the requester. Once they discovered that the requester was of a different race as them. Even going as far as to post the request in the group chat and saying 'I might entertain him longer' if the requester was of the same race. The guy was already upfront saying he was cool even if it didn't work out. What is wrong with just making friends? Why even bother joining Chopsticks then? 

This is none of my business, but I do feel sorry for the poor requester. 

Ending on a random muse, children from inter-racial marriages do tend to be better-looking though. Pity that this friend was too far off from considering that option ;)

Just saw . I'm a little disappointed in the NUS community. A bit ironic since I am myself remaining anonymous but when OP had the courage to reveal themselves I think the response was a bit unfriendly. You guys are entertaining confession about cheating, crushes and useless stuffs and worse of all the guy with the poo fetish. Disgusting, man! But you got problem with someone who got a acadamic concern. Ok wrong place, but what more great important thing are you all doing with your time? NUSMods can go reply to helpfully state the rules, but cannot answer the OP. And everyone as though they are sheep went and like that comment. Singaporeans really love their rules, even in facebook. 
Nobody seems amazed that for the first time really a confesser went and revealed their identity. Only happy to state the rules. 
Oh well at least this confession remind me to go start planning my mods.

I am the guy with the girls' shit fetish in . Firstly, thank you all, I expected to be condemned yet again, but instead I found understanding. Especially Nuo Ning, Hillary, and Darryl, really thank you for the effort to undrstand. 

I guess I will elaborate further so everyone will understand a little more and won't be so quick to judge. Since young I already was adverse to all kinds of dirty things. Mud, sand, feet, farts, dirt etc., even I was disgusted by my own shit. Since I was always scolded that being dirty was unbecoming, I grew to become an absolute clean freak.

I think as I grew up I totally switched to the other side. All till one day during sec sch class chalet, one of my female classmates pranked me by farting on my face while I was half-asleep. I pretended to still be asleep as they laughed, but I couldn't resist getting turned on. The smell was so disgusting, as if something died in her bowels. For a girl to be that dirty, I thought it all to be so wrong, yet so right! Especially since during those years, most guys probably have the illusion that girls fart rainbows and don't poop.

Fast forward to this year's ocip when I found my female friend's poop half-flushed. I thought of simply ignoring it, but when I saw the speck of undigested red chilli skin from the veggies we ate 2 days before, and imagined how a small girl can produce something so nasty from her butt, I lost it. In effect I had cheated on my gf with two other girl...s' shit. Its really as wtf as it sounds :(

From a clean freak, I seem to have changed 180 and become totally fine with being dirty and all, but perhaps too much. They always say when you love someone, you wouldn't mind their dirty side. Like when my ex vomitted on me when she was sick, I was totally cool. 

So thanks all for trying to understand a little, I really appreciate it. For a rather well-liked guy to be hiding this from all his friends, it seems a little wrong. But I really do hope to find an awesome girl who doesnt mind, or is even into, this weird fetish of mine. To my ex, I'm really sorry I grossed you out and caused you hurt, but please move on and find a better guy.

Shout out to all the people on Tinder.

My last Tinder match was on 18th June. It has been 18 days without a match. Since Tinder now has a cap on number of swipes per day (I think it's around 24 "right" swipes), i have been rejected by approximately 432 women. Of course this assumes that my profile is viewed by 24 different unique ladies per day.

So my question is, what has been your longest Tinder dry spell?

I have always try to get in touch with everyone in my orientation groups and part time jobs but after a few months of going out and chatting with them, everyone seems to be drifting apart. I have also lost touch with my secondary school, jc and army friends but I still continue to meet new friends in my workplace and my project work. Is it true that friends come and go throughout our life?
-
 
I'm enrolling this year and never felt the need to attend any sort of orientation camp/activity. Being an introvert, I've attended several compulsory orientation activities from secondary school and JC, only to find myself not enjoying them because I was forced to play silly games and do silly, embarassing things in the spirit of bonding. But the sense of camaradarie that orientation was supposed to inculcate turned out to be skin-deep. Instead, cliques start to form. The shy ones, being outshone by their more outgoing and good-looking counterparts, become more insecure. Everyone knows a bit about one another but not a lot, in fact just enough for judgements to be passed and gossips to thrive.

My point is, as an introvert I've had enough of orientation activities. Recently I've read plenty of posts from people like me who took part in the recent orientation camps/activities by choice, only to find themselves blending into the crowd, not enjoying themselves, or becoming sufferers of camp politics. Allow me to advise these people to rethink the purpose of attending orientation, and if it offers too little returns for the shit you're going through, it's okay to leave the camp, go back home, have a shower and snuggle in bed with a good book. Introverts do need time to recharge, and 3, 4 days of non-stop socialising will obviously take a huge mental toll on us. It is perfectly fine to take a break, or to avoid these extra social activities altogether.

Personally I think making acquaintances is overrated, would rather have a few close friends than a vast network of acquaintances whom I exchange fleeting hi's and bye's with, and who only contact me when they need me and vice versa. It is also okay to lag behind in assimilating to Uni life. We will all catch up eventually, no need to be kancheong. It is perfectly fine to go through Uni as a loner. It is true that the outgoing, vocal ones are highly influential, but there's no need to give in to societal pressures. Just be comfortable with who you are. You can be self-sufficient. While love is a wonderful thing, there is no need to actively search for your other half too. Personally I prefer leaving love to fate, and if I'm fated to be evergreen, I accept the freedom of my singlehood with open arms.

TLDR; If you're struggling through orientation activities, there is no need to keep yourself there for the sake of marginal returns. Look at the bigger picture, consider keeping your happiness and sanity intact. Things will still work out fine without attending these activities.

Male freshie here. I have a crush on one of the fake freshies from camp. His words to me are always laced with double entendres. There was some physical contact from him under the pretence of a joke. I believe we share a similar sense of humour, hence he is comfortable with cracking subtle jokes with me. Or, is this a sign that the interest is mutual? I'm not sure how to go about asking him out, is he waiting for me to make a move? Not sure how to chat him up in the future since he is graduating soon.

To , Was in the same situation, with 2.3k/mth, all the quarrel at home plus dad who is ill (high blood, high cholesterol, diabetes).
Took some burden off by not taking allowance - taking on tuition assignments, and if you had saved enough from army, you can possibly do less. Also, having a group of understanding friends who doesnt force me to spend more than I could really helped.
After graduation I worked really hard and finished paying off my loan within 2 years. Paying $1k/month was no joke either, but I survived.

Of course, I envy my friends who can spend $500 without batting an eyelid and travel to far and expensive places back then. But now looking back, I am glad for this experience. I am spending and travelling now, but saving alot more since my experience had "trained" me to be conscious of how I am doing the spending. And now I am much better at saving than most of my friends.i

As someone who also passed this phase, I want to tell you that there would be many times you feel like giving up. Uni fees and expenditure is a whole different level from JC, and juggling part time + studies is really bad. Make sure you have "me-time" to keep your sanity, make some supportive friends and also learn to become understanding towards others.

It would also be hard for your friends to understand at first - Dont expect people to simply understand what they had never experienced and what you never explained. 
They might say that you are skipping outings because you dont care about them, and yes, it would be really hurtful. If you want true friends, you need to open up and explain your situation to them first. If they choose a cheaper restaurant so that you can join, be thankful and go along, show them that you appreciate what they are doing. 
Dont expect them to always compromise too - they might still want to try their expensive cafe.

A girl in my cohort caught my eye. However, I always feel like she is out of my league. She is very smart and well to do, yet not proud, and above average in terms of looks. However, given her family background, I am not sure if they would accept someone like me as I believe I am unable to match up to her in the above mentioned aspects.  Just curious, to girls out there, what do you think of guys who might not 'match up' to you? Is it important for family background to be similar? Any guys managed to overcome such barriers successfully?
-
 
So I just graduated, and am missing undergraduate life already. However, one thing that I have learnt from NUS is that female friendships are usually superficial, but male friends last -almost- forever. Cheers to all my bros out there :)
-
 
Since everyone is sharing their life stories, I thought I'd share mine. This is something not many of my friends know, probably only my boyfriend and my clique in JC. My family (consisting of myself, 2 brothers and my parents) were involved in a car crash while driving up to Malaysia. By some stroke of luck, I survived while the rest of my family did not. (it was also due to the fact that I was sitting in the last row of our 7 seater car). For a very long time I wanted to die as well, since I had lost basically everything that mattered to me.

This happened during my JC2 year and I was deep in depression, while still maintaining an outer facade of happy faces to my teachers and schoolmates. I only ever break down at home. It was a miracle that I managed to get into FASS here in NUS. 

After As, while most of my peers were drinking/clubbing/working, I was emptying out my house that was still filled with my family's things - clothes, books, day to day items, because I was moving to stay with my grandmother in Upper Thompson. I sincerely wish that none of you will ever have to face this alone. It took afew months but I finally settled in around July last year, just in time for school so I did not have the opportunity to join any camps whatsoever.

I'm not poor as compared to all the stories that are shared here, as my parents had prepared for such an occurrence in their will and I am forever grateful to them for that. However, I do not splurge either and think twice about things like starbucks that may seem like a normal good to some but a luxury good to me. 

It's not easy having to partition money to endure that I have enough money for the rest of my uni life as well as supporting my grandma should anything happen to her. So yes, to everyone living life on the "easy mode", please think twice before making a judgement on why people can't club/spend money on alcohol or even things you consider basic or a "given right" like camps and Starbucks.

Treasure your family. Don't wait till they're gone.

My problem is opposite of others.

While others doesn't have the gut to confess to their crush that he like her, my problem is the opposite.

Everytime I chat with a girl, she will assume that I like her.

Ever since my breakup one hear ago, I just can't seem to find a purpose in life any longer. Everything just doesn't seem to matter any longer. Some of my closer friends sensed my void but I pushed them away, telling them that I'm just carefree. I've tried to take my mind off by taking up activities and joining a club, earning quite a few good friends and achievements in the process. 

However when I look up into the vast dark sky, spotting the occasional blinking stars, I can't help but feel the sense of void that still exists, deep within my smiling front.

Re 

Hi guys, thanks for giving me advice on what to do. But one thing is that, after summer school, the people who attended the program would meet up to catch up with one another. I went for the first meet up, thinking that I would see him around but he didn't turn up. Girl Y initially said she would turn up but she didn't (I'm not sure if Guy A chose not to go because of this or what). From what my friend told me, Guy A said that Girl Y was sick so she couldn't come. This made me realise how he did try to keep in contact with her after summer school. Another funny thing is, I never knew that friend of mine talks to Guy A privately on whatsapp. This is where things get complicated because Idk why he seems to keep in contact with a lot of people privately but none of them is me? In addition during thay meet up, he asked my friend to take candid pictures of me (I have no idea why??) and then when my friend sent the picture to him, he went "Wah Chio". (Tbh I dont't know if he's joking or..) 

He's giving out mixed signals. I'm not sure if I should really confess
-
 
 I really hope that I can meet out with him but I am shy about it. If I follow him on IG, both of us will feel awkward -.-This Sunday there is Sundown and I am very sure that he will be running but I am not sure which distance he is running and even if I know, how can I find him :( I am running 21km so I wish that I can see him somewhere. 

Ps: I will be waiting at the finishing line for you...

Evergreen noob relationship question here -- how does a guy know when he needs to exhibit persistence and determination, and when he needs to stop doing things that the girl would perceive as annoying, when things aren't going that smoothly in his attempts to chase a girl? Am asking because apparently there is this female behavior called 'playing hard to get' which seems to suggest that persistence is required, but on the other hand the guy also doesn't want to be a persistent annoyance.  
-
 
 What about from a girl's perspective? How do you know if the guy is considering the "outing" as a date?

I've gave my best effort but still failed my Final year project, for that I'll have to retake the entire semester 2 next year and thus delayed graduation. Before even the results came out, I secured myself a well paying job. Turns out life likes to set you back a little when everything was going as planned. I mean, everything that I planned for has gone smoothly my entire life. 

After feeling bitter about it for the past month, today my boss offered me advices and contacts for my project research. The company is alright for me to take a break to complete my studies. 

Life may not go as planned but it made me realized just how nice the people around me are. I thankful for everything thus far, and next semester, I will try even harder. We may fall down sometimes, but don't ever give up.

Y cant non nus or non uni peeps stay out of commenting here. Some of them sound so despo. Clearly trying to get some uni girls

I hold high respect for people who can tolerate and suffer in silence when they get backstabbed, get used by their friends, get talked about behind their back etc.

If people treat me like shit, I will treat them back like shit.

I mean, you deserve it.

At least from my point of view.

I am attached but recently another girl which is my friend confess that she has feelings for me. However, I don't see any future between us. How should I reject without hurting anyone's feelings.
-
 
My crush and close guy friend of close to four years is practically using me to get together with another friend of mine. I feel so broken and hurt inside. And the fascinating thing is that she's attached but still ever ready and willing to flirt with him just because he's cute and lusting after her.

So tired of super skinny girls who have figures like sticks or are just nice muscular and toned being all like OHMYGODDD IM SO FATTTTT how am I supposed to eat dessert I'm going to become obese. I've been overweight all my life and I'm constantly battling terrible body image issues. It makes us wonder how you really see us, as fat, ugly people? It's also made me incredibly uncomfortable to eat in front of these people to the end that I've resorted to eating in toilets during lunch in Uni especially because it's so hard to keep friends. I wish you'd know how it feels. I wish you'd know how to treasure your bodies too.

I like this girl.. but how do i ask her out for a proper date? We have gone out alone before alr.. but we never considered that a date.. so how do i ask her for a date..
-
 
To  What kind of "semi-confessions" did you make?Evergreen = no relationship experience. Chances are that the girl isn't sure how to interpret your advances. What seems to you as an obvious display of interest might come across as normal friendly behaviour to a girl who hasn't been in the dating game. It will take courage, but why not confess once and for all and see what happens next? 

Speaking from my own experience-when I first met my gf, she was evergreen. I tried hinting my interest but she didn't dare to think of the possibility that I liked her that way, simply because her hopes had been dashed before and she thought I was just being friendly. I had to take the initiative to text her first and eventually I was the one who asked her out first too. In the end I simply said I wanted to be her boyfriend but I was fine with waiting & getting to know each other better if she still wasn't sure. Now we're together and I'm glad I decided to be truthful.

So many opportunities pass us by cos we are afraid of taking the risk and wearing our hearts on our sleeves. Take my advice with a pinch of salt (sorry in advance if you get rejected/heartbroken ah), but sometimes being honest and sincere about our intentions can open up new beginnings. Enough with the ambiguous mind games and "push & pull".

Hello guys. I'm not very good with expressing myself, but please advise me because I really have nobody to turn to. I think I've an extremely low self esteem issue problem that's gonna grow serious and I hope I could get advices how to make myself feel more positive before I fall into depression (I can feel it coming.)

In the recent months, I find myself crying after every dance classes I attend. There have been a number of nights too when my tears would flow out all of the sudden before I sleep. I'm one of the lousiest dancer in my CCA. I'm always the only one asking the dumbest questions in dance classes because it seemed that everyone could execute the step except me. And it's not like I'm a new dancer; I've been dancing for 7 years and I recently switched my dance genre to hiphop about a year ago. The pressure to dance better is weighing on me so terribly and I could feel even my instructor wondering why the hell am I trying so hard in something I absolutely have no talent with. But I love dance, I like to move my body, play with the music and all. But these feelings of low self esteem is playing so hard on me so I thought I could get some advices how to handle these emotional issues? I am starting to hate myself a lot.

I hope nobody will tell me to talk to someone else about my feelings because I don't have any close friends now. They have driven me away because I've emotional issues. They get so tired and sick of them that most hate me a lot... Yup. Besides those, I know there've been nasty rumors in schools about me too. It's very weird to share my low self esteem issues with my family... Come to think of it, the main reasons why I want to dance besides liking to move and all is because I want to prove myself that I'm actually capable of something in my life, as well as to show my haters that I'm not that invaluable and 讨人厌。

I guess what makes me more sad is the fact that my other dance mates are better than me so much even though they don't take outside classes and they rarely practice. Whenever they see me, they go "hey! You confirm damn zai one right now everyday go take outside classes!!!" But no, when we start dancing together the disparity is still there, and there I go again - feeling terrible and alone.

I practiced and practiced, only to find myself demoralized every single time and wonder how can such a lousy person exists. It's ok if a lot of people hate me and my studies suck. But why does an activity I put my heart and soul in doesn't turn out well too?

Ok sorry for the extremely long, boring & filled-with-grammatical-errors post, if you read this till the end, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart. So yeah... It'll be great if anyone could advise me on this. How to make myself feel positive. Just anything before I sink into depression.

I refer to the post about men oogling or talking up girls/stand close to girls in heartland or near construction sites or wherever regardless of what the girl is wearing.

My girlfriend lives in a mature heartland and she often complains that she gets a lot of such catcalling, or sometimes strange men following her or sometimes asking her if she has time or where she is going. It seems any form of reply, even "go away", or "not interested" seem to spur them on. Shes quite a timid person so she isn't the type to shrug them off or show the middle finger or stuff like that, she often just walk away quickly and ignore completely and hope they don't follow.  I try to send her back as often as i can but it disturbs me to know that there are times when im not there and "anything can happen".

Ive traveled around and it seems Singapore doesn't have as big a problem as others where the law isn't as protective of women. As a guy these things are totally invisible to us, i used to think girls were paranoid about such concerns until ive heard them first hand, it even happens often on public transport. Having a younger sister and a girlfriend i feel very concerned.

A solution would be to advise them to hold their phones and take or pretend to take pictures of their "stalkers", posting them online if need be to warn other or shame/deter other strange men from doing the same, however i think there would be many "fake cases" and many innocent men would be humiliated for nothing. But honestly I don't care, though its technically not a crime to oogle or stalk or borderline harass, i dont want my female friends and family and loved ones to be constantly fearful for their safety.

A concerned boyfriend.

I'm straight and have been with my girlfriend since our first year in NUS. But she wasn't the first person I fell in love with. In the army, I had a good friend, K. I had just arrived to the unit as a newly minted officer. He, on the other hand, was a sergeant who arrived in a few months before. K was a good person. He was smart and helpful. He was exactly the sort of guy you can count on to do things quickly and effectively. 

Due to our jobs being similar, we teamed together and soon, found ourselves a friend in the other. Although he was to report to me, I've never really given a shit about ranks. I saw everyone I worked with as my equal. Neither I nor them were there by choice. My relationship with K was always very informal. We shared meals, played basketball in the evening and even gymmed together. We knew that we could depend on each other to get out of any shit we may have found ourselves in. 

There was one particular weekend we did duty together. This was six months after my posting in. An alarm had gone off at one of the buildings. It was a 25-minutes walk from HQ. The duty driver was no where to be seen. We had no choice but to run quickly there. After shutting down the alarm, we made our way slowly on foot back to HQ. On the walk back, we bitched about how the driver was absent from duty and how I planned to sign him extra duties for making us run. We talked about work. We teased, elbowed and pushed each other around. At one point, I found myself pushed into a drain. To me, that sort of behaviour was common, especially amongst NSFs. Ask anyone who's been through the NS and no one will raise an eyebrow if they see that kind of behaviour in camp. It was just boys being boys. I saw it as mere playfulness and nothing more than that. 

I guess the playfulness got too much that night. He pushed me against a wall... and kissed me and confessed his feelings for me. Not knowing how to react, I pushed him away and told him to fuck off. We didn't speak the rest of the night and the following week. He tried to make things right, but I kept insisting that we be professionals. I became cold to him. I got easily frustrated when people asked stupid questions. It wasn't so much the stupidity of people that bothered me; rather, it was what happened between K and I. I didn't had anyone to bitch to about work; more than that, I felt like I had lost a friend. I had no one else to blame but myself for I chose to call off the friendship. I played basketball by myself, I worked out alone, I ate alone, I swam alone.

One night, two weeks after the incident, I was at the gym doing weights. I remembered feeling so frustrated that night that I took my anger out on the weights. I didn't know why, but after, I made my way to his bunk where he slept alone and knocked on his door. When he opened it, I went in for a kiss. It took him by surprise. We had sex that night (no penetration though) and spooned till morning. That was the first time ever I had sex. Certainly, I didn't expect it to be with a guy. We got into a relationship; unfortunately, things didn't work out. He broke up with me. He knew I loved him, but he also knew that I wasn't fully in the relationship as he was. I simply couldn't see a future with him. He was right. Despite all that happened between us, I still didn't see myself as gay.  Shortly after ORD, he left for his studies in the UK and we stopped talking altogether, despite being on each other's Facebook.

While out in town with my girlfriend, I saw him. He was back in Singapore for awhile. I introduced the two of them to each other. We talked, briefly, before going separate ways. Later he texted me on Facebook to say that I look happy. I told him that I was. That she (my girlfriend) makes me happy. He was glad for me. I don't look at or feel for other guys the same way I looked and felt for K. Looking back, I did genuinely loved him. K will be the only guy I've ever had feelings for and given my heart to. But now I have this wonderful girl... and I love her. And I won't do things to hurt her. She has all of me now as I do of her. But she will never know about this.

Sorry this is so long... It's just that when I saw him again today, it made me think about the relationship I had with him. Crazy, huh?

After seeing all the stories here about guys liking 2 girls and all.. why cant girls be more open to allow the 2nd girl in? Its like choose me or her.. why not both. Dont need to be so jealous leh

He's not the one for me; yet I decide to give him a chance.

Basically, we have very different personalities. While I'm a serious, pessimistic and future-oriented person, he's an easy going and optimistic guy. While I know what I want to do in the future, he doesn't.. And he's also a very lazy and unromantic guy.

2 years have passed and up till today, after knowing him better and all... My brain still insists on telling me that he's not the right guy, but my heart tells me otherwise. After all it has been 2 years and we have spent so much time together.

I'm not sure if breaking up is the correct option because I'm afraid I'll miss him. But I have tried my best, and him too, to accommodate one another because of our differing personality. I'm really tired of all these & I really hope to find a guy who has a similar personality as me so that everything's more relatable. Can anyone advise me what to do?

My girlfriend of a year is the most wonderful person I've ever met, for I've never encountered anyone who is more beautiful, kind, understanding and caring than she is. However, beneath the veneer of smiles and laughter lies a maelstrom of unparalleled magnitude. She is plagued by a whole host of problems, such as depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety, an eating disorder and severe mood swings. We can be having a great time together, and 2 seconds later, with no warning whatsoever,  she can sink into a state of depression. This has happened more times than I can count, and many a date has been ruined as a result of this. She has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past 3 years and has been hospitalized at least 4 times for malnutrition and attempted suicide. Each time this happens, a little piece of me just dies inside. I love her greatly and desire nothing more than helping her through this rough period, but truth to be told, I am emotionally exhausted. It seems like everything I do in an attempt to get her back on track is for naught. I've been disappointed so many times, be it the ruined dates, the unfulfilled promises made on her part to change and put the pieces of her life back together, and her constant avoidance of food despite acknowledging that doing so is bad for her health. Am I a bad person for not being able to accept her and her emotional baggage unconditionally? Am I in the wrong for not being like the spouse who diligently visits his/her perpetually comatose wife/husband in the hospital everyday for years despite knowing in their heart of hearts that they will probably never wake up, and that they are holding on to nothing but a silver of hope? In marriage it is said that partners should stick with each other in sickness and in health, and while I personally feel that this applies for serious relationships as well, is there a point where enough is enough? Is there such a thing as unconditional love? Or is unconditional love really just love with hidden conditions tacked on afterall? I'm feeling really lost right now. I don't know how to cope with the situation at hand. Please help me.

Disclosure: I am from School of Computing.

Over the past month, I have had 3 'friends' approach me regarding their computer problems. They were good friends in the past, but due to circumstances we drifted apart and went our ways. Well, stuff like that happens all the time. I try to chat them up over Facebook sometimes, but I understand they are busy people - one of them has a full time job, one of them is in Medicine, a demanding course - so I'm not surprised when they give offhand responses or straight out ignore for a day or two.

What frustrates me, though, is that as soon as they needed help they would pester me for it, as though suddenly they have a lot of time to chat (about their computer problems). As soon as I helped them with the problems, the lines went dead again.

I decided we're just acquaintances now. It's not really worth my effort to connect with these people when they see you as their local utility shop. Is there any wonder why IT people tend to stick with their own?

If you've been doing this to an IT person you know, I hope you'll reflect on this.

I've been in a long-term relationship. About 3 years now. But i cant help but feel jealous of friends who are single. 

There is this ability to not have commitment and to meet new people. And man am i so curious about apps like tinder that i can't use without feeling guilty. 

Man. Now i am feeling guilty confessing this too.

Being an evergreen guy for so long, sometimes I was thinking if I should turn to tinder or any other dating site since it is rather convenient ( I am quite desperate actually ) but each time I always want to register, it makes me feel as though I have given up looking for my significant other and have to resort to searching only online as a last resort. It also makes me doubt if it is really that effective? Will the relationship appears fake? Hope to hear some advice.

The groundbreaking news that was (not so surprisingly) relegated to page 32 of today's Straits Times World section makes me feel a nudge deep inside to share this story of mine.

I'm pretty close to my old man, kind of his favorite daughter and always accompanied him for runs and outside makan. It was no different when he was hospitalised with a minor heart attack a couple of months back. There was one afternoon I was alone with him in the room and he was going on cheerfully about the places my ah gong brought him around when he was a boy. 

After a while the conversation changed and he began to reminisce about the fond memories he had of a friend he grew up with from pri school up to uni. All sorts of stuff that ranged from getting caught by the discipline master for drawing on the school walls, accidentally breaking windows while playing soccer and running away, even going fishing in the longkangs and streams near where they lived. In secondary school and his times in NJC, they helped each other get through some tough times like when my dad's rebellious streak got him into a big falling out with grandpa and he stayed at his friend's place for an entire week. Or when they each had their own relationship issues, having each other to lean on through the break-ups. They didn't get enlisted in the same camp for national service but they were pretty much go-to company on most bookouts. Sticking together, they even enrolled for uni in the same dept of business admin course (now the nus biz school). Throughout all this, my dad had this wistful look in his eyes and seemed to be looking at a point infinitely far away.

Out of the blue, I casually mentioned "if you guys are still best pals, how come I've never seen Uncle WK before?" Suddenly he paused and became silent for a while. Then in a hushed tone he told me: "J, I'll tell you something that I've never told anyone before not even your mum". 

He started to recall in vivid detail what happened a couple of months after ord-ing, when they went on a trip to phuket with their mutual bunch of JC friends. One of the nights they were out, all of them ended up in a disco (that's what clubs were called back then). The night ended abruptly when a Caucasian guy repeatedly harassed one of their friends. In her defense, WK got into a major scuffle with the guy, ending up getting cuts on his shoulder, a broken nose and bruises near his eye. It only didn't get any worse because my dad managed to pull the guy off before the management came over. The night ended abruptly and they were bounced out. Back in the hotel room, my dad spent a good while fixing WK up with some first-aid. 

As he was applying the bandages, he said "You know, thanks for taking care of me, all these years I don't know what I'd have done without you around".

To this my dad casually replied "Nah it's nothing, I know you'd have done the same for me likewise without even asking". Being slightly drunk too, he was unaware when WK placed a hand on his thigh until he suddenly leaned in to kiss him. 

My dad was stunned and immediately pulled back. Unable to process what just happened, my dad violently shoved him away before storming out of the room. 

WK trailed him to the beach where my dad was sitting by the water. There was a long moment of silence before my dad demanded to explain what had just happened. 

In a stutter, WK said "I don't know. I guess I've felt something for you all this while and I'm sorry it came out that way. I was just so drunk there I must have lost control and I didn't mean to force that on you"

"So are you telling me you're gay?!"

"No, I mean I don't know. I don't know how to explain this. You're the only guy I've ever felt like this for. And I did really fall in love with Jane and Mei Yuan back then"

"Don't give me this bullshit. I can't believe that you've been pretending to be someone else all this while."

"That's not true! Everything we've gone through is real!"

"Real? Now I don't even know who you are anymore"

"Can we just pretend this didn't happen?"

"Yeah whatever it is, I don't want to talk to you again"

With that my dad headed back to the room and it was pretty much silence between them for the rest of the trip.

For a while my dad avoided him and when it came to uni, things improved but they only met together with mutual friends and it was just never the same between them. They did attend each other's weddings though but it was never more than casual acquaintance. In his own words, my dad said he decided to put up a wall between them. 

"So have you still been keeping in touch with Uncle WK?" I broke the silence that followed.

That's when I realised my dad's eyes were slightly wet.

"No and I wish I had. 2 years ago, one of our friends informed me that he had passed away from heart failure." He paused. "I should have been there."
 
"Hmm yeah well but there was no way you'd have known he was ill." 

"No that's not what I meant, I should have been there for him all these years. Whether or not he was really gay or it was just a spur of the moment.. I never should have abandoned him.. he was the one friend I confided everything in. The one friend who never judged me for whatever I did or how I felt. The one friend who believed in me and all the really stupid dreams I had."
 
And then as the tears flowed, "No one has ever understood me like he did. It's like we instantly clicked all the time."

"Not even mum?"

"No, not even mum."

It was pretty much silence for the rest of my visit.

My dad passed on 3 weeks ago and his story constantly bugs me. I came from a pretty liberal all-girls school here before NUS but it just struck me how in our 'first-world' country and several others in the world, we are still pretty unaccepting of people who don't stick closely to the stereotypes set out by society when it comes to love and relationships. Sure, things might be slowly getting better here but it's still very much a two dimensional affair when we talk or joke casually about relationships and sexuality.. the real stuff's all hush-hush behind doors. 

The thing is no two people are the same and that's what should be beautiful about life. This isn't even about the whole brouhaha over LGBT rights or religion. It's about how we can't and shouldn't box the way we form connections with every one of our fellow human beings out there in the world. I'm lucky to have a life partner for about 3 years and yes he's also my boy who I hope to walk down the aisle with (we're both graduating (; ). But I wouldn't have a moment's hesitation sharing my life with another girl if I really found her to be my soulmate (and yes, it's really amazing how he understands that too)

I hope that when we've reached our parents age having growing kids of our own studying and working, that they won't be judged for who they choose or choose not to fall in love or even lust over. That Singapore would truly be a place they can call Home.

. Hmmm I did spoke to him in person personally and he seemed interested in knowing more about my hobbies etc as well. He also approached me to talk while I was waiting for my bus. However as we were from different departments, we didn't really get a lot of chances to interact. Other than the few instances we happened to knock off at the same timing, he did not really initiate efforts to contact me even after I had added him on fb. Thus, I am reconsidering my decision to initiate conversations in the case that he may just see me as a colleague and nothing more. His relationship status is unknown to me as well too so I didn't want to adopt a strong approach in case he may feel uncomfortable. He isn't from NUS by the way (even harder to catch up with one another after school starts) that's why i decided to take a step back and see how things goes. This will probably be my last post regarding this issue, any advice will be greatly appreciated!

It's 4.33am and I still can't sleep. I hope I don't die too young. Anyone has any advice for combatting insomnia?

I've been trying to find a gf for awhile. Not successful.

So I thought, since I got urges, i'll find a FWB until I get a gf. I'm definitely above average attractive, people tell me that. I thought I was single mainly cuz I'm not the easiest person to live with, but since I'm not looking for a gf, FWB should be a lot easier, right?

But surprise surprise - finding a FWB is just as hard. went through a few potential people only to have one back out last minute cuz the thought of going physical suddenly frightened her, another not very attractive so we've only gone out once, and one more but things are going slowly.

So I hear people say Tinder is the perfect hook up app. And I concur - I mean how deep can swiping left and right on a person be? you see picture, decide if you're physically attracted, and swipe left or right. Sometimes the pic can't be seen clearly so you wanna see the others, fine. other than that you take no more than 5 seconds per person. Except for that irritating bitch who puts her doggie or cat as their profile pic.

Fine, Tinder gives you many OTMs (opportunities to meet). Then I realise 'Tinder is a hook-up app' is a lie. People on tinder actually tell me they're there to look for a boyfriend, they wanna 'be friends first', they're not into hookups and the rest of the traditional bullcrap.

..........................I mean, say what?! you're here on Tinder to look for a BOYFRIEND for a committed relationship?......................................... and here's the other kicker. it seems like 80% of people I meet on Tinder are like this.

........................whaaaAAAAATTT?...........

so, respond, anonymously if you will; ladies lemme know, is it true that fewer girls actually want a FWB? or are ladies just simply more discreet about it?

I mean just looking at craigslist and locanto, it seems like the list of advertisments of women looking for men is drastically less than the list of Men for Women. Do women simply just want sex less in general?

Question to guys out there. What do you think of girls who take the first initiative to ask guys out/ talk to guys they meet during school event, through mutual friends ( without any intro from their friend though) compared to girls that guys ask out. Do the fomer come across as being desperate or attention seeking? Sometimes you hear comments about how a certain girl is different from the rest. In a sense that she is decent and not willing to be manipulated. She's only after love and nothing else and sex after marriage. There are times when I'm tempted to approach guys to just talk and get to know them as friends but I'm afraid of giving them the wrong impression that I'm an easy going girl who is just after sex and someone to love. It doesn't help that I'm naive and have a baby face. Because of this reason and certain pass experience, I find it hard to talk to my guy friends or ask them for help in case I give them the wrong idea impression.
This post is not meant to hurt anyone and I just want all your honest opinion.

Never, in the past, did I think I would turn to this platform of anonymity to seek advice (or rant) but I guess there’s always a first time right?

In the eyes of most people, I led an extremely blessed life comprising of awesome grades, great interpersonal skills, relatively pleasant looks, always surrounded by friends, and most recently, started my career in a very lucrative industry of my interest. People always describe me as a happy-go-lucky person, devoid of worries and with a smile always plastered on my face. However, therein lies the problem. Deep down within the labyrinth of my heart lies a very vulnerable and depressed me. Happiness, to me, has become some sort of a social obligation. Whenever I tried to confide in someone, phrases like ‘you can get sad one mehh?’ comes out of them. This compounded matters and I start to learn how to live in a façade, hiding my innermost fears and feelings away from everyone. The only person who knew me and saw me through my dark days when everything spiraled out of control was my ex-girlfriend, whom for various reasons (the breaking point was LDR where she went to London to pursue her undergraduate law degree) broke up with me 5 years ago. She was my best friend, my confidant, the only person who understood me and knows when I’m feeling down even though I have a smile on my face. I miss her (even if not in a relationship way but at least as a platonic soulmate), her companionship and her ability to understand me more than any others (am I dumb to do so?). I tried dating after we broke up but I just cant find back the same connection. Recently, I just got wind that she’s engaged. If you’re reading this, I know there is a reason for you keeping your distance, but could we be friends again?

I’m tired of living in this façade. Just afraid that one day, it will just overwhelm me, forcing me to be more reclusive as I find it harder to control my emotions. 

Sorry for the long post. I’ll end off with a verse from adele: Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you, too. Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said. Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead..

To OP  

Firstly, the cliche advice of 'Be yourself' is very often misunderstood. It doesn't mean you don't change for the better. It means to change within your comfort level. It's a little oxymoronic but I will explain more later. I will try and answer your problems.

1. 'But the conversations with them would seem so awkward'
Make her laugh. It's one thing to get her to talk comfortably with you. It's another thing for her to enjoy talking to you. Making her laugh will make her remember how much she enjoys talking to you. Don't be shy to say, 'Hey, wanna hear a joke?' Even if she doesn't laugh, she knows you're deliberately trying to make her happy. 

2. 'But I would often fade away in conversations' 
If you met a new girl and you are in a social setting, pick-up lines can be helpful! If it's someone you know like a classmate or colleague, remembering the things she says helps. If she mentioned a TV show she's watching, ask her when the show airs then ask her how was last night's episode the next day. Better yet, watch the show. You can talk about the show and even tell her why you didn't like the show. The fact that you watched it just because of her is flattering enough.

3. 'Yes, I am indeed despo' 
Any good advice involves some effort by you. Girls like confident guys and confidence is not about portraying a facade. It's about the willingness to put aside your fear. Be it changing for the better or showing the real you. 

Some other tips that might help you!

4. Okay, so you strike up a conversation and have her number. You can tell if she likes you by eye contact. You know how people tend not to look at each other in the eye for too long? Well, look at her a little longer than a random glance then give her a little smile before looking away. Don't stare! Just don't be afraid to show that you like looking at her.

5. If you are getting the signals from her, ask her out. Just the two of you. Yes, it's a date. It could be a movie, drink... Don't treat it as if it's a big deal, as if by saying yes she'll be making a big commitment to you. If she declines, say, 'Hey, it's just a movie/cafe/dinner, I'm not asking you to marry me laa.'

6. What's next? You just let it happen naturally. If you've gotten this far and the girl has been showing the right signs, it will happen naturally. No need for confessions. You may be surprised at how easy it was. Which it should be if the guy and girl like each other. This is how mature adults do it. 

All the best! I'm not active here but if you find this helpful and found a relationship, do help other dudes!

Now time for me to put in my two cents' worth of advice after reading a lot of the posts recently on being evergreen & wanting to be in a relationship:

TL;DR: Try to look at & evaluate people for who they are, not for the (sole) purpose of romancing them.

I am an evergreen girl myself, 22 years old this year; and if I were to be honest to myself, I would admit that I have always wanted to be in a relationship & have a boyfriend to see what the whole fuss of being in love was about.

But one thing a friend said has stuck with me ever since: "If you're only going to look at guys as meat to snap up, you're never going to treasure them for who they are, or even see them as the people they are." 

I would like to advise the same to guys who are afraid of being awkward when talking to girls (aim being to get close to girls just to see if they are girlfriend material) or girls who are just waiting for Mr. Right (snap out of the cliché too plz) to come along & chat you up. PLEASE STOP. People exist not so that you can just go through all of them to see who's meant for you. You can make all of them meant for you by cherishing their humanity,  friendship & companionship. 

I qualify this by stating that I don't mean that you have to be friends with every single person; I don't mean that everyone will have an equal standing in relationship with you - what I mean is just that please evaluate everyone based on who they are, not who you want to get together with. Don't get close to/start talking to someone just because s/he just seems like someone you could potentially love. It makes your life a lot less shallow than merely making acquaintances as a bridge to love & takes a lot of pressure off yourself. What will happen will happen. Cherish the moment.

I let a friend down a couple of times because I was busy with work and as such had to cancel outings that we'd planned in advance. Because of this, he started to distance himself from me, citing that I'd lost his trust. And I guess this "defriending" process was finally complete when a few days ago he walked right past me (we were walking in opposite directions, hence he couldn't have failed to see me) without a single sign of acknowledgement. We were good friends before this, hence it really hurt me deeply. I didn't expect that losing a friend in this manner would be so painful. People, please treasure your friends because you don't realize their importance in your life until they're gone. Don't find this out the hard way. I'm gonna miss him.

My girlfriend of 2 years has been suffering from depression for about 5 years now. Recently, it has gotten a lot worse, and she has episodes almost every single time we arrange to meet up. Sometimes I'd be 5 minutes away from the meeting point and she calls to tell me that she can't make it because she had a sudden bout of depression, and she's just lying in bed crying and thinking about committing suicide. She isn't the type that lies, just to be clear. I don't understand depression very well, but I'm always patient with her, and I comfort as well as counsel her when the need arises. She is also profuse with words of gratitude and apologies once the episode has subsided. However, with the unusually high frequency of episodes of late, I admit that it has become very tiring and frustrating to have to be her psychologist/counsellor/lover/friend because doing so drains me physically and emotionally. We both know the toll her depression takes on the both of us because we've discussed it at length. Plus it's not like she's in control of the mood swings that occur when depression strikes, so I can't really hold her accountable for the consequences that ensue. Am I a bad guy for occasionally feeling that she can and should be better at handling her depression after having had it for so long? How can I cope with this unshakable feeling that no matter what I do she's never going to improve and I will be stuck with being her crutch and support for the rest of her/my life? Is there any way I can help her and yet remain emotionally unaffected? I like her very much and foresee going the distance with her (and she feels the same way), but this tiny little snag has been impeding the development of our relationship. Any advice will be highly appreciated.

Just wanted to get this rant out because none of my friends understand. I am an overweight girl for as long as I can remember. I never thought of losing weight until last year, when the motivation just came. Pretty clothes did not come in my size, and I wanted to look and feel better for myself. I lost 10kg within the first 6 months.

But after that, my weight has been fluctuating around the same range (for almost a year now). I would lose some, and then gain it back again despite exercising every day. I admit that I have not been eating extremely clean, but the amount I eat is half of what I used to. Because of this, I can't help but feel disheartened and I am losing motivation. Also, all my friends are slim and none of them understands me when I count calories or share stories about my journey. When they complain about the "rolls of fats" and "hideous cellulite" they have, I feel really bad about myself. Some friends have told me to hit the gym, but I don't dare to. The gym feels like an intimidating place where muscular guys and toned girls hang out, and I don't want them to judge me.

I understand that weight loss is more or less a personal journey, but I feel so lonely in this. Some days I feel like I could live with this body forever, but I really don't want to give up this journey and let myself down.

Hi!
I'm a year 1 going year 2 student. My first sem CAP  is only 3.0 but this sem it's 3.4. I was damn excited that finally I can pull up my CAP although it's just only 0.4. But, that's okay cause I firmly believe that I am able to pull it up throughout my study in NUS. As parents, I really really understand that my tuition fee in NUS is quite expensive that's why I need to get good grades during my study. When I checked my result from myisis, I cried happily while staring my grades. Why? Finally, I made it even though it's only 3.4.. I'm not a really smart one, but I believe through hard works and dedication we can be anything. I told my parents about my grades, and my dad was really mad at me. The worst part was when my dad said that 'you are a bloody hell and fake nus students'..I tried to be strong and not to cry. This is not the first time he said like that to me, I heard those words like hundred or thousand times..Every time I face this situation, I always try to wake up by myself and try to motivate myself. I know it's really hard and painful, but that's life..I'm writing this post is actually just for sharing purpose. For those who have the same problem like me, I just want to remind you one thing: no matter how you feel, get up, dress up and never give up!
Have a good day! :)

Can we talk about things other than relationships? NUSWhispers is quickly turning into Aunt Agony.

"I'm still a virgin": Get out more, stop being a shut in, get some new friends to hang out with, stop whining on facebook.
"I just broke up with my SO": Delete facebook, lawyer up, hit the gym.
"My girl/boyfriend cheated on me": Shit happens, let it go, make yourself a better person so the other party regrets it.
"I am content with my current life": Why are you here?
-
 
 1. There's nothing objectively wrong being a virgin for the rest of your life.
2. ...not getting a girlfriend.
3. ...not getting married.
4. Learn to think for yourself. Choice is yours, but you ought to think VERY carefully of future consequences.
-
 
I'm a person of faith, and I'm waiting for marriage to have sex. To all those waiting as well, stay strong <3

I'm a 24 year old guy who's never been in a relationship. Let alone touched a girl in an intimate way. I'm currently studying engineering at uni and I feel that I would be single for life(hey it's 24 years of being single, what are the chances of things changing..zilch or close to Anyway.) 

I fell for this girl in my first year but things did not work out. Ever since then things slipped into sadness and depressed mode and I've ended up making a vow to myself that I should never feel for a girl or ever even think about liking her again. 

At the same time as i don't ever want to fall for another girl. I don't think I will get married as well. So I also had wished to maybe consider adopting a child to form a mini family of my own(and maybe even die a virgin..probably) I've given up all hope on finding a relationship and even considered being a very mean/jerk/douche guy to every girl I meet and know except my mother. Cos frankly most of them deserved it but I can't because I've been brought up the wrong way of being kind and gentlemanly to people(pun intended.) 

So what is your opinion on this? Isit worth sticking to my plan of probably just having an adopted son or should I rethink my life planning?
-
 
 Hey there, my gf refuses to go down on me too due to some personal reasons even though I did it for her. Nonetheless, we still had healthy sex lives and it didn't really bothered me that much even though I want to experience it. Thus, I wouldn't recommend you to break up with him over such a trivial matter. If you are really perturbed, try reaching a compromise with him? 
I know some guys won't go down on their girlfriends is because their girlfriends don't shave, likewise for girls.
-
 
I got together with this girl after knowing her for about half a year. To me, she was innocent, pretty and cute.

Everything was fine until one day I overheard her telling her female friend that she's acting all sweet and simple-minded in front of me so that she can be attached (and then married) to a rich guy. (My family wealth is considered much higher than average in SG (4-storey bungalow) and we have 3 luxury cars.)

I was very disappointed as I'd thought she was different from other girls. Should I not have brought her to my house to hang out / fetched her before we even got together? Now that I think of it, maybe that's the reason why she rejected all her other suitors...

Another issue is, guys take note - a girl should really be the most beautiful girl in your world before you two get together. All along I was attracted by other girls (before and during relationship). I also had a few fwbs and one night stands. I felt that she was a really good girl and I should cherish her. On the other hand, there are so many better choices out there for me and I am not like some old man desperate to get a wife, I keep getting distracted.

Well I guess my good side got the better of me because in the end I gave up my freedom and asked her to be my gf. I guess after dating someone for a period of time, it's difficult to call off the relationship... I'd feel bad if I'd done so... like leading her on :/ 

Maybe I'm not ready to settle down yet... On a side note, fwb are the best relationships, anyone with me on this??? You get no jealousy no drama no expectation but fun and pleasure. Plus it's a bonus if your fwb is your good buddy. 
-
 
I'm tired of hearing guys having such low confidence or insecurities about themselves. Well, for a typical abled human, you have hands, legs, can see, hear, speak and feel. You should feel fortunate and be proud of yourself. Instead of saying things like girls won't fancy me because I'm average look, average results or average finance. Or worse still blame those materialistic girls you know and generalize every girls you see. Girls don't owe you a living. Just be yolo and talk to them. Or spend the effort to go work and earn money to spend for your materialistic wants. I've made friends from work whom I go play sports with. I'm a girl anyway.
-
 
I guess it could work both ways. But why don't materialistic guys get glorified? My ex is one of them. He dumped me for another girl with rich parents.
-
 
These dating-related woes have got to stop. Everyone posting these confessions is making excuses for themselves. Both guys and girls are accusing each other of being materialistic or shallow. No one is introspecting and thinking what is going wrong in their approach. I will first admit that I am nobody to talk: evergreen + not many friends in NUS + terrified of rejection + egotistic + selfish/arrogant. 
But last night I had a crazy thought that if I were to drop dead suddenly. The only people to notice my absence would be my parents. That is a simple fact: not morbid self-pity. And I am entirely responsible for that fact. But I am not going to sit and feel sad about my seemingly-eternal loneliness and singlehood (that I largely brought upon myself). 
This morning I saw one of those many emails from here and there about various activities. Without second-guessing myself, I signed up for it. And I actually found myself feeling excited about doing something new and meeting new people. This is just a small thing but truly, we all hold the power to change ourselves. So do a little more thinking and a lot less negative generalizing about the opposite (or same, whatever floats your boat) sex. 
-
 
I feel that girls nowadays are getting really materialistic, and relationships are no longer as 'pure' or 'till death do us apart anymore'. Just take a look at our social media- instagram, Facebook. A lot of girls who guys consider as 'pretty' and 'classy' are ostentatiously showy and attention seeking.  The guys they date are also of similar nature- good looking and buff guys who are equally showy and proud, and they are no longer looking for nice and good guys anymore, but rather base them on superficial things like looks and status mostly. Kinda sad actually...
-
 
Can someone explain to me why do old people feel lonely so easily especially those who just retired and cannot socialise well? It puzzles me why younger people can cope pretty well even if they are left alone for extended period of time..  
-
 
How to ask if a girl is still attached? I like this girl but I know she has a boyfriend and I would not do anything more than a friend would if she is in a relationship, though I heard things about the boyfriend that are not very pleasant.
-
 
I've known of a few incidences where guys directly/indirectly asked if they could just be friends and know me better for the past couple of years. But for some serious health reasons (that makes me feel less of a women), I always shy away from them because I know that eventually I have to tell them about it if things get serious and I don't know if I can handle their subsequent reactions. At the same time, I just wished I can move on from such a mindset. Awkward, embarrassed and shy all at once. Guys, how do you handle such things if you happen to find yourself involved in one?
-
 
After being evergreen for so long, I started feeling comfortable being alone but at the same time, I am constantly worried that I will not be able to find a girlfriend when I am still young. I will get slightly envy of loving couples I see along the streets which I suppose is normal for someone who is evergreen. Age is fast catching up with me. Can anyone advise how I can break free from my comfort zone that is about to ruin my future?

Saw my female colleague use okcupid like damm pro sia

first let me clarify she is atb but local grad, quite fair skin, soft features type, in ancient china she would probably be like those that run too slow den kenna chop during war time but no one care and the camera pan away after 1 second

anyway she showed me her account, about 5-6 message at lunch time but she say she currently only chat regularly with 2 guys

no.1 guy about 6/10 (I consider tony leung a 10/10, elvin ng 8/10), his profile pic is him wearing some suit standing in the some place that is obviously not in SG, not really tall but look confident

no.2 guy about 8/10, really quite good looking, v broad shoulders and he is drinking beer, like in some cool café at one fullerton or clark quay

and I saw the match %, 90%+! I was v surprised cause what wld this AT have in common with these 2 sakti guys den she told me... she lied in her profile... 

put she is interested in craft beer, travelling, watching house of cards, lived in US, surfing, guitar all those stuff cause she knows guys with these kind of interest tend to be good looking and no aspergers

I asked her but like that you wouldn't have any shared interest, how to click? she say its ok.. these kind of guys like it when girls are dense in their interest and can teach them slowly

damm smart right????

do I tolerate if my bf lies? We were on the topic about his exes one day (he's my first bf) and he told me he broke up with her more than a year ago. Then he insisted on showing me her photo. It was a photo of them happy together. An event date was written together with the year. I was at the event so I knew when was it and it was only less than 6 months ago. So, clearly they didnt break up a year ago already... I didnt want to make a fuss so I didnt question him. Either way is it healthy to keep his ex photo in his phone after "a year"?

I'm a Chinese guy in my second year of university. In January, I got acquainted with an Indian girl (not NUS, but from SIT) through a mutual friend. We hit it off as friends. I found her funny, smart and beautiful. I wasn't also objectifying her, I genuinely thought she was beautiful then and even now.

After a month of hesitation, I picked up my balls and asked her out on a date. She agreed. Prior to this, I've not been with an Indian girl, only Chinese ones. She also hasn't dated a Chinese boy so we were both noobs. If anyone had told me before her that I would be dating an Indian girl, I would have laughed. After all, I've always had a preference for Chinese girls simply because similarities attract. That first date went well and we had many subsequent ones. Later in March, I asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend. She said yes. Some of you are probably thinking it's too soon. I've known her only for three months. But there are some things in life that I know for sure that it is what I want. She, I'm sure of. Confirm plus chop. 

I've met her family. Her family is Hindu, she is too. As far as religions go, I'm an atheist and I'm not bothered. Her family has been accommodating and nice to me. They taught me their cultures and fed me like really awesome home cooked Indian food. For instance, her mum recently told me that "she was going to curry me up." Lol! 

Here's the problem. I want to introduce her to my family, but I know undoubtedly that my mum will not accept our relationship. She knows I'm dating a girl, but she doesn't know I'm dating an Indian. My mum is traditional in her mindset and has said some rather unsettling, racist remarks about Indians and Malay on several occasions. I grew up listening to negative remarks and having negative stereotypes of the minorities in Singapore. It didn't help that I went to SAP schools, and although there was a handful of minorities, I hardly ever interacted with them. In defence of my mum, she's a nice lady, stay home mum... she's just misinformed.

My first "real" interaction, I suppose, was when I was an officer cadet in the army. My buddy was this crazy Indian dude who made OCS super enjoyable. For me, NS challenged the prejudices I had and changed them. Now, whenever my mum says something bad about Indians or Malays, I would correct her. Even now, after NS, I am constantly listing down prejudices I've on paper and I challenge them to see if they still align my values now. If they don't, they get striked out. Before, on top of being the son of a racist (or a misinformed) mother, I was also a homophobe, but I went for my first Pink Dot this year as an ally to a gay friend. So.. I'm learning. Slowly.

Back to my mum... I'm not sure how I'm gonna let her know that I'm with an Indian girl. I've told my girlfriend that my mum is incredibly racist. That the only reason I don't want to introduce her to my mum is because she's probably gonna say something really insensitive that might be hurtful. She said it's fine that we keep our relationship secret for now, but I know it's something I've to do and it would also mean a lot to my girlfriend to know my family. My dad's pretty bo chap about inter-racial relationships so as far as he goes, I know he'll be okay with it lah. Maybe he'll just tease me about it. 

Also, not exactly a big problem, but I've had a friend from JC ask why I was with an Indian girl. I'm pretty sure he's being an ass but his opinion doesn't matter to me. But it might matter to my girlfriend. I fear she might have to deal with future snide remarks like that.

Any advice for me and her? Sorry, this is super long.. I meant to write like three paragraphs, but went over limit. Paiseh. Thanks for reading!

I feel so awkward when i am with people whom i just get to know and this is especially so when i go for camps. Everytime prior to camp, i tell myself that i want to be able to talk better to others but it just ended up failing badly as i am very bad at starting conversation especially to the opposite gender. Hence, there wasn't much interaction with me and the others and i may come accross as a quiet person to them which in actual fact, i can be quite noisy with people whom i am comfortable with.

Going Year 3 next sem. As of now, my past two years' worth of results consists almost entirely of B+s and I'm feeling kinda mediocre, frustrated at not being able to get past this invisible barrier though not overly upset. Anyone else in a similar situation?

I broke up exactly one month ago.. And today I met this new girl(spoke but never seen) for the first time.. Is it too fast to be doing so?(moving on) or is it "normal" to want to find a new girl..

That moment when you feel that you are a bit too old for the crowd but still stuck with immature young noobs in school...

my colleague today tell me he is interested in our dept intern and ask me to "put in a good word for him" say he is mid level management at 31 years old, drive Volvo and nice guy overall

I ask him y don't you just talk to her more first? go for lunch with her? maybe try asking her out for dinner?

One of my drunk friends slept over at my place. I caught him licking my toe in the middle of the night when he thought I was asleep. I freaked out but at the same time got a little aroused and had a semi-erection.

I've heard a lot of people say, "Looks are not important. Personality is." Really? It sounds pleasing and encouraging but do people really practice that, or is it all talk? People will first associate themselves with you if you are good-looking, before being interested in your personality, especially if you're a girl.

I was born to be short, plump, bad skin, bad hair and I have a slurred speech. Both my parents are unattractive too, hence most of this is obviously inherited.

During secondary school, my classmates are constantly bullying me over my looks, especially the boys. They kept calling me names and even once said that I look as if I got hit by a truck. Some girls joined in too. Thus, I became an introvert, just focusing on my studies and didn't bother to have a social life. It is really very depressing knowing that people always judge me by my appearance. Even if I try to be nice and want to join in a group, they may reluctantly let me but they will roll their eyes whenever I speak and they kept replying "Duh can can" or "Obviously". They blatantly showed me that they don't value my opinion as a person at all. And they seldom include me in their conversations and hangouts, hence I usually stay away from them because it is very hurtful.

There are moments in my life when I feel like committing suicide. What have I done to deserve this? I am not rude, I try to be polite. I know my looks are not presentable, and it is a great disadvantage in my life. At least in NUS, the people here are more mature and they don't intentionally show their contempt. I am thankful.

Especially for a girl, success in life is largely determined by the looks. You get to choose a better husband, a better job, guys will shower you with gifts, and people are more willing to help you and associate themselves with you. Maybe this is a good example of natural selection, to put an end to my inferior genes so I won't pass it on the next generation. Should include this example in my LSM answers lol.

So this guy I got close to recently, just confessed. But he also said that the last week we seemed to be hanging out too often and he kinda got a little tired of meeting up with me. (We are colleagues, have lunch 2 times a week together, and met up for dinner once). This notion seems weird to me though. Although I understand how you can get tired of someone who is clingy, but even before the confession, you're telling me you're tired of meeting up with me? Kinda ironic isn't it? Someone please advice because I don't get it. I  didn't accept the confession though, because I think it would be better for us to remain friends.

Anybody feels lost after graduation? Somehow I feel that I have been tossed into the vast ocean on a tiny boat, not knowing which direction to steer. Seeing friends that know what they want in life and actively pursue them makes me envious. What should I do? 
-
 
I've always made it a point to thank the friends who helped me with studies. Though I befriended them because they are good at studies and are known to be helpful to others. Got straight A-s with a B+ for FYP, placing me at exactly CAP 4.00 so I'm graduating with 2nd upper which was a pleasant surprise because I expected 2nd lower. The truth is I know I will never bother talking with most of these people any more. 
-
 
 I am. I really am. I am tired of being called a faggot by my bunk mates in NS who found out I'm gay, of being talked about behind my back. I am sick of having to lie all the time to my parents because I can't tell them all about my boyfriend when I really want to. I'm tired of not knowing whether my job might be in danger if my future employer finds out I'm gay. I'm tired of not being able to hold my boyfriend's hand or lying on his shoulder when we are on the train, like all the other couples around us. I'm sick of having my life up for debate, having my love judged as a sin, having my reality discussed like it's some abstract idea. 

I'm sorry you're tired because of people like me though. I guess you would prefer that people like us continue to suffer in silence, like we always have? 
-
 
Actually I don't mind a younger guy. But I use age gap as the reason to reject/pretend to be oblivious to your hints. I enjoy getting to know you and wonder how our paths have managed to cross. Seeing you in your no.4 is a bit of a thrill. You counting down your days to ORD and finally entering NUS is as much excitement as a dread to me. The only reason you find me interesting now is because your social circle has been devoid of girls. Once school starts for you, who's to know if there is something better for you? Who's to know if there is something better for me when I graduate too? 

Crossing paths should be enough, yes?

Seeing that so many people call MLM their "business" and categorize it under "proper marketing", how would you know whether someone is asking you to join in a new business venture or an MLM? Any thoughts? I'm asking because recently so many people have been asking me whether I would like to earn extra money in my free time and I'm cautious about it (from many stories, I kind of have an idea how MLM people drag you in). I'm all for entrepreneurship but I am quite put off by MLMs.

I'm not using you. I'm just unsure if I like you yet and I'm afraid to hurt you

Dear , your post reminds me about myself in my past relationship. I agree with you that there are some things he has done wrong. He shouldn't restrict your uni choice and he should let you know about the girls he had been talking to, since it's only fair when he had asked you about the guys you had talked to. Well he's also emotionally dependent on you (nothing wrong with that, perhaps just immaturity). But let me offer you this other perspective about the "cheating" part. I also accused my ex-gf of cheating. Why? Because she didn't spend quality time with me and I felt that she enjoyed herself more with other guys than with me. I don't know about you, in fact I don't know you. But it takes two hands to clap. It could be your actions (or lack of) which made him feel so insecured. It is not so much about you cheating but more of because he didn't feel loved by you. Did you enjoy yourself more with your other guy friends than when you were with him? He might have felt this way.

Having said that, I do agree with the commenters that it's the right move to break up with him. Be careful that he may find ways to come back to you again and ask for forgiveness (read: emotionally dependency). But draw the line clearly, and make sure he knows that you are serious about it. Cheers!
-
 
YAYY IM SO MOTIVAT-!! oh wait...
-
 
I can forgive her for throwing used sanitary pad on my face, I can swallow my pride as a man and received those abusive slaps on my face. I'm willing to tolerate all these, because I love my girlfriend, going the extra mile because I'm afraid of losing her.

However she told me that " we are over, time's up". When I went down on my knees to beg for her forgiveness ( I really don't know what I have done wrong!!), she gave me a smile and patted my head before she left. What does that mean? Do I have a chance to salvage this relationship? PLEASE HELP ME!

Sometimes I really feel that I'm a failure as a man. Can't even keep a girl by my side.

-
 
Is it supposed to be embarrassing that someone is still evergreen and a virgin at 27? I don't think it's that big of a deal, but why am I so afraid to let people know that? 
-
 
I had a recent discussion with my friend about pre marital sex and intimacy. I asked him, what base he had done with his girlfriend. He admitted that he only made out and did some cuddling. Being evergreen, I didn't have much experience either. I did cuddling and kissed a girl (who wasn't my gf).......

But actually we are talking about the same girl.... T.T and he is not aware.
-
 
I am a evergreen guy.  Whenever someone ask me if I have been in a relationship, I will feel very embarrass and lost of words and will always try to change the subject. Being the shy and timid guy, I really feared people will judge me for that. That is also a reason why I have started avoiding CNY. Is that normal for my case?
-
 
To  please be honest with her. I have experience with this as a girl whose bf has had many many many casual experiences with random girls he picked up before me. He came clean and he let me know about his experiences and he assured me about how his feelings for me were different and how he wanted this relationship for the long term. We've been together almost 3 years now and we are very happy. So please dont be afraid :)

When your boyfriend ignores you because he has exams.... :/ I know he is busy, but ignoring to what extent is acceptable? We do talk on online but sometimes I feel like his heart is not really there. And I feel I am always the one initiating things, like sending letters, packages, suggesting new activities to do, remembering our anniversaries.. (we are in different countries) when he rarely does anything back. He eventually gets mad or upset at me if I got upset that he has been ignoring me. Then it turns out to be my fault and then I blame myself in the end, for causing sadness to us, to myself (and causing stress to him when he has to study). I keep telling myself it's okay, that I am fine with it, but sometimes I just feel so, so lonely. Am I not seeing the things he is doing for me, or is this a doomed relationship? Sometimes I just feel so tired. LDR is like living life in extra hard mode. ._.
-
 
So I met this guy at a party and we hit it off really well, kept in touch, he asked me out a few times and we met once. We had a 'null period' in between but we met again last month. I still am somewhat interested in him, even though he's in a different country and our conversations have kinda saturated. But I don't know what he thinks about me, and if I'm just a friend he made that he could connect with on a deeper level, especially cos I found out he's been meeting other girls too. Guys, what is this supposed to mean???
-
 
What to do when someone loved you and you didn't realise how much you love them back until they got tired and didn't love you anymore. And now you're left with all the what if's and could have been's and it all sucks cos you only realised that he/she was the one you wanted to spend your entire life with after he/she lost interest and decided to leave:( And then you worry that you'll never meet anyone else that makes you feel the same way again:( 
-
 
There's someone of the opposite gender who has been pretty good to me and I feel really comfortable speaking with and spending time with him. Given that I don't usually open up to guys, this feeling is new to me. Don't get me wrong, he was given the cold treatment as well inititally but he did put in the extra effort to get to know me better whereas other guys haven't bothered to. People around us has been telling me that he seems to be having a crush on me. But he is currently attached and I'm not interested in being a 3rd party anyway, no matter how much I feel attached to him (not so much attraction but emotional attachment). But is there really no way for us to be close friends yet not be in a romantic relationship? I don't know how he thinks about me, but I just really hope this current comfortable state we're in right now carries on without other complications. Guys, it'll be great to hear your POV on this. 
P.S: My other friends have been telling me to stop associating with him for fear that I get hurt because he seems like a player (to them) but whether or not he really is one, shouldn't matter since I'm just looking at friendship between us right? Or is my thinking too naive? 
-
 
 Don't worry about those mean people and their mean comments. They're probably just jealous us gay boys can give way better head than their girlfriends. 

Also, I don't know if you like Neil Patrick Harris too, but here's another meme that hopefully will cheer you up too! <3 

P.S I was just trying to cheer OP up with that giving head joke, so please don't flame me for misogyny; I actually think that both guys and girls can give equally good head though I'll never find out if that's true.

Idea for those confessing to a girl in NUS. Make something just like this https://soundcloud.com/taketwosg/u-town-girl-uptown-girl #mucheffort #muchNUS

I don't like the phrase "she wants the D". I'll acknowledge that sexual attraction works both ways, but I think that the phrase is used even when a girl isn't showing obvious interest in a guy. It comes out of nowhere sometimes, and it feels more like the guy is reflecting his own interest onto the girl. Aside from that, it's often said with an aggressive feel which I can't properly express. Also, most societies still accept male dominance in many social, economic and political respects. For it to be reasserted in a sexual domain, in a way which suggests yet again that men are needed for the happiness of women, is off-putting to me. Guys, you may disagree, but ask a girl about how she instinctually feels about this phrase. It might broaden your perspective.
-
 
Feeling so vexed now. I'm in a LDR and I intend to see it through with my other half. But recently, I'm beginning to feel attracted to this guy I've been chatting with. I still see him just as a friend though.

Don't get me wrong-I still love my SO and I have no intentions of cheating at all. I suspect that this attraction may be because I haven't been receiving a lot of attention from him as compared to my guy friend. We haven't seen each other in 6 months (we've only skyped once or twice? Ironically, he's less responsive after exams.)  It just feels nice to have someone there you know? 

And I don't think that this friend is trying to seduce me in any way (at least I hope so). Even though he's cute, I suspect he's the bad boy type and totally not worth cheating with imo. I really need to get this off my chest since none of my friends can empathise nor withhold their judgements.
-
 
I really fail as a human being~

I see so many couples without any common interest still can along and got topic to talk about.

I see so many friends gather to catch up to 1 another still got topic to talk about.

But my head is always empty...

My current boyfriend's ex still has them as her profile picture. Is it something I should be worried about? Should I talk to him?

Seriously, any Scala lovers here?

One moment you felt sad about the break up. The next moment you say you met the guy you have always been praying for. I don't understand girls. Truth is, we will only know someone after years. You are too impulsive.
-
 
To  IM not a girl, but I think confidence issues can be solved when you start to not think about what people think about you and what you can't change.

You can't change it anyway, might as well be happy with it. Most of the time, strangers won't care and friends won't mind, it is you that puts unnecessary pressure on yourself. 

Took me some time to master this skill, but after that you can be quite invincible and confident in whatever

I don't want to ask my friends their cap. No one in my family asked me as well. Sometimes I feel so lonely. This is just a message to myself saying that I am proud of myself and one day, I will have the life I want.

What do you do when you get downgraded by a best friend? How do you cope?

So I've read comments where people #NUSingles, and I was wondering, is there actually a way for singles in NUS to interact?
-
 
Let me share my story. I did badly in my Year 1 Sem 2, which made my CAP suffer a lot. It almost fell below 3.5 I think. But I didn't give up. I knew I could do better than this. Guess what, I managed to pull it back to 4.18 this sem. I didn't expect such a good result this sem, but there is one thing I am pretty sure of - I have put in my best effort and I have pushed myself beyond the limit. So if you did badly, just don't give up. Keep the faith, work hard and most importantly, persevere.

Unpopular opinion coming through!
Reading some of the confessions claiming that they are moral for not having premarital sex is really getting me on my nerves.
Is virginity a priority in a romantic relationship? I believe sex and romance CAN be separated.
As a single male, I can have a one night stand with a lady without romantic attachment, while we both satisfy our sexual desires.
Likewise, I can have a romantic relationship with a girl without wanting to get into her pants.
That said, having a sexual and romantic relationship with your SO is probably the best thing ever.
Only when people realise this, we will have less "players" who make use of romance to get sex, or "victims" who use sex to sustain a romantic relationship.
Does anyone actually agree with me?

How does a guy who enjoys chatting and hanging out with a girl he's perfectly comfortable with, continue to do so without sending mixed signals?

There's this guy whom I just knew and start text flirting with me. After some time, he stopped doing that and seems to be more distance. Now he is like hardly contacting me and when we meet up, he is basically acting like a jerk. :( How should I proceed further?

Hi everyone! I am a single guy looking for a gf. I hit the gym 3 times a week and enjoy drinking on weekends. I've also been told that I'm handsome quite often by friends and strangers alike if that matters anyway. Girls, if you're interested, just like or comment on this confession and I'll add you on fb;)

Just got my results, was a relief to find out I can do honours, because I got CAP =x. Found it funny that my CAP went from 3.0 to x then x then 3.0 then x again, although the semester CAP are all different. Also, I think I'm the only one who has NEVER gotten a single A(+/-) in all three years in uni?

How many times in a day is it considered normal for a guy to masturbate? My friend told a group of us that he did it four times in a day and everyone was very shocked and started laughing but I have no basis of reference ):

We were never official nor exclusive which means it sucked when I started having genuine feelings for you. These are the 3 times when I tried to forget about you once and for all.

1: After I found out you had a one night stand with someone you met in the club, I wandered around Vivo aimlessly since that was the place where we used to hang out in frequently. A part of me wished that we were exclusive even though we've never explicitly stated that we were. I knew I had to forget you because you obviously did not share the same feelings as I did. 

I entered 4 shops and all 4 were playing your favourite song at that time. So I decided to get out of the mall. I hung around the smoking area, wondering if I should smoke considering that I've sworn off smoking at that time. In the midst of my deliberations, this random guy came over and asked to borrow a lighter. He was holding your favourite cigarette pack - Winston Reds. Wtf world.

2: We were in the same beach party, albeit with different groups of friends. A few days before the party, you gave me sh*t for hanging out with a mutual friend too frequently. You told me to meet you in the party but I refused to because I was still mad at you. That beach party was supposed to be part of my birthday celebration and you completely ruined it, so I decided not to attend the party after all.

You sent me a photo sometime after I left. A photo of the same number of shots as my age that you bought for me as a surprise/apology.

3: You called at 630 in the morning on a Saturday, asking to come to my house to study. Naturally I tried to refuse because.. it's 630AM on a SATURDAY MORNING DAMMIT. But you told me you bought Ya Kun breakfast for the both of us so I couldn't exactly turn you down either. You and your ADHD-like behaviour made you the worst study buddy I've ever had in my life. 

It only took you 30 mins to be bored of studying. Then you grabbed my guitar without my permission and for some reasons... started singing all our favourite songs. After my parents woke up, you decided to play the piano too. I don't think you realised how much my mom loved you after that day. She thought you have a really great singing voice for "someone who's not a professional".. and I agreed.

Falling for you was a lesson. I used to be so critical of people who kept going back to the people who hurt them so much. Now that I made the exact same mistake, I understand why. Love simply makes you weak, as easily as it can strengthen you. Even though we were crap as lovers, we kick ass as friends. I'm just happy that we managed to trash things out and stay as friends. Despite everything, we still do share the same clique and the same interests too.

A girl recently confessed to me...but I rejected her by saying that I cant commit. The actual fact is that she is ugly.

I'm an evergreen graduating girl and my Mum is putting pressure on me to find a partner soon. She is afraid I'll be left on the shelf or something.

Problem is, I'm in no hurry to get into a relationship. I want a guy who can make my heart flutter and sweep me off my feet. Either that or I shall stay single once I'm too old to marry. It's all or nothing for me.

Some of my guy friends have confessed to me but none of them interest me. Am I too naive to believe there is knight in shining armor for me?
-
 
I think the only way of loving you is to release you from the pain I have inflicted on you. I'm sorry I don't know how to love. I don't know how to care for you.

But before I go, I must tell you that, for all the hurt we've hurled at each other, I still love you. But I don't know if I'd recover; it has been a year and yet I haven't leapt out of my nightmare.

To 

Hey I feel you bro. I am 24 years old as well with the next academic year being my last year in NUS, and I still have not found a girlfriend. I came into NUS thinking that I would be able to find one, and I am about to leave NUS thinking otherwise.

I tried joining different clubs for the past 3 years in a bid to find a soul mate and as you can see, it didn't exactly work out. I think this is because I am a shy and quiet person, and when I am around girls I find attractive, I don't know what to do or say to them. It also doesn't help that throughout my whole life I haven't had many female friends in my social circle since I was from all boys secondary school, and that I am currently in a course dominated by guys.

I am starting to think people like you and I are destined to be alone forever.

-
 
Is it wise to move on when you realize that someone really doesn't like you? Been trying to ask this girl out for a while, but times and again she gave various reasons to avoid me. Time to move on? 
-
 
I like this girl whom I've known for a few months now. We've hang out together in a group before with other friends. At first I didn't really have any feelings for her but slowly over the months, I've grown to really like her. I haven't officially expressed my interest but I've sublimally showed it.

I don't know how the girl feels but she seems to like someone else and constantly talks about him. When a girl keeps on talking about someone, its indicative that she likes him right? Its one thing to playfully mention but if she continually gushes about him...

So now I don't know if I should proceed. I like the friendship too much to destroy it if she rejects. Quite at a loss now...
-
 
I'm gay and have been monogamously coupled with my partner for four years now. I'm an NUS student, and he's in a different university. Two years ago, he told me that he was in treatment for manic depression. That actually explained a lot of the missing pieces in our relationship like how he would often cancel on our dates because he wasn't "feeling well". 

When he told me that, I said, "Ok, how can I be there for you?". I've held onto my promise to take care of him and offer him emotional support when needed. I've seen him go into states where he cannot even form words and sentences together, and it's so painful to see sometimes. I've been his caretaker... but lately, I feel like I cannot do it anymore and sometimes, I wish I had a normal boyfriend.. whatever the fuck that means. I love him, and I feel like a terrible person for even wishing that. I don't know what else I can do....

It seems like I like nerdy boys. I do appreciate the other types of good-looking guys (like the conventional almost-flawless face that sends almost every girl or gay heart racing. A hot bod is a bonus), but I don't gush over them as much as my other friends do. 
They say that I have an inclination towards "smart-looking" guys (i.e. not great, but decent in terms of their looks. And they just have this particular look that somehow hints that they might be intelligent. They're just so handsome to me). I thought it was utter nonsense at first. Then I realised that my boyfriend is like that--he's not the best-looking, but he's so brilliant. Recently I was acquainted with this guy who looks (and is) smart. He's so appealing even though he looks like the regular guy. [I have no intention to cheat, was just observing].

I don't even know why I'm confessing this; I just realised it and I guess I sorta need to get it off my chest?

Just an innocent question: if someone who is 'gay' is attracted to guys, how can 'gay' relationships occur, since there is no way a 'straight' guy can be attracted to a 'gay'? It would be a one-way relationship.

So perhaps the relationship can only occur between two 'gays'? But if 'gays' identify themselves as being female, how can they be attracted to another person who also identifies himself as being female? 'Gays' are only attracted to guys, remember?

So I honestly don't understand where all the fuss about gay/lesbian relationships is coming from. Could someone please enlighten me about this?

Nothing sucks more than having the person you love so much ignoring you.

Too many stories of relationship breakups and failures to get the guy/girl of someone's dreams recently. Here's a happy one! 

I just got attached with my girlfriend yesterday after having a crush on her for the past six months! Here's hoping for many more happy six months to come! <3 Love you!

A shout out to those trying to get over their unrequited love, erasing feelings for someone who doesn't feel the same way. It's a long and arduous process, but better times lie ahead!

Just broke up with my gf of 4years... Feeling lost.

Never chase love, affection or attention. If it's not given freely by the other person, then it's not worth having. You deserve better.

Hi. To all those who have sought uhc's counselling services, how does one get started with booking an appointment?

Would need some advice too:

Had depression last time, but i became much better already. Stopped feeling so "emo" and having a negative outlook of life. No longer suicidal and living quite a normal life. However, just about the past 2-3years (yes it has actually been that long), i think i probably have anxiety to the point where i have insomnia and frequent hyperventilation episodes while trying to sleep (which further impairs my sleep). This gets especially worse on the night before exam or when i have an important (and stressful) event the next day. 

will the uhc service be of help? I dont have the finances to seek out private psychological help and neither do i want my parents to know...

I feel sad when I'm on holiday. Being the socially awkward, quiet girl even amongst my chatty friends, being socially obligated to go on a "holiday" with my peers is a terrible idea. At least when during curriculum, I had common topics to talk about like studies, but now I just cannot bring myself to talk about anything else because I think I'm pretty boring and I'm afraid of being talked over and ignored. 

I feel the need to space out every now and then in my own personal bubble without the need to be interactive and my friends mistake my quietness for judgement or lack of topics to talk about when I just do not want to talk at all. The larger the group, the lesser I talk because I feel the need not to contribute to the noise pollution. If only things can be still, even for a moment, I would be so content.

Still an evergreen but briefly went out with 3 ladies with romantic motivations during the semesters, at different, non-overlapping time.

1st: Nothing in common but we have a lot of chemistry. But I cannot stand the fact that she was dating several guys at once. But maybe she was just popular and outgoing?

2nd: We have some common interests, but our topics just stops there, coupled with awkward silences and lack of chemistry. 

3rd: I thought we have common interests but it turned out that we like very different genres of the same stuff. Talking to her as a friend is alright and I love chatting with her but things got weird when I said I want us to be more than friends. She said outright she doesn't want a boyfriend and only wants to live with cats in the future.

Today (20/5) I went to the Forum Bookstore to try out my graduation gown. There, I was helped by a friendly and cute girl. I wish I could have known you!

This is abit early to ask since I am just an incoming freshman but seeing many photos of poly students graduating recently on Facebook, this has been bothering me. So anyway, my parents are divorce but during my graduation, I hope that both my parents can turn up for the ceremony. However, it will be incredibly awkward if they run into each other and I don't really want that to happen. What should i do?
-
 
I'm extremely tired because I feel my mum is quite overbearing. She is the sort of person who screams "Did your friends teach you how to do that?" whenever I start talking back to her. Otherwise, she threatens me by saying she would hurt herself, to get me to do as she wants. 

Talking to her has become a bit difficult. She's the only family I have so I get a bit lonely sometimes... :-(
-
 
To the girls and guys out there, how important are physical attraction and compatibility to you?
-
 
I really like a friend of mine but he's got a long time girlfriend. We get on really well together and I sometimes think he may have feelings for me too. I know it would be terrible of me to even express my feelings to him but it is becoming damn difficult. I don't want to sacrifice the friendship by avoiding him but I don't see any other way of escaping my feelings. I'm going to unintentionally end up a bitch for ignoring him seemingly for no reason.

I have given my everything to you and you vowed to love me when u took away my virginity. But you left me in end. What should I do :(

I made up my mind last semester (my 6th) to work harder, to be a better person, to stop fooling around. Unfortunately, with a CAP of around 3 flat, things don't look very well for me, and things still don't look good. I am aware that there are CAP below mine, but it still doesn't make my situation better; it just gives me a false sense of security to sit there and say that I should be appreciative of what I have and don't be a jerk. Well,my CAP is still low, I am appreciative of it, but I wish to have a more ideal CAP, as with quite a number of people.

I worked hard, studied harder, and worked towards being a better person. While things do not look very well right now, if I try harder, and work harder, I can make something out of these pair of hands that created nothing for my life so far. 

Unfortunately, in this summer vacation, out of the around 10-20 applications I have made (Again, I am aware that there are others who made more), none have replied. I turned to a self-initiated Vacation Internship instead, learning the skills to be an automotive (car) mechanic, due to some family connections, which I am very fortunate to have. True, at the end of this first week, my hands have cuts and bruises on them due to my own carelessness, but if they are willing to teach me, I am willing to learn. If others see me, and reject me because I have not proven my worth to them, I will just continue to move along. They don't owe me my living. I only need to prove my self worth to myself.

I still have no idea how to write my report,though I am sure something sort of... intellectual? will come along the way while I work along.

True, your story may be different from mine, and the extent of actions you have taken may have been more. I don't know about that, and I am not in a position to criticise you either. However, the point of my post today here is, don't be disheartened, yes? If you have the time to be feeling disheartened and comforting yourself that you cannot do anything, you're burning time in doing things that let you know that there is always something productive and creative that you can do. Have hope, take things slow, and you will mine a way out of this tunnel.

Those girls who can not keep their eyes away from the handsome nerdy guy in the library, please quit eye-f*cking the guy and make a move on him.

You know, any guy studying at the library on a regular basis is obviously unattached, plus this guy is a rather introvert student with not many close friends, so you definitely stand a pretty good chance of getting him, and you should really move quick, before anyone else approaches him.

Alright, just do it, girls. If not you will put me in a very difficult situation as you all distract me a lot. ;)

I broke up with 2 girls in 2 separate relationships and finally single after 7 years. I got together with the first girl at the end of our A-levels. She went to NTU while I was in the army and she was the steady one, always meeting me at Pasir Ris bus interchange when I book in to Tekong. When I finally ORD, she was near graduation and we thought we had everything planned out; a cosy 4-room HDB flat in Punggol and getting married after I graduate as well. Needless to say, when I got into uni and she started work, everything changes. Her peers at work got her to indulge in all the materialistic goods while I am caught up with school and camps. In the end we got distanced and both of us got someone else. We end our relationship of 5 years peacefully without much quarrels since we know that we had another person deep in our hearts. Now, girl 2 was my junior where I was OGL in one of the Freshmen orientation camps. She was a friendly person and chatty to every friends. That's probably how we got together anyway. Things turn sour during the exam last year and we finally ended our 1+ years of relationship as she feel that I am too over-bearing with how she talk to other guys.

So after so much adventure, I am now a 25 years old single virgin all over again.

From what I've observed, this is the usual "type" of girl that most guys will tend to chase (sometimes even multiple guys competing for the girl at the same time):
Slender to skinny body figure, "Innocent", Gullible, Soft Spoken, Dancer/Cheerleader type. Basically the type of girls that tend to reject guys a lot.  

Meanwhile, girls like myself, Curvier, Speaks for herself, have more Common interests and thus gets along better with guys, have no one chasing them, and we have to fight to get noticed. 

Seriously guys, stop chasing after the same person as the rest of the other guys, you're not going to get her because shes either attached or happily single.

Have all FoS guys vouched to stray away from feelings and relationships or is it the only guy I am interested in?

It seems to be that depression is a very very common syndrome among people nowadays, especially those our age. For those of you who have been through depression, I just want to know if you'll ever fully be free of it and how you've gotten out of those episodes, regardless of how much it recurs. 

I've been struggling with depression for three years now and when it was at its worst, suicide was always on my mind. I don't mind living with depression but when it begins to interfere with my motivation to work and fulfil my roles as a student/friend/etc. then it really gets crippling. I know speaking to a counsellor/therapist is pretty sound advice but it's been very hard for me to get an appointment and the last time I saw one, it was utterly meaningless. 
-
 
I got together with my girlfriend in nus and we were from the same clique. now having recently graduated, the clique of friends will be going for grad trip soon. but i am so not looking forward to it. for the past semester, i started a relationship with one of the girls in the clique, one which should not have even started. we both understand the rules of being friends with benefits, but things gonna be so awkward.. i guess you will probably read this and i hope that wont do anything during the trip that may make my gf to be suspicious. i really do not wish to hurt my girl.

I'm a straight guy. My best friend who is gay invited me to Pink Dot on 13th June. I'm not sure if I should go and don't know what to expect. As much as I want to support him, I'm worried if I meet people I know and they judge me.
-
 
Wanted to ask out a girl but then someone asked her out a few days before I did :(

The hard truth of an NUS life for me is this... 

Men cheat. Women cheat. I've been on an receiving end all the time. 

It's only one year later after graduation, that I realise that I was a deeply needy person back then - that caused all this to happen. 

It's alright. I don't pretty much give a damn about relationships anymore. 

Truth be told ever since I graduated from NUS, I haven't looked back all the relationships that I've been cheated of. 

It still hurts for sure, but that's the past. It's a learning process and I'm happily being who I am... 

... a player.

Hello, I'm a girl. All along I thought guys should be the one to take initiative in a relationship but after reading NUSWhispers I changed my mind. I'm not too sure what to do though, any advice on what I can do to 'take initiative' on a guy friend? Honest advices please! 
-
 
When it comes to relationships people are always so scared of the what-if’s that they forget the what-is. They spend so much time thinking, ‘What if I get hurt?’ and ‘What if it doesn’t work out?’ that they stop thinking about that things that are already real. They forget the feeling they get when the person they love walks into the room and the excitement that rushes through them when the phone rings because it might be the person they are waiting to hear from. Never let the fear of what-if stop you from letting yourself take a chance on love…because “what if” this is the person you’re destined to spend the rest of your life with?
-
 
To , same bro. My family member passed away during mid terms and I swear it is the worst feeling on earth. I almost wanted to take LOA for the semester. Couldn't study, couldn't sleep...yes time will pass but i guess we will never stop thinking of what we could have done more...

Treasure your family my NUS friends.
-
 
You didn't have to go crazy at me when my boyfriend rejected you. If I never existed, you wouldn't have been his type anyway. You should probably understand that.
-
 
I am completely and hopelessly in love with this girl. Problem is, she has a boyfriend. And oh yeah, I don't think she knows I exist. Please tell me I'm not a creep and stalker and others nurse hopeless crushes as well while conducting outstanding research on their hopeless crushes like me . For e.g. I just figured out which unit in army her boyfriend was in. Waayyy cooler than mine 
-
 
I am an evergreen Masters student who is socially awkward. I've been asking some of my friends for advice on girls but everyone seems to give a different opinion on whatever issue i bring up. For example, everyone gives a different idea when it comes to picking up girls, or different opinions on where is the best place to approach girls. Is there like some sort of manual that i can read to learn these things? Also if there are any girls out there who don't mind a nerdy, marvel fan, i am single. =D
-
 
Why do so many people in NUS have fwbs and casual sex partners? And multiple ones simultaneously. And without telling your other partners. Does sex and trust mean anything to these people? I hope most of you guys know that even oral sex spreads stds  (trust me, many people don't know)
-
 
Ever since that incident, I became weird. I started looking at guys from a different perspective. I lost interest in women. And this happened when I was in P4. A senior of mine whom I don't know started touching and squeezing my butt while I was peeing. When he discovered I was the wrong person, he quickly said sorry and left. But that left a huge impact on me. 

I feel disgusted about myself. What have I become? But I cannot help it. I just can't resist the desire.
-
 
to , personally i think that person is making use of you as a study buddy and chat buddy. whether you view it as a bad thing or not i shall leave it to your own perspective. however, if you were to ask me, i guess it would be good to remain friends with her for now and what not. be the nice guy a girl needs or wants in her life.
-
 
To  i've waited awhile to get this off my chest, and my darkest secret is that i masturbate too. What makes it even worse is that i'm an active church leader. Often i wonder if masturbation is a sin, or whether its simply another need. And fact is, im often riddled with guilt when i walk through church doors knowing that i just jerked off last night. Or when the pastor touches on themes like holiness. But behind my room doors, private browser comes on and i come on too... Just cant help it man.

This may be a bit hypocritical, since i didnt tell anyone, but if you havent done so already, maybe you should let your bf know? If he is a religious guy, he would know the constant struggle with sexual purity that all guys face, and would emphatise. 

P.S. If by any any slim chance you break up, i hope we find each other to 'help' one another out ;)
-
 
This semester, I learned that there is no such thing as a free lunch. 

There are only two reasons when people of the opposite gender are nice to you: to make use of you for their own benefits (to get assignment answers etc), or they want to be more than just friends with you. I defended from the former, but for the latter, I just let my guard down and we'd both be hurt later. 

This has happened one too many times. I'm now confused as to how I should treat the people around me. Is it really possible to find friends who are genuinely nice? 
-
 
Just being curious to know: should guys take initiative to begin a relationship? Is that true for saying: guys will looking for/ chasing after you if they really like you?
-
 
My girlfriend and I chose to have sex, not because we can't control our urges and wait till marriage but because we believe our wedding night will be better spent cuddling watching running man together than feeling frustrated and trying to have sex for the first time after a long day.
-
 
To , I turned 23 this year and never had any boyfriend all my life. You are not the only one. I think you are just confused now, but don't let yourself become more confused by believing what your friends said. Now that I am graduating, my chances of getting boyfriend in uni is diminishing. I am not expecting myself to get married because I am such socially awkward person that I will not be able to get close enough to any guy to verify if i truly like him.
-
 
Feels like I screwed up my second Sem. Though I still have my last paper. I feel a bit bad but really, I don't seem to have any damn motivation to chiong. Oh but this doesn't mean I've given up. The fight begins in the hall, after all. (Although this confession is anonymous, which to some extent means, low accountability, i find it weird that I keep editing it, as if someone is judging.)
-
 
I've really liked this girl for two years now, and would do anything and everything for her. I've imagined doing everything romantic with her. Problem is, she has a boyfriend.. and I don't want to make the first move for fear of damaging our relationship. At least I won't have to see her when I graduate :)
-
 
Just want to rant. I am a male. I see myself as an individual with high libido. I yearn for the pleasure that one can derive from sex and yet, I am holding myself back because of my ideals and commitment. I am not a religious person. Because of the struggle between my sexual desires and ideals, I am left with an unfulfilled sexual urge and a great sense of pride in myself. Is anyone going through similar stuff too? 
-
 
Anablepophobia - the fear of of looking up

Yup, that probably (partially) describes me. 
I know many people around  my faculty by face, but i am afraid to look up in case i bump into one of them. Some people in my faculty think i am socially awkward and kinda weird, and it has been said in front of me a few times (and rumours too). Over this sem, I have actually grown to be scared of people and drawing away from them. I feel so nervous and often look down, pretending to be using my phone. I dont think I am THAT socially awkward, i am just shy...? But once i step out my faculty to other places around school, the fear dispels a little. 

-
 
Honestly, is being despo wrong? :( Being evergreen, whenever I  see how other couples behaving so lovingly, I will always hope that I would be able to experience how it is like to be in love. :( sigh 
-
 
Guys in SoC and Engine, please stop hitting on every girl you meet even attached ones just because there are so few of us. I know you guys are predisposed by Mother Nature to be horny and desperate but please control yourselves. All your incessant attention is killing our interest in you. 
-
 
Everyone thinks I'm an innocent girl but my darkest secret is that I masturbate. He is a religious guy. He doesn't know but if he does, will he judge me for that? Don't really think it's neccessary for him to know yet but at the same time I don't really want to hide it from him. :/
-
 
Is it wrong to ask your TA out for a meal to get to know her better? We're same age and all and surely its alright?

my ex&i broke up a couple of months ago. the spark was because of his friend from lab. he said there was nth going on and she was a friend. 3 months down, he's now dating this particular friend. funny thing is how he used to bitch about her.
although we have broken up, i still had some hopes of us getting back together. i found out that the girl&him are going overseas tgt but yet i refused to believe they are actually tgt. i even went to ask if he is seeing anyone now, but he said he's too busy for that and i believed him. 
it was only when his friend came to tell me about the new girl my ex is dating that i finally let go of whatever hopes i had. what is consoling is that his friend also said our breakup is for the better, for my ex is not ready to settle and that he is only selfishly thinking about himself at this stage in life. i always knew my ex is quite a selfish person, but because i loved him, i didnt mind at all. 
although still feeling sad over the r/s because afterall, this would have been our 4th year together. but i'm also glad that it ended now, as compared to dragging it on any further. i'm glad he pulled the trigger, because i wouldnt have the courage to end a relationship. i dont really know how to stop caring for someone when over the years, he has already become like a family member.
if my ex is serious about the girl from lab he's dating now, then I sincerely wish them all the best. 
meanwhile I shall hold on to the faith that someone better will come along :)

Haizzz.... the moment when I realised that my answers which I thought were correct, turned out to be completely wrong. All hopes of getting an A are more or less lost. Just hope that the prof is kind enough......
-
 
I'm actually more than glad I'm leaving hall. Home is the best place afterall, away from all the bitching and silent hating. Hall sucks
-
 
Last paper on Monday, don't know whether to be happy that holidays is coming or nervous for exams :/
-
 
So exams are coming to an end and it would be nice to hang out with new people from other faculties. It kinda gets boring being stuck with the same social circle/ people after awhile. If you're up for it, comment below : )

PS, I'm a guy.
-
 
There this girl I really like. I enjoy hanging out with her and she's really nice to me. She has a boyfriend and I'm a girl. Is this wrong?
-
 
Do guys like girls making the first move? I have just broken up a while ago and this guy came helping me out and all that. However, after a long talk with him today, I realized that he is single and still looking for a relationship but he is also a player at the field. Though, he says he will commit if he have a gf. Should I make the first move?
-
 
Dear desperate single gals in their graduating semester,
the world outside of the NUS campus is not devoid of men.
Just sayin'..
-
 
My boyfriend is always busy, I don't mind that. But I've gotten a little suspicious these few weeks and scrolled through his whatsapp messages when he was bathing. I couldn't believe my eyes, there were some pretty saucy exchanges between him and guy 'A'. My boyfriend cheating on me, with this guy 'A'! How does this even work!? I don't even know how to be jealous, I'm sad that I've been used as his cover for 2 years. Anyone else had similar experiences?
-
 
I want to make a confession. I have a great crush on this Prof for this module in FoS. It is hard to find one Prof in FoS, and particularly my major, to has all his wonderful traits. He is charismatic, eloquent, super intellegent, confident, well-mannered and kind! For those k-drama addicts, the Prof is 99.99% similar to Do manager in "You who came from the star". Just so dreamy! 
Can someone advice me how to get into his research group for my Fyp?
-
 
I just want to apologise to my best friend. I kissed her lips for at least 3 times but I kept denying that I liked her. 

Yes, I liked you so much and I am sorry for not saying the truth. I was just so afraid that I would lose you if I confessed. I didn't lose you after I lied. But I lost myself for hiding this feeling.
-
 
 Move on if you haven't already done so, and if that is not the person you want to see yourself be for the rest of your life. Life isn't without struggles. Perhaps you'll eventually meet someone who will appreciate you for who you really are. It may be tough and may sometimes take a while, but I think love has that ability, to allow one to look pass the flaws and "hard facts" of another. I know I will :)

29-4-2015 will definitely be the saddest day of my life. I'm using NUSWhispers as a platform to vent out all my sorrows.

This is my story. I'm a guy that most guy will look down upon, I'm used to being called an "ah gua" since primary school. Unlike the normal conventional guy, i lack masculinity that most girls prefer. To make matters worse, my character and behavior are almost like a girl, because i grew with little interaction with other guys. My friend circle is always just made up of purely girls .Despite having female attributes, I have to tell you guys that I was never gay.

Although I'm a independent person, I do have mood swing sometimes(I confess that I cry a lot too)  and i wish that i have a gf to comfort me and protect me. Sounds like what a girl wants right? Most guy will start judging me and hurl insults at me, but I'm alright... my heart is already numb to all these abuses. 

Most of you will laugh at me and say that I'm a dreamer, truly I don't believe that any girl will love me too. But GOD is really kind to me. He answered my prayers and sent me the women that changed my life forever. Let's call her Jane ( I don't want to reveal her real name), I met Jane from my SS mod. She is a strong women, decisive and full of bright ideas. We started calling each other every single night and chat till 3am, she will always console me whenever I'm crying. She will also knock my head softly when i do or say something stupid, she is a pretty rough girl isn't it? =). She can be quite fierce too, there was once, she confronted a group of young boys who called me "bapok", I was so shocked then! Whenever Jane is around me, I feel so safe and secure. I told myself "this must be my true happiness".  I wish that time can freeze and we remain happy forever. But fate is really cruel,  Jane got struck by cancer. She lost 14 kg in 5 months and lost all her hair, which I always like to play around with. Ever since then, I have been putting up a brave front when I'm around her, in order to motivate her.However she soon found out that I was frequently crying outside the hospital ward. She knocked my head again and said "silly, I'm not going to die" ,and gave me a faint smile. After 11 months of fighting and suffering, she finally left the world today ... leaving me behind.

Thank you Jane, my love. Thank you for coming into my life. Thank you for making me cry a lot lesser and laugh a lot more. 谢谢你，让我知道世界上还有人会爱丑小鸭，爱 ah gua. I will remember all your advice, from today onwards I will be a stronger man and stop crying. I promise!

 We do not all see guys for their money. I am not speaking for myself only, I believe, or I hope, when I say that I find money to be the least attractive thing about men. I'm an independent woman, if I want something, I work for it. There's more I would want from any relationship than money. Maybe some girls would love a guy who takes them shopping and to expensive restaurants. I personally prefer the guy to just make an effort to spend time with me so that I can respond likewise. If all the women around you are looking for expensive dates, I think you're looking in the wrong place. There's another post recently about men being visual creatures and girls having to work out to attract guys. Frankly, I don't care, I may be slightly plump but I love what I do here in uni, I work with and get to know people who value my opinion and I believe it's better to let your personality shine through. What makes you think your looks are average anyway? Did you conduct a survey? Although I agree that looking decent is important, being healthy is important but it's ok to be yourself and it's ok to hate exercise. I prefer to roll with it;)
-
 
 Dun worry... Many people do feel that way including myself when strangers say that. However, I feel you should not feel so about guy friends cos it is just a harmless compliment. Just b'cos they praise your appearance, it does not mean they do not like you for who you are :D

I am a freshman and I did not join any orientation activities. So I do not have any friends that I hang out with all the time. Therefore, I eat alone during lunch and I do not give a s***.

I am secretly happy when friends that I borrowed their notes from, score worst then me in exam.

To the girl who looked lost and asked my for directions while on campus. When I decided to spend some time walking you to you destination so that you would not get lost, it was also because I thought you were really cute and wanted more from you besides the simple thank you. Otherwise did you think I was willing to be late for my own class? smh.

I am going on a grad trip soon with a group of 'friends'. However, there are some people on that group whom I really cannot stand. I don't know why I agreed to go with them on the first place. I feel like I do not fit in well and the worst part is that we have already booked our flight and tickets. 

I hope everything goes well or I am just going to be miserable on that whole trip. And I hope that 'that person' does not piss me off with his stupid jokes and lame attempt to make the whole group laugh by doing stupid things..otherwise it is on baby.
-
  
To 

Totally similar experience. Graduated senior who seems like he is sometimes interested and sometimes not. So i went ahead and flashed a big hint and got back a hint thats reflects his disinterest. 

My advice is: if you have to guess, he's probably not interested. Some guys are just enthu and random in nature. It's gonna be obvious to a girl if a guy likes her. You can still try though, well at least you tried even if it doesn't work. But our friendship was awkward after and we haven't been talking for months. So, it's all about risk taking and whether you feel comfortable and appropriate to confess. Good luck!

Mother's day is coming so ill share my story. I grew a pot of herb. They are small about 1-2 months old but edible like basil. This morning my mother asked if she could cut a few leaves for cooking. Sure I said. But I came home to 5 stumps because my mother cut all of them.

Anyway at first I was sad and feeling dumb. This is my mother's way of reminding me:
1. If you love something that much never trust another person to take care of it. 
2. Someone whom you love and trust can and will betray you, even if they are suppose to be kind, loving, etc.

So to all of you out there who has a lovely mother, appreciate her more often. As for me, I guess should just suck it up and plant a new pot.

I did not attend the last two tutorials for a module as I was busy rushing my FYP. I thought no one would be willing to share the answers with me as it was a dog-eat-dog world.

I was so desperate that I added an acquaintance in class on Facebook and asked him for it. He was extremely nice and sent me the answers.  I wanted to repay him for the favour but he replied that "help is freely given". 

I'm extremely touched by his kind gesture. Hope that we all do well for our paper tomorrow (:

I'm a girl from SOC who just finished her last final exams in NUS. Looks and figure wise, I consider myself slightly above average only but not so much that I attract too much attention generally except in SOC. I would probably be nothing if I'm in FASS. Even so, let me recall dating record, 7 propositions from guys in SOC throughout my 4 years, one from FASS and one from Business. I dated 2 guys from SOC for just 6 months in total, FASS guy for 6 months and the Business guy for my final year. We are still together.
Now, this is generalisation, but I feel being in a male-dominated faculty like SOC or Engin really makes me feel like a piece of meat being mentally undressed wherever I go for classes. I seemed to get most of the attention and hence switch off from SOC guys totally. All the SOC guys who propositioned me are either ugly immature nerds or are just plain jocks who chose SOC only because it was the only course they could get with their results. There seems to be a variance between the the number of eye-candies in Business/FASS vs Computing/Engin.
I dated the 2 guys in the hope that their hearts are better than their outside appearances. Sadly, it was not the case. They are more willing to spend time understanding their video games and computers more than they spent understanding me or women in general. Come on, even though unlike most girls, I know programming and algorithms, must you discuss those topics again outside class? Women are not like logical machines, we need the emotional connection.
Dress sense in SOC is clearly no where near the league as in Business for example. Even on important presentations, most of you dress worse than a Business student in his slackest days. In fact, I got weird comments for overdressing when my group of guys chose to present in their shorts and slippers.
I find Business and FASS guys way more articulate and mature. Their command of English seems light years ahead compared to the stuttering nerds. Business guys especially, seem to have the aura of ambition that SOC students seem to lack. They can voice out their inner thoughts and emotions much better, know how to cheer me up when I'm down etc. It seems all the SOC guys are horny copies of each other whereas the non-Science guys have a more unique flavour to them. About the FASS guy, it was only because his parents didn't approve of us because of differing religions.
Fitness wise, I seem to feel that Computing guys are not as physically fit in general. I know they are exceptions so don't flame me, its just that the majority are short, skinny, nerdy dudes who seriously need more time out in the sun and on the track than behind the screen. Business guys seem to be taller, more buff and give me the feeling of protection.
Oh and finally the fun part, the sex bit. I admit my sample size is small, but from the 4 guys I had, the FASS guy was the most creative (sorry my bf, but thats true) followed by my current bf with the 2 SOC guys far behind. I chalk it up to them being inexperienced virgins and if they have, its probably from porn. I know the argument, you can't get better without more experience but seriously as a girl with modern sexual needs, I don't care about your excuse of me being your first gf. It just proves how much of a loser you are for being a virgin or having your first relationship only in Uni. Either you give me a good time or I show you the door, the fairer sex is the one that decides when to spread our legs for you so we make the rules. My rule is that you don't waste my time learning on the job, you better know how to do yours before you start. Your learning should have started on innocent girls from your JC or poly. Imagine applying for a a fresh grad job when you are in your 40s. Uni girls like me have higher expectations of sex as we climb the academic ladder and gain more sexual experience.
So as a piece of advice to girls in NUS, date FASS and business guys. They are more mature, posses greater awareness of the real world outside the land of the Matrix and communicate better with you. Poor communication in a relationship is as good as bad or no communication. Sex with SOC guys, totally cmi, feel more like an emotionless porn actress after the act.
For my final advice to my male SOC mates before I leave, watch less porn and jerk off less, it is not only bad for you, its totally inaccurate. Dress better, go to the gym more often, take up those CELC speaking and writing classes then maybe you stand a better chance with women in the dating game. Remember, computers don't propagate your genes, women do.
#from a girl who actually feels disadvantaged in the dating game in the land of nerdy guys with so few eye-candies.

One of those awesome things about being a loner - I can do all the odd stuff I want. I wander off to places where I can hide, and I don't feel the need to make a conscious effort to fit in. I don't need to be around large groups of people, which makes me extremely stressed for some reason. 

However, having said that, it does feel very lonely to be a loner. I don't interact well with people, I cannot make jokes like many other people, I seem highly unapproachable and creepy because of the odd things I do, and the odd behaviours I exhibit, when I am under stress.

I don't mind company, but I do mind the fact that I feel obliged to try to entertain my company, by constantly trying to talk to the person. If you attempt to reach out to me suddenly, I really don't know how to react and give a proper response.

At this juncture, it really does seem that the best company for me is a probably a Lego figurine, or a stuffed toy.

I'm on my journey of self-discovery.

Before matriculating, I thought that I'd get into a relationship pretty quick, judging from the hive of activity 'confessed' at NUS Confessions. Now I'm a 3rd year engineering student still looking for my love...

 I am indeed sorry to hear of your predicament.

I am a guy, and certainly have not gone to the point of having a bf/gf relationship. I understand what you are going through. It is very hurtful, and hard to confess to anyone because of the stigmatisation towards human pleasure.

Just don't get into trouble. Some guys would love this kind of girl, take full advantage and leave you with big trouble later. ;)

Have you ever feel so tired that you don't feel like resting at all? It's like you got your engine started but you don't know how to turn it off even though it is obviously tearing down. So I kept on walking, to and fro the mini mart, just to make myself feel a little better so that I have a reason not to look at the books.

Hey, I know I should be studying now. But I can't. I fell in love with my own best friend (we are both girls). I guess I figured it out when we were hugging in my room and I ended up kissing her lips. We were both laughed and thought it was an accident. But I lied to her and actually I did it on purpose. That happened several times. And now we still like to hugs and kiss each other cheeks. There is no point confessing as she said she is straight and she had boyfriends before.

There's this girl that has been chasing me for a while now. She's asked me out like 3-4 times, keeps throwing compliments my way, and gets quite jealous when I so much as talk to other girls; asking me stuff like "Do you like X" when i sit next to X in class, and so on. The only thing is that I have no romantic interest in her; we became friends only because of a shared hobby. 

I keep turning down her advances, but she seems to be unwilling or unable to take the hint. How do I get her to stop chasing me? I don't want to hurt her feelings by telling her bluntly, but I fear there may be no other alternative...

Can we have a "Haolian"/"Boast" category for confessions? I think there are too damn many boastful confessions especially after seeing the MA1506-related confessions.

In order to prevent yourself from falling into friendzone, you have to pick up flirting skills. If your conversation with the girl are mainly related to studies, school etc. and nothing else, you will never ever break the "friend barrier". Girls do not like to hear all these boring topics. Entice them with exaggerating sweet talks even though it may not be true. 

There's a saying, " Girls love to hear sweet lies".
Inflate them with all these sweet lies and coat their minds with sugar, she will fall in love with you deeply.

This method is 100% effective to evergreen girls. They will believe whatever you say and promise =)

For attached girls in an affair with another guy, don't ever trust his words on loving you and rescuing you from your current relationship. Chances are that he just enjoys the sex you are giving him and possibly the kick he gets out of knowing that you use the same pair of lips to kiss your boyfriend after sucking him off shortly before.

Besides, if you ever left your boyfriend for him, he will ask you, "If you can leave your current boyfriend for me, why would you not leave me for another guy next time?" The poison/doubt/rot is set in from day 1.

Trust me, because I am a guy, and I asked the very same question to the attached girl. Thank goodness it is over now.

 I lost a good number of friends because of r/s gone wrong. I don't know if some folks will ever get over it. So maybe the real sign of getting over the r/s is just not realising the existence of a previous r/s. You know, it's like, if you look like you hate someone, deep down, you might still have feelings for him/her, but if you don't even care a damn, the heart is truly dead towards him/her.

I've an idea for a new nus app.. Maybe someone can design a 'meal buddy' app where people can form/find groups of several people (say, 4?) with similar interests to have lunch together in school. No one should be left out eating alone! It's a good way to meet new people too. Let's create a friendly and fun NUS!

This is a long one. Guys mention about being friendzoned, being afraid to ask the girl as they are not sure if she seems them as only a friend or more. Well I would, JUST ASK and do it sooner than later. Why?

Say you know a girl for like 5-6 months, you see her as more than a friend, you have feelings for her. Just tell her in person what you feel. Pros: TADA gf. Cons: It probably would probably become awkward as hell and u 2 might even stop talking. No daily SMS-es, not seein her smile on a daily basis and basically becoming strangers. Is it worth it? hell yes. Because you were being honest to yourself and to her. She isn't a mind reader to know how u feel if u don't tell her. And the longer u wait before asking her it just becomes even more harder to get over her if eventually you do ask and it is negative. The consequences are painful but time will do its magic. Join ccas, hang out with other friends, focus on studies/passion, hit the gym whatever. Occupy yourself. You will move on. You may even meet another girl and she could be the one. The longer you wait to ask, the longer the healing process and I highly doubt by just being around her she will magically one day know your feelings for her and say yes. So just be honest to yourself and to her. Don't be afraid of losing her as a friend, since you always saw her as more than a friend :)

Don't act like you have done nothing wrong and post 'I am innocent but it's okay' kind of messages on social media. Perhaps you have no idea how traumatizing your action was. I was indifferent to it, but now I can't help venting.

I'm a Year 3 student.

I like girls.

But I'm a girl.

Should I continue to live the rest of my life in order to maintain my existing friends? Find a boyfriend and get married. I still can't discount the possibility that I might find a guy who I can bond with on a deep emotional level but it'll never be a bond that is physically and sexually fulfilling. Divorce is unacceptable especially if we end up having kids.

Being in Singapore means its tough to avoid homophobic friends, means saying that 'I'm a girl' can only come with a 'but' after 'I like girls'.

Do I be who I am?

It isn't a simple choice.

I hope I'm not alone on this.

From what I observe, Arts students are the most difficult to befriend with (as compared to any peoples but Biz people, because from what I know, they have quite a reputation). I have roamed the places frequented by Arts students, in particular UTown and FASS for the whole year, and from what I see, the girls are all fashionable, always hanging with a look-alike friend(s), and chatting happily. None of them seems...available for a new friend or one with different taste of fashion, height, or IDK, a different look? As for the guys...hmm...I assume most have already had some girl friends or well, committed themselves to befriending some popular girls. Maybe it's just me and my stereotyping fashionistas as aloof or unfriendly, but really, after taking a few modules in Engineering and Science, I felt college less suffocating and isolating, in a sense that the girls there are more homely looking and thus, approachable .... Sorry don't bash me...Some girls in Arts are also adorable...I was talking about those who live their stereotypes :(

There is a perfect girl of my dreams whom I knew through a mutual someone. We talked online regularly for some months but all this stopped after I did not initiate, because I was afraid that I was being bothersome. Neither did she start any topic.

"I have died everyday waiting for you."

I missed those times when you felt so close. But We met at the wrong time I guess.

As a procrastinating (graded) exchange student, I want to offer alla y'all a little bit of love advice from across the pond, which me and my friend epiphanised the other night.

1. As long as you are not obvious about your stalkery, boys, you can woo waaaay more girls than you thought possible, just by paying attention to them. Honestly - a gal's perception of you will change if you make them feel wanted. Literally, any guy. It's properly easy, and even though I'm not one to stereotype, it's tried and tested. Just be nice and gentlemanly, and the worst thing that could happen is that you have a nice friendship with a nice girl. Just ask her for lunch one day, or offer to buy her a Starbucks if you're a classy guy who has money to burn.

2. Girls, unbeknownst to you (or even them) it is possible for you to get any guy you want, or at least a nice one who you are pleased with. If you show confidence in yourself, and that you're comfortable in your own appearance (regardless of your appearance, honestly) and personality, you will ultimately succeed in the game of luuuurve. I know it's easier said than done, but if you act like you are the most awesome person ever, people will start to believe it, despite their own thoughts. Mind over matter, folks.

I don't understand how there are so many couples here - everyone appears to be so shy! But don't fret, follow my advice, and you will prevail. 

P.S. Apparently guys don't really like girls wearing make-up, and most of the time they can't even tell the difference (so why waste your time and pores?)

P.P.S. In terms of your chances with the exchange students, the poorly (yet so accurately) termed "yellow fever" definitely kicked in a good month or two ago, and what with the end of term swiftly approaching, alongside a whole lotta time to fill with procrastination, now is the perfect time to romance an international hottie. And they will definitely appreciate a free coffee cos now they're poor AF.
-
  
why is it that guys think its okay if they're not virgins but not okay if girls aren't? What makes it right for guys to impose such judgement on the opposite gender? 

it's kind of sad that girls even think of themselves as "second hand" and guys can joke about things like master key and shitty lock. something is very wrong with how some guys/our society think if girls should have to feel ashamed of not being a virgin while guys can boast about not being one. we really need to rethink how we label others.

Got to know this guy and he's kinda cool and all. But he smokes, just a random question when he is planning to stop smoking bacause he freaking told me that he knows it's bad. But he obviously is in love with his ciggs and gave me the cold shoulder. I said sorry then asked to meet then I think I did'nt ask nicely or whatever. Cold shoulder again. I am rude and he is so sensitive. Relationships are just freaking complicated. srs

Reply to 
It really depends on the guy. I for one, wouldn't mind entering into a sexual relationship with a woman who's a 'second-hand good'. I mean it's supremely unfair to slap that tag on someone without an inkling of the circumstances behind their 'first night' and generalise her as being promiscuous or loose.

P.S. and yes, I have done it with such a woman before. Even though we have since gone our separate ways I think her having prior sexual experience made my first night slightly less awkward and as prone to making amateurish mistakes on bed :)

To ,

Oh come on, all these expectations on guys to be fun, interesting and aggressive in asking girls out on a date is so borderline sexist please. 

If a guy expects a girl to be demure, receptive and submissive, I bet that guy will be burned on a stake faster than you can say "chauvinist". So much for #heforshe 

Anyway, serious and emotionally mature guys can be equally amazing too!

The irony of having lots of acquaintances yet so few are close friends. Spending time in solitude has become a norm especially after college life started. You attend lectures with a bunch of friends, join numerous events, know lots of people from various faculties, yet none is considered close. Friends ditch you when they have more important things to deal with. None show p at times when you need them. Indeed, nobody could have 100% of his/her time to you, yet having to spend a day without saying a word/making any contact with another human being is unhealthy.

Yes  I do enjoy solitude, but perhaps human are just social creatures. Prolonged periods of alone time are unbearable. At times you are glad to be independent and just spend some time with yourself, at times you will start to feel the loneliness creep in bit by bit till it consumes you. And the latter just gets worse in this stressful period of finals preparation. 

A universe full of humans/lives. A world just with myself.

I am feeling very conflicted about my emotions for a week now. For now  I try not to think about the things that have happened. My close friend had suddenly passed away, I don't know what to make of it and I'm still seeking for a closure. 

Sometimes, the images of us having fun together in our past adventures just flood into my mind without a warning, I would almost break down immediately in tears while studying in the library. 

It would mean a lot to me if you guys can post some encouragements on this post, just to get me through until I go for some counselling. Hopefully I don't need them. 

Thanks in advance :)

I really enjoy attending lessons because of my tutor. Does it make sense if you find someone attractive because he's so smart?

J and I met in army. We were officer cadets in the same wing. We bumped into each other at the sauna where we talked. Just talked. Over the next few months, we got to know to each other better and soon, found ourselves falling in love with each other. Our relationship went well for first year, but spiralled in its second year.

I was addicted to alcohol. It started in army. My weekends revolved around opened bottles and loud music at the clubs with my camp mates. J hated it when I arrived at his place drunk. I would get so high that I don't even remember the events of the night. Things get so dark when I drink. I lose control of myself and I get violent. My friends and I were Attica one night. J was there too. I drank too fast and too much. J, being the caring boyfriend he was, told me to stop. When I refused and chided him for overreacting, he forcibly took the bottle out of my hand. I got angry at him for that, and made my way out of the club (miraculously given how drunk I was). J followed me closely behind. When I told him to fuck off and leave me alone, he wouldn't, and I guess I lost all rationality and punched him in the face. I don't remember what happened after that, but I awoke in his bed the next morning.

I apologised for my behaviour, for which he accepted the apology. But that unfortunately was just the beginning of things which eventually drove him to end our relationship. When he told me I needed help that he couldn't give me on his own, I knew I had lost the most important person in my life.

J entered NUS soon after we finished army whereas I deferred an additional year off to get the help that I needed. I'm happy to say that I'm a year sober now. I contacted J last night for the first time since we ended army and we arranged to have coffee at Starbucks U-town, where I am due to matriculate in August this year.

"You look good," he said.

"Thanks," I replied in kind. A long pause ensued. "You look well too."
I related to him that I've been a sober a year now. He was happy for me that I had my issues sorted. He apologised for not sticking through, but said that he was at his wits end, and he didn't know what else to do to help me. I assured him that he had nothing to apologise for; that his decision to leave me was just what I needed to put my life together again.

"Love forgives, love forgives immeasurably," he said. J and I decided to have another go at the relationship again. Clean slate, we agreed. I am hopeful — no, I am certain — that this time, I will treat him better. I can't deny that there are times when I desire a sip — he's well aware of this — of a drink, but I'm well equipped to know that I can stay away for it.

This is probably not the right place to post this, but I really hope someone can help me. My sister has been cutting herself for the past few years, we found out about it early on and she has promised to stop. But we suspect the truth is that she never stopped and always tries to hide it from us. We tried to ask her what the problem was, but she refuses to tell us.
Her tweets are very worrying and I don't know how to help. I think she's facing a problem that she can't solve, but she doesn't want to tell anyone. Every day I fear that she will one day not be able to take it anymore and end her life. I really want to help her but I have no idea what to do. She does not to see a psychiatrist.
I'm posting this here in hope of finding someone who has similar experiences and is willing to share or know someone that can help.

She's well liked by guys and even girls. I want to approach her but don't know how. She's an incredible girl, while I'm just...your average nerd...not incredible...

"You will definitely find a boyfriend when you go to university because there will be a lot of desperate army boys!" . Well friends, it's almost been a year, and I think this is bullshit.
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

I think I'm in love, for the first time in 21 years.

Every semester for the past three years, without fail, I would have crushes on the TAs and/or GAs.  But it's so sad that I only get to see them for one semester because they are graduating already. I miss my CS1020 tutor the most. J, hope you're doing well.
So there is this senior, who has been always helping me since we barely know each other when I first came to NUS. He has his girlfriend and we all know each other. He seems to be nice to everyone but I feel that he pays some special attention to me. I do not know how he feels about me, and I am not sure whether I like him or not. Nevertheless I really enjoy being together with him, but I will not be staying in hall next year.
I feel like now, with all the progressiveness, that it is more socially acceptable to just say I'm asexual. At least, rather that than admit to a terrible truth that I try to deny: That my standards may be a tad too high for my own good. 

At least, people find you a lot less of a b***h/arrogant if you say 'I may be asexual, I don't know' compared to 'I just haven't found someone I respected enough to really have a crush/fall in love with.' At least I don't get reactions like 'Well maybe you should stop having such high expectations/be so stuck up/idealistic.'

Ok, so respect may be the wrong word. Something closer would be admire with more than a point of passing interest. And so I pretend to have frivolous crushes on people that most people find good looking (and objectively, they are) but I absolutely feel nothing for. I don't even find them attractive. 

It's not like I don't want to try either, but feelings are hard things to fabricate and I find it far more cruel to lead a poor guy/girl going on a date on hoping I'd finally have feelings. With all due respect to everyone I have amazing friends and meet wonderful people in my life but it feels so hard to form connections that are beyond friendship. Trust them with my life? Yes. To bail me out of jail if I do stupid things? Yes. With my heart? Absolutely not romantically. So maybe I need a reality check, but I a) Don't fangirl over any celebrities, singers, bands, actors or otherwise. b) Don't really fall in love with fictional characters in anime/movies/books beyond really rooting for them against their enemies. (For instance, I adore Tyrion but marrying the man? Never.) 

Yet I know I am not fully asexual because I have been capable of having a crush once, and it's not like I was burnt, I simply fell out of my crush once I wrote down a confession speech and everything and realised that I just didn't feel it anymore. 

So now I'm stuck. I'm okay with living happily alone till old age, but I do wish I can genuinely join in or empathise when people have relationship woes. It makes me feel like a terrible human being when I catch myself thinking 'She/he can do better' or 'Eh, if you want to settle he/she's a good choice.'

I was about to start a romance when finals suddenly came. Oh I feel like stuck.
Anyone else wishes you make new friends in college that willingly take a GEM with you, sit with you in lectures and lunch with you? :( Feeling so lonely without a clique here
I've been in love with her for so long, but I watched her get together with him and watched him hurt her. All these while, I never dared to tell her how much I love her and how much I wanted to protect her all my life. I remember how she came crying to me, asking me for help and I was as heartbroken as her. I wanted to give him a beating so badly but I never had the courage to stand up for her. I hope that one day, I will get to tell her how I feel before she leaves for SEP. By then, I hope she will accept my request to join her in Shanghai. I don't know how she will respond to my sudden confession, but I know that deep within my heart, even if she rejects me, she will always be that important someone in my heart. I hope you see this, and realise its you I'm talking about. You have such a beautiful smile which I want to keep there forever. When will I ever find that courage?
I feel like the reason Nus confessions died off pretty quickly was that unless some other countries in Singapore there is only so many things to confess to. Nobody in their right mind is going to confess to taking hard drugs with a death penalty hanging over their heads. And while drunken stories and partying definitely occur there is relatively far fewer of them to confess to real debauchery like cheating or orgies or messy break ups  or whatever people get up to that needs confessing without mentioning specific circumstances that narrows people down and loses the anonymity.   So we are left only to confess about crushes which is sweet but gets stale after a while or bitch about group mates. And even then it wears thin because of corse everyone's crushes is unique and something beautiful but it is the same boy meets girl or girl meets boy and they are too shy so too bad you're Gonna miss the girl/guy. There is only so much variation. Here's to Hoping whispers will last longer.

There's this girl in my CCA who's smile I just can't get over, it's too beautiful. Though I think I'm not well liked by her, I guess looking whenever she smile is good enough.
Hey CAPT girl :) I just wanted to say that I love the way you smile and laugh, how you're always the life of the party, and most of all, that you're so bubbly and pretty that each time I see you, my heart skips a beat.

I'd never dare to introduce myself to you in real life, so I guess I'm stuck looking at you through my binoculars.
To the group of guys who always talk about sex-related stuff. I hope you do realize that I am still a girl.
I have a crush on this graduating senior but I just don't have the courage to own up. The thing is that he is my TA and I see him once a week. Now that the semester is ending, I may not get to see him anymore. Should I confess to him?
