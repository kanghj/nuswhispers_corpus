Hi admins pls don't delete this! Really need some advice from chemical engineering seniors! Is 'A' Levels physics and math important for the course? If so which topics should i revise on? Just a little paranoid from not using my brains for 2 years~

Is anyone else panicking because this is the last week of school and finals are coming and deadlines are upon me and I don't know what's going on pls halp

What is with the hate for GER by certain people? 
Honestly, while GER is not perfect yet due to it being a first year implementation, the topics taught is generally very easy to do. The tutorials are also quite manageable, with only once every 2 weeks. MCQ for finals, can just shade and go. Most importantly, have u had any module under GE that has such a light project workload? 1 poster and 1 synposis, that is all you need. 

Feel free to comment back with hard facts, but I seriously think subsequent years they should ban GER from being an S/U module due to its simplicity and the people who just abuse their S/U for this module and not bother to study or learn from it.

it sucks to know that you're at the very bottom of the class, even more so when they perform so much better than you and you cannot compete with them at all. You know what? screw this module. Why bother putting in the effort anyway? F**k it.

My prof told me that I missed 6 deadlines.

I asked if I could still get my A

He asked me if jet fuel melt steel beams

I think that's a hint. Maybe that's a question I should prepare for my Engineering Thermodynamics finals

Ever realize how hostels have been earning poor students' money? 

If we check out early, we will not get compensated. If we check out late, we get penalties. If we check in to a room early next semester, we have to pay extra and usually they will stipulate that the official check in date is one day before class starts, which most people especially international friends will have to pay for the "early check in" because they simply can't check in a day before. Well done admission services.

Hi Guys, I want to take up some part time job stints, eg. working for a startup to gain experience and get paid a some stipends. Which websites are you guys using currently other than going to career centre?

I just heard that Yale-NUS students have a different honours system. Apparently, they're going for SMU's Latin honours system. However, since there are reports of grade inflation, only 35% of their student body will get honours. I wonder what the average and median grade there is. Perhaps we should also take more of their classes because I heard they are not curved, and that most people typically get A-/B+.

I know one guy who does not have a 'career'. He is an antifragile guy. He took risks and started companies. And he doesn't have a monthly salary. He lives simple. So girls find it unstable to be in relationship with him. It took him ten years to find some success. Now he have enough fuckyou money. But through out these years, he doesn't have a girlfriend. Most Singaporean girls very short sighted. Bo bian. He still pretend to be poor in order to avoid gold-diggers.

Here I am finishing up my final semester. I too entered nus with a spark glimmering through my eyes.
I have high expectations for the future and believe that anything is possible if i put in my fair share of hard work.
I see the same spark through the eyes of the freshmen. They have hope, ambitions and dreams that they too want to achieve.

Through the course of 4 years, I slowly lost that spark that kept me going. Reality sank in and academia proved too rigorous for the untrained mind. 

I've learnt, I've grown and I've matured.
But i lost that spark.
Retain it, if you can.

As an engineering student, I have some advice to juniors.

All juniors (especially girls!) coming into NUS (or NTU, for that matter), since things are cyclical, the next really profitable career (and good degree) will be in engineering. In the USA, engineers earn much more than in SG. Just like how IT jobs are in demand now, we can expect an adjustment in salary for engineering grads (after the banking and IT bubble bursts!). Join engineering!

Sudden realisation. Next sem I should overload, take part in more activities, be more active in cca, be in the exco. So that I won't have time for projects and other commitments like now.

I concur with the view that some law students are elitist, despite being a law student myself. However, this elitist bunch is an exceedingly small minority as the rest of us are just not bothered about such whether-we-are-superior-or-inferior comparisons. Once, I was on the receiving end of such elitist snobbery before.

There was this Sunday when I decided to make a quick trip back to Bukit Timah Campus to pick up some notes from my locker. As the locker was located on the upper floors, I took the lift up. There was this other girl (who was carrying a law textbook) who shared the same lift with me.

In the lift, the girl looked at me and started giving me the wtf-are-you-doing-in-this-campus look. I, not realising what was wrong, gave her the hey-this-is-my-campus-too look. When we exited the lift and went down different sides of the corridor, it dawned on me that I was wearing my sibling's IFG t-shirt and my sibling was from another non-medicine faculty.

It clicked at that point in time - she mistook me as from being another non-medicine faculty by virtue of me wearing an IFG shirt from another non-medicine faculty. Why the emphasis on non-medicine? Well, it is because of this implicit recognition among such elitists that medicine students are as elite as, if not more elite than, said elitists.

It is to be emphasised that such elitist law students remain the exceedingly small minority, but they are enough to give the rest of us bad names.

I found out the difference between a top university like Oxford and a local university like NUS. Oxford aims to make their students learn from their mistakes instead of penalizing them. There are smart tutors to help you whatever you encounter a problem. Whereas NUS focus more on grading without caring about whether a student really learned.

My CS friend was boasting about the AAA entry grades and high starting salaries of CS people. Given the end of Moore's Law, I seriously doubt computing is a field that will continue to innovate in the long term. 

Programming skills are seriously easy, anyone can pick up it up. The fact is you don't need a CS degree to pick up a coding job. Outsourcing is common too. Any programmer in India or China can do your work at a fraction of your pay. With the upcoming O Level computing subject and increase in coding literacy, coding will become like reading and writing. Commonplace skills that society will soon commodotise. Do you hire someone to transcribe letters for you anymore?

The bubble will burst soon. People were hyping CS careers just before the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s. For the sake of you long-term career, pick up a general degree like business or down-to-earth engineering degrees like EE or Mech. Engineering graduates can always switch to programming if they want to but no CS graduate can ever switch to EE.

The saddest thing I feel, as science students, is that we may not get the job in related field and in the end, do something unrelated. Unless you're super smart to do master of Ph.d

FYI: If you're an SoC student who intends to graduate using IA under SIP, you MUST start in the summer of your Year 2 if you want to graduate on time. If you finish SIP in the summer of Year 4, you have to stay on for 1 semester.

If you just realised this, you have until April 29th to look for an internship.

getting a degree today is actually quite dumb

most degree don't let you learn a technical skill unlike those taught in the ITE like plumbing, hair stylist and cooking class

when times are bad, your toilet still choke, your hair still grows and needs to be cut and you need to nom nom everyday

Getting a general degree or going to business school hoping to become rich just don't work anymore as there are more degree holders than jobs avaliable

the public sector is taking up the slack by increasing the defence budget to hire degree holders whom otherwise be unemployed

but if you have not notice that singapore has been in deficit for 2 years if you do not count the contribution from GIC and Temasek

i question the contribution from GIC and Temasek as they state as long term adjusted return

the current return could be negative but not disclosed but we can see it reflected in our currency as it has plunged against RM and USD

Really hate it when group members are not willing to do projects despite being asked many times. Don't they know this project will affect their scores too? Or they simply don't give two sh*ts about it? It is even weirder that some of these people have CAP 5.

I am an exchange student currently studying in NUS. I happened to pass by Engineering School today and it was heartening to see students giving out free ice cream and merchandises to people today. This really shows a lot about this school where students take initiatives to approach other students and brightening up their day in this stressful environment. Kudos to whichever society it is !

Hi! I'm a yr1 bioeng student, and am interested in going for NOC to stockholm since there's alot of biotech startups there right? Do any of you know if it's okay to go for NOC to replace the industrial attachment in yr3 and do we have to take up the language mod or knowing English would suffice? Thanks!!!

I realised one thing while doing a lab with seniors. It's better to do things with people that you don't know than to do it with people that you know. Cos if you know the people, you take them for granted, asking them to do more stuff. But if you don't know the people, you will be paiseh to ask them to do more stuff, and that's when things get evenly distributed and tasked, which really speeds up the process.

I hope to use this channel to spread an important message to all. Please know that eng+@domain is hacked, any messages sent will also meant more spams to everyone set in the list. 

Please kindly STOP being idiots by replying or having fun using the email. You are adults, be more mature and stop complaining about the spam when you are one of the spammers cause of the settings. Just wait patiently for the school to do something about it. 

As for NUS com centre & IT, it is understandable that you have been sending few emails in the past saying the removal of the virus folders BUT it will be better if you close down the whole email = invalid, thus no more spams. 

As for the department, if could be done, please assist in anyway appropriate, being silent doesn't really help. Greatly appreciated if some actions are taken.

Hi I really need some help and hope admin wont filter this.

I currently have a few free apps in the appstore and are generating revenue through ads and Im paid monthly via bank acc. I would like to ask if I need to register a company e.g sole proprietorship for this case(apps), and if the revenue earned is taxable. The audiences for the apps are all across the globe, and more than half are not from singapore.

Tried googling alot including iras and acra but cant really get the answers.. really hope someone could enlighten me as I would not like to get into trouble with the law. Thanks!

Not from NUS(from another local Uni), but I've been together with 2 girls from NUS. One is from NUS Business and the other is from Engineering and I've got to say that the girls from NUS know how to have fun. I have heard from some friends in NUS that the girls there bring a lot of drama but I Guess if you're in it for something casual, why not right?

So, the other day I happened to chance across a definition of engineers as "[geniuses] with godly math and science abilities, that can solve problems in ways normal people do not understand". Nope. Just nope. Engineers are what you get when you take the limit of a scientist as his or her CAP tends towards zero.

To the OP of , You aren't alone in feeling this way. As a Year 2 Arts student, I experience the same thoughts too, and I believe many others do so as well. 

For myself, my family also wanted me to go for a 'good degree' course like law/biz/science but it was not something I could see myself doing too. FASS was my first choice, and though my grades aren't that awesome now, given a choice, I will still opt for this path. I can't see myself in another major, let alone another faculty. 

Like some have mentioned, a degree is really just a sheet of paper. True, it can't be denied that lawyers/doctors/bankers etc. will probably have a 'more stable future and earn more money' - but is that truly the path you want? There are reasons why you chose not to pursue them in the first place. If those reasons still hold, then you won't be happy if you were to pursue those degrees. 

Don't make decisions based on what your family wants. Make them based on what you yourself want. Even if it's the 'unconventional path'. Don't doubt your own abilities or decisions simply based on the negative comments from others, because in the end, it is your life - not theirs. 

Suffice to say...there's a certain 'calling' that all of us are more inclined towards, though we may not know exactly what we want to do. But I believe deep down, you know what you do not want to be. Just remind yourself of that, and for now...it would be good enough :)

The interesting thing about a business degree, or even accounting, is that non biz students can apply to those roles (including professionals like audit) that we apply. I would still like to think we have an insurmountable advantage compared to others. (Faculty pride :P)

Tbh, I do not know what is the value of Global Studies. Maybe it could be helpful in dissecting top officials' thoughts or countries dynamics to predict the direction of policies, although I really don't see how lah. I would think the value of a degree would be dependent on how a few things:
1. What do you intend to do next time? Most people can't imagine the potential next steps forward, and feel lost when they got hit by the fear of unknown. 
2. How do you package what you do? BBA is all about packaging. (Stereotype :P)
3. What are the other things you need to complement what you have? Seen quite a bit of engineering students doing finance modules and related internships even though they are not doing double degree. Some of them have gone off to join investment teams/trading
4. Luck in life

Read yours and a few other posts, so have some more blabbering. Mediocrity in life or facing failures can be a weird transition like falling into a rabbit role. Thankfully, my brain has a strong level of inbuilt nonchalance.  
1. Dig in deep and do what you can do to improve the situation. Grades suck, then study harder. 
2. Prioritize and decide your goals.
3. Set a longer timeline if needed. More haste less speed. Plus nowadays, our average life expectancy is quite high.
4. List down and explore the list of possibilities. (From best case scenario to worst case)
5. Embrace yourself for who you are, and not who you were or who you could be
6. Work towards what you could be, and not work as who you are
7. Try to find the right balance of being a realist and an optimist. 
a. The world is awfully realistic and has limited resources. Some forms of mediocrity is bound to befall on us, and some of us will get hit harder than others
b. However, if we don't put in effort, we are bound to be mediocre and never pick ourselves up.  
8. Lastly, my favourite line on failures: 

"As somebody once said, there's a difference between a failure and a fiasco. A failure is simply the non-present of success. Any fool can accomplish failure. But a fiasco, a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions. A fiasco is a folktale told to others, that makes other people feel more... alive. Because it didn't happen to them."

To  :
I honestly do not like the question. What do you mean by 'the least programming?'. I have to assume you are afraid of or simply do not like programming. If that is the case, there are plenty of other courses which does not require programming at all. From the way you asked, it seems that your results are good enough to be enrolled in any course? Please just choose any other course, it would be better for everyone! There are more and more students who are more interested and potentially capable in computing, but not able to get an offer because of people like you!

Going to school makes me feel lousy and hopeless and while I always tell myself to think rationally it is very hard :( please help

Some thoughts from a foreign talent (no sex, no fwb, no masturbation, no weird rs)

I came to Singapore when I was a kid and my friends are all local. You can say that I'm singaporeanized just that I don't sound like a local when I speak. I've been on three scholarships but I can list down 20 local friends who are first-class students but not on all any scholarships, and I can also list down 20 FTs who struggle with their results but are on prestigious scholarships. I really hope that the school can actually help more local students who perform academically well by awarding more scholarships or giving more financial aids on the semestral or yearly basis instead of giving it once at the beginning of the freshman year. I have local friends who are on study loan schemes or who have to read part-time degrees cuz they need more time to work and earn money. I always have this thought in mind that if I am fortunate to be rich in the future, I will donate money back to the school so that they can give to more local students who are in need.

Hi ppl i need some advice on this...

I am currently taking a module in which there's different profs teaching. Now we had this 1 prof who likes to put discussion qns in our lecture notes for us to discuss eg "design blah blah blah". Problem is i do not know anyone in this cohort so i chose to not talk. Instead i spend the discussion time to read up more about the design stuff relevant to this lecture. I think the prof know for sure i am not playing with my tablet because he did look at my screen. 

However, during his first lecture with us, he kept walking around my area (even staying in front of me for quite some time) for 3-4 times. I simply ignored him and continued reading. Fine let this be.

During his second lecture, i sat on my own because i need to be alone in order to focus on my reading. He still walked around my area a few times. Then suddenly he asked me "which group are you in?" I anyhow pointed to a random group and continued reading. What shocked me most was the fact that later on when some volunteers went down to present their group's idea, he sat directly behind me when he usually likes to sit at the first row to hear people present. 

I really had no idea whether it's mere coincidence that he behaved like this or was it done on purpose to pressurise me into speaking up.

Anyway what i am thinking was that from my 3 years in uni so far, reading up more usually helps me improve my grades, and discussion doesn't usually help me do better. Also, there is no point for me to do something that i am uncomfortable with (ie talking to strangers) when there is no participation marks at all. Furthermore there's no point for me to make any friends in this module since friends made in modules are usually hi-bye ones. I come to uni with no intention to make new friends, but only to study because i had no interest to socialise. And yes i am a very shy and introverted girl who intended to remain as i am because i believe in being yourself. 

Qns is should i remain like this for the rest of this prof's lectures (just had 3 more to go)? Will i end up leaving a bad impression? Does it matter even if i were to leave this kind of impression? Do anyone agrees with me on doing whatever that i believe is better for my grades?

Hi all, are there therapists at UHC & if yes how much would it cost for me to consult one? I've suspected that I've been suffering from GAD & depression for a long time now & would finally like to seek help. So far I've been lucky enough to have a teacher in my previous schools who have acted as my pseudo-therapists, but not now. Not consulting external therapists because my parents don't think mental illnesses are legit so I'd want to turn to resources in school for help. Advice would be greatly appreciated :)

I find the CAP arguments quite nonsensical.

All of them assume that the curves drawn have equivalent grade distribution.

Simply put, grade curves are also module-dependent. Even the standard curve that is to be drawn may not be the same in NUS, NTU and SMU.

Here is a simple example: if the mean curve to be drawn in NUS is such that E(grade) is a B, smack at E(CAP) = 3.5, i.e. the summation of everyone's CAP divided by the number of students is 3.5, of course it's going to be harder to pull up CAP in that module as compared to another module where E(CAP) is say, a 4, i.e. a B+.

To actually determine if it is easier to score in NUS, NTU or SMU, one must then multiply these grading curves by their weights, i.e. their MCs. And even such a computation only gives a normalised, expected answer. We are assuming the curves indeed, as they would suggest, are Gaussian, i.e. bell-shaped.

In this simplistic look, we take into assumption the standard modules, but the standard curve drawn in each university can differ. For the SMU case, because of a small class size, the curves drawn may deviate from NUS and NTU.

Even expectation, strictly speaking, is not enough. What one really looks out for is the "grade cut-off", which has nothing to do with the curve; it is an arbitrary cut that a professor can use to decide who scores what. Remember the debate over "how many percent of the cohort can score an A- and above?" and we do not know that number? That number is important if we want to perform CAP-lifting calculations, because the expectation value can be heinously useless if say, the professor fails many people in that class, i.e. a grade point of 0 for that module.

It is probably more prudent to study smarter and beat your friends at your local curve than to ask whose curve looks swankier.

I know it is amusing sounding smart performing CAP computations, or claiming to do mathematics, but the central assumptions behind the calculations are not verified, making the workings quite clearly nonsensical.

God damn it. Sometimes dont you guys find being in NUS its generally harder to score than peers from NTU/SMU?

to , i've asked this question before to my mentor regarding the transfer of courses. the reason why they only allow students with good results to transfer is because usually they would do equally well when they switched while the trend is that students with bad results maintained that way...they concluded that it is not about the course, but about the student him/herself. this is stupid, i know, because i am in your shoe too and stuck in a course that im doing badly at because i cannot transfer to another field which i am better at.

Fighting to meet the 3.2 CAP to continue with honours. Some have said don't because you won't get a "good class" and even hiring and promotions require "good honours". Some have said that depending on major, the year 4 mods and FYP is a valuable experience. What do you guys think about the honours or no honours debate? And why do profs ask for CAP when applying for FYP?

Admin please don't filter this. 

He is from the faculty of mundane, from a very very small-sized course. He is rather good looking, with his new red hair and his bigger-than-normal nose. He sings very well, and even has a YouTube channel. A really charming boy who is unfortunately attached to another girl in his hall. Rumours said that he is no longer a virgin, but oh well, that's not the main point here. Although he don't come for lessons, but people remember and know him because of his fuked up behaviour. He fuking MIA from ALL the projects and lab reports. 
But, he is someone who can articulate himself extremely well. So he exploited the skill and used it to come up with retarded excuses to explain to the various Professors why he miss certain lab or test. And apparently, the Professors from the mundane course are overly nice and were so charmed him, that they believed and gave him a second chance. Damn what the fukg right? Believe it or not, but this talented boy has a great skill of cheating. He not only cheat to everyone about his "oh-4-point-something-only-lah" cap, but also during exams. He thought no one saw it, but the dark forces YODA is always there, watching him. This boy betteng stop all the ridiculous behaviour. It is getteng really annoying and the dark force will stop you.

Hey guys! Just sharing something that has been useful to me
If any of you are worried about your internships, my friend recommended this TalentTribe Summit that I thought was quite cool! There's a conference series on career & personal development skills. There's also mentoring opportunities with employees from their corporate partners, company sharings & office tours (some of the conferences are held at the office of their corporate partners), and finally the possibility of getting short-listed for first-round interviews for internship/full-time. You can check them out here:

Is it wise to switch from Computer Science to Information Systems?

To students in LSM2103.

When you are doing the peerwise assignment can you kindly leave CONSTRUCTIVE feedback and genuine ratings? If the question is too easy, you complain. And if it's hard and you chose the wrong answer, you give the question a low rating cause you lost points. You are being very unfair here. You lost points cause the question was able to trick you. Isn't that a good question? Think before you comment instead of just copying previous comments.

Thinking of joining NUS Architecture this August, can any Aki senior enlighten me on how the course will be like? 
I have heard scary stories regarding sleepless nights before deadlines, is that true? 
Has any of you regretted joining Aki? 
Is it really busy all year round?
Really hope that someone can enlighten me, thank you in advance :>

Hi, I'll just like to find out what kind of internships life science students can take up. I still have not done an internship yet, not even in my first year. I'm in Y2 now. I only worked at a tuition centre as a teacher. Is that too pathetic to write down in my resume? I heard most of the students went to government agencies?  My grades arent that great either. So should i work at the tuition centre again for 3 months, or find another job? Thanks for advice in advance! Sorry, no friends to ask for advice lol

People should get their facts right. In uni, there is no such thing as not coming to school on a weekday or going home early, unless you are in some course that allows your timetable to be this way.

Hi guys, this 2FA stuff on ivle home page (image below) is worrying me so can i just double check with you all that this had nothing to do with us students? The word "faculty" in bold does not include us right? 

I tried doing it but realised it's really complicated so i gave up but yet was worried that if i ignore it, i cannot access my gradebook in the future...

Thanks in advance for any clarification.

Do you notice those local IT companies like to rant about the lack of developers in Singapore? Every year, we have thousands of IT students graduating from our universities and polytechnics. The shortage is often exaggerated. The problem with these companies is that they addicted to cheap labours from India. The directors usually pay themselves well with fancy houses and cars. They find excuses like your skills are outdated when you graduated. Tons of Bull.shit. How is the Data Structure and Algorithms stuffs outdated?

I think CS4238 is a waste of time, the lecturer is just teaching himself how to use gdb instead of making sure his student understands. 

I think he can be more objective with his lesson and speak louder and faster.

Hi, I'm taking LSM1301 (general biology) and does anyone know when the quizzes / assignments are usually done or how the assignments are collected?

 Engine student here, well it might explain the abysmal rankings of NUS philosophy now. I took logic the previous year, and philosophy of science a few years ago, the lecturers were really crap. It is as if they can't be bothered with the course and are just trying to waste everyone's time. Heard there might be better courses in philo but guess not.. the philo of science lecturer was talking out of his rear most of the time lol

I'm the confessor of  and . I think what I want to specialise in biomed is probably dealing with medicine devices (like inventing new devices to aid the medical industry) and dabbing into life sciences as well? Like eg, inventing a cardiac medical device which probably involves life sciences as well? I think I need a good amount of depth in biomed knowledge, however I need engineering knowledge too. In the future, I hope to be involved in the biotech industry and inventing biomedical products to help the medical field.In this case, is it still life sciences or engineering(materials science/biomed engineering)?

I'm already considering doing masters as well, but what am I furthering in in YLL if I do go there?Thanks seniors! :)

I am prospective NUS student hoping to study engineering. Is Engin really that hard which is not really worth the effort unless I want to be an engineer? Some of my Engin friends are saying it's not worth it unless I have no other choices or unless I love the subjects so much that I sacrifice my leisure time. Or is Computer Science or Science more worth the effort and probably less difficult? I have no idea what I really want to do in the future and engineering seems cool. But I know reality seldom meet up with expectations. I seek your opinions my seniors.

Sometimes I ponder if having true friends is better than having more acquaintances, because when 'true friends' whom I thought are true friends back stabs me, and I think again, probably I don't have any true friends. Whereas for acquaintances, we all know beforehand that we are going to use one another for benefits. 
Isn't it an ideal where we use one another to climb our own ladders, as long as we are not climbing the same ladder?

I'm a third year student from SoC. I guess I will need to bid for FYP soon, although I know for sure that I won't know what areas I want to work on...

May I seek advice from seniors and profs on how I shall go about choosing my FYP, when I'm actually kind of lost? I don't know specifically which area I want to concentrate on (but I do know areas that I dislike, so I can eliminate). I'm actually thinking about delaying for one semester, I will take more modules next semester and then start my FYP in Y4S2, and so hopefully I can be clearer on my direction...Will this help?

FYP is causing headache #haiz

I was on the train last week, and I overheard two students (one apparently foreign) wearing Yale-NUS shirts talking rather loudly about how "oppressive" Singapore is and how they felt "stifled" here.

To those students, and especially the foreign student: Hey, nobody forced you to come here to study, you know. If you feel so "stifled" about our country, you're welcome to leave and take your liberal-artsy attitudes back to wherever you came from... It's not like you guys are particularly welcome amongst the general student population here in NUS, in case you haven't noticed from your ivory tower.

Everybody's like "oh no not enough bid points," "why are classes so small" and i'm like "why is my core mod still in advance bidding in round 3B?"

Tried looking online but couldn't find an answer...does anybody know what a guest student is in a module? Does that mean you get to sit in and get access to its resources, but without actually officially taking that module? If so, how does one become a guest student?

I've been wanting to take this particular class in forever but it either clashes with my timetable or I get outbidded each semester.

Two of my friends and I can't file for graduation, even though the degree verifier says otherwise, but the rest of the people I know can. I'm starting to become convinced that this is a skin color thing...

I am aware that the profs need to know the CAP profile of his class as it is one of the gauge they use to determine the grade distribution. I have a couple of questions regarding this.

1) does it mean they know the CAP of individual students or only the average CAP of the class or both?

2) let's say if someone is in a class with a high proportion of high CAP students, does this means the line for eg A grade, instead of being at 80 according to departmental guideline, the prof will now inflate it to 85 for instance? Wouldn't this means whatever grade you get, it partly depends on your luck such as whether your class have more high CAP or low CAP students? Which means your chances of getting a good grade may vary from cohort to cohort? 

Would Prof Ben Leong please clarify? Thanks.

To the “most disadvantaged” Year 2s,

I would kill for a gradeless first semester.

Sincerely,
A year 3 who is now drafting an appeal for a gem
-
 
what is a strong reason to appeal for a module? if I'm just really interested and was unable to get the module because it wasn't opened up to my faculty to bid, will emailing the prof help? it's a module that was open to FASS students to bid only in round 2A, and supposed to be open to non-FASS students in round 2B onwards but because vacancies were filled in 2A, now that it's open to us in 2B theres no places -.-
-
 
To all those in the same boat as me (Yr 2s) who are most disadvantaged by the change in the GE system, I think almost all hope is lost. I called in to ask about whether year 1 slots will be opened and the operator said no, the slots will remain under their own codes, so if there were 300 slots initially for the new GE listed module, and only 100 vacancies were taken up by the freshies, the remaining 200 will NOT be released to the non-year 1s. 
That being said, I understand that the cross-listing is supposed to be protecting the year 1s since they have lesser points that the seniors. BUT. By so clearly adding a divide line between the year 1s and the rest, NUS just easily disadvantaged the year 2s, who are the most junior of the seniors. And we will continue to lose out to the year 3s and 4s, and even to the year 1s who have so many points all because they only need 1point to bid for the module, that we need 1000 points to bid for. Which is infuriating, 'cause I paid my school fees like everyone else, so why are we the ones at the losing end?
-
 
NUS CORS management team probably got sicked and tired of the previous bidding seasons that they decided to spice things up a little in this semester; making us pathetic seniors to all show hand at once with no mercy.
-
 
For the year 2s, I understand why some of you were very upset by the recent changes in the GE system, especially those who spent a lot of points on expensive UEs like languages(unless you are from FASS). Since round 2B is coming, here are some advice for those who didn't manage to get any GEK/GEM/SS mod.

1) Don't bother bidding for popular GEM/GEK/SS in the subsequent rounds as Cors will not transfer the leftovers to GEM/GEK/SS codes and they will only do that during the appeal phase which is after round 3B. 

2) If you intend to bid for a popular UE, most probably you won't get it becuase the year 1s, 3s and 4s will have more g points than you. 

3) Relook at your module planning for your next 1-2 years as you can only afford 1 or 2(if you are doing 4 year programme) popular mod. 

4) It's really time for you to look for 1 point module and if you have a slight interest in it, just bid for it. It is better than underloading(you can't anyway, min 18MCs) and unsuccessful in appealing. 

5) Speaking of appealing, you can try your luck and create a story to smoke Cors but I doubt you will get it also. You might get it if you have clashes with all other modules available out there but what are the odds?

All in all, the popular mods are popular for a reason and we all know it. It is unfortunate that you all won't have the chance to bid many of them. Change is the only constant. I wish you all the very best in round 2B!

-
 
i feel extremely discriminated by and disgusted with the nus cors management. i used more than 700 points to secure a gem module which had only 75 slots (for the y2s, y3s, y4s to compete over!). when i went to check the modules available for bidding tomorrow, it turns out that the same module under a different code name for the y1s still has 52 slots left. in the first place, there were 115 slots allocated to them specially. this is the quintessential imperfect market, worsened by intervention from the management who has imperfect information.
-
 
Hi, a confused freshie here I need some help please!! As our GEMs have different module codes from the seniors, will the leftover vacancies after round 2B be merged with the GEMs for seniors? In round 3, are we still bidding against only freshies? 
-
 
I've been wondering.....
many theories/ reasoning/ rants/ accusations have been running through my mind the whole day (not that I am obsessed or anything) but why has such a new and unfair system been implemented. I mean it's not just unfair for the older undergrads, but the year 1s as well! (yes, though I am not a year 1, I shall speak for you guys) 

For the Year 2s and Up: the bidding system is definitely wrong and (sorry for whining) but unfair! I mean the school could have reduced a whole bunch of whining online and calls from students if they had the mind to combine the bidding stream for the new five pillars and the old GEM GEK SS (the year 1s would be in the same like their seniors) This stream would then be implemented until 4 years pass on and eventually all the GEM GEK SS are under the 5 pillars code. (is there any flaw in this system? maybe for the year 1s, who are unable to clear their requirements early on)

For the Year 1s: although it's minor.... okay maybe not for me. It has come to my knowledge that many of the GEM GEK SS which were previously 2k module codes, have now become 1k module codes under the 5 pilllars. and the horror? the maximum number of level 1000 modules to read does not increase? (I have not spent much time and research on this, so anybody may correct me if I am wrong) This matters so much to me because a lot of my UEs are being cleared with GEMs and GEKs as the modules are much more appealing as compared to module codes with other abbreviations - for this, I feel extremely sad for the Year 1s.
 
I really wonder why the management have not considered these aspects? maybe they don't feel the stress from bidding + planning for modules to take,  which to me, is worse than studying/ doing finals for the modules itself. I mean they just has to ensure: 1) students are not misbehaving/ rioting/ breaking any general school rules, 2) lecturers are okay, not slacking/ attempting anything funny, 3) making it into top university Leaderboards by always providing all kinds of holistic stuff - from environment, to education to whatever that is needed in these Leaderboards

Finally, I am in such a dilemma as to whether I should all in my points for a module (showhand also less than 2k points.. I am a poor student D:) for round 2A and happily secure it or take a risk and wait to see whether they will combine the bidding stream for the 2 module codes. (though my research on the past sem shows that they didn't - but I hope they learnt from their mistakes?) I mean the horror if I were to find out they combine the bidding and the module only cost like 800 points instead of 1.5k+?!?!? I'M NOT GONNA GET MY 700 POINTS!! 
*side note: i need to bid for 3 more modules LOL gg fml, hence the desperation for points.

p.s.: a secret thought - is it possible some high rank person's kid just got into year 1 this year and the parent understand how hard is it to secure these GEM GEK SS so he/she made a suggestion to the board and got this exclusive treatment? I mean, if not why all the lecturers allocate ~ 55% worth of slots just for year 1s? (it isn't even equal, if you check most of the double coded modules, most of the 5 pillars have more vacancies than the old module code) 
-
 
I have a module which I badly wanted but I do not have enough points for it (because of the new system in which too much places were allocated to the GES/GEH coded modules). Let's say if I appeal, when is the latest i can get my result on whether i managed to get in? I would like to hear from those who appealed and successfully managed to register for a module.

I'm very worried because that module first lesson is on the first day of semester 2 in which bidding are still ongoing. Without getting the module first, I would not be able to download my lecture notes from IVLE just on time for my first lecture. Is it possible to ask the lecturer to email me the notes while I wait for my appeal results? Any advice?

Hello, I've just got my IB results and would like to apply to NUS. Can anyone please comment (or maybe the admin could comment) how adjusting from IB to NUS life is like?

Hi guys, I really need some advice on this matter...just some background information, I worked in this research company for my internship before and was assigned a mentor, let's call him Z. He appeared like a really nice guy who would be patient in mentoring me in the experimental techniques and also to check through a school report that I have to submit. However, a few incidences had led me to doubt his intentions, like whether he is indeed the nice guy I had initially thought of and I thought he is a little weird too...I do not know if I should continue working with Z for my final year project.

1) it appeared like it's a culture that when a student leave the company, all the mentors would usually buy gifts for his/her students or treat the student to lunch as a form of appreciation for the student's help. However, I received nothing from Z despite producing a lot of successful results for my given tasks (which Z himself admits). 

2) sometimes when I conduct experiments and something urgent crops up, I called him as I thought it's easier to discuss by talking but funny enough, he never once pick up my call and would only reply me by text.

3) There were a 2 days during my internship whereby I must go off for just an hour on each of these days  to settle really urgent matters but I was not warned beforehand that if I disappeared for even 1h, the company will simply consider the 1h as a half day leave. Had Z warned me beforehand, I would have applied for a half day leave and not go back to work after settling the matter. This incident led me to think that he didn't want to tell me the truth because if he does, I will leave early and not be able to help him with his experiments later in the day. Or fine, perhaps he really don't know this is how the company pays interns but given that he had worked here for nearly a decade, i wonder if he can possibly overlook this.... 

4) when I finally leave the company, I have this friend who had worked in this lab before but had lost her mentor, B's contact. My friend was keen on working in this lab too. Seeing that B and Z are good friends, I requested for Z to ask B if she could mentor my friend as I myself do not have B's number. He didn't reply me despite seeing the message. Another colleague of mine helped me contact B instead.

5) there was once I thought I could simply ask Z to help me check through a lab report if he could spare some time, as this report was worth nearly 50% of the module grade and I thought he had great expertise in writing a report since he's already a scientist. He rejected and ok, this incident is forgivable since he is not obliged to go the extra mile.

6) now, because on the day i ended my internship, I expressed my wish to come back to this company to work under Z (as during that time, I didn't suspect Z to be a bad guy), I was told to find a NUS professor to co-supervise me. To find an NUS prof, I filtered out 3 profs that I think are suitable and simply would like to check with Z if he think these 3 profs are doing similar stuff as him. I asked him because only he knows what exactly he is working on but guess his reply? He said it's not his task to tell me which prof is suitable. He withheld too much info from me and only gave me generalised info so how was I supposed to know exactly which prof to look for?!?!

7) fine, I went to look for the prof myself nevertheless but before I meet the prof, I simply wish to understand more about Z's current progress in his project and what exactly he is working on because I suspect the profs will want to know exactly what my project is about. Z's reply was terrible. It seems like he didn't bother reading my questions and simply asked me to Google for the answers myself and that such school matter is none of his concerns. At this point I was like "WTF?!?! I am not even asking you to help me find a prof, I am simply asking for the exact details as I require these details in order to answer to the profs. If he don't tell me, how am I supposed to answer the prof? And very funny hor, how would Google tell me his progress currently?!?!" I probed him further but in an annoyed manner this time, and he still refused to answer my questions, asking me to look at the lab's publications instead. The lab publications give me info only on what they did in the past but not what he works on currently or his current progress. When I met the prof, even the prof agrees that it's unfair to me that my mentor is not telling me much.

Alright, enough of such ranting, my main question is, based on these incidences, do you all think Z may be nice during my internship simply to "lure" me back to work for him so he had extra help? After which once I agreed to go back, he simply showed his true colours (cold, weird, selfish)? 

Do you all think I should should take the risk to look for another mentor in this company, even if there's no guarantee that another person can be better than Z? Are such hypocritical people common in society?

Ps, just to let you all know, the only reason I chose to go back to this company to do my final year project is because they have unlimited resources and that I am already familiar with the company's culture and environment. 

I really need you guys' advice on this, like whether you all agree that Z may not be as nice as I thought. Thanks.

Let's get rid of the notion that some courses are "more competitive" than others.

I believe that A-level and poly grades have little correlation to university-level performance. And your GPA has nothing to do with being in a course with "smarter" students. Singapore university admissions works in a certain way. If there are lots of demand for course A, the IGP will rise and hence, more "smart" Singaporean students will be there. If there is little demand for course B, the IGP will drop. However, MOE will fill the space up in course B with foreign scholars. You can check with the parliamentary replies by MOE. Less popular courses like engineering/science has 26% foreign students. While popular courses like biz, law, med etc have very little. While the overall total is capped at 16%. That means non-science courses probably have as little as 5% of foreign students. What this means is that if you are from a BBB/B course, your bellcurve is still quite bad as there are more foreign scholars and their grades are not reflected in the IGP. On the other hand, if you are in an AAA/A course, you might have more well-performing local students but almost negligible foreign talents. So every course becomes equally competitive and no course has a more "steeper" curve than any other.

From a person who is tired of hearing biz students whine about how their course is more competitive because their IGP is high.

In my life I am never truly happy. Paper chase since 12 and in the process I've sacrificed time and opportunities to build up friendships and relationships. Ultimately, I didn't secure a good cap either. All my life and time, what have I achieved? I wished I had spent more time on building r/s with people rather than studying for psle, o'lvls,  a'lvls and every single class quiz.

 If you want to be a real programmer, you should use MBP. That is the best option for a Unix-like experience between Linux (too risky if you update your distro often; not enough mainstream hardware support) and Windows (crappy OS; you cannot use Unix). Majority of the engineers in big tech companies like Google and Facebook use MBP. If you want to find out more, google this tech god from HWZ who write long essays on how good is MBP.

Need some advice on GET1031: Computational Thinking. I'm in my final year looking to explore introductory modules into the computing perspective but I have no background nor the time to commit to learn how to code and all that. Will this module be easy enough to grasp and understand? I'm hoping to apply other perspectives to my own major in Psych.

I graduated from chemistry 2 years back without honors because I wasn't interested in it and so neglected my studies, so I've been working in an entirely different field. Now, I suddenly have a revived interest in chemistry but I don't have any working experience in the science field. Anyone know or can give advice on how I can restart my career in the sciences? I really don't know what to do since I have no honors and no chemistry working experience.

If I decided to extend my studies for another extra year, can I still apply for financial aid like bursaries?

Admins, I hope you do not filter this as I need to check with the rest if they also encounter this problem. 

Does anyone knows if this module review website (http://module-review.com) is still working? Whenever I type in a module code, the module in question doesn't show up in the results. Then I tried clicking on NUS under the select an institution section, then under select a faculty, I click for instance science. Under this I tried typing a module code taught in science faculty and guess what? The results state "no matching modules found" despite the fact that I for sure did not misspell the module code:( does anyone also encounter this problem? Can someone please provide a link to NUS module review websites which allow us to see all reviews of all the modules? Or am I suppose to register before they allow me to see the reviews? 

Sorry I actually wish to provide a screenshot to illustrate what really is happening but somehow I was unable to upload the pic:/

I am a secret follower of prof. Ben Leong. I read all his posts and comments and replies. A pity is that I didn't take any of his classes when I was in school. I took CS3217 hoping to be taught by him but it turned out he had passed it to another prof. In the showcase, he passed by my project but didn't seem to be interested :( I wanted to do FYP with him but I didn't see his topic in the list to choose. Now I have graduated alr :(

I wonder if the A+ grade was created to provide an ego boost for students since it carries the same grade point as the A grade. Or was it created to allow the "non bell-curve spoilers" to have a shot at achieving the pinnacle grade point?

From a SoC graduate student:

I need your help!

I’m very sure that I did perfect on my exam but still got C. You may think that I am over-confident but I had taught the same course in my home university.

That C made me failed to continue my scholarship. I am hopeless and thinking about withdraw! I myself cannot handle the tuition fee for next terms.

Is there any change if I can ask the professor review my script? I am thinking to come to his office and talk to him, is it ok?
`
Prof Ben Leong, can you give me an advice? Thank you!

-
 
 I think the chemical engineering department should be blamed for this, Not only they are offering lesser number of TEs in the coming semester, the quota for each module is lesser too. Things are still not that bad for students doing regular semester, as they still have quite a number of TEs to choose from. But for those who are going for IA, they face a "super-limited" number of TEs as evening modules available. To make things even worse, the department does not allow IA students to take up Btech modules, unlike other engineering students.
What is going on? Must well just pre-allocate us with any TEs they like and deduct all our credits in the account. Don't have to go through all these troubles of bidding and appealing etc. 

-
 
Just wondering, as a university student, how many books have you read so far? Is it very common not to read any books anymore?
-
 
I am very interested and curious to know what goes on behind the scenes after our exam scripts are submitted so please do not filter this post as I really wish to hear from Prof Ben Leong if this was what happened.

1) The profs mark the questions relevant to their teaching areas
2) The profs key in the marks according to the matric number
3) The module coordinator totalled up the marks for the assignments, tests, final exams to give the raw score. At this point, the system reveals the students' name next to their raw scores
4) The raw scores are subjected to the curve.
5) The grades are keyed in next to the students' name and matric number.

Is this order correct? In particular I am most curious about when is the time the students name get revealed by the system since we only submit our exam scripts with our matric number.

I don't get what is the hype with Computer Science this days that require straight As. The bunch of things that CS people do can easily learned from the net and one's own free time. Many people working as software engineers especially web developers don't even have or need CS degrees. 

As this Quora answer puts it "Coding bootcamps emphasize skills employers are looking for more than computer science programs. " and “University computer science departments are in miserable shape: 10 years behind in a field that changes every 10 minutes".
https://www.quora.com/Should-I-get-a-bachelors-degree-in-computer-science-or-go-to-coding-boot-camp

As another puts it "The people who were good at the school part of computer science—just weren’t good developers." http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-im-not-looking-to-hire-computer-science-majors-1440804753

It is a fact that some NUS CS graduates can't code. One learns coding through real experience not solving useless problem sets in academic settings. Many coders I have met learned most of their stuff outside school instead of inside it. 

Basically, if you are good, you don't need a CS degree to flaunt, go get a business degree to widen your connections and improve your communication skills instead. Many engineers I met can't present and communicate well for goodness sake. The gender ratio there is much better too. Nuff said.

 I'm a FASS graduate, and I can understand why some people still have the perception that FASS is a "dumping ground". Back when I was a freshie, I can tell that some of my OG mates were here simply because they had nowhere else to go. Sad, but true story (maybe this is less so now). The academic gap in FASS is also large - perhaps larger than other faculties. On the one end of the spectrum, there are those who are really brilliant, like PHD-track and local PSC scholars. On the other end, there are those who barely slipped into uni through FASS and dunno what they want even after the end of 3 or 4 years. They would have been better off if they found a job first, instead of doing it the traditional way of A-levels>Uni. That said, I know people with really terrible A-level grades, but graduated with 2nd-upper honours and above. Dumping ground? To some extent it was in my time.

Not exactly a confession, but with all the talks about CAP and results and surviving University. Thought it'd be good for all to share their study tips in this thread here. :)
-
 
seeing the FASS guy who's trying to maximise CAP makes me wonder if i did the right thing by learning for the sake of learning. given that we forget most of the content we learn by a semester or two after the exam, is the point of going to university learning, or to show employers that you know how to get around the system by S/Uing as many modules as possible? after all, being able to chao keng is a life skill too.

Hi, just wanna ask has anyone done a double major in geog and soci before? I understand that for double major you can double count up to 8mc of modules. Has anyone tried double counting a geog module to a soci module or vice verse before(since some of the modules are very similar to each other)? Or basically suceed in double counting modules from two different majors? Thanks in advance!
-
 
The best way to graduate with as high a CAP as one deserves, is to just stop focusing one's attention on the damn number.
-
 
Regarding a few posts about the value of CS major. Here's my experience.

A bit of background: I'm a Life Science grad. I've graduated and work in a lab for a few years now. My field is bioimaging. Now, here's the reality of research: we humans have put out so much data that it's no longer feasible to do analysis manually. We all resort to machine these days. Even History and Humanities run in to the problem of so many books, reports, and written records that absolutely no one will ever have time to go through. So machine reading is necessary. Watch:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp4y-_VoXdA

My field absolutely requires computing. The data is simply too big and to many things to keep track of. However, we have a bit of a problem: our work involves animals, and if you are in the field, sooner or later you will need to work with them. Our labs are so underfunded and understaffed that one person need to do everything and cover each others' job. As far as I can tell, the CS grads I worked with hate working with animals. In fact, I got my position from a CS graduate who fell out with my supervisor. Life Science grads are not good with digital image analysis. I got so many FYP students from Life Science bailed on my supervisor the day they heard about what they need to do.

Personally, I'm a bit of an oddity: I work with animals and do my image processing and analysis. I spent 70% of my time in front of my laptop doing analysis, about 20% acquiring the image and 10% writing. I'm not as good as other animal specialists, the ones who can split open the poor dead mouse skull and harvest the brain or cut out the 1mm thick hippocampus from the rest of the brain. Nor I am as well versed in coding as CS grads; the extent of my coding in my work was butchering and cannibalizing other people's code to frankenstein my script into existence. The world of bioinformatics is quite wonderful in that also any problem that a publish solution is out, there is a open source program available. The documentation and the GUI need some work though; and that's also one of my skill: reading a 30 pages manual. Otherwise it's a software that cost 10k.

 Still it put me in an odd position as a guy who either can do everything or at least know who can do a certain thing the best. It means most project coordination goes to me. or I'm the bridge between the biologist and the programmer.

Anyway, my point is you kinda need everyone and nobody is more important that the rest. You need the best physical, technical person to do their part, the CS people to do their part and the people like me to connect those 2. But the main point is each has to be at his/her best. Same thing for the sales/business vs engineer conflict. Sales typically regard engineers as a bunch of nerds who can't sell a bottle of water to a man in the middle of the desert; and the engineers thinking the sales as a bunch of cutthroats who would sell their mother's kidneys if it's profitable enough. In a way, they are both right. But you need both of them to work together.

Say you need yo encourage people to use the trains. The engineers will design a high-speed system that only require the GDP of Denmark to build. The sales bunch will suggest we repaint the train and remind everyone that cars kill people too.

hi! I'm a freshman and I would like to ask if there's still a point in aiming for a cap of between 4 to 4.5 now that there's no longer the division between second upper and second lower in the new honors system? will my cap still appear on my transcript or is it just honors with distinction/etc?

I do agree with . I was at third-class back then to my first semester in NUS. But now, I'm at 2nd upper :'). I'm not a super smart student, but I'm sure that everyone can achieve higher if he/she has commitment to do so :)

Hello , I would like to offer an alternative perspective on your observation of why US college students are getting more than one degree. I hope you (and many other students who have gone or who will go to the US) do not feel that you are any less capable or worthy. 

First, unlike Singapore, there are about 1,700 public colleges/universities in the US, and the majority of these colleges/universities are nowhere as recognised in the US as Stanford, Harvard or Yale. Correspondingly, the bulk of US graduates come from these colleges. Therefore, if a US student graduated from one of these less-than-recognised colleges, he or she will need to further their education in a more recognised college in order to increase their job prospects, especially if he or she wants to work in one of the bigger US cities. It is easier to gain entry to a more recognised college once you have completed your first degree and scored well in that first degree. 

Compare this with Singapore. In Singapore, there is some parity between graduates of public universities. Whether one graduates from NUS, SMU, NTU or SIM (still too early to compare with SUTD and SIT), the employer is unlikely to turn your job application down on the sole basis that you graduated from NUS/SMU/NTU/SIM. This can happen in the US if you graduate from one of the lower-ranking public universities. The difference in Singapore, generally, is the starting pay received. 

Second, more jobs in the US are increasingly asking for a Master's Degree or a Second Degree. Careers in law, education, counseling, healthcare, library sciences etc. require a Master's or a Second Degree in that discipline. This means that a US student who wants to pursue a career in one such industry needs to spend about 6 to 8 years in university alone. In Singapore, most students need only 3 to 4 years of studying, and a Bachelor's is enough.

Third, with about 1,700 public and 800 private colleges/universities, the US has a large academic industry. In other words, academia is a viable career choice. And in order to pursue an academic career (fellowship or professorship, not tutorship), one needs to have, at the very least, a Master's Degree. This is unlike Singapore, where an academic career is largely restricted to our 6 public universities and a handful of academic institutes.

Hi. what does it mean by if you s/u too many modules in sem 1, your cap becomes very unstable? I was originally aiming for FCH but seeing as how I got almost all B+ for my mods, I don't think its viable anymore. should I keep some of my B+ and s/u some B+?  confused freshie here ><

Hi there. I need some advice. I am a mechanical engineering student with decent looks but just very soft spoken.

Hi guys, I just wanted some place to rant. So here's the thing, my brother recently approached me asking if I could sponsor him for his exchange. (note: he hasn't applied yet) 

Previously, he told me he was planning on going Korea. But now, he's saying that he wants to go Europe instead, because according to him, it would cost about 10k or so for KR and 15k or so for Europe, so to him, it seems like it is more worth it to go Europe instead. 

Of course, I want to help him, but the thing is, I just hate the fact that he's really broke, but he is not doing anything at all to save up. 

I told him he should probably consider some other cheaper locations, but it seems like he has set his mind on it. And the sad thing is, my parents are probably going to pay for it in the end if I don't help. Or worse, he mentioned about getting a bank loan. Like seriously? 
-
 
It appears that we are in a time when going to university and paying for it yourself actually costs more than just heading straight for the workforce after JC/poly/NS. This cost is in terms of tuition fees, loss of earnings and interest from savings, and delayed career progression (especially in entrepreneurship, creative and service-oriented industries; less in technical ones or the civil service).

Do you agree? If so why are people still paying so much good money without having a solid objective besides "just getting a degree, any degree, lor"?

Posting this on behalf of a friend...

How to find bae:

Step 1: Go up to a girl
Step 2: Ask for stead
Step 3: Profit(?!)

(Step 1.5 talk about how good looking she is, eg "I couldn't help but notice how beautiful you are" to increase chances of success for step 2)

This is the fastest (but not necessarily best) way to try to get bae.

Principal considerations: 
- Her personality sucks
- She turns out to be cray
- She actually just had a lot of makeup on

There you go bro I did it.

I do not want to spend so much money on supplements and special diets. Anybody can help shed some light? Thank you.

Relevant to , there are also other factors other time constraints with regard to the significant error in the exam question. The problem I had was that I could't catch what professor said (he was at the far left of the classroom while I'm at the far right column), the sound that followed was unhappy grumbling lol (adding to my confusion). Also, he only wrote the correct molecular formula at the left whiteboard (too far away! I really couldn't see). I immediately wanted to ask but he just hurried out to inform the next classroom. With no sight of any other invigilator (I didn't dare to turn around and instinctively didn't  to raise my hand as this unstabilizes my other hand writing), I stupidly assumed that this crazy question would be taken out of marking, so I just continued focusing on other questions. Unfortunately, the professor later emailed saying that he received feedback and he would still mark it 'as fair as possible for each other student'. Of course, this really is the fairest treatment especially because there's even 1 guy in the original post who said that he spent 1 hr 55 mins on that question alone (means the other 80/100 marks is gone). Sigh, I should have at least assigned any protons to the 1H NMR spectra. The only thing I did was I drew a benzene ring, and despite all these, I'm so screwed for both chemistry exams anyway. Haha. By the way, any advice if I fail any one of them? They are my core modules.

A commenter on  speculated that the only 5% of a cohort graduate with first class honours. That is far from reality. 10+% is a better estimate.

I just found out that forensic science is removed as a gem module and relisted as a regular module. Thing is, I have been saving up for this module and intend to take it in my final year when I have enough points. I have cleared my electives already (and the other science gems arent very interesting), and would really like to take this as a gem. Will we be allowed to reclassify it as a gem after taking it as a regular module? Does anyone know? I still feel that it's quite unfair to some of us that have been saving up for many semesters, to suddenly remove it like that:(

 The only place where your grades will not seriously impede you is entrepreneurship. I have seen people who have no university degrees doing well in business. These people usually have asperger's-like traits (don't care about what others think of them) or extremely sociable (understand the crowd well). The problem with most people is that they are on average very 'normal'.

CNA news: "Engineering crunch in Singapore despite more Engineering graduates." "Graduates do not want to do engineering because its mundane and boring." HAHAHAHAHA hey i thought april fools is over?

I was the typical child with an engineering dream. And i got it. After graduating two years ago and being in an engineering company for almost 2 years now, i know for a fact that the average starting salary for engineers is $3000-$3200, significantly lower than professions such as education, finance, nursing, pharmaceutical, even research. 

Well everyone starts of humble right, hmm....3-4 years into the job, the average salary is STILL $3000-$3200?!?! Oh wow, career progression at its best, dy/dx = 0. Oh but i should be grateful, because i am getting almost 20-30% more (inclusive of cpf) than my foreign colleagues, whom average $2500-2700 throughout their career. 

Oh sure, engineering is mundane and boring. but why do i see a long queue of volunteers to do ANY high paying but mundane job? Cus its ****ing logical, yes i said it, demand and supply baby. Let the engineer teach you. If the pool of engineers in Singapore is flooded with endless supply of foreign "talents", what happens to price? YEAH, IT GOES DOWN LIKE THE RINGGIT BABYY WOOO!!

Why would any employer pay for a Singaporean? Even at the same salary, extra 15% CPF is already a turn off. I wouldnt, why should they? Oh wait, you found out that some engineering companies pay well? Did i hear top Oil firms? Oh okay, if we are talking about top firms paying top dollar then you'd better compare the top with every other industry, cus im talking about the man in the street, the engineer at the plant, the pathetic student preparing his cheatsheet at E5 right now, who sadly has no future in engineering.

I just got an offer to work in an American bank, they're giving me a 100% increment, im taking it. Im selling away my dream so i can pay off my BTO in half the years, take my GF out to nicer dinners and spend my career in a less "mundane" environment. But I guess thats the real dream.

ENGINEERING FTW WOOHOO!!!! stop dreaming.

To Op of 
Must be another strawberry generation engineer expecting 9-5 office armchair engineer job with high pay. 
U do realise that even with a degree, u still have to learn from scratch right ? Why would employers pay u 4k when u cant contribute anything ? Joining bank right ? Ever heard of ROI ? 
Complain about foreign workers again . MOM already tighten the quota , their work permit cannot be approved unless the job ads is advertised for at least 2 weeks and no Singaporean has applied . And there is a levy of few hundred dollars . E.g : an engineer hired by NUS has a levy of 600-700$ . Learn your shit before you start throwing accusations .
Just because one company took advantage of u doesn't mean Singaporean engineers aren't appreciated . Learn as much as u can , then move on to another company . 
All the best to u in your new job ( provided that you're not lying ) . With that attitude I doubt you'll last long in that industry with oversupplied skilled manpower . Really strawberry generation expecting everything to be spoonfed to them .

The teams that are doing CS3216 ***seriously*** need a lesson on advertising and marketing ethics, as well as the PDPA. It's understandable to want to promote your product since they're part of your grades, but to the extent of sending unwanted, otherwise known as spam emails, to all of our email addresses? I don't even know how they got their hands on personal, non-NUS email addresses. As the person sending it yourself, put yourself in the recipient's shoes. Personally, I feel that Facebook advertisements, and advertising among your peers on WA and etc, are fair game, considering that you paid for them and/or are using personal connections.

Additionally, those that use NUSgroups for mailing, I wonder if you've even read the Terms of Use that ComCen states: "You will not add members to your group without their consent.". Wonder if we can report them to ComCen though.

Could someone please explain something to me?

Whenever anyone wants to use the pool table or the foosball table at the YIH student lounge, we need to pay a dollar. For the pool table, a dollar earns you a full set of balls and the game is over once all the balls are sunk. For the foosball table, the dollar earns you 7 balls which you use to score goals, each ball not returnable once the goal is scored.

However, whenever NUSSU committee members or the like have an event here, they (being in possession of the keys to the 2 facilities mentioned above) unlock the ball-holding areas, practically allowing them to play both games for free with unlimited number of tries.

My question then is what do we pay the dollar for? If it is for the maintenance of the tables, then why are the people mentioned exempted from the fees? If it is to ensure that our students do not abuse the tables, the same question applies. Either way, I feel that this is unfair because ultimately, everyone pays school fees (or gets their fees paid for them in their name) and hence, should be entitled to the same benefits by NUSSU which are in essence, the Student Union.

Maybe I am missing something here, so would someone please enlighten me? Thanks.

I'm the OP of  back again. I must thank all you seniors for your kind sharing on topic, though I must say I'm surprise by how well received it was. I was also kind of surprised to see my words being twisted to suggest that geographers are 'arrogant assholes that stands on the moral high ground'. I certainly find no such a phrase in my post and am worried of how the 'contented geography student' may have came about to perceive so.

In any case that is off topic. From my experience of History in JC, that was a clear emphasis that arguments should be balanced in the essay and avoid words that suggest "absolutes" or "extremities". Which is why I perceive History to be generally more objective? At least these were actively taught by my history tutor in JC and I take care to practice these points. (I do find it funny how one comment went on to suggest how 'History' is patriarchal. I have learnt of such a reference being made, but then why should we determine the content of the subject from pure reference to it's 'name'? Anyway..) What I understand of history is admittedly not deep, I did it out of interest in the topic and the believe that lessons (history) should not be repeated. I've perhaps not gone in deep enough to see how it's also not as objective as I think it is.

In any case, I won't be listing examples from the text/references that I've read and honestly it's difficult to consider putting in too much thought into this matter given that it's not even more core module (I'm not a geography major, nor even in FASS). But yeah, I do agree with the majority of the comments otherwise.

My concerns stem from how I don't really wish to afford time to really dig up for evidence on how some of these 'contentious points' raised in the said text. I guess I'm lazy in that aspect, but I'll still follow the advice and seek clarification from my tutors/profs to better understand where the authors may be coming from.

Thanks!

My grp mate shld go to hell. 1st, he didn't contribute much to the project. 2nd, he wants to throw in additional stuff for extra points but doesnt know how to do it. And then he keep pushing us to do it. 3rd, he said he knows that he didn't contribute much, so he volunteered to do the presentation slides, which he did (slides were uploaded to dropbox at abt 11pm, the night before the presentation. Fuck!) The slides was clearly done without much efforts put in. There were misalignment, black fonts highlighted in navy blue, dark background with dark fonts, some slides have no heading and etc. He literally copied from original report and paste into ppt without thinking. I hate him.

This is with regards to  and . I am in no way affiliated to FASS club, but I do wish to voice my opinions on this matter. I don't get why people complain that they aren't able to collect their welfare packs because it's on a first come first serve basis? It was very fair and clearly stated beforehand that it's "while stocks last". I understand that there was some survey that people had to complete first before collecting the welfare pack and some people did the survey but didn't get the welfare pack. But you shouldn't blame anyone if you weren't fast enough to collect it. I feel that it should be a personal responsibility.

Is 3rd class honors worthless? I am likely to be graduating with 3rd class....i'm afraid that it will hinder me as i look for a job

To the few who are constantly whining about not being able to get your welfare pack: Wow, how self-entitled do you have to be to think that unconstructive criticism about it is the way to go?

As someone who has helped out in several welfare packing, there is ALWAYS a lack of resources (both in terms of money and manpower). Do you think the items in the welfare packs fall from the sky? Do you think they just magically appear pre-packed?

And yet you (1 out of 6000 FASS students) seem to somehow think that they should make it their life mission to give you that welfare pack. Did you bother checking the many posts that were made saying that welfare packs were running out? Did you bother looking into how you could help FASS Club out with their packing/sponsorship so they can provide as many students as we can with welfare packs? Nope, you just sit there on your lazy ass and whine that people aren't spoonfeeding you.

You aren't even representative of the general FASS student body. There are many who offer their help. There are many who silently appreciate the welfare.

And yet you come here acting as if you represent everyone around you.

Pui.

Get off Nus whispers and go make a legitimate feedback to them if you feel that it is warranted. Until then, stop whining here.

I'm actually thankful you didn't get the welfare pack. The other students certainly deserved it more.

I need advice. 
I got accepted in an internship for this December but it requires me to commit up till the end of February next year. Idk if I should take LOA because technically I would only miss 2 tutorials (whether tutorials fall in odd or even week) or I should just bid for modules as usual and email the TAs/Profs when I cannot make it for tutorials. Help please.
-
 
I have just started working and I realized most of the times it is not about your capability but whether you can impress by talking. There are just some people who never contribute as much but can portray themselves as one who contributed the most. The opposite applies. Will the management able to tell who actually contribute more? I doubt so. I guess that's the real working world.

I'm an engineering student, and I'm just writing this to rant. I really don't understand the rationale behind profs not releasing solutions to the pyps. One of the reasons given by them is that they want us to understand the concepts without referring to solutions??? But without solutions, we are basically helpless! >:( It doesn't help that we don't have the answers (not solutions) either, cause we won't know if we have done it correctly, or not! then what's the use of the PYPs then?

Some people (usually lecturers) will tell us to consult our profs/lecturers. But not everyone works the same. I myself am a slow learner (in terms of understanding), and consultation would take up a very large amount of time if I consulted ALL my lecturers. In comparison, if I had the pyp solutions, I could refer to it and find out my mistakes, and then only consult if I still don't understand the solutions. Isn't that much easier for both the student and the lecturer?

Anonymous poll question, because the last time I tried to ask this I got flamed pretty badly.

Why do Singaporeans not support their local brands that much? I mean, SIA is internationally-renowned, but more love is given to Cathay or even Thai.

Or say Charles and Keith, or Creative, or even Thai Express (do people know this is Singaporean?)

I come from the United States where we regularly bash the sucky local brands, but Singapore creates good products; why do people not like them very much?

*confused exchanger*

Do profs get irritated if someone asks questions that he has already mentioned in lecture but it is not in the lecture notes? I have not been going for lecture for one of my modules for the past few weeks cos i was rushing other projects, so i'm quite far behind. I'm a bit apprehensive to email the prof cos then he will know i have not been attending lecture. Advice?
-
 
I have some evidence that a certain professor is biased against me. I'm not sure if it would work if i report though, I just don't wish it to happen to others

Although I've heard that finals marking is anonymous, wouldnt it be quite obvious with the matric number anyway? Anyone could search for the matric number to see who is who.  

btw, my grades so far for that module isn't like failing, it's just average, so it's really not sour grapes. It's just what I felt when I was asking him a question.

Hi. The B77W speaks.

I have half a year remaining in the university. Deep down, I really would like to take off for a more interesting future.

Here are some personal thoughts which you may want to consider, considering that people are considering going on SEP.

Experience: besides possibly flying on a B77W (do it!), I guess one key takeaway of going on SEP is not just how "wonderful" somewhere is. It is also how "wonderful" Singapore is compared to some other place. But comparison isn't everything. It's a chance to understand another location, another culture, another way of thought. Place "speaking with locals" in the bucket list beyond just "going to places". I have many friends who go on SEP and take marvellous pictures, but there is little beyond a picture unless you can associate with it. It is just like art. Pretty if you understand it, useless if you don't.

Cost: one of the best ways to keep costs down is to listen to people. That is, keep your eyes and ears open. Learn how the locals themselves manage in a high-cost environment and be pleasantly surprised.

What to do: there is absolutely no guideline to this. Some prefer nature. Some prefer concerts. Some want to skydive. Go ahead. Just don't get yourself into either irreversible trouble (STDs) or end up bankrupt.

Since some are about to plan their take-off, here is a take-off picture too.

I think there are some value in learning to take your own notes rather than buying it from some website unless of course it is a guide to a difficult subject. Then again I can read an academic textbook published by some professors rather than reading it from some unknown students whose credentials are based on their grades only.

Having graduated some years ago, I miss the time when I was a student in NUS. No real worries other than getting the assignments done and studying for my exams (I actually love exams compared to doing my essays, you don't really have to study that much for my course). 

Now, I have to worry about my job appraisal, handling my subordinates, money etc. How I wish I was a student again :(

This semester, i found out that 3 profs ran through the list of students names and profile. While waiting for students to come in before a lecture, i saw them scrolling through the students' profiles on ivle.Sometimes we had some class activities in which the prof is waiting for us to finish and i happened to see a prof flipping through a hardcopy of the ivle students' profiles. 

All these while in my 2.5 years in NUS, i always believe that profs are too busy to bother with who their students are but what i saw is going to change my mind. Who knows if they might even check which student emailed them? Which means they will know exactly who asked stupid or good qns.

I was wondering if most profs actually look through students profiles during their free time...heh who knows if they might be checking out pretty girls in the list of students' profiles or any pretty girls in the cohort (since all 3 of them are guys) and i wonder if male profs do that too just like any other guys out there lol:P

Experienced seniors please advise. I failed both my SEP and internship job interviews and currently I have received no internship offers and no SEP to color my resume. The rounds of selections for both have already concluded and I don't understand why I am so repulsive to the interviewers. My CAP and CCA records are not the best but they are pretty decent and I am pretty sure I carry myself well during interviews as well. I don't understand how people can get multiple interviews and job offers while I only get ONE interview throughout the whole selection process for the internship program, which I failed.

So my question is this, am I at a great disadvantage for not having either SEP or internship during my 4 years? Am I doomed to becoming a jobless wizard?

Good evening fellow whisperers.

I am once again the B77W.

Week 12 is coming. Exams are coming. The B77W has only three short messages.

1. Work hard and smart, but more importantly, take care of health. Nothing is worse than hard work all done, except that you're too sick to take the exam. Eat more fruit and vegetables, and contrary to what some seniors may say, the food in welfare packs isn't very great health-wise; use as a last-resort measure.

2. There is always something to fight for. Maybe your mid-terms weren't spectacular. But there'll always be an opportunity to do well. So please try your best, don't give up.

3. Having said all that, university is not sometimes all defined as grades. I have friends in 2nd lower who have already got a nice job waiting for them before graduation. I have friends in 1st, too, who are scrambling and lost at what they want to do. Amidst grades, there are other things one needs to work hard at, be it grad school applications, job-hunting for the old, and racking up outside the classroom opportunities for the young.

The B77W wishes you all the best, and hopes to see all of you onboard the next flight onboard SQ2 to San Francisco via Hong Kong, departing at 6.30 PM.

I was wondering if it is okay for lecturers to change an assessment only in week 11. The point about this module is that there were several lecturers and each of them were supposed to give an essay question related to their lectures and the class could then choose any of the questions to complete; this was explicitly stated in Week 1.

Fast forward to Week 11 and the lecturer only uploads a single question onto IVLE. It's not a terribly difficult question but I had wanted to do my essay on another topic by another lecturer and I kinda feel cheated (idk the right word for this). 

Opinions please.

I'm a Singaporean who've lived overseas for my whole life. I didn't get to join any orientation camps because I received my acceptance to NUS really late. & I also didn't know anyone in here. :( I've joined quite a few CCAs, but the friends I made are never as close as the ones back in high school. I also attend lectures alone. I feel like my 3 or 4 years at NUS will pass by in loneliness as I have no one to really talk to :(
-
 
Can students who have graduated (this is my last semester) be able to still access NUS facilities like CLB and PC-Commons to print stuff/use the computers? What about our NUS email? I don't think the alumnus card will still include our matriculation number right (which means we won't be able to sign up for any events that require us to fill in matric number)? Hope that NUS graduates can answer my queries.

I put in effort. 
I understood the concepts, and applied them to the best of my effort. I derived them on my own as well.
I come to school every single day, staying until late, doing work before I head home in the east. 
I am not a leech in my group.

Yet, ultimately, I only got a low 5-10% for my project, while the folks who copied from me got 80%. The people who only did the reports got A+s,As, while I sit here, getting a B.

A bunch of people with better grades than me, don't even understand the concepts they are supposed to use. You can even come by and tell me that the results in a certain simulation is due to something entirely out of context. You can set parts in solidworks, floating in mid-air by itself, and drop by to tell me that that is a proper stress simulation. You put things interfering through one another, even as rigid bodies, and you tell me that the thing is out of whack.

I have never gotten a semesterial CAP of anywhere near 4. 

You will never have the anxiety from being concerned that you will get rejected in a job application because your CAP is lower than a 2nd lower. 

Capability? I got a C for the modelling module I took in year 2. Ironically, I was the draftsman for my project group. They all had As and Bs btw. They still tikam tikam the simulations. 

When you apply for a job, the first thing bosses look at is your CAP. 

Let me quote that lady from SMRT a few months back: "Yeah, we also look at your other achievements as well, so no worries. Say if people get a second lower, we look at their cca achievements first, and if you are a second lower,not to worry." It's word for word.

If you have a rather decent CAP of at least 3.5, be glad that your effort paid off. If you make it sound like you made a big sacrifice to get there, I would tell you, I only saw my family, or talked to them, once every 3 months.

Hi, I'm a NSF starting school next year. I'm interested to take Economics. However, according to my economics teacher, the career prospects for economics students in the private sector is pretty dim unless one is able to secure at least a second-upper. She further add on that only a handful can secure such stellar results. May I know how true is this?

 The problem I have with NUS students is that they are too focused on grades. When you reach university level, you are considered to be top 10% of the society. There is no reason to be obsessed with competing. Instead, they should focus on playing around with what they have learned and less optimized on exams. It's okay to be a 'bad' student.
-
 
 Hi OP :) Let me give you my perspectives on the matter. I am a year 4 Math major who pretty much fits in your description (bell-curve spoiler, can do tough, unconventional exam questions). Typically, the students who fall into this category are either

1) Geniuses, which most likely is not the case. Frankly speaking, those prodigies who are capable of pulling out miraculous mathematical feats are studying in top schools overseas. There are some geniuses who studies in NUS, but the number is pretty insignificant.

2) Students who had a head start. There is a sizeable number of Math majors who have done Math Olympiad before the enter university. Just like you, they have your perseverance in studying math to hone their skills, and your ego in making sure that they do not fall behind their peers (don't get the wrong idea though, I have interacted with many top Math students who are the humblest bunch of people that I have seen, because they are smart enough to know that there is always something that they can learn from others). However, these people have spent thousands of hours practicing problems that require unconventional and creative manoeuvres which cannot be possibly covered in most modules that emphasize on content delivery. Personally, back in high school, there were many times when I was so indulged in solving Math problems until I realised that it was already 2am in the morning. While I did not experienced many Math training camps before, I do know that students selected to represent their country for IMO are excused from school for several weeks just to practice Math. These people are professional problem solvers already. While a question might seem unconventional to you, a veteran problem solver could have solved the problem countably many times, to the extent that it becomes a routine problem.

That said, I have interacted with many peers who only started doing serious math when they joined NUS. Several of them are now top students in their cohort, winning various faculty awards for mathematics. These people managed to compete with students who have had many years of experience in problem solving because they have optimized their learning. For example, when I study, I think it is pointless to read through the lecture notes for my modules. I will jump straight into solving unfinished tutorial problems, exam problems or problems from external sources because doing so will allow me to identify the theorems or techniques that I need to practice further. When I see a problem that I can solve within split second, I will not even bother writing down the solution and just proceed with the next problem. Different people have different styles of optimising their study. There is no one-size-fit-all solution, but the most important thing is to question your current methodology to see if it is optimal for you.

Do look for additional sources of problems too! If you have friends taking S modules, consider looking at the problem sets that they are working on. If you are interested in the hardest problems that can be asked in your course, look at problems from undergraduate math competitions such as Putnam and IMC. Otherwise, you can look for problems asked in graduate student qualifying exams too. The Berkeley Problems in Mathematics is a good source for tough problems in most of your core modules. Yes, these are intimidating, but from you post I can tell that you are not a person who will merely settle at our module content. 

Most importantly, one fact that I regret not knowing earlier is that it is not sufficient for one to merely understand the line by line arguments presented in proofs or solutions. Merely understanding a proof or a solution does not mean that you have acquired the knowledge. Few months down the road, you probably would have forgotten the proof for theorems such as the fundamental theorem of calculus, or the correctness of Lagrange multiplier, or the step by step details of Fast Fourier Transform. A theorem will only belong to you if you can elucidate the ideas communicated in the theorem. As an analogy, if I were to ask you to write a blog post about the epsilon delta definition of limits, what would you have written? If I were to ask you to explain the construction of real numbers to a high school student, what would you have said? When you are confident of doing so, only then will the knowledge truly belong to you.

Of course, the main motivation behind your craft should be your love for the subject. For me, I see math as more of an art form, and a very far departure from a conventional scientific domain. We see beauty when we see the proof in infinitude of primes. We exclaim at the ingenuity of the proof of irrationality of square root of two (Google "A Mathematician's Apology" for more information). You need to start treating math as an art form, for math is a craft that requires perseverance to master. A person with a diploma in piano is clearly different from a professional pianist. Similarly, a maestro of mathematics can see much further than a typical math graduate. Work hard, and treat mathematics as a craft that you want to perfect. Eventually, one day, you will be able to perform feats that will leave someone saying, "Wow, this is really beautiful! How did you even think of that?"

I'm in a hurry so pardon any grammatical mistakes or incoherence in my writing :P

Why must profs force us to group with exchange students? I am not against exchange students. Most of them are really friendly and nice. It is just that they don't have time to commit to projects! They travel during recess week while some simply don't care because their grades are not counted. I think it is really unfair especially if the two local students in the group would have to tank the whole project almost by themselves and THE PROJECT IS WORTH 50% OF THE GRADE!

The first 8 weeks of sch this semester was going totally great. My midterms, my assignments and quizzes were mostly above average. However, I am at the point of the semester where I feel mentally exhausted. So much so that I found myself skipping a lot of lectures (especially those modules with no finals) the last two weeks just to catch up with sleep and have a good rest. But I can't seem to do so when my phone is bombarded with Whatsapp messages from my groupmates all the time. It doesn't help either that I have five projects to juggle this sem. I know its ironic, but I am scared my absenteeism would greatly affect my grades. 

I always feel a tinge of guilt whenever I skip a lecture whose modules do not have finals. But at the same time I am in a desperate need of sleep and not think about schoolwork as much. Today, I got up in the morning in an attempt to attend class but my body and my mind just couldn't bring myself to do it. I found myself crying and just headed back to sleep. I am so suffocated and I cannot wait for this sem to end and get my well deserved break. Does anyone feels like this too or is it just me being too weak to handle the pressures of university life?

Hi everyone, I should be studying but i am just rotting away, using the computer and reading NUSWhispers. Just want to say, 3 more weeks to end of the sem! WE CAN DO IT GUYS.

Sometimes I just could not believe that how the quality of the exco are selected in the certain club where the outgoing exco will look down on the incoming exco.

Am taking my A level this year and looking to enrol in NUS next year. Looked at the IGP and realised that the only courses that i can probably qualify for are the 'dumping ground' (based on what I read online and infer from the IGP) courses like PFM and RE. I am really disturbed by the perception of these courses.. May I know if anyone in these courses specifically chose to enrol in them even with stellar grades? Or is it as a last resort like what many ppl say?? Also, is it true that as not many ppl do not want to enrol there, students who listed any of these courses as their choices(even if its the 5th or 6th) will be offered any of these courses so the faculty can meet intake quota even if they may qualify for other harder to get in courses listed as 1st or 2nd choice(eg. Business)??

*I do not mean to offend any students of these courses and am really seeking for advice!! TIA!!

Hi, Yea so this is my take on NUSSU and club recruitments/ engagement. I feel that it's totally fair to have internal recruitments / coopting. Well (regardless of motive) first a club needs dedicated people and with the few people running for committee positions, there isn't much of a pool to source from. Secondly we need to release that backdoor job opportunities are not just a university level phenomenon. Easier to go through shit with people you know rather than taking the risk. Similar, easier to hire someone who has been recommended by your own staff. Of course what needs to be done is striking a balance between building an inner circle and getting new blood / diversity if of opinions. Perhaps the real problem with all this is the lack if empthy/connection between the clubs and student population. But take note that the problem is a two way issue, the student population needs to help make the process easier as well (through feedback, active participation and involvement).

To ,

For a committee who went against the students' decision by choosing to co-opt a Vice President which has been previously voted NO by the science student population in the external elections, I would say there is no point in wasting your time here. 

How can NUSSU and such faculty clubs continue to be the students' representative voice when they repeatedly choose to ignore our opinions?

Like honestly these freaking Graduate Assistants (GAs) are there to assist you during the labs. But they often don't know what is going on in the labs and even chit chat amongst each other like they are there to have fun, and only occasionally looking at us struggling to finish up the labs. 

Often the only last option is to ask the Teaching Assistant (TAs) for assistance and the TA can only do so much with every other student asking for help. Honestly there should be a rigorous test to decide whether they are fit to be GAs.

Sincerely, 
Year 2 EE student

To 
I call bullshit. Unless you are talking about bikes. How much can u earn working part time? Do u even know the rate of doing part time jobs ? Ok let's say u already worked full time for a few year before quitting to study full time, can you tell me how are u able to save up to 65k for just the coe alone in 3 years at our level ? I highly doubt that. Even if they were entrepreneurs I don't think you can just "earn a car " .
Just to be clear, the "my parents bought the coe and down payment so I just have to pay the monthly installments and petrol every month " DOES NOT count as working hard. 

If you come from a wealthy family , u get support from your rich parents . There's no need to cover it will bullshit like " I worked hard to pay back for 40% of this while my parents supported the rest."

And yes I'm saying this because I'm sour that my parents are poor staying in a small hdb taking public transport everyday. 

Do prove me wrong by saying how you,  " worked hard " for your car. If you can.

 Im an upperclassman and I certainly am the so called "science student" before I matriculated. I was in the science stream in both secondary school and junior college and did pretty badly for all my arts subjects. I guess that's the norm for the average kid where you only are good at either science or arts. I know many friends whom are better at arts than science and can't do well in the latter, especially mathematics. I hardly read before I entered FASS but I majored in humanities anyway because that was what I really wanted. It's hard to tell if I would have done better in science-related majors since I'm better at science but at the same time, I would have less motivation studying them than what I'm enjoying studying now, humanities. I would say I'm doing pretty well right now. I think many times, it's just a matter of putting in hard work, and I mean serious hard work to make up for your lack of aptitude.

Perhaps the question you should be asking is if you should be majoring in something you will be good at rather than something you really want, or are they the one and the same thing? All the best :)
-
 
Why are there so many guys in engineering? Are guys innately better at math and science while girls for humanities? Such a weird phenomenon. General observations also prove that girls are normally more eloquent than guys (or maybe that’s because Im in engineering)
Final year B student here and I don’t think I can even do a MA1505 problem now. I literally don’t know anything about my major. I got CARRIED hard by my project mates (who is really smart and don’t mind me contributing 5% of his efforts). B student who don’t know anything. Wdf nus?

Hi everyone here. I have a question to ask regarding the grading in NUS.
Say if IVLE grade book's score and the actual score is different and it is unreported to the prof. Will the prof know? Or is there a possibility that the grade book score reflects somebody else's results like there is an error when inputting in IVLE? Then when computing the final results, do they key in using the results in IVLE or they have another list? Would be good if a prof could comment on this..

To OP of  You're definitely not the only one feeling this. I am a Year 2 student and always bugged with finding meaning to university life. In fact, I have been questioning this since I matriculated. Tried convincing myself with the "university is the best time of your life" philosophy but it feels like hell everyday and I'm faced with much dread going to school. I am much convinced that student life and academia does not suit me. I feel like a bird forced into a fish tank to swim. The only reason I am going on is solely by societal's perception that one has to be well-educated to be 'successful' in life. Anyway cheer up and pull through your final year, I'm sure new and exciting opportunities await you after your graduation :)

I am a year 4 student, currently working on FYP. I have heard from my seniors that the final year will be hard, juggling between FYP and other regular modules. I thought I had mentally prepared myself for it before the academic year starts. But the amount of pressure is so tremendous and overwhelming. Readings, research, deadlines, prof meetings, reports.... 4 hours of sleep is totally like a luxury now. Just recently, when I was scrolling through fb and instag, I see that a lot of my friends also do feel the pressure from FYP, especially when it is week 9 now, and deadlines from other modules starts pouring in. The bloodshot eyes, the eyebags, the eyecircles, the struggle is real. I realize we don't tell each other the pressure we are facing, we still show our happy side in school, lest our friends get worried about us. But when we were alone, i guess many of us do feel exhausted.

I just want to say to all the year 4s out there: You are not alone. When you are still working on your FYP till the late night, there is also a fellow NUS year4 doing the same. When you tear when it is too much to cope, there is also a fellow NUS year4 feeling the same.  
We will pull through and we will be fine (: These bits of sacrifices will be worth it (: 
 
For the juniors, do give a word of encouragement and show some concern to your seniors when you see them (though I think yall will hardly see year4s now (like phantoms), always stuck in the labs/thesis room). A short whatsapp message, a warm hug, or a short meal/meet-up will do too! Never underestimate how the little gesture can help to brighten up their days (: 

Do tag the year 4s if yall wish so that they know they are not alone! Make them feel loved! All the best for FYP my fellow schoolmates! (:

(Alright, back to working on my FYP...signpie)

I am graduating soon (year 4 now) and in my second year, I had to to divide my time between my studies and helping out in my father's business. My Father was out of job in my second year and plunged his retirement savings into the business. It was tough and we really had to slog our ass off to make sure it would work. Today the business is running well and I confessed to my dad that my grades in my second year were not good and had affected my CAP badly. He just told me this, " so what? Never base your life in terms of CAP. You are young and there is so much you can achieve." I just felt a huge burden was lifted off my shoulders and felt so much more determined to succeed. Thanks dad for being my best Friend and mentor

Anyone out there who feels that studying is meaningless and struggling to find meaning in university education? 

That's me. 
Last semester, I attended my friends' commencement. Those that were in my clique left for the working world, leaving me behind. I came a long way to make it to start honours year but i can't seem to find motivation and joy in my studies. :( 

Life changed, lost too many friends and I am left with my education. I have no idea what i should do next.

Hey guys, is this legit? I'm still receiving email in my NUS account though

 Is it because you think can rely on certificates to prove your worth? It can help you with getting in. But chess players know the importance of studying the end-game. In other words, it is not enough to just get in. You must know how to get to the end and win.

STEM subjects are mostly grounded on mathematics (axiomatic). This is very powerful in many situations. You can take a few STEM modules if you want. You probably be given some recipes on how to solve some problems. Recipes are necessary but not sufficient, as students found out in exams. Another problem is anchoring (see Kahneman), where student hang on to the existing recipes instead of coming out with something different. To come out with something new requires meta-level exploration. In NUS, there is only one subject which attempts to explore meta-level. Locke calls it the under-laborer of sciences. Hawkings said it is dead. A typical STEM student says it is useless because there is no recipe.
-
 
So I am not a student at NUS yet but will be in 1 year's time. Currently I am offered a slot in PFM and I would just like to ask about the culture/prospects/advice from current students since I am quite nervous about spending the next 4 years in the PFM course. Any comments would be so much appreciated and if PFM isn't suited for me, then at least I can make the decision to apply for another course/another Uni next year.

@bizschoolkid Finance and accounting graduate here. Class part only destroys friendships when you allow it to. I have classmates who pass me their slides for reference even when my group is presenting the same question in a later session. 

Few basic guidelines if your classmates are the zealous type
1. Gauge the situation before shooting. If it is obvious the person is wrong, avoid doing an overkill unless you hate him
2. Ask questions when there is a decent scope for different opinions. Don't ask bloody stupid questions like why the tax rule is like that
3. Choose your tone and style. Fine line between learning and being an ass
4. Be prepared to survive any shots. You can also be nice and defend the helpless sheep if there are asses in your class. Done that a few times.
5. But also prepare a list of weapons. Be diplomatic but armed yourself well to deter asses

Year 2 here, thinking of applying for a restricted minor. As it is now, I will have to take 1 of the minor's mods during special term otherwise I won't be able to fulfill the requirements before the end of my 4 years.

I really like Prof LP for LSM1104 lectures! I love the way he speaks, (esp. that accent) and presents himself for lectures! I like how he puts in so much effort for us to have mini assessments to understand our misconceptions and replying to any questions in our emails with lengthy answers to address our misconceptions! I feel that he is the best lecturer I have met in NUS so far~~~ (Y)

to the OP of  I'm in the same situation as you. my bf is currently serving the army and he is going to enter uni next year while i would be graduating. i would have to wait for him for another 3 years for him and he plans to do a masters overseas if the opportunity arises. we are the same age( he took the longer route). I always wonder whether I would be able to wait for him and what future lies ahead of us though he always reassures me but i can't help but worry still with all the uncertainties ahead..

just want to rant about my Dota games...

The thing is that when I play with my friends I always feel like a burden to the team and I hardly have any impact other than the standard buy ward buy courier up courier. I'm not saying that I don't like to play with them but sometimes I just hope that my friends are not of such high mmr so that we could play a easier and less stressful game. I don't want play solo because I rather play with people I know instead of teaming with players who spam other languages that I don't understand even though I selected the preferred language as English. :(

Sigh anyone wants play low mmr games with me?

Any professors dare to try this?

Throw your students bunch of books about a subject and ask them to self-study them for 6 weeks. After that, test them on the subject.

Please help guys. I'm always at a lost on how to email profs. Maybe I'm overthinking it? I'm afraid I'm coming across as rude or demanding when I'm enquiring about something. I could not make it for the mid-term and hence am attending the re-test. However the re-test date isn't finalised yet. I am afraid the re-test would be set on certain dates, which there would be definite clash for me. Hence, how do I tell them to avoid these dates, without telling them what to do? Plus I'm probably not the only one taking the re-test! How?!

Hi seniors, can I ask what do you guys usually do during the december holidays? Of course, I want to relax, but I'm afraid that I may lose out because others might go work, volunteer, etc. My older cousin told me that his interviewer asked him what he did during uni breaks... well, I don't want to end up in that situation where I have nothing to say. I think I should plan ahead for my holidays. Any suggestions?

In recent times we've constantly seen news reporting things like: "Shrinking pool of engineers poses national risk", "Engineering should be the core of our economy", "More should do engineering". Let me shed some light on this matter as a recent NUS Engineering graduate.

Im wasnt the typical engineering student, who chose engineering for its job prospects and future. I wanted to be an engineer, to transform ideas into applications, to create new solutions for existing problems and all that inspirational stuff. I took on a government scholarship which allows me to serve a 3 year bond in any local engineering firm upon graduation, i worked hard, graduated with good honours and a shiny resume of 3 internships, overseas exposure and a couple of Project Director positions during Uni. I graduated amongst the top of my cohort.

Discounting the foreigners in my cohort, whom mostly joined the industry under their mandatory scholarship requirements (SM 1/2/3 scholarship). Almost half my singaporean peers joined banks and the finance industry, the remainder landed civil service positions, further studies, and maybe alittle less than half joined the engineering industry. 

It was incredibly puzzling why so many chose to join the finance industry until i started work. In engineering, most of us work in the west, Tuas, Jurong Island, some at Sembawang. We get up on average 5+am daily and travel 1-2hours to get to a place closer to Malaysia than our homes, most of us work late without OT pay, and without public transport in the area, call cabs home. All with the average 3k+ salary, the lucky few in the big MNCs get 4k. Which is about half of the salary of those engineering students who joined the finance industry. Btw im not comparing with biz/arts students who join the banking/finance industry, im refering to fellow engineering students.

The work environment is unpleasant, glamorous, and you would be lucky to have afew singaporean colleagues to hang out with, as most foreigners there just want to finish the stint and go back to their country. The remuneration scales poorly compared with other industries partly because companies would simply hire a cheaper indian/chinese engineer to replace you if you ask for more.

In summary, Engineering is tough, you work long hours, with long travelling times, unexciting environment, with low and poor increment in salary, my question to everyone who demand engineers in singapore is: why should anyone do it? 

I intend to join a bank when i finish my bond, im sure the finance industry is tough too, but its surely nothing i can't handle. With about double the pay, better conditions, better prospects, who would want to stay in engineering?

Since we are in the mid-terms I would like to ask the community a question. How much does a helpsheet really help in exams? I find that I hardly refer to my helpsheets unless I am not well-prepared for the exam. And if I'm well prepared, I don't need my helpsheet at all.
-
 
Is our uni ranking in the world really that important? Ranking doesn't equate to us getting jobs more easily. Many of my friends (and including myself) is still unemployed, despite looking for jobs for several months.

 and the hardworking but not scoring well peeps

Just my take on Engineering and Sciences, from the 'smart, lazy, high CAP' dude, after teaching so much home tuition, my advice is ironically, start asking less.

Everyone thinks that we got it all sorted out. We don't ask much questions, people go to us for answers, but we never even appear for lectures, tutorials or anything.

How about us? No, I didn't magically understand everything just by reading the notes once. Yes, I get stuck while practicing about 80% of the time cause I have never appeared for any lessons. 

But I don't ask. In the worst case, for hours, I will just sit there thinking why I got it wrong. Read notes, try to solve, get stuck, rinse and repeat. Then after so so long I figured it out, I understood, and I redo the same question twice to make sure I can apply the understanding.

The most valuable questions are the ones you can't do. Be hard on yourself. Too many people do every question in the tutorial, feel satisfied that they can do the easy ones, then hit the hard ones. Got stuck for 5 minutes. It's okay, skip, next question, done a great deal of work today, lets just wait for tutorial. Find the flaw in that.
Tutoring only helps you to understand the logic, and everyone follows the logic normally. But the issue here is, tutors can't help you to apply. Do you review your tutorial? You haven't figure it out unless you can do it all by yourself again. But hardworking people are rushing off to do their next tutorial already. 

Just my 2 cents, take it with a pinch of salt, thanks for reading! And back to the question i'm stuck at. Good luck for midterms!

Sometimes you got to believe in yourself :) Don't let the comments bring you down

I miss reading books. Ever since the semester started, I have very little time to read the books that I want to read. All my energy is channeled on the materials provided by the lecturers. Most of the reading materials are boring stuffs (probably there is a selection bias: those who can tolerate boring stuffs are mostly likely to be an academia). I have to practice 'critical' reading and fault finding on everything I read.

And my friend told me that today is my favourite professor's birthday. How does my friend know? Well, apparently the professor told the entire lecture group to respond to her questions because it's her birthday. And the entire LT sang her a birthday song. HAHAHA!

You know you have gotten yourself a really awesome professor when she never fails to try and connect with students genuinely! In addition, she loves her students like they are her children too. I was walking to her room and I was surprised when I saw my photo on her door! She prints out photos her past and present students took with her and attach on her office door. I have never seen a professor that passionate towards the students before. She is the first!

"The best teachers inspire", that's her teaching philosophy. She truly holds herself true to her words and places her students' learning before the content. 

Here, I wish Prof Ang a very joyous birthday and to all her students(including myself), I am proud to say that you guys are really blessed to have such a professor in your uni life.

Fresh grad from Nus biz here. My colleague and I text everyday after work abt everything under the sun. Both of us are attached btw. Is it considered excessive or 'crossing a line' ?

I graduated a few years ago with a CAP below 3.0, pretty lousy by most of your standards. My purpose of writing this post is to let you, whose results may also not be so ideal, know that it's OK (really!) as long as you give your best, and don't be too harsh on yourself conforming to society's standards (like a 4.0)

In my undergrad days, I know that my grades aren't as good as my peers, although I put in extra hours including Sat and Sun, hiding in the library. I studied hard, but didn't study smart. (Thankfully during commencement, they don't announce what class you graduate with.)

Fast forward to present, I have a job that I enjoy, pays relatively well and have good prospects. Actually my company recruited me without me submitting my results transcript to them lol. (PS this may not apply to ministries, stat boards and "branded" companies)

Conclusion: Give your best, and don't be too harsh on yourself. Some ppl in NUS are smart, hardworking or both, it's really tough to compete sometimes. Internship experience is helpful to 1) give you real working experience and 2) let you know what you want (or don't want) to do in the future. So my advice is go take up internships if possible. Another tip: you may think that internships are hard to find, THEY'RE NOT. Just apply early and apply many!

Please comment below if you would like me to share more of these experiences. Other graduates feel free to share too. Cheers!

I still remember that it was a brilliant start to my freshmen year especially with getting almost 100% for all my midterms. With me starting to work on problems way before my first semester, they were just too easy but most of the students were in like "must get a Boyfriend/girlfriend" or "must do your best in hall activities" kinda mode. There wasn't anything wrong with that but I knew that I was kinda distracted easily and that was why I told myself I would never join hall.  I was in the top 75 percentile for all of the midterms and obviously you could guage it would be easier to score As in these modules, unless of course you make careless mistakes in the finals. Eventually I did score almost a perfect 5 in my first sem. Now, in my fourth year, I am sitting near CAP 4.4 cos you see I wasn't really that smart and in the first sem I started practicing exam papers in the recess week whereas most people wait for about 2-3 weeks before the exam period starts. Modules get a lot harder especially in the second year and the professors just become most stricter, with failure rates a lot higher (esp in engineering, BTW i am from ME)

I did not want to brag about it but I did actually work very hard for it. The main reason for this post was for the freshmen who just arrived at the uni to realise that it is not easy to pull up your grades in the later years after nearly flunking one of the semesters without working extremely hard. On the hand, not all of your time should be focused on cramming all the information and have some play time/social time as well. Of course, you would have batch mates who are already very good at what they are studying because they became familiar with all the concepts way before. I know it's not easy not to be intimidated by such people but try focusing more on the concepts rather than practicing more examples. For those who haven't started studying for midterms, it's not too late now as well and I think getting As in the first year is a lot easier than the later years unless of course you are willing to go for extra consultations etc.

All in all, it's really easy to get disillusioned and tempted by peer pressure at this stage and it's important that you learn what exactly are your priorities? Just my two cents as a final year student in NUS
-
 
To the OP, can't help to say this but I believe it's alright to assume that people who don't stay in hall or join NUS CCA should perform better academically. Unless you are working part-time, there is no reason why with so much free time, you can't be doing at least decently. I stay in hall and have NUS CCA so I know the struggle. Like you, I am also studying what I like and slowly trying to improve my grades. The difference is the social commitment I am willing to commit. I have no regret whatsoever because I am NOT missing out in my university life and doing quite decently academically. I believe instead of feeling irked, OP should understand the context when people assume you don't stay in hall/join NUS CCA. Try joining one before criticizing other people.
-
 
nobody is irreplaceable. face it. if you are not smart/successful/hardworking/lucky enough, you will work for people who is. Time and money, you can only choose one. Classic e.g would be spending money to take a taxi(save time and spend money) v.s queuing and squeezing in mrt(save money spend time). Time IS money.

The Yale-NUS article about how their library is an exclusive space makes me annoyed.

Anyone here who got into NUS through discretionary admission? As a future applicant, I want to ask if they still look at your grades if I apply via that.

 The problem with Humanities is that it doesn't use mathematics to reason. Hence it is not really rigorous.  You can't achieve certainty with Humanities subjects unlike the STEM subjects.

Need some advice here: Can anyone please tell me just how bad a 'W' grade is? Do employers find that to be a 'turn off'? Has anyone had a bad experience with it?
Background: I'm overloading with 6 modules. Currently thinking of dropping a level 4k module... I really don't have a good feeling with this module because it is really difficult for me and I don't have a clue what the Prof is saying most of the time... Less than 2 weeks left to make that decision...

What's the difference between the 24h reading and the 3h reading since both are updated hourly? If suppose I want to determine if it's alright to go out, which reading should I take reference from, since there is big difference between 143-168 vs 222 (Just using this as an example, not intending to go out at 1+am).

I'm hoping that one day there will be someone who has gone the double degree route with arts and something else like engineering, science or business to step out and tell everyone arts students are not having it any easier than them. Just because saying "fass no need to study and arts degree is easy/useless" is a norm, there is no need to continue this misconception. Stop putting arts students down and stop pitying yourself. Pathetic.

I'm a recent graduate of NUS. I'd gotten a highly sought after position in a top bank. It's been three months of work. Am I crazy if I'm to quit my job and sell off every thing to hit the roads till I'm out of money? I'd done three months of Indochina peninsula for $2k sgd. With more than $12k in my bank, no loans to pay off, I'm confident of at least a memorable year with couchsurfing and hitchhiking. Question is, what's in for me after I'm back eventually? Anybody wanna come along?

What talking you op ?! You can go make your own confession page with your own voting POLE. I am quite a frequent reader on NUSWhisper when my friend first introduce me this page. After reading a few confessions I check out other universities (overseas as I am currently on exchange) confession page and guess what, OMG the amount of drama and post quality I don't even bother reading on. I will admit I do learn a little here and there from some post and comments. What is there to complain about?! Maybe you can consider confessing else where loh like fessup.

Admins, just so you know, you are doing a darn good job in filtering posts!

First and last confession from the silent reader

Year One student here. I feel uni is not really a place to learn in depth about things. The pace is too fast. It's all about showing your profs how well and how much you already know about the subject beforehand, then they grade you accordingly. Therefore, if you want to do well, you cannot just choose a course because you want to learn more about it in school. You must actually choose one that you are already good at and hopefully been reading and practicing previously. There's a fine line between being good at something, and just casually being interested in it.

We push young people who have no idea what they want to do in their lives into a specialization. What if students are free to take whatever major modules that interest them in year 1. Then they get to apply for the major that they want to study.

I'm a year 2 life science major but I don't have much interest in what I'm studying. Learning about all the research methods, reading all those research papers and doing labs that are bio-medical/ molecular biology based are so so so painful, because unlike most of the LS majors, I have no interest in specialising in biomed or even molecular biology. I try my hardest to understand, but I seems that it takes longer for me to understand the content compared to others.

Initially i wanted to join the arts faculty but was rejected because my A level score was too bad. Ironically, i did more badly in all the science based subjects at A levels. Till today, I do much better for my arts modules than my science modules.

I feel really discouraged and stress at the thought of not being able to cope. I've considered switching to the arts faculty, but there seems to be more job opportunities for science...

No idea what I should do..

Do profs check out who exactly emailed them and how the students look like? I always thought they are too busy to bother checking out who the student is and the cohort is pretty large with more than a hundred students, until one day after lecture a prof came to my seat and asked if i am the one who emailed and whether i can fully understand the explanation given. I emailed profs questions thinking they will never check who the students are but hmm now i shall be a bit skeptical about this eh? Does anyone knows if the prof's email have the ability to reveal the student's identity by clicking some stuff?

Ps: in case you guys start thinking the questions i asked are too basic, it's not. The questions are usually those that delve deeper into the topics taught which can  help me understand a lot more about that topic.

Anyone else feel that NUS Students are generally quite rude? Once the lecturer has reached his/her last slide, students start to pack up and talk among themselves while the lecturer is still talking. There is so little respect given to the lecturer. I wonder if this is the same overseas..

I'm confused. Why are people whacking MOE on spending hundreds of millions a year to foreigners on scholarship and sponsorship? Total amount / amount per student is probably less than a thousand student?

First of all, it is a SCHOLARSHIP. I believe scholarships are meant to award people (regardless of locals or foreigners) who have the most potential or the best qualities to contribute back to a certain ministry or country in the future. If the foreigners are really good, they deserve the scholarship.

And not to forget, MOE have bursary awards and financial assistance scheme for Singaporean who faces financial challenges in affording school fees, on top of all that highly subsidised school fees and misc. fees from primary school to JC (yup poly and ITE gets subsidies too). And all Singaporeans get to benefit from the MOE tuition grant of about S$120,000 per person (my fac is about S$14 000 per sem).

WHAT'S THERE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT?! I DONT UNDERSTAND. I'm a Singaporean and I am more than thankful for all these. (And there we have some political party saying that Singapore's education system is not good?)

Hi so I really need advice, I'm a year 1 student in FASS and i took on the "Introduction to Economics" mod because I really wanted that exposure. (I'm not from a JC so I literally have no prior background to Econs). Week 3 just ended & despite putting in extra hours to study, I really am struggling with it. Is it possible that I would be able to catch up and do OK for this mod?? or should i just try to drop it now?

(P.S. Econs is not my intended major)

#CS2103 Software Engineering Advice
"Be everything to somebody and not something to everybody."

I just graduated from NUS and now I undergo training before starting on my job, which I received a study award for. The problem is, I took it up because I didn't know any better; family had low income and parents wanted me to secure a job. They weren't in favour of me pursuing my dreams if it didn't cover my tuition fees, but I was rejected of their scholarship. 

I'm not suited for this current job, I want to pursue my dream job, but I have no $$$ to break the bond, which amounts to about 70k. My family fell apart along the way, I only support my father now. 

As I grit my teeth and pull through everyday lifelessly towards the end of 4 years, I'm looking for any possible option to obtain a 70k loan to free myself of this. (Asked the banks, it was a no-no.) This job and my dream job are both good jobs, but I just want to pursue the thing that makes me happy and keeps me motivated, and not something just to get by. Hopefully, someone/something will help me out and end this. If not, I just have to survive my bond.

Anyone have this problem? The school demand us to take modules outside our technical classes to broaden our education. But I don't see any link between studying some b.s. GEM/SSA modules from FASS to my own technical education. It feels like a waste of time. The lecturer likes to talk about many things and leave the students in aporia. I could have taken more technical modules which are more relevant.

as an accountant-to-be, i'm angry that we get treated like cheap whores.

the only perk of being an accountant is job stability. (anyone cares to suggest any others?) 

accountants work long hours, maintain company's financials in order to satisfy regulations and laws. Sometimes provide added duties to help company save some taxes etc.

but we get paid like shit on graduation (and for an extended period of time the pay sucks)

my prof once mentioned that accountants used to be paid quite well as it's a professional skill. 

but idiots came and cheapen the entire profession. 

damn it. SCREW THOSE IDIOTS.

Pfft. Another article about uni degrees and education. 

I worked with a friend during NS before and have immense respect of him. He keeps implying on fb he got good attitude but couldn't get a job because his qualifications are not good enough. 

I believe many people didnt fuck up their education but the education system fuck them up. I feel like they shouldn't waste their time and money studying SIM UoL and/or compete against the local uni grads. Learning useful skills like excel or programming is more beneficial than chasing papers. They complain that companies look for qualifications first but that's because they are applying for the mainstream big company jobs. There are bosses (usually the smaller companies) who are very open minded and value skills over qualifications. 

Am I'm naive? Does being a local uni student cloud my view? If not, can anyone advice me on how to advice my friend (he is a poly grad) because he really has a lot of potential.

I'm a first time TA for a programming mod, my first lab session starts next week, but I can't help but feel nervous. I mean, I had experience teaching primary school kids before, but teaching students only a few years younger feels totally different. later kenna stage fright how ah, no hole for me to hide. Especially those awkward silence when nobody answers. TA workshop also not very helpful to me. Anyone feeling the same way? Any experienced TA got any advice to share? Thanks :) Those going for their first programming lab session next week, be kind and cooperate with your TA okay :)

Hi guys quick question.
Can I go for lectures that were not allocated to me. 
E.g. I want to go for a language lecture but I have zero intention of taking them to clear MCs but purely for interest and hobby reasons.

Can I still do it? If the lecturer caught me in his/her lecture is it going to be an offence in any nature?

Sincerely, 
freshie who stays on campus and wanna attend free language classes during his free periods.

I'm a FASS Year 4 male student graduating at the end of this academic year. The sad thing is I'm still evergreen, although I'm in FASS where the numbers are supposed to work out. Everyone says it is best to find a soulmate in Uni life and I'm still stuck at evergreen. I have only this song to describe my current situation.

I always wondered why some lecturers do not print the essential readings for the module into a course pack. This means that up to hundreds of students would have to clog up the printing rooms and spend time individually downloading the very same material from LINC. 

If the lecturer has designated certain readings as 'essential/basic/compulsory' and given a list of other optional readings that more aspiring students can peruse at their own pace, then shouldn't those readings under 'essential/basic/compulsory' be printed for everyone since everyone is expected to have to print it themselves ANYWAY? This would free up much wasted resources and time and greatly convenience students without compromising their initiative to learn.

Hey I need some advice.. extremely terrible time management and overcommited for this academic year already, but every weekend I'm pretty much torn between 3 things:
Volunteering, studying, and working.

I head a volunteer group for  free tuition for the past 6 years and it's pretty much a thankless endeavor, fueled with some satisfaction because I was once in their shoes. I want the kids to know that if I can make it to uni, so can they. But I'm getting so tired, all the admin,  and I have no one to see this through with me.

Then there's adhoc work that comes every now and then and it pays well. It makes me happy to think that I am slowly starting to support myself. I no longer ask my parents for pocket money, and gladly so.

And lastly there's all that studying to do which I have been falling quite significantly with crazier classes and my final year coming up.. I really like to study and read, but nowadays, there's just no time because of the above 2. (So here I am posting this at 2am after studying for abit)

What do I do? I'm obligated to my tuition kids, my parents, myself and even my future. All this occurs EVERY WEEKEND, this excludes time needed with friends/bf/family. I can't please everyone ><

Hi slightly off topic but I just want to hear you guys' opinion... I have seen many of my fellow course mates using coding programs which I don't think they pay for...

 i think there is always a fair share of people who are disappointed about each year's rag.
Yet i believe that this year's rag did not provide an equal ground for every faculty and school to compete on. The first few groups that performed were at a clear disadvantage as they were performing almost in broad daylight. 
There was no lighting for them to display as well which clearly affected the atmosphere. And as far as i know, the groups that performed first didnt do that well. 
Furthermore, i've always thought RAG focuses on being environmentally friendly. I don't think purchasing lights for the float and to use in the dance is in line with that.

Hey NUS! I'll start off by saying that I'm not a NUS student, but I do browse this page whenever posts appear on my newsfeed. 

Just wanna tell you guys that you're really awesome! I attended your Rag and Flag Day to support my brother and was really quite touched by your sincerity. For the performances by the various external groups, faculty groups and hall groups, your applause and cheers were polite at best. But you saved your best most rousing applause for the MINDS kids who guest performed. Not sure about Grimmie because I didn't stay for it. 

Well it's not much but amidst all the negative posts I just wanna say that you're a cool bunch. Especially the blue shirts I sat next to.

to 
I fully understand your concern. Just want to share my experience, hopefully you will be more encouraged to follow your passion. I don't come from well-off family as well and I always have this sense of responsibility to be financially independent. I used to share the same sentiments as you, thinking that I should just focus on my study or try out CCAs and part-time jobs as well. My friend recommended me to stay in hall because the experience I'll get will be one of the best throughout my 4 years in NUS. In the end, I stayed in hall, thinking that if the CCAs affected my academics badly, I would just move out after 1 semester. I also took up a tuition assignment on top of the CCAs. It was difficult to juggle at first but eventually I can assure you that it is not impossible to balance schoolwork, CCAs and part time jobs if you have the right mindset and discipline. During year two, I took up another part-time job during the weekend as well but I would ask for excuse from my job when finals were approaching. I'm now in my third year and am still staying in hall. Although I am not on track to get first-class honours, I am happy enough to know that I am doing decently enough in school and most importantly saving up bit by bit so as to minimize financial burden on my parents at the moment.

On days like these it gets the most difficult... I just graduated from NUS this year and started work at a prestigious firm with many other hires from the local universities. But unlike my newly hired peers, I've been the only one dumped into my department. Call me fortunate perhaps, for being the only one who was selected for the job.. But on days like these, when you see your peers heading out for lunch together and you have no one else to go with, the loneliness really sets in. Don't ask me to make friends, I definitely already have. But it's just different when you have to ask your friend sitting beside you for lunch versus someone sitting on another level. Just wanted to rant.

My recent job-seeking experience at the Recruit Express was very much similar to  and  but much worse.
The first meet-up was pleasant. To the very least, the recruitment consultant did introduce me the jobs that I have applied for, although he actively promoted his job at recruit express as well. Largely turned off by the idea of doing sales, I declined the offer. A week later, I chanced upon another job posted by recruit express. And my meet with this agent was less than pleasant, because my stay at RE was close to 3 hours but I wasn’t given any information about the job I have applied for at all. The process I had to go through was awfully similar to my first visit, the personality tests and meeting with the team managers and executive. This time however, by the end of the 3 hours, I was brainwashed completely. I was called up to meet with the director the very next day. Although I decided to take up a permanent position, I wasn’t given much choice as the director offered a temporary role for me, reason being that I shouldn’t expect high pay while they are training me. But still, I happily signed the contract with HR and thought I’ve finally secured a job, I was all excited about entering a new phase in life, meeting new colleagues etc. 
Imagine the horror, when I received a call from the HR a day before my work start day, that there’s no temporary position available for me. I was too shocked and upset to react to the sudden news. After all the efforts of meeting up, the grueling hours spent sitting in the meeting room, I really thought they wanted me in. I was told that the division was underperforming and my mentor isn't available to coach me. How is that reason convincing/justified? What about assigning me to other mentors/divisions? As a company, they should have better ways to deal with this rather than just invalidating the contract. I contacted my supposed mentor and she seemed really willing to help, promising she would find out what happened and give me an update later. However, my trust was misplaced, as she proceeded to ignore my calls and messages. 
All I could do was to contact the HR to express my dissatisfaction. I felt like I should be given some form of compensation since I was being unfairly treated and they did break the contract one-sidedly. However, I can't seek compensation because I have not officially started work and it's not recognized as employee-employer relationship from MOM's perspective. The HR recognizes this point, which means they could well be using this loophole to invalidate my contract and other victims like me (which I think is a major flaw: it means companies can just make jobseekers sign contracts with them when they are short-staffed but cast them away when they find more suitable candidates by exploiting the fact that we are not official employees yet). 
I was told that they would forward my resume to external agencies for other job opportunities, which make me madder! That was the very reason why I visited RE initially but on the second visit, I wasn’t even given information about the jobs I applied for before they start selling their job to me. Furthermore, I haven’t receive any job updates from them to date. I was even asked to mail my contract back to them to show that its mutual agreement that the contract is invalidated. How is this a mutual agreement?
Just when I was prepared to let all this go, I came across postings on Jobstreet from that division looking for TEMP/PERMANENT Recruitment consultants. And this was only two days after I received notice from the HR. If they decided that I was incompetent for the role, why would they make me attend interview for hours when that wasn't the job that I was interested in initially? And since they have signed a contract with me, they could have let me prove my worth before they decide to cast me off.
I thank RE for the painful lesson learnt--not to be so naïve and trusting. Now I know shit does happen in life other than FYP. BUT I’m so so glad that I’ve seen their true colours before working for them.  Seriously expected more from Singapore’s best recruitment agency.

I just graduated from NUS (science) this year. Applied for a science related position posted by Recruit Express and got a call from HR the next day. He confirmed that I applied for this healthcare position and invited me down to Recruit Express for an interview immediately. 

I went down and met with the recruiter who started off asking me some basic questions, then he pointed to my previous temp job experience in HR and asked me about it. After telling him the scope of my previous job, he started telling me more about his job, like what else he does as a recruiter (i.e. the additional differences between the temp recruitment job I had vs his position as a full time recruiter). I realized he was not going back to discussing the initial position I had applied for so I asked him about it and he went "Ohh actually, we need people with experience for the job so you are not applicable." ps: He already knew I had no experience when he called me on the phone before inviting me down for an interview. 
Then he was trying to continue selling his HR job but I told him I was not interested in a sales job but wanted a science related job. He went on saying "Did you know, 60% of science grads are no longer doing anything science related, I too was from science." He also asked if I had ever thought of what I knew my career progression/ prospects would be like if I remained in the science industry. Well, I don't know what was his point of saying all these things since I already said I did not want a sales job. 

Anyway, I'm posting this to warn people who apply for jobs posted by Recruit Express as I recently met up with another friend who experienced the exact same thing with Recruit Express. Instead of telling us straight up during the phone call that we are not applicable for the job we applied for, they scammed us to go down and tried offering us a recruiter position with their company, this is ridiculous, having to waste time (about an hour for me) to travel all the way down to ngee ann city. So if you get a call from them calling you down for an interview, do confirm that you are being interviewed for the position you applied for and not a recruiter/ HR position with recruit express to save yourself from angst and travelling time.

It's not surprising that foreign scholars are coming under fire by locals.

The fact that they're here, sponsored by our government and such, it's part of, or an extension the government's foreign talent initiative if I'm not mistaken.

Think about it this way. Working parents are working with foreign talents in the workforce and they're unhappy about opportunities and advantages given to the foreign talents. The parents prolly even lose their jobs if their bosses replace them with foreign talents. They go home, angered and upset. Their kids, studying in local schools, go to school and find that foreign students are bagging the As and given good opportunities, depriving locals in the meantime. That's an additional set of resentment. Young and old, they face similar predicaments with the same set of beneficiaries of the policy. Can the locals really be blamed for their resentment? 

There are those who say foreign talents can inspire and motivate locals to work better and etc. Good way of looking at it, but do take on this viewpoint in due empathy of what locals face on a daily basis. Chances are, the playing field isn't even level to begin with.

On the other hand, foreign scholars, they got a good share of nice people and idiots. I wouldn't hesitate to show those idiots the finger and add some arm-breaking and skull-bashing, but I won't hesitate too, to talk cock sing song play mahjong with the nice peeps around. They're humans too. Same goes for local peeps.

End of the day, what needs to be changed, or reversed to a greater extent, is the policy. As for changing the policymakers, the nation will decide soon enough.

PS: I want to highlight a possible foul practice that certain better secondary schools practice, particularly a well-known school in the east which is my alma mater. I was told quite awhile back that the principals of such schools are sent to China to handpick PRC scholars, after which they will be placed in the top classes of the cohort, depriving many local students of the opportunity. The arrangement of PRC scholars to fill up at least half the top class was true in my alma mater. Should abolish at least this part of the arrangement and let the PRC scholars either mix in with the rest of the cohort, or simply increase the seats in the top class for local students. I think many have complained about this, hope they have done something about it already.

I feel very sad whenever my mom and her siblings (my aunties) discuss about the salaries of different jobs. Whenever they talk about doctors and lawyers, they'll be like "Wah doctors and lawyers got the highest pay". Well, I do agree but I cannot tolerate it when they go on saying (especially my mom), "Ah ya teacher's pay very low one la." It pisses me off. I want to be a teacher next time and although the slow increment in income doesn't affect me much because I am more passionate than anything else to teach, I couldn't help but feel annoyed whenever they think that teaching is a lowly job instead of a profession just because it has a lower salary as compared to doctors and lawyers. I feel like telling them straight by saying "Just in case you do not know, giving private tuition could easily make up for the lesser amount of money that teachers earn." Well, being a teacher won't make you rich unless you are diligent enough to find ways of earning passive income from various investment sources, but its definitely fulfilling and a rather meaningful job. I feel that it should be treated with respect. Even when I tell my friends that I want to be a teacher, they will give this skeptical look and be like "really?". After all these, I am really sick and tired of telling people what I plan to do after I graduate whenever they ask me about such stuff and I would rather they continue assuming I become an engineer since I am studying engineering. Tired of living in such a superficial world. This is the reason why I prefer to be on my own most of the times, away from such toxicities. And also, I may sound disrespectful towards my mom, but I never once voice my concerns. This has been going on for quite some time and whenever my mom talks about such topics, I just feel like getting into an argument but somehow, I will try to do some meditation on the spot to keep cool and not say anything.

Why is there so much hate and mistrust for international students, mainly PRC and Indians? We're all students like you, studying for a good career so that we can support ourselves and our loved ones. We aren't competitive freaks who are out to get your jobs. Moreover, living in another country isn't easy... My heart still breaks every time I leave home. 
We are nice people; please don't treat us like outsiders.

Hi peeps are there any interesting or funny stories in NUS to share ? Dying to know one.

 Hello students. There are many metaphors and analogies that I learned in my field of study that can be applied to my current work even though they are non-related on the concrete level. 

We don't know how things can connect unless we play around with it. For e.g. how does calligraphy relate to typography. Before Steve Jobs, people in Microsoft did not see the link.

Enjoy learning.

As a former NUSSU office holder, I am writing this anonymously not because I am afraid of being identified but rather because those of us who have held office before are reticent in speaking up and I don't wish to put my friends in the spotlight. What I say here is purely my own opinion in my own personal capacity.

I think it is fair for NUS students to question the relevance, effectiveness or even the competency of NUSSU. There are many deep-rooted structural problems that plague NUSSU, ranging from differences in opinions, lack of resources and manpower and being unable to tackle bureaucracy effectively. Indeed, many NUSSU volunteers often use the excuse that they are student volunteers to explain why they fail to deliver results to the students. These have been hurting, are hurting and will continue to hurt the image of NUSSU in students' perception.

However, what I disagree, and with extra vehemence, is the view that people in NUSSU are out to build resumes (ostensibly at the expense of student welfare). That cannot be further from the truth. NUSSU is a graveyard for those building a good resume. You spend ungodly amounts of time doing fire-fighting and executing plans for initiatives that don't receive gratitude when they go well but receive tremendous amounts of brickbats when something minor goes wrong. The time and effort could have been better spent doing internships and career networking sessions if one is truly career-minded.

Also, even though I held a high-enough office in NUSSU that some students feel could be "milked" for resume purposes, I daresay I speak for most NUSSU volunteers in that we are/were in NUSSU because of friends and the belief that we could help effect positive change. Trust me, if you are there for resume-building purposes, you will get jaded within a few months and leave. Yet, many NUSSU volunteers (some of whom become office-holders) stay on year after year. Resume-building doesn't drive them. Passion, belief and friendships do.

NUSSU is not, and shouldn't be, above criticisms. Sure, criticise NUSSU for being irrelevant, ineffective or incompetent. However, don't accuse NUSSU volunteers of being there for resume-building purposes because that cannot be further from the truth. If you don't believe, please take up the challenge of serving in the NUSSU committees or even the exco for a year and tell us whether your resume-building process has been enhanced or diminished.

P.S. No, none of those who interviewed me ever asked me about my NUSSU office, so it didn't help my resume a single bit.

Is there any official statement explaining the rationale of the minimum 18MCs requirement? I am genuinely curious to know what motivated this requirement. Are many students underloading and delaying graduation on purpose? Even If this is so, why should this matter if they are paying school fees? Are they defaulting on their school fees? If a student wants to overload in some sems and underload in another, is it not in his prerogative? That is the whole point of giving us some elaborate bidding system and the autonomy to plan our modules no? Ultimately one just needs to meet the graduating requirements in a reasonable number of years.
 
I was from a polytechnic before coming to NUS which gives me 20 MCs worth of exemptions (generic stuff like gems and UEs) but I have been taking the normal 20mc workload per sem for the first 2 years since it was still manageable. I had always planned to underload come my 3rd year since the modules are supposedly harder and I wanted to use the extra time to focus on a research project. (And by underload I just mean an average of 16MCs per sem which is technically not underloading based on the previous minimum 15MC requirement.) I also cannot push my year 4 mods forward due to prerequisites and the fact that I am not allowed to map honours year modules from exchange. I am essentially stuck in the situation where I need to take arbritrary mods which I do not need to graduate just to fulfill said requirement. Did not plan to graduate a sem earlier either since it would mean giving up going on exchange.

Like that why bother issuing exemptions sia?

I come from a family with above average income. Recently, my grandmother who does not stay with us is diagnosed with cancer. So I wanted to apply for (late) financial aid because my parents do not have savings, so we are now essentially living from paycheck to paycheck. I am doing part-time to support my school fees. So the first time I logged in, I got very frustrated. The portal https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/webroapsbs/jsp/logout.jsp has a lot of bugs and basically it seems like NUS is purposely trying to make it hard to log in. Do you think there is a chance that I will get aid, or should I just forget about applying? I am already in my 4th year.

Have a career goal in mind:
Most of us don't know what we want to do in our lives. I believe its a problem that resonates with every uni student of our age. I couldn't agree more. We have only lived for 2 decades where we spend most of our time in this paper chase. Have we really taken the time out to think about what we want to do or explore the career options out there? Barely at be. We could hardly find a breather in this endless pursuit of grades. Maybe its time we take a step back and give our future a thought. For those who have yet to enrol into university, explore your interests and try to find a degree that aligns with it. Talk to seniors, go for university open houses and find out what are the degrees that offer the kind of modules that you would like to pursue. For those who are already in the university, drop your books during the holidays and dive into internship opportunities that you are interested in. Talk to your professors, academic advisors I'm sure they will hook you up with internship opportunities. If what they offer are not what you are looking for, go out there and source it for yourself. Check out sites like Glints that offer internship opportunities in various sectors of the corporate world. There's no better way to find out about a career then to take on an internship and experience it for yourself. Some of you might disprove that idea of internship as some firms might task you to work on meaningless tasks. Even so, internship offers you to the chance to meet people who are pursuing the career that you are considering. Reach out to them. I'm sure they are in the best position to offer you both answers and advice. At the end of the day, always have a goal in mind. Jump out of this mindless pursuit of good grades. Taking modules with an end goal of getting an A+ grade is not healthy. Rather, take the module because you know it will be benefit you in your pursuit of your ideal career, take it because you interested , take it because you love it. Days are long, decades are short. Make the journey of learning less taxing and more meaningful. And having a career goal in mind will definitely add meaning to this journey.

Hi again. OP from . Thank you for your replies. I guess I still have yet to figure out my destination. There are a couple of things I could see myself doing, having a startup, creating cool things. But they are quite vague. For now, I thought that I could focus on the things that I like doing and taking the mods that let me learn more about them; without having to worry if this mod is the right one for my future. Maybe after uni, I could see what I can offer to society with my knowledge. 

The replies were reassuring. Yeah.. comparing yourself with other people too much isn't that healthy. I do hope I'm satisfied with the path I choose to take. :)

OP of  here... Prof, I think you can set up a matchmaking agency in SoC. :) But my question here is the TOP graduates (ie. Top 1% of the entire cohort when they graduate) Perhaps from class of 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and now 2015? :D

 As a social scientist and humanities researcher, I don't think this is a simple issue about whether a student ranting about unfairness of the CS3216/CS3217's selection criteria. I am not happy with most of the responses to OP's confession as they simply amplify the opinions (doxa) of the political structures that we are in.

It is easy to give comments that people agree on and receive likes from them. Scientific progress doesn't depend on people agreeing on things but on finding things that people disagree on. Personally, I learn the most by addressing both disagreements and agreements (in a Hegelian sense). It seems that the dialectic process is missing in many technical faculties.

Have we consider that the possibility of student bringing new qualities to CS3216/CS3217 which is not identified in the present discourse? We often look for students with good developing skills, designers to be in-charge of UI/UX, marketer with Business experience etc. All these are technical skills (the know-how). What else is missing?

For example, Stanford University has a class where Computer Science students work together with students from Humanities / Social sciences to do inter-disciplinary projects. Src: http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/january/humanities-cs-class-010515.html To quote: "And they agreed that learning to communicate across disciplines is the course's greatest challenge as well as its major payoff. "I want the students to learn to talk to each other," Thrun remarked, "and reach levels of achievement that individual disciplines alone never could achieve.""

Often we relegate the task of generating meaning to the designers or the marketer. But the ones that are good at the "know-what" comes from people who like to ask big questions. They are not necessarily the designers / marketers. These people often have degrees which the society consider to be useless "technically". They are destined to work for Starbucks or McDonald's. Imagine what we can do if we expand our criteria.

Software engineers learned about the important principle of refactoring. There are often better ways of improving our current design even if things are functioning nicely. So why aren't we taking this principle and apply it to the criteria of CS3216/CS3217 or any parts of our life. 

So in software engineering jargon: REFACTOR!!! REFACTOR!!! REFACTOR!!! 

In ordinary language: IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE!!! IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE!!! IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE!!!

The comments from some of the students are alerting. I urge everyone to think harder in whatever position they are in. The education system wants to pretend that it is meritocratic i.e. the smartest and the brightest will get to the top. What if you are too intelligent enough to see the flaws in the system and try to change it? Will you be stopped? Especially when most people are comfortable with the conditions that they are used to :)

The lesson is that currently if you are too intelligent to point out the flaws in the system, you are not allowed by the authorities to change it. Power, as Foucault pointed out, is not residing in any individuals but in the social structures. In NUS, the students no longer hold any power over what the schools decide. NUS student union and NUS political association are facades. The university bureaucrats do things behind our back. Just like how they change the minimum workload policies recently.

 Rejection sucks man...but this is how it happens in the real world. You have to face it. Let me give you a personal experience: I was rejected for NTU scholarship interview because I failed to convince the panel about my achievements. I got good grades in English for A levels but I was so nervous during the interview that I stammered and stuttered most of the time. I made a bad first impression and the panel thought I was not competent enough.

It is because I got rejected that I joined NUS. Had I got the scholarship there, I would have joined NTU. Don't know whether I'm better off or worse off but I am definitely enjoying my life here and would consider myself successful. So it's not true that all rejections spell doom for your life.

Instead of blaming the selection process, I introspected and tried to improve my interview skills. With practice, my communication and interview skills are much better than before. However sad you may feel when you get rejected, most of the time there is no denying the bitter truth that you were not good enough. You can't change the unfair world, but you CAN change yourself.

Think harder. Why did the CS3216 committee reject you? Is it because they want a better coder than you? If so, you should utilise this time and sharpen your coding skills. When you apply for a job, the employers will pay more attention to your coding skills rather than scanning your transcript to look for 'CS3216'. Giant tech companies like Google and Facebook have multiple interview rounds to assess your technical and soft skills. Prepare yourself for these.

Paying same fees doesn't give us the right to take the same modules. All Singaporeans pay taxes, why doesn't everyone get the high-paying coveted government jobs. The world isn't fair to everyone, it is competitive. CAP, grades, intelligence, competence aren't everything in life, but they are not totally unimportant. When it comes to limited resources, only the best are chosen. Survival of the fittest.

Having been through so much efforts and years of study in hope to be a researcher, I often feel crushed when people tell me I probably won't make because of my poor grades. However, being more open-minded now, I just study because I am interested in what I love (which is nanotechnology) and not for the grades to get me to second first class. I realised no matter how I try, my grades won't improve that much.    Instead, I will continue to do what I love and see what it leads me to. If I cannot change the tides, at least I can change myself and embrace it.

Hey Tay Yang Shun, I am wondering why you took cs1010e and cs1020e instead of cs1010 and cs1020. Did you switch your course from engin to cs?

To 
I really can't find your argument.

Have you joined any camps? The fact is that camps help and always will, even if that is not the comm's main aim.

Don't know which hall is right for you, how hall points work, what you can expect in your course, how bidding works, what are the special programme requirements, what to do for SEP and in general everything in uni.  The nature of seniors who join camps vary so wide that they can answer all these questions, where else can freshies ask them? If this is not orientation, what is?

Secondly, why insist on the red tape from OSA? What are we, 8 years old? Everyone is a consenting adult who made it to uni, made a choice of his or her own will to join the camp as a freshie or senior or comm. How do they even affect you? They even pay to book the lecture theatres they need. Seniors pay too, btw.

Some camps filter (facs, some halls), most camps don't (course, oweek). Just demand and supply, why complain? The comm didnt design it for a bigger size, simple. Sometimes you get the short stick, but mostly camps don't filter that significantly, and you definitely can get into one if you want.

And guess what, I didn't even join any camps as a freshie. Am joining this year as a senior, and all the questions I posted are questions freshies asked. Didn't join as a freshie cause i was uncomfortable, but just can't see why people would be against them. Why complain when it doesnt even hurt you? Its like you don't like to eat chicken so no one else can eat chicken. Let consenting adults do their shit.

Hi, I'm a year 2 student. In the midst of recent discussion about orientation camps and activities, I would like to say that many of these programmes have objectives that are way distorted from what they claim to be.  Especially in my faculty, the selection of incoming freshmen is based on whether the org comm thinks the person is happening/ pretty/ sociable enough to be deemed worthy of joining the FOP (freshmen orientation programme). 

From there, you notice that the people who turn up for the various FOPs are generally the same group of faces. These activities have thus become an avenue for a limited number of freshmen to form an exclusive group which is comfortable within itself. This is further than ever from what the FOPs claim to achieve - bringing everyone together, creating an inclusive and vibrant student life, etc. Even amongst the freshmen selected to participate in these FOPs, segregation, clique-forming and mutual judging occurs.  

As for the org comm, you doubt if they are truly interested in achieving what they claim, or are they in this to a) boost their portfolio, b) feel good about themselves that they are doing such big projects, c) expand their personal circle of friends, or d) find a girl/boyfriend in the incoming batch of freshies.

FOPs have become a hotbed for people to show off how many friends they have, how happening they are, posting photos on Insta/FB, etc. No one truly cares if the person next to them feels welcome or integrated into the school. FOPs do form true friendships - this I do not deny, but the amount of hypocrisy and unhappiness they propagate are severely disproportionate. And those who feel left out/unwanted in these FOPs, or are outright rejected from them, often are those who do not have a voice.

Finally, we all know that people of vastly different personalities and characters all have the potential to succeed and make it big in life. FOPs tend to make freshies with certain personality traits feel great, but at the same time make some others feel completely discouraged even before semester starts. Perhaps you might be one of those that will be better off without attending such activites.

This may seem like a flaming post, but this is not just my opinion. It also reflects the voice of some others whom I have spoke to. It is an inconvenient truth that someone has to bring up one day.

Weeks into the internship, I realized that there's always this staff that gets us to do her work. She is not there when something important is happening but she is there after the event. She will ask what happened and then report to her superior in detail. Other than that, mundane brainless work are thrown to us as well. It it well under her job scope though. 

There's a sense of unfairness that i feel. But I guess this is intern life. I can't do much about the situation too. Can't tell the school too, isn't it too insignificant? In this scenario, I've learnt to accept and move on. There are always good and bad staff anyway. I'm lucky to know other staff who treat us like colleagues. Other than that staff, the internship was a pretty good one, not much complains! 

Guys, how was your intern experience?

Adding on to what  said, it is quite well known that some camps only admit people who look good. There is this cross-faculty camp, let's name it Camp X, which is well-known for its 4 days' worth of intensive sporting activities like night cycling, wakeboarding etc. It is also rather well known for discriminating freshmen based on looks by asking them to submit a picture of them having fun. That picture is just an excuse to evaluate the freshmen's looks. (TL;DR is at the end)

So there was this year when a few aggrieved freshmen emailed my student group complaining about discriminatory practices by Camp X in admitting camp participants. They signed up earlier than their friends but later found out that their friends got in while they didn't. What made it worse was that these aggrieved freshmen had more extensive sporting experiences (which I separately verified) than their friends who got admitted.

I then emailed the President of Camp X's parent club and asked for an explanation, in particular why there was a need for freshmen to submit a photo of them "having fun". I also mentioned that the Camp X's committee may have breached rules on unfair discrimination and personal data/privacy protection regarding the photos. To add more bite, I copied their staff advisors and other university administrators in the email chain.

The response from the President was one of the most eye-rolling I've ever read. He said that the photos were used to "evaluate the freshmen's ability to withstand the rigours of the intensive sporting activities" of Camp X. When asked to clarify why the Camp X committee didn't ask for other information such as history of sporting experiences, he said that the Camp X committee could evaluate the freshmen's ability to withstand such rigours "through just looking at the pictures alone". I think I nearly sprained my eye muscles from rolling my eyes at his replies.

As Camp X was already starting then, we decided to close the matter but their staff advisors promised to address the unfairly discriminatory practices as well as personal data protection. The President was also made to email those aggrieved freshmen personally, but the emails were just a rehash of the reasons given above.

I know people who have been in Camp X's organising committees and they admitted privately that they do reject people based on looks, not for lack of sporting abilities. However, I am thankful that my freshmen camps were not as discriminatory since I got excellent experiences out of them.

Perhaps, karma came back to bite Camp X in another way. Usually, Camp X would be so popular that they would have filled up their slots by end-May but this year, there were still empty slots in June. This probably suggests a drop in popularity this year. Momentary or structural? I don't know, and I frankly don't care now.

TL;DR - There is this Camp X, which has intensive sporting activities, that asks freshmen for pictures. When quizzed on the basis, the President of Camp X's parent club gave bullsh*t-y reasons. Their staff advisors promised to address the unfairly discriminatory practices. I am glad the freshmen camps I attended were not like that. Karma came back to bite Camp X as their probably popularity dropped this year.

I graduated from NUS more than 3 years ago, and have been following this page for the past few months. Just wanna share my experience in accumulating wealth after graduating. My genuine advice is..give tuition in your free time. I have been doing so for the last 3 years since I started working. At least 4 times a week, and one point, it was 5 times a week, including weekends. It's kinda tough at the start, but after that when you get used to it and get better, it just becomes a way of life.

Specialize, specialize, specialize..and you'll get better at one particular subject you can teach (fyi, the subject I taught had nothing to do with my major and job). My take is, do more when you're young and full of energy. It will pay off.

I secretly get a kick out of earning an extra $75 on a weeknight and $135 on a Sat morning, knowing my friends are still in bed. Helps that am a morning person.

I'm only holding a normal paying job, and am not especially frugal. But I have easily accumulated >100k (minus cpf) in about 3 years. I encourage everyone to do the same.

I'm an average barely-made-it-to-honours Arts student. However, I have secondary school friends who are getting first class honours, doing their masters, getting into med school, graduating from med school, and getting scholarships for PhD. We're 23. I know you should never compare yourself to others, i am sincerely trying to. But its freaking hard when their success stories are all over the freaking news and facebook. 

In a way i am happy for them (haha maybe not. Who am i kidding) because i know they worked hard for it. Still sucks though. And it really does not help that my mom have been comparing me to them since secondary school. Not knowing what im doing with my life also doesnt help at all.

I always feel inferior as compared to officers and sgts in army. Cos as a Man, you are classified as a person with little or no leadership capabilities. That's why you are Man. And in the process of planning and executing assignments, we usually have no role in them and just listen to instructions. So I tried to be as useful as possible in my unit to show that at least as a Man, I feel proud of what I do. But somehow, I still feel empty. I feel small in front of the officers. Even after ord when I talk to them, I will still address them by Sir or sgt and be polite. That strata of Man and leaders has sticked to me ever since. 

And I don't dare to try out leadership positions now since I'm labelled as Man. Even when I have an idea on how to solve a problem, be it at work or in sch, I will always question the plausibility even before speaking up. And most of the time, I don't speak up. 

So is it true that leadership skills are innate? Or it can be nurtured. Cos I feel indignant abt this stratifying in army. I know I can be a leader, but a few small errors and immature thinking in bmt made me a Man in army.

Singaporeans look down on Singaporean universities. That's a tragic fact. Going into the working world, companies put students graduating from LSE, UCL, Texas A&M, Michigan on a pedestal while treating your NUS/SMU  graduate like the typical run of the mill worker. 

I mean these are good universities but they aren't top tier like Harvard or Cambridge; in fact NUS even ranks higher on the global scale than most of them. Yet we have most of our Singaporean managers thinking that graduates from these schools are far superior and should be entrusted with more important roles than our local graduates. 

I've even been to UCL for summer school and to be honest, the level of their education doesn't match what NUS offers. Students are bright but they aren't subjected to the academic rigour that NUS offers. In fact I've many a colleague from a supposedly superior western university who constantly asks for my help with regards to excel work and all.

Its really tragic to see how Singaporeans as a whole look down on the products of our own education system; which makes me wonder if we are all still too beset by the vestiges of our colonial legacy to be truly free from the western superiority complex

Soon-to-be Year 3 student here. You know those ten minutes or so before any exam officially starts right? The person at the mic would tell us not to start writing yet - does he/she mean not to write even our matric numbers, or just not to start on the answers themselves?

I've always been writing my matric number before the official start of exams, despite the instruction not to write having been made. Scared forget to write if I leave it till the end of the paper. And judging from the mad rush to flip the front cover page right as the "start" announcement is made, I'm quite sure nobody *immediately* writes their matric number only after the official start time, right?

Need some advice! Do most people write their matric numbers only towards the end/middle of the paper, or do we all do so before the paper's official start? This may seem trivial, I know, but if I have been ignorant all this time and I ever do get into trouble for it, it won't be trivial anymore lol. Thanks in advance!

Reply to  :

It is observed that CAP is still an ambiguous methodology in judging human abilities / skills / performance. Let us examine the epistemological grounding of the CAP methodology to see if it helps us to understand where did CAP come from and what CAP is.

Genealogy of CAP methodology:
The origins of CAP methodology is not from the university administrations. It has deeper roots. The essence of CAP is not about figuring out each of the student's subjective performance BUT to measure objectivity. When the Positivists started their naive realism movement in the 19th Century, one of the way to obtain "objective" knowledge is through measurement. Social Darwinist picked up the idea and tried to apply it to the Social World. It is continued to be practiced in our society.

Some universities grade their students using one final exam at the end of their candidature period. NUS students are graded by semesters. More "objective" measurement can be made if the students are graded by many professors through out the 3 to 6 years period.

Phenomena of CAP:

I'm a little confused about all the results-related posts here. Are y'all looking for reasons to not study? Validation or sympathy for achievements or failures? Even if they did not matter, wouldn't you want to do the very best you could for yourself? I mean, you're already paying a few thousand a semester for an education, you may as well make the best of it, no matter who looks at it or who throws it aside in the working environment. If you've tried your best and the bell curve God has seen fit to put you on the wrong end of the curve, what's there to say? You'll have to find other ways to get an edge over the better worshippers of the bell curve God. You wanna beef up your portfolio? There's many opportunities to do that during your holidays, rather than lollygagging around the house. Go take some skill courses from WDA. You can even do it on ah gong's money. Go take an internship in a related field. If you're desperate enough, you could even offer to do it for free. After all, the experience is what matters for private companies. Leave the people who are good at worshipping the BCG to the civil service. There's better ways to live than with everyone fighting for the same slice of the pie.

I'm about to graduate soon (with a degree from soc) and I am starting to see that the more I work with IT stuff, the more I hate it. Recently I have been exploring other topics of interest and something that really caught my eye was behavioural economics. I read Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational and it was such an awesome read! 

I love looking at stock markets and just wonder in general how people would react to certain situations. I've taken quite an interest in the recent Euro crisis and have always been wondering how the global markets would be affected by this. Unfortunately I dont have have much of an Econs background (I did take A level H2 Econs and even got an A for it)

But i'm wondering, should I change my degree based on what i've read on 'pop' behavioural econs? Probably too much of a drastic decision but i've heard that Econs in NUS tends to be very math focused. Is this true? I am pretty bad in math theory (proving) but i can do decent calculus calculations. Just want to hear some thoughts from the folks majoring in econs here!

Anyone can help? I'm just an incoming freshie who wants to narrow down my cca choices.

Life in NUS Business (as a reply to  ):

Before I begin, I need you to ask yourself one serious question: Why is NUS Business your dream school? Is it because you think you are gonna graduate from here with a fat paycheck in your starting job? Or is it because NUS Business seems to be the most "glamorous" of the faculties out there. Because really, depending on your answer, the choices you should make in NUS Business would be really different:

Choice 1 (aka the high-flyer): You wanna graduate with a high-salaried finance/consulting job? Then don't bother wasting times with other stuff. When you are in year 1, you will realise that a lot of your friends get involved in bizad club activities (which is the de facto student council of NUS biz of sorts); but don't be mistaken - for unlike your JC/high school days, being part of "council" is no longer something that is valued by your prospective employer. So instead of spending your free-time planning out activities for the school or prospective freshmen like yourself, use it more wisely instead: by attending networking sessions, business seminars and all of that. Sure, you won't get to have fun running amok and throwing paint/balls/whatever at your friends, but I promise you the intellectual stimulation, the connections you make and the opportunities you get from these things are equally satisfying; and more importantly, useful for a future career. And while your friends are busy joining camps in their first winter/summer break, you should busy yourself with internships instead. Internships are the staple of any high-flyer wannabe, because beyond your grades, the next thing (and sometimes even the first thing) that employers look at is your work experience. Be sure to visit your career counsellor often, buy him/her drinks, chat with them over e-mail - because these people are the ones who will help you get that coveted internship at a big bank/MNC. As for your grades; you will definitely need to study hard, but because biz school has a significant number of modules that demand project work, being able to choose project mates are important as well. This is where you start your social exploration: before you enter a class, be sure to check your class roster first. Look up these names on Facebook/LinkedIn, and be the first to approach those from Raffles/Hwa Chong in your first lesson when groups are formed. Not to say that students from other schools won't be good, but there is a higher likelihood that those from these top schools are better seeing that they have been exposed to project work since their high school days and generally have higher IQs. 

Choice 2 (the cool kid): Well, if you are looking to be the baller or stud on campus, the first thing you should look at is joining a hall; and none stands out more than Kent Ridge Hall; business' schools de-facto hall of residence. Kent Ridge Hall scans their applicants rigorously, which is why they have the largest proportion of hot chicks and sporty hunks. Hence, you better up your game: get a good looking profile picture on your social media platforms, be extroverted during their exposure camp and generally just be crazily enthusiastic about doing the most retarded things they ask of you; because KR only admits the craziest, fun-seeking freshmen every year. Once you are in KR, parties with hot chicks and banging a couple of them throughout the year becomes an easy game; people here are generally more open-minded and seek thrills as much as you do. Next, do look out for the modelesque kids in school; because business school is rife with them. These people get special invites to exclusive high society events, glamorous photo shoots and the lot; so start rubbing shoulders with them on day one (that means joining all those camps by the way.) Dress well when you come to school daily; and that means no slippers and berms even on days where you have no seminars. The bare minimum you should allow yourself to get by with is at least covered shoes and jeans. But if you can, don't be afraid to pursue the latest fashion trends, because they are often headhunters looking out for well-groomed, good looking people on campus to join modeling agencies/events etc. 

So there you go, hope this short write up helped. By the way these two paths aren't mutually exclusive, you can actually do both. But you would need an Einsteinian IQ matched with the looks of Brad Pitt; and if you are that lucky, what are you even doing in NUS anyway!

I just realized that i might have made a big mistake by taking the science and tech scholarship, which bonds me for 6 years. What if i want to go for higher studies later? I will have to take loans to deposit the surety. I have two years to go, and there's still time to break it. Any thoughts/advice?

Am currently in NS and will be matriculating in NUS Business.  The course has been my 'dream course' since young and needless to say, I was elated when I realised that my grades would allow me to qualify for the course. However, I've met many ppl who kept telling me that NUS business sucks and that NTU business school is the best local biz sch or SMU biz is better etc. I'm really worried that I made the wrong choice.. any NUS biz student mind sharing your reasons for choosing NUS biz over the other 2? Any regrets after matriculating? How is NUS like as a school? Is it really more vibrant etc? Just wanna make sure I don't regret my decision Arigatoo gozaimasu~

I am a 3rd year student moving on to my 4th year of studies next semester. Today I learnt that for this year's Sports Awards 2015, they have removed the Honorary Award category. This award category was applicable to students who have been actively involved in their Varsity Sports Teams for 3 Academic Years.

Now, of course, I as well as many others do fall into this category. Sure, I wasn't the fastest runner or the best catcher, and I do admit that I am not the Star Player of the team. But it doesn't mean I didn't try. I trained my guts out, constantly bettering myself and never slacking off in training, in the hopes that one day I would be the one to make the critical move that wins the team a medal. But it was not to be.

Removing the Honorary Award this year has much further consequences than you might think. It is telling us athletes that dedication to the sport is not recognised, that all the school want are medals. Every other Individual Award category demands that the nominated athlete brought glory and honour to the school, or was instrumental to the team's performance in order to actually be selected for the Award. What happens now when the entire team contributed to the winning of medals, but we only get to nominate one player to receive any individual award? What about the rest of us who might not have performed just as well, but nevertheless dedicated their university life to living and breathing the sport?

I put in hard work and gave up many opportunities in exchange for my sport, but yet you are telling me now that I am to win medals or fade from view. Dedication and hard work counts for naught as far as the University is concerned. So why bother telling us that NUS is more than just a medal mill, when all the University recognises is exactly that, Mr L (edited by admin)? Is the money spent ordering each Honorary Award really not worth our efforts for the team?

2. Why do you want to join the NUSWhispers moderator team?
3. How often can you carry out moderator duties (rough estimate)?
4. Any suggestions for improvements and feedback for NUSWhispers?

We regret to inform that only selected applicants will be contacted. Thank you for your continued support!
Hello , I think it's great that you want to change your life for the better. I, too, am constantly reflecting and thinking of ways that I can do this. At times, people do talk to themselves and wonder about the "what if"s and "things that could have gone better" - but this is possible because of the benefit of hindsight. In reality, we can't change what has already been done, so don't berate yourself for that. 

I'm also a Biz student, perhaps I can offer some tips on that front: you still have a month or so to go, how about applying for a temporary job that is related to your specialization? Alternatively, if you're able to juggle it, how about a part-time internship when the semester starts? This would possibly be looked upon favourably by hiring managers/HR. For FSP, do approach JD in the Biz office as he is really kind and helpful. Just explain your situation to him (please do this ASAP since you only have two semesters left! you can actually start on your project in summer if you find your team mates earlier). I'm not popular either (I know how it can get in Biz...) but I found a wonderful group. 

Jiayou :)

 What society do we live in now for you to have such an impression? Hahas.. But if you think about it, how can you be the only one. So many people out there, though I would think the minority, are putting up with less material assets and hardship of various forms just to achieve such goals as you've described. Some dedicate their whole lives just to do so.

With regards to you only having yourself, read up more on the many different relevant NGOs etc or how potential careers you might plausibly end up in can contribute towards your end in mind. It is important to keep in mind too, that you may only be a cog in the wheel. Learn to see things with different and broader perspectives. (E.g. An educator coaches and guides the next generation not just in the ascribed syllabus; an academic builds on the past works of others and whose works will lay the foundation for future research etc.) Of course, they all vary in impact, but they are out there, if you are just willing and hopefully given the "opportunities." I would also think it best if you take into account your talents at the moment together with your passion, since we are limited by time to master skills we are less proficient in.

If you are just talking about friends and acquaintances in general, then share some care and concern? Ask them out? Provide a listening ear? Just providing a listening ear would already help quite a bit I guess. But then again, if they don't wish to hang out/open up, there is only so much you can do. Its a two way thing.

Remember to take care of yourself while you are busy taking care of others. :)

I've just completed Y1 and noticed that many seniors who just finished Y2 have already sourced for internships for the summer. I've heard the rationale for getting an internship after Y2 is to secure a good one after Y3 and then a good job after graduation.

My grades are decent as I work hard during the the academic term, and prefer to engage in leisure during the holidays where I find it more OTOT and more freedom to venture outside uni. I guess most people prefer it the opposite way.

I've been involved in some NUS activities this summer, but with enough free time for me to pick up new sports and meet new people outside NUS, caught up with many old friends, reflected on my NUS journey thus far. I find it to be a good breather after a tiring academic year, to mentally refresh and prepare myself for the next.

I wonder if in this competitive environment, my holidays will have to be spent further tiring myself out instead of enjoying and making good use of the last few long holidays I might ever have :( 

I am adequately stable financially at least to get me through uni with both tuition and passive income, so money is not much of an issue now. How much worse does not having a scholarship, AND a resume with less internships, fare compared to my other counterparts? Is it worth the sacrifice?

-
 
I'm facing a serious problem in my internship. I realise i spend a disproportionate amount of time in the toilet pooping or trying to poop. I suspect it must be the free nespressos that the company provides, or the free coconut juice in the company kitchen. I read that those drinks are natural laxatives. However, as an intern, I don't feel I'm in a position to tell the office manager to change the company's food restock just for me. Also, please don't tell me to stop drinking those drinks - it's free and it is an income equalizing force. Some fat cat VC is indirectly paying for it.
-
 
Every time people find out I'm a uni scholar they think that my life is like smooth sailing and perfect. Little do they know I just want to cry right there and then. 

I suffer from anxiety and depression issues and I don't come from a well of family. Doesn't help that my parents are divorced too and that my father is ... unreliable to be politically correct. Even after getting straight A's and a fairly good CCA record I just barely got the 5th tier of an NUS scholarship while who knows countless others got better ones which cover hostel and laptop fees. I got accepted into a programme which requires me to stay in a RC for at least 2 years but I don't want to add any additional financial burden to my mom so I'm currently working and busy applying for additional grants/bursaries. 

Its not fair, those who work their asses off and get similar results with those who were well off to do and afford tuition and stuff. The former usually getting lower tier benefits than the later. What's the point of being smart and talented in so many areas when those who have the resources are in a better position to get what they want? Even within uni scholars there's discrimination/segregation.

I am an Applied Maths major going year 2. Having a major that is quite uncommon, every time a friend asks what my major is,he/she always follows with this question: "So what do you do after you graduate?"

I really hate this type of question.

Because honestly, I have zero idea myself.

Usually I'll just tell them that applied maths major can go to finance/banking , or business analytics. But honestly those are just the answers that I found from google. very vague and not satisfying. I have absolutely no idea what kind of jobs I can do with this degree.

So anyway, the point of this confession is, to ask my fellow Applied Maths majors. What kind of jobs can we actually do after we graduate, other than being a teacher? Some explanations would be really helpful. Thanksss ><

I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying. I met some business people who did not start learning programming because they say they are not programmer-type. On the other hand, I also met programmers who just want to do coding because they say they are not the business-type.

I am currently doing my internship at a small company. From what I heard from a colleague who just left the company, he said this company pays a very low salary (Vague, but understandable), which was also the reason why he left the company. 

Any suggestions on how can I raise the issue of salary? Since this is arguably the most sensitive topic to discuss about with other employees. Personally, I must know how much it is so that I can consider working here once I graduate. At this point, I don't even feel like putting in the minimal effort to complete the tasks assigned.

Also, what is a good starting pay one should expect?

Found this extremely insightful post (as shown below) when I looked for module reviews online. This post somehow gave me deep reflections on my learning altitude, passion, and goals in life. The author mentioned about the huge differences of the learning atmosphere between MIT and NUS. What do you think is the root cause that leads to the lack of passion/curiosity/hungry for knowledge among NUS students? What is more saddening is when you see some teaching staffs have just-teach-for-students-to-score mentality. One also advised that students are safe to forget the content from his module in his module feedback. 

One may argue that we should not compare these two institutions as the cultures and education systems are significantly different from each other. Nevertheless, why not we reflect and learn from others if something is good, right? 

Lastly, why can't NUS students talk about how to develop your passion, enjoy/enchance your learning experience in school, and make a difference in this world instead of talking about how to score, which is the easiest module to score or which modules should I S/U this semester?

"Do what you're passionate about, be passionate about what you do. And if you love your job, you don't have to work a single day of your life"

From,
An engineering student who strongly against study-to-score mentality and accelerated programs

https://routinepercussivemaintenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/intuition/

This academic year’s e-learning week has just ended, and I want to spend a bit of time talking about something I experienced in the process. For PC2232, the e-learning workload was surprisingly light: all we were expected to do was watch 2 MIT OpenCourseWare lectures pertaining to our syllabus (if you’re interested, it’s lectures 12 and 13 of this introductory quantum physics course). Now first of all, here’s a fun fact about my studying habits: I absolutely abhor webcasts; if a lecture webcast is 2 hours or longer, I invariably fall asleep halfway through. Given a choice between watching a webcast and reading a set of self-contained, wall-of-text-style notes, I will gladly choose the latter every time. And yet, as I watched the 2 MIT lectures totalling 3 hours all the way until 2am of a school day, I felt myself completely awake and engaged in the lecture. The difference in atmosphere between NUS and MIT was so stark for me that an on-site NUS lecture during daylight hours could not compare to an MIT webcast in the middle of the night.

For the brief 3 hours in which I mentally inserted myself into that virtual lecture theater, for the first time in a very long time, I felt myself surrounded by people who were actually curious about what was being taught to them. People were asking why the equation had that variable in that place and what were the physical implications of such a structure, even though they only needed to know how to crunch the numbers to pass the course. They were stopping the lecturer to ask about tangentially related topics they were interested in or even the optional tutorial problems that they absolutely did not need to do at all. Back in Singapore, lecturers would have a hard time coaxing a response out of a Singaporean cricket. The MIT students were positing predictions to the professor, based on what had been taught thus far and based on their own innate mathematical and physical intuition.

“Intuition”. That’s a phrase that the MIT lecturer used fairly often. “Play around with the simulation software; it will help you to build up your intuition.” I feel that intuition is something that is sorely lacking in the Singaporean education system, particularly in the science and engineering fields. Right from primary school, we’ve been taught that being able to calculate “1 + 1 = 2″ makes us good at math, with the same flawed logic that posits that being able to spell “literary analysis” makes us capable of doing just that, when really much of higher-level math has to do with understanding how variables and operators fit together in an equation, and how changing any one thing could change the behaviour of the equation completely. And in the context of engineering, equations always translate to real-world phenomena. So many people are stuck crunching out dv/di over and over again, when they could take a step back and realise that they might be trying to find the perfect resistor to solder into their very own Iron Man suit without even realising it (which is incidentally why I decided to go into electrical engineering in the first place). People need to look beyond the microscopic task of performing tedious calculations over and over again, and recognise the macroscopic changes with every tweak of a variable here or there. A student without mathematical intuition appreciates equations just as much as a calculator would, and solves them much less efficiently.

As stupid and backwards and illogical as it may seem, it seems like there’s a stigma against learning in the Singaporean education system. “Learning”, at least in the “score enough marks to pass” sense, is something to be disdained, something that you have no choice but to hunker down and get over with if you want to get your degree. “Studying” has become conflated with “mugging”, the mere exam-savvy rote memorisation of facts and question templates, and as far removed from learning as remembering where you kept your Rubik’s Cube is to actually solving it (something which incidentally can be done via rote memory, which I guess is kind of ironic). The joy of learning, which is something that I truly believe can be attained by any student or even anybody at any stage of life, is referenced either sarcastically or with wistful nostalgia, like it’s some relic of the past which we could not hope to ever regain. Even people who are actually academically successful are seen to fall into one of two camps: either they had to devote half their lives mugging, in which case all the time spent studying was the hefty price they paid, or they’re so naturally gifted that they got to where they are with minimal effort, in which case they’re just blessed enough to get a free lunch without investing anything. In both cases, studying is seen as a burden, a cost that was either painfully paid or luckily avoided, almost like throwing money into a paper shredder labelled “learnin’ box”. People don’t seem to want to consider a third possibility, that for some people learning is the journey, the endeavour in itself, and good grades are simply the most logically probable outcome of such a life. But come on, someone who enjoys learning? That’s just silly.

If ever you want to build up your intuition, don’t let anyone else say that it’s a waste of time.

I'm an incoming freshman and semsesters are going to start. That also means all the freshman projects are currently happening now. I missed my faculty social camp and am comtemplating whether to join the other events. Not the most enthu kind of person, neither the most extroverted so taking a step to go for these events is a challenge for me. But I do not want to spend my uni days alone or with very little friends. Was told by my other friends that Oweek is sufficient to make enough friends for your uni days. Is it true? Should I join the other events, is it worth it and why? The commitment level is quite high. Most likely will just attend Oweek only.

I am a year 1 political science student, and my finals results were quite bad, especially for my major's modules. I don't know why how did I manage to do so badly for my finals, given that I scored quite well on the tests/essays on 2 of my pol sci modules. I am beginning to consider if I should switch majors, as my CAP is quite low now, even though I am really passionate about political science. Any advice from political science seniors? Also, any recommendations for easy A scoring modules in FASS?

I'm a mech eng student about to go into year 2. It's clear that there's gonna be a steep learning curve ahead and I'm shit scared. I've unfortunately not got a group of peers that make it conducive to study. The fact that I'm "already" worried makes them think I'm going to get all As next sem. 

Fact is, I left school an extremely strong student and promptly screwed up year one entirely. I want to get back on track, but well, I need a study group. You know, corroborate each other's understanding, work out tutorials together, exam papers,etc.
So, if there's any like-minded people out there that want to get a head start or at least collar during the sem, just comment down below.

So, I recently graduated as a Computing Student; Have a decent job in Singapore now.
But, I want to shoot for the stars; work hard to get a better job or do my Master's from Singapore or elsewhere. And that's where the problem lies!

For undergraduation, I had a decent CAP, but unfortunately, couldn't get to know any of the profs well enough. Obviously, to apply for master's, I need recommendations from profs. So my question to all of you is : Will I be allowed to do volunteering work with any of the profs in NUS along with my full-time job. (I believe I can do it) Do you think the profs will agree to this and in turn give me a recommendation according to the work I have done?

Just a question. Are there any other CCAs that don't require experience for ppl to join. Cos come to think of it, all sports CCAs  recruit ppl to win ifg or inter varsity games, orchestras prefer experienced players for overseas competitions. And only left martial arts and other CCAs like skating or windsurfing that recruit inexperienced ppl.

I really want to learn how to play the cello. And I really want to learn how to play tennis. But somehow newbies are not really welcomed. And recreational courses are only conducted for a period of time.

Hi seniors/folks

I'm going to be a freshie this year and being exposed to the workforce at quite an early age due to financial/interest circumstances, I have pretty much settled down on which career path I want to go down, decisions and actions I have to take. 

If all falls through, this August I will be a student here just like most people on this page. The thing is, I struggle to find a reason to motivate myself that school and chasing that paper degree is going to give me an edge in my adult life.

Sure, going through college, making time for friends and projects and with a bit of luck find people with common interest sounds really fun. 

But on top of that I cannot see any logical reasons to continue my tertiary education and this WORRIES me.

Any graduating seniors faced or find yourself facing these problems right now? Because the last thing I want is to spend the next 4 years dreading school and academic works. Any advice from absolutely anyone is sincerely appreciated.

Thank you.

Seeing all the bright, fresh faces out there, looking for a good job, stable job, great pay, work-life benefits, what-have-you... The working world is and will always be a hostile environ to exist in, let alone excel. If you're not competing with your peers for a job, you're competing with those already in the industry, those with more experience. No matter what "they" say, every employer is motivated solely by profit. 

"Can you bring more benefit to the company than the salary you've 'drained away' from the company's profits?" This is the underlying thought process that all employers go through (barring welfare organizations, and even then this may be uncertain). 

The hard truth is that, at the end of the day, the minimum every individual needs is food and shelter (in the context of the current audience). Fighting for your rice bowl to carry on living to whatever standards you need or want is simply an extension of cavemen fighting over a kill. At the end of the day, everyone is selfish, especially when it comes to survival. 

"I need experience to get a job to get experience?" This paradox has been uttered lately, and with good reason. Yet in the working world, experience will always trump results (public sector jobs are only partially insulated from this I believe). You who want a well-paying job from the get-go? Go take some courses externally first, and differentiate yourselves from your peers. Not in urgent need for a stable 2.x k salary because of parental support? Go join an SME. Granted, you'll work your ass off, get paid peanuts, without benefits, etc. etc. BUT, trust me, the experience gained from having slogged through maybe a year of learning almost every pattern of bovine fecal matter that a business can face, any other interview will seem like a party. What will you bring to the company? Only the experience of having failed so hard in all possible ways until success was the only other method left untested.  Wanna be an entrepreneur? All the best to you, but before that, some networking sessions with the pros out there will help you understand what the industry you're targeting really needs.

The long and short of this, is that you should never expect, or else live to regret. Experience rules all, especially failure, but wield your failures wisely, lest you come across as a baboon waving a stick.

I always feel that rich ppl who get scholarships in sch are like competing with other less well to do students who really need the scholarships. No offense but they have sufficient financial support while others may not have. 

Yes they are clever. And it will eventually reflect on their results. So why not let others have the chance to get the money? Cos if you are clever and attractive to companies, you don't really need a scholarship to prove it right?

I graduated already, and at work, I am constantly waiting for my higher-ups to give me green lights for a project so I can inform my team members. So when people, be it my team members or people from other departments, chase me for any information, what the hell am I supposed to say except "I'm still waiting for the green light" or "I don't have any news yet"? I'm trying my best already to rush the higher-ups, but in Singapore and any industry, compliance is very important. So you know what, please don't rush me, I'm trying my best already. Take a chill pill, for both you and me.

I have a very strong desire to prove to others that I am successful. This is because in the past, people (my classmates and even teachers) had this elitist mentality and i think they kinda looked down on me. My teacher in jc told me that I am a slow learner and it will be highly difficult for me to climb in life (i am serious). This is why I always want to prove to others, especially to those who looked down on me, what I am capable of. But i still have not reached that stage of success yet. Although I am graduating from NUS this semester,  I dont feel satisfied because I am jobless now and I am graduating without honours (despite doing 4 years since i am from Engineering). When i read up about successful stories who dropped out of uni (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs), it makes me feel good bcos not all hope is lost. I wish I can become successful one day too and prove to those elite people that I am equally as good as them.

hi, may i know what is the procedure for overloading beyond the maximum MCs allowed? I know we need to write an email but will they only allow it if we have a very strong reason? I am a DDP student and I would like to go on SEP yet graduate early, hence the decision.

I wonder why there is no deans list for the first 2 semesters. Sigh I got 5 for my CAP for both semesters without S/Uing.

My gf from accounting just ditched me cos I only got a second-lower and only have a job offer from a lowly startup. She got a first class and has accepted an offer to work in one of the Big Four. She says I'm not good enough for her as I failed to enter the tech equivalent of the Big Four, Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft. Like what....

should i apply for LOA for a good internship opportunity on my last semester? need advices please!

I'm year 1 and I can't decide whether to apply for a double degree or not. On one hand, it seems like a physically and mentally exhausting prospect, but on the other hand, it's perfect for someone like me because I don't know what I want to do in the future and the double degree will open up a lot of possibilities. Any advice from people who're doing/have done or dropped out of double degrees? Can people doing double degrees participate in things like SEP, NOC?

I went to the Technical Help Desk at Computing with a problem. You know what was the response by the staff? "Go Google it" -.-

Some observation: The higher your CAP is, the less risk you will take in Life.
Longitudinal studies is required.

 Hey!! Don't think negatively!  Killing yourself solves no problems but rather makes your parents even sadder as they arte the ones who have brought you up. 

For your financial problem, try working during the holidays to earn some cash? And seems like you only have a project left to redo for the entire year - you can work part time too to try to earn abit of living expenses. Some part time job opportunities can be found via NUSSU students' Fund (https://www.facebook.com/nussu.sf?).

You can also apply for financial aid for the next academic year (https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/webroapsbs/jsp/login.jsp) if you have not done so. It's closed already but you can still write in to appeal your situation. If you have some money left in your PSEA account, you may use that to pay for your school fees too! Debts left behind after university ends can be paid off when you start working.

For your project, speak with your professor(s) and coursemates for help with your project and determine what went wrong! And so you can avoid them for the next project and get it right the next time round~ Jiayo!

In all honesty, it's my first time visiting NUSWhispers even though I know the page exists ( Thank you, Facebook!). In the light of the release of exam results, I just want to share something on top of my head, something spontaneous though, but I hope it can help those who are troubled by the grades they received :)

First, my sincere congrats to those who scored well, though the definition of 'well' varies greatly. But to those whose CAP is above 4.5 or even 4.0, you are doing well no matter what others are saying. However, I guess I can relate stronger to those whose CAP is below 4.0. My CAP was 4.0 after my first semester in NUS, after which fluctuated around 3.75. But I digressed.

Checking myISIS for results this morning was as thrilling as it used to be. Of course, it still carries some weight as I need to maintain my scholarship threshold of 3.5 but other than that, I am fine with anything that is not a F (because I will have to retake that mod again and likely to score another F!). The reasons behind the change puzzled me. But as of now, I can say a few things that will probably explain part of the conundrum.

1. I am now genuinely interested in my course and what I am learning and being taught in class. It is not always that way. Throughout my year 1, I have thought of switching my major more than once, averagely once every month. It is horrible when you have to do something you do not like.

2. So why am I still stuck with it you might ask. Probably because I have learned how to like certain parts of that major. My major is very general, which I believe all the majors in NUS are, in the sense that students have to learn and master many aspects of the major if he or she is inspired to be an exemplary student. Certainly I am not capable of such, so I learned to embrace those aspects which I find suitable and within my comfort zone. For example, during year 2, I fell in love with model design using computer software (I like to mess around on my computer) and law (I like the succinct thinking of legal arguments).

3. Believe it or not, I scored 2 B- for model design and law mods hahaha which leads me nicely into my 3rd point. I do not feel really sad when I know the results but more concerned about why I scored 2 B-. Did I get something wrong? My knowledge of the subject has gaps? I just sent two emails to my professors booking 2 consultations to find out why. I believe they will be very willing to help, especially since no one comes for consultations during vacation hahaha.
Truth be told, I scored A- on a mod I barely studied for the whole semester but managed to somehow digest all the notes during revision week. The irony leads me to doubt the method in which I am being examined.

To end off, this note is long and clumsy, but take home this point. Like many have said, CAP quickly becomes irrelevant in our lives. It still does when you need to land your first job but after that, not so much. Find the thing you like to do and try to do it well. Failures are acceptable, as long as not repeated. I wish you all the best in your years ahead in NUS and elsewhere.

Signing off,
Anything Cued

I've always studied in a neighborhood school (188 PSLE score to enter express stream) and then to a lowest tier JC. I got rejected twice in the first and second of NS before finally being able to enter NUS. Growing up in this social circle meant getting good grades was the least of my concern. Even my parents didn't inculcate the importance of straight As, as long as we stayed in school, and me and my siblings never had any form of tuition. I felt extremely nervous that i wouldnt be able to cope in NUS with all the elite JC students and are not just smart but also hardworking, and already conditioned to be able to study for hours even after the school has ended.

Today, i finished my first year with cap of 4.5+.and not just that, i stayed in a hall and have contributed enough to stay on, indicating my activeness in activities outside of studying.I'm proud of myself. Probably my best academic achievement. 
But i know nobody like braggers, so i'm writing this here, because i really am proud of myself. 

I hope this is the turning point away from my 21 years of mediocrity.
-
 
To those who scored extremely well, congratulations. But here's a piece of advice from NOC:
-
 
If only there are like "interest rates" for CAP. Compounding CAP whoop whoop. 
-
 
Freshie here. Even though I have yet to start school, I'm already terrified that I will not cope well and screw up my CAP big time after learning about a lot of uni horror stories (crazy bell curve, workload etc.) from friends and this page, even though I scored decently for my 'A's :/

Hi. I am a Year 1 (going year 2) FASS student. Just wondering what is the general CAP required to go to UK for exchange? (Minus CCA and other considerations) Thanks all!

It's funny how computing students are often stereotyped as being able to fix computers but after I graduated, I applied for several IT support jobs and didn't get any, including those that says "no experience required".

Hi, do you think it's important to join a CCA in uni and get a leadership position? I do not have a leadership position in sec sch and jc, will it jeopardise my chance of getting a scholarship or a job in the future? Or should I just join a CCA and if i don't get a leadership position, at least i tried.

I am a victim of a Ponzi scam and this is my story:

A year ago I was happy with my life, carefree, good CAP, nothing much to worry about. During the summer break my friend introduced me this company to park my extra cash as it pays good interest , I didn't think much about it and i parked around half of my everything I got into it. This money is intended to pay off my student loan after I have graduated. 
To cut things short, after many sessions of “financial knowledge seminar” with the company, I have begun to trust them. I have advised my parents and friends to invest into it, rather than putting it in the bank with such a low interest rate. It turns out to be my worst nightmare, it is just another Ponzi scam in making. 

The only way to get back the money is to scam your friends/relatives into investing into the products, which I refuse to do after realizing it. After the payment from the company stop coming in, my parents knew there is something wrong with the company. I told them not to worry about it, if anything happens I will pay them back whatever money they have invested.

So here I am $120k + 20k in debt, waking up every morning brainstorming how to come up with this amount within the next 4 years. All I hope for is that I will find enough strength to live by every day.

I like to let this story serve as a reminder to everyone . Please be extremely careful with the choices you make, because some choices matter a lot more than others.

After reading all the internship confessions, I'm a bit worried that I'm sitting at home and doing nothing. Just finished year 1, and some of my friends stayed back to do part time jobs/internships. Should I be worried?? Any other suggestions as to what I might do now?

There's this particular UEM mod that I've set my eye on for next sem. There's also this person from my clique (same major as me) who wants to take that same UEM mod next sem. So in all likelihood, if the two of us do take the mod together then we'll probably also be in the same project group for it (from what I've read, each group would have about 3-4 members).

The thing is, this person's been in the same project group as me for half of our core mods during the past semester, and it's safe to say that this person generally doesn't do very much at all, often pushing work (that was pre-assigned) to the other members last-minute. I am quite certain that this will repeat itself if we were to take that same UEM mod next sem.

I don't know what to do. Should I find some way to tactfully avoid being in the same group as this person if we were to both take the mod? Or same group nvm and just try to at least work with the other 1-2 members? Or just take some other UEM? Haaalp!

If you think all dean's listers are hardworking people, you are terribly mistaken.

There are some dean listers who freeload other hardworking people's work in team projects. Then, they spend time revising for exams or other projects that they can't freeload from. In the end, they get the best grade in their enrolled modules, thus making it to the dean's list again.

It sucks to be in this sort of predicament where you get screwed over by the dean's lister thinking that he/she is going to help you get the coveted A when it is in fact, the reverse.

Please do your DUE DILIGENCE when teaming up with a (popular) dean's lister. There is a fine distinction between working hard to get into the dean's list and scoring the well deserved A. Chances are that  he/she has been working hard to get into the dean's list and not the other.

Truth to be told, they have been doing their due diligence during the last semester. Preying to team with those who is a good candidate to freeload from.

Cheers, you're welcome. And A-/A isn't that hard to get if you put in the effort, Just stop being a f**king leader everytime and think you're the best. In a basketball team, there are 5 players and only one of them is a captain. Not 5 captains. For god's sake, there's a reason behind this. If you don't know the REAL reason why, please go take a semester off and reflect. You'll be pleased to know that it is actually common sense.

 If you can afford it, take it slow? It seems to me you need a well-deserved break. But ultimately I guess you ought to make your own decisions and you probably know yourself best. The only thing I think we can help you with is to provide you with information but you already seem well-informed. Hahas... Sorry if the advice isn't very helpful. But the point about making your own decisions is important. All the best :>

 That wouldn't work. Gender ratio in faculties boils down to interest. 

And even in faculties itself, are we going to split them up into the prescribed gender ratio? Cause that doesn't make sense. Take FASS, with a gender ratio of about 1 male to 2.4-2.5 females, where different majors will have different ratio. In Economics, I think the ratio is more 'balanced', but in Psychology, it's more skewed towards the females. For Science, this ratio is about 1 guy to 1.6-1.7 females, but yet for majors like life sciences, we would expect to see more females compared to say, Physics.

It's just simply due to different strengths. Guys MAY (i'm emphasizing this) have a preference for mathematical type modules, this is seen in the greater number of guys in engineering and economics, where there is an emphasis in math (of course, there are females who are interested to).

NUS is a place for education -.- the gender quota is gonna prevent people from doing what they like and worse, force them to do something they don't like. The take up rate might be bad; a 40% intake for girls in engineering might not be filled up.

I study X major, what can do I do after graduate? What you can do is to find your place after you graduate with whatever major you have. If you are an engineering graduate, your place is in the back-end. Whatever shit that people at the sales end get will eventually be rolled to you. And yes, they will earn higher commissions than you. Shit goes down, money goes up.

Let's face reality: some majors are worth more than others. Yes, one or two will definitely become the exception and make it big for reasons like entrepreneurship and stuff like that, but that's why they're the exception. If everyone from an X major make it big, then all the resource channeled into training such graduates for the industry is wasted. The thing is, ONLY that one or two is supposed to make it big so that everyone else can benefit.

If you want to make it big, let go of everything your degree teaches you, and start to learn how to identify opportunities and level up your resourcefulness. Because university education in the industry is merely a safety net, it teaches you to work for someone else in case you can't make others work for you.

 C'mon, isn't your CAP the thing that can help you shortlisted for an interview? If you do not reach the interview stage, you practically have no chance to showcase your experience.

I personally believe if you are focused enough, you would have no problem overcoming the challenge to strive for a sufficiently good CAP. To me, saying CAP is not important is merely an excuse for people to be lazy.

And pls stop mentioning the "I have friends with lower honours who secure better jobs than people with first class honours" cliche, everyone has this type of friend. It's your life, not your friends' life. Don't try to assume you can follow your friend's footstep. If YOU have a lower honour, can YOU secure better jobs?

 Literally every aspect of your friend you described is personal bias. Why not enter the art pieces in some competitions? Win some awards and get on exhibitions? That would be your art equivalent of having CCAs. No personal bias? Ha ha ha, seriously, who gives a damn about the view of a few kids? If he is that good, he would be having his art on exhibitions, won some awards and have glorious recommendation letters.

Its nonsense to expect deans to entertain every tom's harry dick (pun intended). Like you mentioned, they have MILLIONS (okay they actually have thousands) of applicants. Who is to say one deserves something over another? (Spoiler: Not you or me) That is exactly why we need standardised tests and for those who have, pardon my language, lopsided talents, NUS does have discretionary admissions WHICH GO THROUGH THE SAME GOD DAMN SYSTEM! 

Of course, you may say that art is some lofty thing that has more than intrinsic value. In which case, please set up your own private academy. This is a national university and all students must be treated fairly. Think of the athletes who enter through discretionary admissions, they too had to win awards through competitions.

You talk about fighting for opportunities. WHY NOT FIGHT AND STUDY FOR A LEVELS THEN??? Seriously, its not that academics are everything, but why if you really want to, why not try harder there? And like I said, submit your art for competitions. And of all fields, the most artistic fields CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR PORTFOLIO THAN YOUR DEGREE! Of course, all else equal, the degree will matter but rarely are things equal in all manners but 1.

OP, I hope you learn. Or you will be wrecked (read: rekt) in the bell curve by the "millions of students the school accepts based on perfect CCA records and grades...[very few of whom] actually evolve to be legends of their field." (By the way, they wouldn't be legends if there were a lot of them.)

I realized that during CS2100 mid-terms it was possible to cheat via impersonation because the invigilators did not check matriculation cards. I was so suspicious of those who attained high marks and full marks when more than half the cohort failed. Damn, I should have cheated too.

I need some help :( is it alright to ask someone who taught you in Sem 1 to write you a letter of recommendation? (In case, er, they've forgotten me) And normally, how long does it take?

I'm a Science freshman and I wanted to ask my tutor from Sem 1 to write a letter for me. All these applications things are leaving me a little lost...

I've been losing a lot of sleep over the last few days because I had to study for PS2237. I've finished almost all of the readings, never missed a lecture, and yet.. I don't know how to attempt the questions. The prof gave us 12 questions to prepare for, and only 3 will be tested (and we'll have to pick 2 to answer). Like what, I have to prepare for 12 questions but I'm only limited to 3 choices? It's even more stressful than having no questions to prepare for at all. The bell-curve is going to be so steep because everyone will be so well-prepared. Except me. 
The thing is, I cannot screw up this paper. I need to maintain my CAP for exchange (it's complicated). I've never been more stressed. I was quite close to REALLY wanting to die (I'm not joking) this morning. The only thing holding me back is that it's not going to be worth it. I hate the fact that 1 mod can make or break your CAP for the semester. And I cannot SU this mod. 
Right now I just cannot take it anymore, so I'm just going to bed. Prolly too late to seek help. By the time this confession is posted, the paper would be over. 

It also sucks that this is not my last paper.

Ok so another Yale-NUS student poster here (maybe by now, completely not welcome)... But I just feel equally hurt by my fellow college-mate(s) that posted statements with attitudes unrepresentative of the college, and NUS commenters that reaffirms my belief that I as a Yale-NUS student is not welcome in the (shared) NUS community. Yale-NUS students are definitely not 'better' like what the poster suggested. Yes, we learn different things, yes, *some* Yale-NUS students are really brilliant. But the same goes for NUS students. We will never learn things that our friends at NUS learn, and there are definitely MANY in NUS that have better grades, or are simply better in other fields which Yale-NUS does not offer. These two colleges (that aren't even 100% distinct) offer different learning paths for people that have different strengths and interests. So where are all these "Better than you"s or "You are not even Yale"s coming from? Many of us here wants to establish a good relationship with NUS, and I also hope that you NUS peeps will understand this as well. I understand if the previous posts have offended you, but please don't think that all of us are such self-absorbed, shallow people that don't learn anything from our curriculum. (We, however, do not learn Heinlein. This one can confirm.)

hey nursing student who posted  ! As a medical student, I really like nursing students (no, i'm not a guy)! Medical students like to say they like to help others etc... But sometimes seeing how some of them treat people around them on a daily basis, you wonder whether that is really true. After all, the degree comes with prestige and a lot of money (for some). However, I feel that most nursing students are in the nursing course truly because they like interacting with patients and helping them through their difficult days. Also, through my interactions with nursing students, I feel that you guys are really friendly and genuine! So don't worry about working around medical students! Just continue being sincere and be confident. Most of us view nursing students as colleagues and equals :) jiayou for your attachment!

Can people stop discussing about the exam papers after the exams? I mean, there is abosolutely nothing you can do to change the answers and there is no use getting all worked up about who's right and who's wrong unless you're going to take the same mod next sem..

(Serious replies only please:) Thank you!)

How can I make up for a relatively low CAP (say ~3.5) when applying for Masters programmes? I'd just like to clarify that the reason for my low cap is because I started my first two years doing modules that I didn't like much - I only realised late in the game what truly interested me academically.  Would love to hear some success stories too.

I'm actually from the social sciences, but please feel free to contribute even if you're from a different field, just so others could benefit.

This university scholars programme really too much. The people there seriously too zai. I got a class where the people from usp take up 90% of the class part. They seriously spoil the bell curve. Why let them take the same mod as us normal people?

Just wondering... Do modules with different module codes have different bell curves?
-
 
Don't know whether is it just me, but I wished someone would tell me that when taking GEM2900 I would be doing more short answer essays than doing calculation and statistics. The only thing I think I took away from the module after taking finals is probably Simpson's paradox. Much wow. So sad.

What is the point of studying so hard for our exams when foreigners with degrees from unaccredited institutions have priority in securing  jobs over locals ? Don't you guys find it disheartening that we have put in so much time , effort and money to attain a degree only to be displaced by foreigners with degrees from degree mills like Southern Pacific Uni?
-
 
Am I the only one who thinks st2131 is actually very easy? Most of it is just common sense tbh...

If you think Level 1000 modules are difficult... 

... wait till you take a Level 5000 final paper where you can't answer a single question in spite of the lecturer giving you 3 hours with free access of internet. 

And I got an A+.

Guys you all need to SHUT THE - UP if you finish your exams early. I was sitting near the door for my paper today and tonnes of people were leaving early. There were so many people discussing the paper and the freaking answers right outside the doors. VERY LOUDLY.

Can you all display some etiquette? First of all the noise is super distracting. Secondly we can hear what you're discussing. Are you trying to give us answers to tip bell curve in our favour? THANKS BUT NO THANKS.

Seriously, if you want to discuss a paper or catchup please bring your "OMG IT WAS SO HARD" to at least 100m away from the exam venues THANKS.

And honestly the invigilators should just go outside and shush the people. Some people have 0 freaking EQ .

Due to a recent change in Facebook's policy, NUSWhispers will be offline for a bit while we sort things out. We'll be back real soon. 

In the meanwhile, study hard for your exams (:

we're really similar, im also a yr 2 FOS student with cap below 3 and not sure which industry to go into in future, so youre not alone :)
As for internships, some companies do not hire based on cap (unless banks and all then is different), but rather based on your interview skills and if they see that you are suitable for the job. I recommend emailing the company HR directly instead of through talentconnect cos ive heard that talentconnect tends to recruit based on results and competition is steeper.. 
Well, since youve considered going into the media industry means you have some interest in it right? You can consider doing internships or trying out jobs around that. Some of them dont require a specific major and if they see that you have the passion and capability, thn why not. It can be a stepping stone to your future career. 
There's still time to figure out what you want to do in the future, find what your interests are and what you are good at and start from there :) A good cap doesnt determine everything.  good luck!

Actually i feel the condominium post might not be a troll. I am not from RGPS or Henry Park Pri or any other pri sch in some posh area surrounded by private estates. I was from an ordinary yet good sch in a rather humble neighbourhood (compared to the aforementioned schools). However, I felt poor because i stayed in a 4-room flat. I felt the financial assistance students are exceptions and just extreme case who are worse off than me. I had classmates who stayed in condo for 2 years while their bungalow/semid (whatever private property it was that they had to get) renovated. My other classmates stayed in landed property as well as 2-3 branded cars while my parents till this day have never owned a car. However, in secondary sch, I joined a school with diverse backgrounds. It was only at this point that I realised how fortunate I am to have supportive parents and good socioeconomical background and all the other stuff i took for granted and that is not the basic norm. So, i would not say that guy/gal is arrogant but rather just someone who has not been exposed to the realities of real life.

$48500?!?! how on earth did you manage to rack up such a huge debt?! that's so scary and un un un unbelievable! my entire 3 years of nus life is only about ten thousand (after financial aid) and after including the costs of notes/textbooks/transport/food, it only amounts to around fifteen thousand dollars? after including the cost of $5000 overseas summer programme, that 20000 is still less than half of your debt?! I so stunned like vegetable!

Hello! I would like to learn German this summer vacation as I missed the registration period for LPP. I have been learning German independently for 8 months and reading skills have reached B1. However I desperately need to improve my speaking and grammar. . It is quite urgent as I need to take a certificate test in August. (My SEP partner Uni requires it.) Does anyone know where I could get German tuition in Singapore this summer vacation? 
If you do please kindly help. Thank y'all very much!

I will be graduating in two months or so along with the rest of Class of 2015. While everyone were busy planning their grad trip or showing off their "career" prospects, I looked at my TFL with a heavy heart... $48,500 at 4.5% interest and I have yet to find a job.

I'm a SoC student, and I get annoyed sometimes when I meet new acquaintances (Like through project groups in cross faculty modules), and they ask questions like: "Oh you're from Computing? You know how to write websites? Can help me write a website like this ... " and so on.
Yes, many of us know how to write websites, and no, we don't write websites for free. Simple websites like blogs, that's fine, that is a couple of pages at most. But if you ask for a proper website like a blogshop or anywhere near that, you're asking for way too much.
A proper website takes weeks, or even months to properly write out, design, and implement. These projects are usually paid hundreds to several thousands to do.
I've friends come up to me asking me to help them with this grand idea of a brand new Facebook-like social website that has this and that, and many cool stuff. Little do they know that that's the idea of theirs is easy to say, and hundreds (usually thousands) of hours to do.
So, before you ask a computing student to help write a website, unless you're willing to pay that friend well, don't.

To be honest, I have no idea why people find CS1010S/E/J/CS1101S/CS2010/CS1020/CS2020 hard at all. CS1101S and CS2020 were the easiest A+ I had so far in all my sems.

I am a recent graduate that kinda missed being a student in NUS.... just went back to campus seeing so many people studying for exams and then I remembered... okay I don't really miss having to deal with that... but I'm still open to doing Masters in NUS in the (hopefully not too distant) future though. Of course, it'll never be the same experience as an undergraduate's.

All the best for exams! And enjoy the experience while it lasts.

Don't care about the pay and health, my dear fellow computer science students. Care about algorithms, design patterns, problem-solving skills, OS, FS, programming languages, not to mention tools like git and etc. 

"Pursue the excellence; success will follow itself". 

One day you will find asking for 4k/month and work-life balance doesn't mean a thing to you, if you could have owned a company worth a billion. Stop thinking about the money, think about CAP and knowledge. Think about how to help the world become a better one.

I have graduated from NUS already, but let me clear the air about Business modules being 'easy'. My background is that I am a double degree student doing business and engineering, so I've done at least 15-20 modules in each faculty. Modules in Business and Engineering are hard in different ways, resulting in varied challenges from different individuals.

Generally, the content of business modules is easier. There are two issues: 1) The high quality of students result in fierce competition. I've gotten a drop in grades (B+ to B) because of careless mistakes. 2) Business modules also spread across components such as class participation which is difficult depending on the lecturer/tutor.

Engineering modules generally have harder content, and that makes the curve slightly more kinder. You can get 'A's scoring 70-80% (versus >95% in Business). That provides that kind of bias that people are claiming now. 

TL;DR - Modules in business and engineering are equally hard in different ways.

I am the OP for  and it was interesting to read the responses, both anonymous and non-anonymous. After talking with some nussu people that I know, I will just consolidate my 8 main points here (warning: may be a bit long):

1) What exactly is the special value proposition for nussu student groups in terms of enriching student life that other student groups cannot achieve? I find it hard to buy the argument that nussu student groups' contributions to student life are special because other non-nussu student groups do it as good, if not better, than nussu student groups.

2) This relates to the point above. If there is no extra value proposition, then why make it mandatory for students to fund them? Why not make it mandatory to fund other student groups as well? What makes nussu student groups so special?

3) Why are we funding sports, community service, cultural activities and political clubs, especially when a substantial portion of students are not involved in their activities? How are they different from other student groups given that they are not tied to any specific faculty? This is worse when non-Singaporean students fund political association but are not deemed members. Taxation without representation, anyone?

4) This is a good point raised by one of the commentators - if the fees from students are not sufficient to fund operations and most of the revenue comes from external sponsorships, then why are mandatory fees still necessary? In essence, will the nussu student groups' ability to run initiatives suddenly collapse if such fees are withdrawn?

5) If there is truly value and relevance in nussu student groups' initiatives, then why impose mandatory fee taxation on students? Is the mandatory taxation of fees on students necessary or a bureaucratic fiat to mask the fear that, once left to students' free choice, the (possible) irrelevance and lack of value of nussu student groups will be exposed?

6) I am not "blasting nussu". Rather, I am trying to ask hard questions of nussu. There is a difference. Don't get overly defensive. Besides, stop asking critics to "step up and make the difference". I don't seek to replace the nussu leadership. I believe in evolution, not revolution. I hope our student 'leaders' can understand that they can effect positive changes themselves instead of waiting for someone to do so through the ballot box. That is true leadership.

7) Don't cite the regulations or laws to justify taxation. The laws on taxation are always the most rapidly changing. Taxation should not be justified by fiat but rather by some other policy purpose.

8) Yes, nussu people are student volunteers and they try their best to do thing, but that does not give them a free pass whenever they fail to deliver or something goes wrong. Sure, they might have good intentions and put in a lot of effort, but if your initiative fails to take off, perhaps it is only right to call a spade a spade (or rather call a failure a failure).

That is all I have to say. Hopefully the nussu student 'leaders' can reflect.

P.S. I am not from SoC, so no need to feel that I am personally attacking Computing Club people, but then again refer to point 6 above.

The stresses of the exam period drove me back to Neopets after a 4 year hiatus. My Meridell Strength Potion investment didn't appreciate as I had expected. Also, now that I have studied finance, I realized the most efficient way to earn neopoints is to collect interest. Unfortunately, I locked up 7 million neopoints in asset speculation. 12.5% APR, compounded daily is insane!

Tmr got HR2002 and the day after that I have EG2401. I cant read for nuts! Thats why I am a bloody engineer. Still make us do this kind of module! I am now calculating my CAP based on getting a C for my HR and B- for EG2401 and probable B+ of my other 3 modules (And SU for my GEM2901 - 6th mod). Ok la not that damaging. Still in the same classification of CAP. Shall just chill then. No point reading only at this point of time. Screw this kind of readings modules la!!

I wonder why the university must restrict electives to general education, breadth, and Singapore Studies. Can't we all just have unrestricted electives to pursue our interests, whatever they may be? And I feel Singapore Studies is a really biased requirement which benefits FASS and the other faculties that emphasize on writing essays and readings.

I'm appalled by how many people here feels that asking for a starting pay of $4,000 with healthy work-life balance in your first job is considered acceptable, and getting anything less than that is considered being "undervalued" by the employer. This reeks of serious self-entitlement. 

You are a fresh graduate, for goodness sake! You have got nothing to prove yourself with..not your grades, not your short internship experiences (hardly any real world impact), and definitely not the projects or leadership experiences you have had in school. Why should anyone, much less a start-up with little resources, give you an insane amount of $4k every month?

The median salary for fresh grad is only $3k to $3.2k (Straits Times). I only asked for a starting pay of $2.8k when I was looking for jobs, and I've had friends (1st class honors from NUS no less) who is having a starting pay of less than $2.5k. We are facing competitions from China and India graduates who are willing to accept even way less than this. You don't deserve to be at the top of you've never climb your way up from the very bottom. This is the reality, face it.

To , ,  join the NUSSU clubs and you will see how they spend money quite wastefully. Urgently need to buy something (because of poor / lack of planning), pay more lor. Orders are not consolidated among clubs (to reap economies of scale by buying cheap in bulk); internal AGMs with food/pizzas (even though it's just another meeting for that club); NUSSU events/dinners that target only erm, those in NUSSU clubs. Suggestion regarding procurement of items: consolidate orders (or perhaps ask around various clubs if anyone wants to "tag" along the order), purchase from GeBIZ e-Catalogue and GeBIZ Mall (government procurement portal); there will be paperwork involved but at least it is value-for-money (VFM as defined by Accountant-General's Department, Ministry of Finance comprises economy, efficiency and effectiveness). Mandate all clubs which receive money from OSA to publish their yearly budget and expenditure statements with detailed breakdown. To overhaul how NUSSU works (with our money) requires a firm stance from even higher levels (more direct oversight by OSA maybe?), otherwise with Fin Secs with one-year terms, how to implement changes? Can't blame the students too, with heavy school workload and issues arising from day-to-day operations, how to find time to overhaul the system?

P.S. What happened to the saga on the transparency of accounts (the questions by Mr Teo Yu Sheng)? Seems like there is no more "updates" since OSA took over the role of "respondent" from NUSSU VP.

I found out that day that I am paying $25.68 a year to NUSSU for compulsory "subscription fees". I went to do a bit of searching to see where the money goes. Looks like it goes towards NUSSU itself, my faculty club and some other clubs I didn't know existed.

Why should we pay these fees? It is not like I get back $25.68 worth of welfare packs (not every one gets one in fact) every year. I am not interested to fund what sports, community service, or cultural activities or political clubs do.

Cmon these student clubs are just taxing us to create "initiatives" that ultimately only their small group of friends enjoy and participate in. Abolish the compulsory subscription fees. Make these clubs earn their income. If their "initiatives" are truly useful, students will fund them voluntarily.

Let the free market work, not big government. Well, at least government funds public goods like defence and healthcare, unlike these student clubs.

I managed to enter NUS with my not so great results (Bs and Cs) and i'm really feeling the pain of competing with students who are naturally super smart (or super hardworking with normal brains). 

I am not smart and i am not the most hardworking person on earth so i often find myself on the verge of "dying", especially during exam period. I want to get a decent CAP but i know that i can never achieve that. After 2 sems in NUS, i find myself being unable to balance 5 modules each sem. Every time i study, i can only at most focus on 2 modules and neglect the other 3. And when i TRY to balance all 5 modules, the results of all my modules are horrible. 

Gradeless first sem that we have is supposed to help us to get used to university life but i feel that i will never get use to this. And i find it pointless learning for the sake of exam. Going for lectures for lectures, trying to cramp stuff, doing papers, try to whack the way through CAs/midterms and finals. I don't feel that i am learning anything..

Anyone feel my pain too? :(

 is the prime example of why I'm not staying in Singapore to work. I'm just your "average graduating student" because I didn't get accepted by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or any of the other big names. Yet, the startups there which did accept me offered me a starting salary which is 3x that of what I'm being offered here in Singapore.

But that's not why I'm choosing to leave. I'm leaving because tech talent is under valued here, as evidenced by .

NUS Business Mythbusters (or rather, the expectations VS reality after one year):

Myth 1: Biz is where the chiobu/hunks are at.
Reality: You get a couple of stunning ones, a pleasant number of decent ones but the rest are average at best. People here are just better dressed rather than being really good looking.

Myth 2: Biz is slack,  all talk only no work.
Reality: Man, nus biz has to be one of the most, if not the single most competitive faculties in NUS. From a sea of hands during class participation to bribing your prof with sushi platters and all the way to having staged questions during presentations; this place makes medicine look easy. Oh did I mention how getting 85/100 is merely the average for your test score?

Myth 3: Biz students are the nicest/friendliest people around
Reality: not unless you consider "friendly" to be someone who politely deflects all your requests to see his A scoring report or tell you that doing the bare minimum is enough while he churns out a presentation more theatrical than a Shakespeare play. People here are superficially nice, they are your friends when you are useful,  but really, you are just another matric number to step on in the bell curve

Some came to university to excel, to pursue their passion, to innovate.

As a senior who have graduated from SoC and worked for a couple of years, CAP is not going to help you get high salary.

Just realised how lucky we math students are, cause hell week is not applicable to us.

Anyway, good luck to all the students rushing their work in Utown :) Look forward to the upcoming holidays!
I think it's high time people learn to respect professors and lecturers. Yes, you may be the one paying school fees, but they are still the teachers, and having your meals, talking among yourselves while the profs are trying to teach are simply rude. University students.
If we can make anonymous confessions, how about let us make anonymous comments too?
I have a crush on this graduating senior but I just don't have the courage to own up. The thing is that he is my TA and I see him once a week. Now that the semester is ending, I may not get to see him anymore. Should I confess to him?

The class participation system is flawed. Allocating such high percentages for it results in trivial 'contributions' since everyone is forced to churn out something to say. I wish my seminar classes were more of an learning experience.
