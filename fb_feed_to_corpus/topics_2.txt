Just wanted to share a story a friend told me. Do read, I promise it is worth your 5mins.
(Like really friend told me, and not a '' I-have-a-friend '' type of told me)
He was watching Chicago Meds, an american tv series so here goes...

Irony:

In the Emergency Room (ER) in Chicago Med hospital, victims flooded in. A shooting was reported at the cinema, in the middle of a screening. Word has it that a man entered the theater holding a gun and started shooting at the crowd. A teacher, armed with a licensed sidearm, eventually gunned him down with 6 bullets to the chest, after the other movie-goers ran from the  Victims poured into the hospital. Abrasion; bruises; as the entire audience was scurrying away from the mass shooter. Among the victims included a mother who hugged her child after they both fell down in the commotion, suffering from the stampede. Their father was separated from them, watching helpless as his wife was stomped, but protecting their child.

The shooting survived his ordeal. Carrying six bullets in his abdomen, he was sent to one of the trauma rooms. The doctors were not thrilled to save his life, and the police even commented: '' I won't sweat myself for this one if I were you. '' Nevertheless, the professional medical doctors did their job and treated the shooter to the best they could. He went into surgery, under the hands of Dr Rhodes.

The teacher arrived at the ER as well, suffering from a mild cut in his forehead from a fall. He was hailed a hero. And as the media caught wind of this, he gained popularity. Twitter trends, facebook post shares, everyone thanked his actions for saving their lives. His twitter followers skyrocketed. He was the hero. Being a normal John Doe in his daily life, he enjoyed his new-found fame, and begun happily reading the online messages. Things got sorted out in the ER. It was then realised that despite the mass shooting, the only victim with gunshot wounds was the shooter himself.

The heroic teacher got brought in for questioning. And police investigation revealed that the mass shooter was in fact a teenage kid named Tom, famous online for his troll and prank videos. At the cinemas, he was carrying a leaf blower and the shooting noises were from the movie itself. Tom has timed his entrance perfectly. Hearing this, the teacher was devastated for taking an innocent life. As news hit the internet, the public and netizens' opinion changed. Tom's followers and fans, learning how a childish action escalated things, started unfollowing him online. The plot thickens.

The mum who acted as a human shield didn't make it. She died after suffering too much blows to her head, but her daughter made it alive. The husband was grieving, until Dr Rhodes came to him and informed him that his wife was the perfect doner for a liver to Tom, whose injuries has crushed his liver. Without the liver transplant, Tom will not make it. Dr Rhodes knew what he was asking the man to do - to save the life of the killer of his wife, with his wife's liver. 

After a few moments of hesitation the man signed it. And the liver transplant proceeded. Meanwhile, the teacher left the hospital, shocked at the online comments and hate directed at him. After the surgery, the husband came to Tom and Tom expressed his thanks. In a shocking turn of events, the husband blasted at Tom, assuring him that the only reason the transplant was done was because death would be too lenient a punishment for Tom. He 'saved' Tom for Tom to live with the guilt, the pain of killing someone over a prank and for online popularity.

Just as the day seemed to end, and the chaos seemed to settle, another patient came in to the ER. A car crash, fatal, collision head-on, leaving the victim covered in blood. He died shortly after arriving in the hospital - he never stood a chance. Eye witness reports placed the victim jumping onto the road, in the middle of a highway. It was suicide. It was the teacher.

At the end of the episode, a day in the story:
The once-hailed hero descended into being a villain and was chided on the internet.
The heroic teacher who was cheered and thanked, entered the hospital alive, only to return for the second time, dead.
Tom, who was in the worst shape upon arrival in the ER, made it alive.
The act of forgiveness turned out to be an action driven by anger, revenge and hatred.
A unpopular teacher gained fame, and a popular online prankster lost his popularity in a day.

Once again, Irony.
This story really left me like.... wow! I can only applaud the author and scriptwriter for coming up with such a nice plot.
A cyclinder can cast both a rectangle and a circle shadow, depending from where the light is beamed from.
Guess I don't really know how to conclude this post. But like all confessions, it's just sharing and ranting.
Guess we shouldn't jump to conclusions huh? i learned a lot from this thought-provoking story. Just wanted to share. Thanks for reading.

Computers will never replace human beings because they are stupid.

According to the Chinese media, customers flocked to the Heweilai Restaurant chain in the southern Chinese city when it introduced robots last year, but the chain has stopped using the machines for a number of reasons. A staff member said the robots couldn't effectively handle soup dishes, often malfunctioned, and had to follow a fixed route that sometimes resulted in clashes. A customer also said the robots were unable to do tasks such as topping up water or placing a dish on the table. Another restaurant in Guangzhou's Baiyun District said robots were used only because of a high turnover of waiters and waitresses. "The robots weren't able to carry soup or other food steady and they would frequently break down. The boss has decided never to use them again," said one employee. The limitations of the technology were clear, says another. They added: "They can't take orders or pour hot water for customers."

As a final year student, I've always thought that the so-called Welfare Committee in my home faculty only appears when the finals are coming as that's the only time I see them giving out the so-called Welfare Packs in that three days. 

This year the so-called Welfare Committee appeared more often than I have expected with milo vans, yakults, cereal bars, bananas and the funny God of Wealth which I happened to see him walking out of CBLC which made me and my friends bursting into laughter. 

On April 1st, I left my lab at around 10PM, en-route to the station, I saw a commotion at the Students' Hub. People were sitting down packing bags and people transporting bags everywhere. All of them were perspiring and some were so tired that they just laid flat on the floor. Only till yesterday when I collected my Welfare Pack, I see the familiar bags and only realized these people were staying back till late to pack the bags for us. 

Thank you Welfare Committee. Your effort, your time and your sacrifice.

I read this part of the poem by Tennyson during near the end of every semester.

"We are not now that strength which in old days

Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;

One equal temper of heroic hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."

How to tell your friends to stop shipping you with this guy? I get that it's fun and they don't mean anything bad, but it's getting ridiculously excessive and just super annoying

I am not so horny that I think of your naked body the moment I lay eyes on you. Instead, I am mesmorised by your naked face.
I am not a jerk who calls you names after you reject me.
I have the intentions to buy flowers and gifts for you in the long run, and not just during the initial dating phase.
I tell you words and praises together with promises not to get into your pants or get you to my bed. I do that to hope to put a ring on your finger some day.

Dear girls, there are still guys like this. yes. Dont forget that just because you met the wrong type of people.

On Thursday I was at an interview and was teamed up with a really cute guy from the same faculty as me. He had the "quiet look" and seemed to have really good manners. I should have talked to him or something but I didn't have time to wear nice makeup or do my hair properly for the interview that morning so I just walked away. :( Regrets, regrets. Anyways, I cannot seem to resist(?) guys in suits and nice cologne. 
Just submitted a lab, suddenly have too much free time, and now his face keeps dancing in my head. *_*

I had lunch at reeds (the cafe at business) today and it was quite packed. So I felt quite happy that there was this empty seat and I quickly put my things down and went to order my food. When I return to my seat, this Uncle was there and he asked me "girl is this your bag?" I nodded my head. He proceeded to lecture me saying "did you not see the serviette on the table? Uncle go toilet only I already chope the table! Move your things away!"

I was incredulous because all there was on the table a single piece of white serviette (the kind that reeds provides) that was folded in half on the side of the table. It looked like a discarded piece of tissue that the previous patron used. But I decided not to kick up a big fuss and let it go. Just needed to rant, it's people like him that makes Singapore such an ugly society.

Overheard at Subway at E4:

Staff: What filling you want?
Girl: Good
Staff: No, what filling you want for your subway?
Girl: I'm good.
Staff: No, not what you feel, what meat you want in your bread?
Girl: Oh Oh, sorry...

I was on the bus just now. There was a frail elderly man on a wheelchair with his maid.  He looked at me, smiled and said in English, "Hello! Boy, you are very handsome!" I found it very amusing, so I laughed and thanked him. I really appreciate the complement and it boosted my ego. His maid who was busy using her phone probably didn't hear what he actually said to me. She most likely thought he was disturbing me, so she apologized to me and said, "Uncle here got dementia."  Oh alright, So I guess I am not that handsome after all...

Today I decided to take D1 and embark on a long route home instead of taking a SBS bus from Com Centre because I wanted some alone time to think about life.

By the slimmest of chances I saw my crush walking.

With her boyfriend.

And I was listening to a radio station from my phone.

And just then, it played: 
"我想哭但是哭不出来，等到思念像海"

Double standard is real! What most girls perceive as creepy suddenly becomes romantic/funny if she has a crush on you. How do I know? Let me tell you how I got my Girlfriend. I was by myself, drinking coffee at my own table and I stared at this girl's boobs. I must have stared too hard cuz she knew about it and came up to me. She is my course mate btw. She basically asked me why was I staring at her tits and I replied with "uhm...I thought my coffee needed more milk?"...and yea we have been dating for 3 years since then.

I see what you did there

To 
i wonder about this sometimes. i often park at a surface parking lot directly next to a bus stop along bukit timah, and if i leave at night, i usually see a bunch of folks waiting for a bus. i know most of the buses on that side go down bukit timah road, which is in the same direction as my travel, so i always thought it might be optimal to offer them a ride, since my vehicle is empty and i am not in a hurry. 

in sg, i have only ever tried offering once, asking a pair of elderly ladies where they were going and if they would like a ride, but was curtly declined-- so i have never asked since. i understand the various prejudices involved, though in this case it was 2v1, i was unarmed and of the same race, but much younger than them. perhaps their generation is a little more suspicious?

i think back to my exchange days, when i hitchhiked home on private cars after being detained at the mexican border: somehow it seems that though things were more foreign, people were more trusting. ever since then, whenever i drive alone from SF->LA or back, i have made it a point to carry any hitchhiker i see that offers me a thumbs up sign. so far i have never regretted it-- i wind up wishing that the ride would be longer, so i could listen to more of their stories!

Do we have like a cooking cca? That teaches us how to cook, bake, make food? Like Lorraine pascale, Jamie Oliver, Martha Stewart cooking style. That would be so interesting and fun.

 omg you should go by utown's bike racks man. 

There's this bike over there that's all spoilt in the gears, and no one's claiming it. If you are can give it a second life, I'm sure it can do very well.

Btw, if you're thinking of repairing it, mind if I help? I want to learn.

I like second hand goods. I don't see why people need the latest, newest and unmarred models all the time. Isn't recycling good for the Earth?

Which comes to my wish. If anyone doesn't want their BICYCLES anymore, could you comment below? I would love to take the the bicycle you no longer want for someone who would love to have it.

Thanks!!

Is the warming effects in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia higher than global average? It seems like the days where the temperature falls below 25 degrees have been a thing in the past and almost everyday will have temperatures going above 34 degrees. I still remember how the days where temperature of 23 degrees in the morning used to be very common during January but not at all this year.

Someone please help

I have a tiny crush on this guy in my hall. A few nights ago, I got supper for him and accidentally left my wallet in his room. When I figured in the afternoon, I wanted to retrieve it before going for class. I went to his room and knocked on his door, and when he didn't answer, I walked in assuming that he was not in. When I walked in, I caught him playing with himself (if you know what I mean) with earpieces on (maybe that is why he did not hear me knocking). I said sorry and immediately left.

That night, in the wee hours, he texted me and said "I hope you are not embarrassed by what you saw" "It wasn't your fault" "I hope you enjoyed the sight haha". I still do like him in a different manner but I really do not know how to go about dealing with the issue and I cannot really tell anyone about it. Advice please

I was studying till late yesterday at YIH, while waiting for someone to pick me up. I told them to meet at the museum bustop. So as i was walking from yih towards the bustop, when i was somewhere near the gantry for the mpsh carpark, a car stopped in the middle of the road on the opposite side (the road frm the roundabout that will lead you to the residence opp the museum). 

The chinese dude in the grey car winded the window down and waved for me to come over. This was about 1130pm, btw. I was alone, yes, but there were stillother students around out running and stuff. 

So i thought maybe he was lost and wanted directions, but it felt a little off. Anyway if he's lost he needs to come to me and ask, not wave for me to come over. 

So i was abt to head off when he did drove over. He stopped nearby me, infront of the carpark gantry there and i thiught he was gonna ask but NOPE. He asked me if i wanna get in and then he opened the door to the passenger seat!

In my head i was wondering is this dude just legit concerned for a lady walking alone at night or smth but and i told him, sorry but im going the otherway (like. What? Obviously not thinking). Then he said smthalong the lines of, its okay we can just be friends.

THAT WAS WHEN IM LIKE, NOPE. 

So i said i have a ride waiting, which is true, i thanked him and walked away. 

Thankfully my friend arrived right then. 

I honestly dont know if he was genuine or not in giving someone a ride but. 

NO ONE GOES AROUND AT ALMOST MIDNIGHT, ASKING A LONE GIRL TO GET IN YOUR CAR, TO BE "FRIENDS". RIGHT?!?! 

Also this should not even matter tbh but just so you know, im a hijabi girl so i think  i was dressed modest enough and was not "asking for it".  

Anyway. Just be careful okay, everyone!

Hi pls don't censor this is actually quite a serious issue: 

Recently I've noticed one A2 bus driver being really reckless and ungracious? He never stops at the zebra crossing (I swear I've almost been run over by him twice outside CLB), cuts dangerously in front of other vehicles, and whenever students do really trivial things e.g. flag down the bus several steps in front of the bus stop or run for the bus he swears using the most colourful language ever (usually involving the student's mothers and the word "jibai" thrown in here and there). 

I'm not too sure if other students have had the same experience, but this driver is relatively pudgy, wears white shoes with red stripes, and looks like (to borrow a line from Deadpool) an ape had sex with an older ape. Any thoughts?

Walked past political soc room and saw this group of ppl drumming and singing some chinese song on the steps. I must say. Yall are impressive. Keep up yhe good work.

You were a bit off key.

Who watched Zootopia here? I was feeling very down and burned out, but the movie cheered me up a lot. Do you remember why you wanted to come to uni and study your course in the first place? I came to science because I wanted to make a difference in the world, I wanted to help contribute to something everyone on earth can benefit from. Seeing the movie helped remind me what my childhood dreams were, and that I'm still on the right track.

Also the main character is very cute. By the way, has anyone else developed an obsession with watching rabbits mate after the movie?

Warning : there is a guy who likes touching and grabbing other girl's body, and running away. it happened today, on a busy D1 bus, around 2:00 PM, at Utown bus stop.

Guys, please take a simple look around to catch someone who is touching on the other's hip. If you see them, you can take a video of them to make him responsible for his rude behaviour, or just simply make it sure when the victim is looking for help.
and for Girls, Anyone will be very embarrassed in that situation, but try not to be embarrassed and help us to prevent making any other victims. I know it is hard to talk about your bad experience, but please at least Remember to ask for help to catch him if your bus had stopped.

Thank you.

P.S. to THAT GUY. I know your face and clothes today. don't be embarrassed if a stranger punches on your face at the dining hall.

My male friend "accidentally" spam-sent me a series of nude pictures of himself. There was a video clip of himself masturbating as well. I'm pretty sure it wasn't by accident because we haven't talked in ages and our chat is way below and it wasn't possible that he sent it to our chat by accident. The thing is I have a bf and he is close friends with this friend of mine. And I masturbated to these images of this friend. Now I cannot bring myself to look at him in school because my eyes automatically go to his crotch.

I wonder if anyone of you noticed, but there's this guy who goes to the study at ERC level 2 Everyday and makes annoying and irritating "clearing throat noises" that are Super loud, in 5 seconds intervals. To that guy: why do you have to make this annoying sound when clearly, everyone who comes to the study really genuinely wants to study in peace? Do you even notice that you're making such loud and disgusting sounds? Can you please be considerate and go somewhere else and study if it has become a habit for you? I really wanted to find you just now but I just didn't want to embarrass you. It was disrupting my studying session badly ok. I Hope admin doesn't filter this cause I'm desperate to stop this, and also helping the rest of the nus community.

One of the darkest and funniest line I've ever heard: "you are not going to be a great power when you run out of supplies of 19-year-olds who think they are bulletproof, let's face it".

BTW, thats your lot in the Infantry. The most numerous arm in any Army, and they one that takes the most casualties, when the bullets start flying.

Be in Artillery. First, bullets rarely reach you (except counter-battery fire). Second, you rarely have to look at the results at the other end, less likely to mentally scar you.

A shoutout to eastsiders- do you all ever get the vibe that Sengkang/Punggol has the Japan feeling while Pasir Ris has the Europe feeling?

Once when I was in Y1, I scolded an uncle who works at NUS. He was cleaning the room I was studying in (I was the only one), and he had asked me to leave. As my laptop was some shit-brand at the time and I needed to charge my laptop, I asked him whether he could clean the other room first. He refused and asked me to leave. I remember getting irritated but I can't remember what I said. It was probably something rude because I remember my eyes shooting daggers at him. 

It's something I think about every now and then. I get filled with shame and guilt - I really shouldn't have gotten angry at him, after all, he is merely doing his job. Dear uncle, I know you don't use NUSWhispers but I would sincerely like to apologise to you but I'm such a pussy I can't apologise to your face. 

I learnt my lesson - keep my temper in check.

I know that for many guys, they have this "See boobs and like" mentality but it really annoys me greatly when girls post pictures with captions such as "oh look at my 22 inch waist" but have the focus and 3/4 of the picture is of their boobs or cleavage. Or advertising something when said object only takes up a small portion of your photo and the rest are just your cleavage. Like honestly honey, that is one way to gain likes but really? Have some self respect.

This is already my final semester in nus, and I just discovered today that the zha jiang mian in utown is dam nice. And no.. this is not the main point. What I want to convey is that sometimes when you step out of your comfort zone, by trying new stuff you have not tried before, you might discover some rewarding insights! So I would like all of you to drop all your preconceived notions or "stereotypes" about certain stuff and just try it. You never know until you try!

Shoutout to the beautiful and amazingly strong woman who was at the uTown gym today at around 7pm. I have seen you  twice now and your stretching and workout routine keep astonishing me. Stay strong

I am not sure if she happen to see this but will still write. On Thursday night (24th March) at around 9.40Pm, I happen to meet this girl, majoring in psychology (doing her FYP currently), at one of the lift  just outside CLB. If you happen to see this, I am the engineering guy in the blue NUSSU shirt whom you spoke to in the lift and on the way out to the bus-stop. I did not get your name the other time and thinking of keeping in contact with you. I really wish fate will let us cross each other's path and meet again.

I am a year 3 student in NUS. Anyone who had spoken to me or had seen just my face by first impression thought that i was some secondary school student. They mentioned that i had a baby face. Just last week at an event that i attended with my mom, the person in charge thought my mom was my grandma and the thing is, my mom don't exactly look old as many ppl thought she was 50 plus years old by her looks. Bascially anyone who seen me thought i looked very young.

However, one of these days, i happened to be super lazy and i wore an oversized shirt, oversized shorts and these are too big for me mainly because i accidentally chose a size too large and because these clothes had been washed a number of times (so naturally they will become very loose). To add on to this, i wore a pair of slippers which was quite old. Then i went to the night market to buy my dinner and guess what happened when i stopped at a stall? The person asked "auntie what do you want?" 

So, now my qns is, do you all think its more likely that the person spoke too fast so the wrong words came out or seriously, poor dressing can make a person seems way older? 

If you all are wondering, when i approach the stall i was looking at my wallet to see how much cash i had so there is a chance the stall owner didn't really notice my face.

I really do wish to hear you all's opinion on whether dressing extremely poorly can make a person seems very old. If really dressing poorly had such a drastic consequences, then i shall think twice about my dressing in the future.

Hi sorry if this sounds stupid. Every time i have 10am lecture, by 9:45am when i was still on mrt, it was usually crowded like the peak hour at 7/8am plus. I'm genuinely curious if there are office hours at 10am. If so, what kind of jobs had office hour starting at 10am? If not why would the train still be crowded at 9 plus am?

If anyone's wondering, the train i'm taking is the green line, alight at buona vista to switch to circle line. Not sure if what i said about crowded mrt applies to other train lines at 9 plus am though.

It really irritates me when people "chope" seats for their friends in lectures. If your friend is coming in five minutes then ok fine, but seriously? To have the cheek to reserve seats for your late-comer friends when the lecture is about to start and all the seats are filling up? That's a bit much don't you think? Especially those that chope not just one but A FEW seats in a row. Please be more considerate.

Not a confession per se but I wanna know the answer... Why is the water in the UTown Swimming Pool so green nowadays?

Since you gave me that note, there is not a single minute during which I'm not thinking about you. Those bright eyes and luscious lips, I need to know whom they belong to. All I have is a mental image of you, reading through this big pile of Bloomberg magazine while sensually biting your bottom lip. You have my number, but somehow refrain from using it. I'm sorry if I offended you anyhow, you took me by surprise and I didn't know what to do. I'm not used to the Asian way. I should have known that you wouldn't message me. 

I hope you're just being shy. If that's the case, don't be. All I need is one text from you. I felt the connection when our gazes met. Something wonderful is awaiting us. Let's not miss it.

5 years ago, I was a tourist in Singapore travelling with my family. While we were at Vivocity, my grandmother had a cardiac arrest or a heart attack and we were terrified. At that time we had no idea how to react. Some people tried to help, and a big crowd stood around us and watched as my grandmother seized up. Ma ma passed away that day, despite having people help and mall officers assist with the AED. She did not even make it to the hospital.

It is a painful memory but now I do recognize the shirts that the helping people wore, they are from NUS. The people in NUS may have graduated. But I just want to say thank you for trying to help even when so many people stood around and watched, some even filming it.

Hello! I lost my white tablet (with black cover) today at S17 04-05. Apparently I was charging my tablet and I forgot to take the tablet along. When I realised that I have lost the tablet, the tablet is gone (but the charger is interestingly there).

If any kind soul has/knows where the tablet, please let me know because the tablet contains a substantial amount of confidential work-related data. Thanks!

- fun fact of the day -

The gym at src has reopened for quite a while now . Some newcomers likes to mark their territory ( most of the times it's the bench area ) with the smell of their farts . They will fart when u are doing your final set whereby u need to inhale alot . After that they will continue to walk around u while farting continuously thinking u won't notice .

Why are there so many rude people at NUS? I'm obviously not talking about everyone, but there's always at least 5-6 idiots in EVERY lecture and tutorial who constantly talk the whole way through. If you have no sense of manners or respect for the person trying to educate you, why are you here? Idiots.

To the guy who handed me the nice note in one of the PGP common rooms the other day: you made my night! The next time you see me feel free to say hi; you left quickly, and I'd like to say thank you in person! Sincerely, the girl wearing the green jacket :)

I had a really long day today and tomorrow is an early school day too. So I told myself this afternoon that I should be sleeping early tonight, but it didn't happen cuz my steam acct was online and my friend sent an undeclinable "4缺1" request. Now after several games, I am on my bed regretting it and doubt that I will wake up tomorrow for the morning lecture. And oh wait, didn't the same situation happen last week? The week before? Damn my life is on a replay. The vicious cycle never ends. T.T why do I have so many 损友s? Advice please!

Do you guys ever just get up from your computer to walk aimlessly around your house only to sit back down in front of the computer again?
Do you guys pointlessly open the fridge too every time you enter the kitchen?
Do you guys tend to move around  aimlessly when you're on the phone? 
I feel like somebody is controlling me like a sim from above.

I have a confession to make that I'm not proud of. I'm a very lazy person. I have been using wet tissues to clean my ceramic cups that I drink out of if I poured sweet drinks inside of them instead of washing the cup. I once threw away one ceramic cup just because I was too lazy to wash it.

Hey:) I lost my MacBook Pro 13 inch retina which has a marble design plastic casing (in a grey faux leather laptop case) at a female toilet in utown (the one nearest to foodclique) at around 6-620pm on Thursday 17 March. It was gone when I returned for it at 11+pm:( To the person who picked it up, I would really really appreciate if you could return it to the lost and found ASAP thank you!

S.H.E song taught us this 
再靠近一点点 就让你牵手
再勇敢一点点 我就跟你走
你还等什么 时间已经不多
再下去只好只做朋友
再向前一点点 我就会点头
再冲动一点点 我就不闪躲
不过三个字 别犹豫这么久
只要你说出口 你就能拥有我
Guys, confess before it is too late cos in the end we only regret the chances we didn't take.

Being in uni has made me so thick skin that my pimples are now all gone because they are covered with new skin. Thick skin until keep emailing prof. Thick skin until keep asking questions. Thick skin until I don't even care if I'm a bad guy or not.

Women do not wear make up for men. Let me get this clear. I wear makeup to school half the time. I say this because I do sports as well. On the days I go for CCA I don't wear makeup, obviously. On most other days I will wear makeup. And I feel comfortable in my skin regardless, I just like the feeling of being more put together instead of looking like a panda when I leave home. Even if I left home as a panda it doesn't mean I hide my face in shame, you dress and put on makeup based on your mood, or the activities you are doing throughout the day. 

So what are guys reaction to women that wear makeup and then don't wear makeup? Honestly, its the exact same. The reason is because they like it if you are comfortable. So even if you are dressed to the nines with a full face of makeup and on other days you have dark eye bags and dry lips its not gonna be like suddenly the guys are going to go OH MY TIAN WHO U.  Of course they are gonna ask you why you look so tired.  I'll just shoot them down by saying I slept 12 hours but apparently my eye bags didn't get the note and go into hiding. 

Don't put on makeup just because others are doing it. If its not something YOU wanted to do then don't get pressured to do it. While guys are very visual creatures and the first impression they get are usually looks, statistically a smile makes a greater impression than if you have makeup. So chin up and keep smiling ;)

Not trying to sound evil here but it really just happen. One of this guy in our project group just MIA for all the meet ups and discussion and everyone just forgot that he is in our group. After we submitted our report, we realise that we forgot to add his name and matriculation number. (Of course he wont have notice it and don't even know what is going on in the report). I guess this must have been karma.

Hi, this is more of a shoutout than a confession but... Is anyone in NUS following a HCLF Vegan diet? I'm interested in changing up my diet but I have no clues to what food to be eaten.

ps: No bashing please.

Just watched a horror movie on channel 5. Last week is the first movie. This week is the sequel. Channel 5 has this habit of playing all the sequels to prepare us for the new movie they going to show. Then they will show the Ch5 tv premiere. Man of steel and batman also. Last week is batman movie. This week is man of steel. Preparing us for batman vs superman. But what ch 5 doesn't know is we don't need them to prepare us. Let me make a guess. Soon, or months later. Harry Potter will show all over again. Or the hobbit. Or any movie sequels that are enough for ch 5 to air for weeks. Pls la ch 5.

I mustered my courage and finally went to this pretty girl who I have a crush on for almost a month and talked to her at the bus stop. I dressed in my best and said, "Hi. I am ******* from Biz. I've seen you around quite a few times. What are you studying?" She looked at me aloof. Then two houseflies flocked around my face, as I tried to brush them off. Then they circled around my head. In my mind I was cursing at them, because they made me looked as if I stink. I was thinking why can't it be butterflies instead. Embarassingly, I told her I've already bathed today. Then she giggled and introduced herself and we started chatting until her bus came. Then she gave me her number when I asked for it. Yay! I want to thank the houseflies in NUS for making this happen!

So...my mom was gonna send an email that said "I am afraid we have to reschedule the meeting today."
However, she accidentally pressed the send button before she finish typing the sentence. So, it turns out as:

I've got a unique habit that's been punching at me like a shard of ice flung at you in a blizzard, and I need to get it off my chest. 

When I'm feeling cold and depressed, I like to take out my sigil-patterned balloon, hide in my homemade white styrofoam ball, collecting things scattered nearby like my shoes and bags, and roll in the ball towards my homemade papier mâché statue of Doraemon, thereafter delivering a swift punch to his flabby belly. After that, all is well and I continue down my lane with newfound zest for victory and life in general.

Today as I was getting my lunch from Fishball story in Utown foodclique, I witnessed something rlly amazing! 

As I was waiting to get my food, I saw a little boy (he was really young I think at most 6-7 years old) approaching the Nasi Pandang stall (next to Fishball story) and he was just knocking on the glass at the stall and asking the Aunty for rice, and then he added some veggie and an egg. But the amazing thing was despite the boy not having a single cent on him, the Aunty still went on to give that plate of rice to the boy!! 
Later on, the boy approached the Aunty for water too, but since they didn't sell water, she asked him to get some from the drinks stall. The boy had no money so he just shouted "money money!" and I think the Aunty actually gave him the money to get a drink coz I saw him walking back with blue coral haha.

Just wanted to share something light -hearted & positive amidst all that dreary mugging we're all stuck in now! (: things like this really make me so hopeful and happy (:

 Counselling at UHC is free. And if you decide to book an appt, book it asap as it's actually the peak period for counselling now. Lol. See? Normal. You're not alone. Last sem I was in the same boat as you and finally decided to give it a try, and I had to wait two weeks to get an appt. 

And it won't be awkward, they're trained professionals! And even if you somehow don't feel comfortable with your counsellor during your first appt, you can request to change to another one too. You can also choose when you wanna stop counselling altogether. 

Just go if you see the need to, there's nothing to lose either way. Hang in there

Just want to share about an incident that happened during a recent lecture. We had a lecturer who was a very old lady and was visibly sick. She told us she came for the lecture (which was her only session with us) because she believed that it was her responsibility to turn up even though she was on leave. Her lecture was very professional and comprehensive although a bit long-winded. She mentioned towards the end that she couldn't finish on time (1.5h) and requested another 15mins. A small group of students instead of showing some appreciations, appear to be rather rude and with a rather unpleasant tone, shouted that they had other electives to rush to. Since we are all young adults, I believe we should have some manners and appreciate the lecturers. Even if you feel the need to leave, just leave quietly. The lecturer was really trying her best to finish on time and not purposely dragging the lecture.

I thought I knew everything about love: all the neuro-chemistry, every impulse in the synapses, and the amount of oxytocin coursing through veins. I was correct, but I was wrong.

I thought I knew everything about our relationship: things to say to make you smile, and I could even predict your every reaction. I was correct, but I was wrong.

I thought I knew everything there is to know about breakups: the volume of tears shed, the amount of salt crystals condensed at the edge of your pillow, and the amount of alcohol I need to wipe mine away. I was correct, but I was wrong.

I thought I knew exactly what your next guy would be like: a really nice guy, someone who easily put a smile on your face which I try so hard to figure out how. He could make you happier than I have ever seen in any of our previous episodes. And I was correct..

5 months ago, I couldn't help but to constantly proving you that I'm right. The momentary taste of satisfaction very much like a child's victory after throwing a tantrum. It is 'childish,' a word which I so eloquently used to describe you hundreds of times. And guess what? I was wrong.

This may be a part of the thousand apologies I owed you, but no, I wish not to return to the place we once were. I seek nothing but closure. What I long is to inadvertently bumping you in the lift again, but this time I could finally muster the courage to just casually say "hi."

to  I was intending to include this in my short dating guide I was gonna write, but due to the busy work, tiredness at the end of the day, and I eternal status of "can not be asked", I have not started writing. But I'll chip in a short bit about clubbing and dancing.

So what's in a club? Most noticable: eardrum bursting music. Seriously, why the fuck does every club have to have music so loud? It's on the fucking pain threshold. Though whatever, I have sit on train and listen to the music the dude sitting next to me blasting through his in-ear earphones. Stop it mate, that's just way to loud. The few times I've been to club, I am eternally thankful to the pair of Sennheiser noise-cancelling in-ear earphones I carry in my pockets. Though I use it as somewhat more stylish earplugs. Oh and you can't hear people for shit.

What else? Overpriced booze? A sausage fest of 4 dudes to 1 girl ratio? Creepy ass motherfuckers who sneaks up to you ang grind away (from the girl's persepctive). Terrible terrible dancing and derp faces?

You know where else has music, dancing, and a much more favourable girl-to-guy ratio? Well, sans the booze? Ballroom dancing classes. For some reasons, in all the ballroom dancing classes I've been to, girls always outnumber guys by at least 2 times. So most guys, if you are somewhat presentable, not having bad breath (since your faces are going to be real close), and don't step on a girl's feet too often, you get to dance with at least 2 girls. Physical, close contacts are a must. It's not less intimate than grinding. If grinding is simulated standding doggy style, than ballroom dancing, if done properly and beautifully, can look like you two are doing it standing from the front.

Another plus, most girls there are single. Why? Because if a girl is attached, another dude would have been dragged along. And you know who the couples are. They dance exclusively with each other only.

What's the advantage of going a ballroom dancing classes? All the above. If you are a akward guy not used to physical touches with girls (and do the hover should hand in pictures), this is a chance to get comfortable (you'll be amazed by the power of physical touches). Some light chit-chat and you can get better at talking, and smooth-talking.

BTW, if you guys reading this and find the next ballroom dancing class you go to (NUS has a Social and Ballroom Dance club) a sausage-fest, well, I'm not sorry.

One question to gym goers:  what is your reaction if you see fat or brawny people in the gym? Do you smirked at them secretly and think that they are weak?

It's interesting. The meatballs at Engin actually goes very well with the off-the-menu chilli sauce from the soup stall (it's a tad bit hot, though). 
The western stall's cream-based pasta actually taste a tad bit better if you actually add a bit of black pepper to it (though they don't really provide it, I had to bring my own).

Isn't it interesting, that there are food combinations and usages lying all around campus, that have not been utilised for a long time, or even discovered yet? It just takes a bit of effort, to make your day a bit more interesting.

Is it considered weird to have never gone to clubs before? I'm 25 and I have never stepped foot in a club. My friends keep on asking me to go but I am seriously not intrested.. I come home from work dead tired and all I wanna do is shower, eat and watch movies. I don't have enough energy to party until the A.M. 

Like is it soooo weird that I don't wanna go at all??

There are videos of people applying sunscreen and how it looks under uv light, to show how applying sunscreen is important to block uv rays. 

But suddenly I got the thought. Aren't the lights in clubs uv lights as well? Does it mean that if people apply sunscreen and go to the club, they'll all appear to have black stuff smeared on their faces? I haven't seen any black faces in the clubs though.

Just a random thought.

Why engine canteen stalls has the notice "Brown rice available" but always not available? (Maybe due to high demand).

It's interesting. Apparently, if you add a bit of cinnamon powder into the Milo you drink, it... Actually tastes quite good. Not sure about school Milo, though. 

Heheh, it's just very nice to experiment with food. It's like, you know the Curry Chicken at the Deck? It actually goes very well with a Baguette (you know, those French Loaves)

The distance from our hometown to Singapore is 2391km. Although it has been nearly a year since you left, the image of you leaving our village is still fresh in my memory, as though it had happened just yesterday. Ever since you left, I would wake up occasionally in the middle of the night and wonder what/how you are doing over there?  

On the day you flew off, I was resisting the urge to hug you tightly and refusing to let you board the plane. But what rights do I have? After all, you are pursuing your dreams and I believe that one day, you will become an outstanding engineer that you aspire to be. In the end, I forced myself to abandon that selfish thought and loosen my grip. Now that you are no longer around I had to admit that it gets lonely at times, there seem to be lesser laughter but everyone is studying hard to get into university. Your juniors see you as a role model. 

All my life, I have been feeling inferior when compared to you. During our school days, you are always swarmed around by the juniors, I would stay outside of that circle to admire you quietly by myself. Whenever you stared over to my direction, I would look away immediately because I don’t have the confidence to look back into your eyes. The thought of you flying higher and higher in life while I’m stuck being that ordinary girl really scares me! Perhaps one day, I can’t reach out to grab you anymore…

It doesn’t really matter, if I get to confess my love or not. Hence I would rather submit this heartfelt confession anonymously, it’s like tossing a message bottle into the ocean and do not expect any reply. I get really jumpy and excited when you update about your life in Singapore, I’m so glad that you are blending in perfectly and made a lot of new friends in university. But who is that girl who always placed her arm over your shoulders!? Well.. It’s not like I’m jealous, I don’t really care anyway. 

I heard that you are not used to the diet over there, however you should stop eating chicken rice every single day. Stop being a picky boy and eat healthily! Remember to exercise regularly and put on your blankets on those cold windy nights. I will pray for your CAP every single night, deep inside my heart I’m secretly cheering and rooting for you =) I will wait patiently until the day you return home. YOU ARE REALLY AMAZING!

Hometown girl
Sign  off !

I really need to get it off my chest. This is too overwhelming for me. I need help. It was too painful, too stressful for me to do it. Yet, I have to do it myself because, if not me, then who. I felt hopeless, completely restless and breathless. This piece of masking tape on my chest hair needs to be removed.

I listen to mainstream pop music occasionally cos I don't really identify with it. On the other hand,  I realised that I am more comfortable when I land on random playlists of Taiwanese soap drama theme songs. I can't understand a word,  yet the moist, tears-like quality of the music speaks to me and enfolds me in a mother's embrace. Are some people like that too,  or do I just have some left-behind childhood issues?

Maybe the ushers at KR mrt for open house can station themselves nearer to the mrt instead of being all at the opposite bus stop. So many jc kids are waiting at the normal bus stop and taking any bus they see (including bus A) to utown! :/ #shuttlebus #nusopenhouse

Why do people always say GG when they are in trouble? GG stands for good game. Saying GG is like telling photocopy machine aunty that you want to glitch the paper when you wanted to duplicate them because in Pokemon Red/Blue, glitching an item refer to using the MissingNo glitch which duplicate the 6th item on the backpack.

I noticed recently, rubbish (drink cups, plastic bags) lying around in the lecture theatres/study benches etc. I know sometimes we honestly forget to cleanup up our rubbish before we leave, while other times it's too inconvenient to find a bin so we just leave the rubbish there. It's not pleasant for the next user to come to a place with trash lying around. Keeping the environment clean is not solely the responsibility of the cleaners. We're sharing a space as a community of NUS students, and we owe it to each other to make an effort to keep our environment clean, don't we? (:

之前的我，觉得你就像钻石一样珍贵 
现在的我，已经知道了，你的一切只是在玩弄我
如果可以的话，我不会想认识你
如果可以的话，我不会爱上你
如果可以的话，我不会为你付出
如果可以的话，我不会相信你的话
如果可以的话，我不会浪费我的真心
如果可以的话，我不会浪费我的泪水
如果可以的话，我不会浪费我的时间

对一个不值得的人心痛、难过
对一个根本就不值得的人思念
这样值得吗？
这样会更好吗？
如果他真的那么好，他还会背叛你吗？

如果可以的话，去看看在你身边等你的人
因为他们很爱你，所以才会等你 (:

For those of you arguing that the TSR is too thick and difficult to follow because of the very duhhh kind of regulations, have you ever thought about why that happens? Why so many seemingly common-sensical notions are codified in TSR and why are they so rigid?

Root cause being that people do all sorts of stupid things and conveniently point fingers feigning ignorance when things go wrong. Since govt and army has to be accountable and to do something, what do you think the poor investigating officer has to say for the report, recommendations and follow up? For example we laugh at the duhhh safety notices for SAF vehicles like carbon monoxide poisoning can occur from running engines, military license must be displayed on dashboard, vehicle commander must help keep lookout, remember to wear seatbelt etc. 

Ever wondered why? Because when an accident occurs, people say oh no one told me i cannot sleep in the passenger seat, no one said i must help the driver keep proper lookout, i didnt know i need to wear seatbelts, i didnt know the driver need license, i never heard of CO in my life.

That's why.

not trying to shoot the lunchbox initiative but instead of promoting the use of reusable lunchboxes, maybe they should try to persuade the expansion of the seating spaces of canteens and educate people to let other people use the tables after they are done eating and not sitting there to chit chat. Because the biggest reason for takeaway is not being able to find seat in the canteen during lunch hours

I like how many of u tries to defend the prof without even considering the students perspective . Unlike most of u  , some of us had to pay rent every month , rush to work after class and have to think twice before ordering a 20$ ramen , so , when we say we use our hard earned money to pay for the tuition fees , it literally means that . Not that I expect people like you all would understand , living in the comfort of your parents house , not having to feel the pain each time u take a cab when you're late for something.   
We expect value for money . The prof is paid to teach, hence it's his job to make sure he deliver the lecture properly , when he doesn't , anyone can have the right to criticise him . 
If you paid for a plate of chicken chop and the chicken is raw and u complain, can I also say " wow you're a dick because u didn't try to empathize what the chef specialty is because that's not the dish that he was born to make " ?

No , not everyone has the luxury like most of u guys here do . But good try on trying to defend something that is wrong kids . Have a cookie.

There is a guest in my lecture. 
It is small and black. 
It runs around looking for food.
It's a cockroach.
It's a problem.

Unless you want to be friend with them, I suggest that everyone do their part and avoid eating in the lecture hall.

L&F (Lost and Found)
Just went for a movie screening in LT9 and saw a dropped ez-link card at the first row of seats from the top. Pic has been attached. Not sure if the owner will see this, but if anyone has a friend recently saying that they lost their ez-link card, ask them if it's a red cny one.

If you're the owner, please contact me at e0003141@u.nus.edu and we'll try to arrange a quick meet up so I can pass it back to you. dk how much is inside it but doesn't really matter.

Cheers~

As a foreigner, armschair general, and military enthusiast, I saw the drama around the deaths of a NS man in training exercise and can't help but think. "You lot are worrying about the wrong thing".

There's a common saying in military that you should train the way you fight. Sweat and blood on the training grounds means less blood on the battlefield. I hear you say "but  it's not safe to throw 3 times the allowed amount of smoke grenades". Wait ... do you want to create a functional fighting force or do you want to run a daycare? When bullets are whizzing about, over open grounds, the smoke grenades are the only thing that reduces your chance of getting hit. In such situation, I would trade one guy suffocating than half of a platoon being wiped out by machinegun fire.

But a more serious question: how effective is the medical service of the Singapore Armed force? If trainees die in exercise from exhaustion and allergic reaction, how do you think the medical personnel would fare dealing with a sucking chest wound or a limb being blown off by explosion? There's a medic at the platoon level already. Why can't they deal with such thing? Isn't that the area you need to improve? Remember that on average, an attacking company (Red Army, WWII) lose about half the men from casualties, about a quarter of them die instantly, the rest wounded only. 70% of the wounded can be returned to service, or at least a less physical demanding task. If the medics can't deal with non-combat injury, what can we expect from them with combat wounds.

General David Patraeus, when he was a Lt. Col was shot in the chest with a 5.56 round at close range. He was promptly given first aid and evacuated, and operated. He was allowed to left the hospital early after doing 50 push-ups without rest a few days after the incident. He lived long enough to become a general, director of the CIA, and to lost the his job after the affair with his biographer was found out and publicised. The Spymaster general was quite clever in hiding his tracks and conceal his affairs. Contacts involving extra-marital affairs were to be done using emails only. But not sent emails. Two people having access to the same email account can leave notes in by means of drafts to each other without the emails ever be intercepted. That is as long as the account is secured.

 Just wanting to add on to what one of the commenters said: First, accepting for someone who they are is not used this way for god's sake. If she couldnt accept this about you, would she still be with you? Rather, you can try seeing it as her trying to help you. There is no harm in a relationship in helping each other improve. Impressions make a great deal on every person and you'll be surprised what changing your dressing does to others' impression of you. Polo tee and jeans to nicer places? Honestly I'd think people would at least wear a cotton button down (doesn't have to be all formal and long sleeves) and non-jeans kind of pants. Dressing presentably doesn't have to involve formal wear. Polo tee and jeans are probably more suitable for malls. And honestly, wearing a polo tee does not equate to dressing better. 

And about your gf, you say she "enjoys dressing up". I don't think any person actually enjoys it. People who dress up are simply people who care about impressions and make the effort to do so. People who do not are simply too lazy to do so. There is no enjoyment factor in this. Also, ask yourself if her presentation was what attracted you in the first place. If she walks into 'nicer places' with you in tshirt and jean shorts, what would you think?

It appears that I got a lot of flak for insinuating that people dying in military exercise is justified; and that life is somehow not precious. And flak for being an armschair general. Well, I'm not an active member of any arms forces but my knowledge of military matters would probably surpass many junior officers. 

Yes, life is precious. But it's never the first priority. Seriously, if it were, we will have no need for a military, because we will never fight a war. Let me shatter the slogan and illusion that "safety is our number one priority". Many workplaces put this as their safety slogan. And it's bullshit. Safety is never the number one priority in any field anywhere. For eg: you are operating multiple tons trains running at very high speed. You are having switch box with hundreds of thousands of volts running through it. An arc formed jn such condition burns hotter than the surface of the sun. You are running exercises with teenagers handling automatic weapons firing totally lethal bullets. And grenades, heavy vehicles, and explosives. Someone will eventually get hurt. Or killed.

If safety is really everyone's number one priority, you will commit yourself to a bunker with titanium walls (and suffocate because the ventilation fucks up). No. The number one priority is to run the trains, make sure the cities have electricity, and the teenage conscripts can fire in the general direction of the enemy and not their face or their own comrades.

Worse is a priority is something that get shift around, shuffled, removed or changed becuae something else is of higher priority at that moment. Corners get cut, and people get killed.

So what it should be? Safety is a value, and it's your own responsibility. As a supervisor, my job is to get the work done, first; you guys get paid, second; then you guys go home intact, third. As a worker, you put the value of your life however you want, and pay the according amount of attention.

This does sound very cold and uncaring. Unfortunately, it's how the world works. The faster you learn that at the end of the day, you are responsible for getting your ass home intact, the more attention you pay to whatever you are doing.

And I still stick to the point that if the medics can't deal with non-combat injury, they sure as hell are not going to be able to deal with combat injury. Dehydration? Basically hypovolemia due to insufficient water intake and excessive sweating. You know what else causes hypovolemia? Bleeding from the brachial artery because the poor lad just took a 50 cal bullet to the arms. Or the femoral artery because he steped on a mine (some have very cynical name like toe-blooper). You have about one minute before the poor guy bleed to death (immediate tourniquet and IV infusion). Heat exhaustion? Bound to happen in Singapore weather, 100 pounds of gear and armor (move to shade, remove clothing, pour water all over him, get him to drink water). Cardiac arrests? At least it's fast; and medics don't really carry defibs. Airway obstructions due to airway allergic reaction? You know what else causes similar swelling of the airways for combat injury? Throat, esophageal, and airway burn due to hot air and smoke (generated from a normal, or incendiary explosion) inhalation. Very common combat injury (immediate intubation, maybe some corticosteroid).

Why do people come for lecture just to play game on their tablet or phone for the entire duration and disturb people around them by talking non stop? Just cannot understand them. There are people who wants to listen to the lecture yo. After that, spend the same amount of time watching webcast at home. Doesn't make sense right? Might as well just not come for lecture at all. #commonsense

Let me share another story that happened. Every meal time, soldiers are required to scan their 11Bs (Army identity cards) at a machine before taking their meals in order to account for the meals consumed per day. One fateful afternoon, a recruit scanned his 11B at the machine but was instructed to scan 2 more times by the duty orderly officer. He followed orders and scanned his card twice more –triple the normal amount. The machine started beeping and shrieking, causing the recruit to panic and get a heart attack. He never had previous problems with scanning his 11B, and none of the other soldiers had problems with scanning their 11Bs.

Yours sincerely,

Do you subscribe to "Information should be free" or "Information should be copyrighted and owned"?

Here is my view: In the Age of Information, we still have professors who want to stop their notes from being shared online. Copyright Act is made by the establishments (publishers, politicians, bureaucrats) because they cannot stop the pirates from sharing their information. Who will want to spend $200 buying some expensive academic books?

I've been with my gf for only a few months but she always complain about my dressing. When I'm at home or just going out for meals around our neighbourhood I just wear tee shirt and army shorts, when we go out I usually wear tee / polo tee + berms and if we go to nicer places I wear polo tee and jeans. She enjoys dressing up and always complain about me, but this is my wardrobe why can't she just accept me?!?!?!

Let me share a story that happened during my army days. During every night training, all trainees and instructors are issued 1 nightsnack (twiggies) according to army regulations and TSR. But one night, we got so many twiggies that everyone was issued 3 instead - triple the regulated amount. Our OC said that everyone had to finish the nightsnacks instead of throwing and wasting them. One trainee, being the zealous soldier that he was, dutifully ate his 3 twiggies but tragically passed away from twiggie overdose. He never had previous problems with eating twiggies or other nightsnacks, and none of the other soldiers had problems with the twiggies.

Yours sincerely,

With respect to the recent furore over Dominique Sarron's death. This might be seen as a rather cold and unfeeling statement.

Honestly, all those males commenting you should know. Touch your heart how many of you followed the TSR to the letter? Just the basic half-water bottle full a lot of people don't fill it full in the first place and then drink down to half, and that's just the start! Armor vehicle on the road bash in at least 10m? Pshhh. Do what you want, just don't get caught eh?

DSL's death was an accident, and there was a breach in the TSR. But... put yourself in the shoes of the officers subject to the witchhunt. It's the end of the day and you overindented extra smoke grenades which you don't want to return to ammo dump(a common enough scenario). You've never even heard of zinc chloride allergy and even know that these men have actually gone through smoke grenade in previous training exercises(as stated in the mothers response letter). Could you have reasonably predicted that this would have happened? Without prior knowledge of this incident, can you really say you would have not done it just to avoid that bit of extra paperwork?

For sensitivities sake no one wants to approach a grieving Mother and say that "I'm sorry, your kid died because they wanted to avoid some extra paperwork, which was a perfectly reasonable decision at that point in time, so we didn't want to ruin another two kid's lives by locking them in DB"
Safety rules are written in blood and predicting every possible accident scenario before it happens would require omniscience or simply not doing anything at all and keeping soldiers in their bunks forever.

Let he who has kept TSR to the letter throw the first stone.

Dear NUS / UTown management,

please increase the number of motorcycle parking lots around UTown. There are no new lots near CAPT/RC4 at all, there are no new lots near Yale-NUS, but the number of residents around UTown has increased greatly. The existing UTown Residence motorcycle parking lots are gravely insufficient - most bikes now either park on non-existent lots or on double yellow lines.

Having more lots closer to all the residential colleges and Yale-NUS will help reduce the urge to park illegally. 

The biker community will be very grateful for this.

Many friends are criticising the govt about a Tesla car owner being slapped with extra surcharges for importing his car. These so called clean and green electric cars still charge from the mains which get power from fossil fuels. So what is wrong with the govt doing the calculations based in the amount of CO2 released to generate the electricity?

To 
YOU LOT ARE IN THE SAME BLOODY CITY. Even in the same university. Some busy bees you guys are.

I am working full time, close to 9 hours a day, 6 days a week. I live alone so I do all the houseworks. My fiancée is a 2 hours flight away, and I can only manage a weekend visit each month. She also works fulltime, and have housework after office hours. Yet we video chat on Skype everyday for at least an hour for the last year without fail.

Oh yeah you undergrads are so busy. Like I've never been one.

Notice the fiancée-fiancé thing? That's our relationship status. And honey, that's the least commitment you need for any serious relationship to work out. Too bad with text? No time for visits? Commitment with life and work? Please, git gud you fucking casuls.

I still remember this one incident in NUS when I got lost before I matriculated. I was supposed to meet my friend outside some LT but just couldnt find it because the place was too crowded. I walked circles around the faculty and ended up at some isolated area there. Surprisingly, a girl passing by saw me and offered to show me the way there. Just want to say Thank you for your help. I only remembered she had long hair and was wearing a T-shirt with jeans, but from the looks of it, I think she is some Year 3 student and doing a language mod then. If you remember this situation or me(who was in short-sleeve button shirt and jeans with a slightly curly hair), please acknowledge. Thanks

 For me, it is because I hate confrontations, primarily because I can never quite withstand the entire process without breaking apart in front of the other party. I have no wish of letting anyone hear my voice shiver and break as my heart shatters, or my eyes sparkle as the tears well up and threaten to spill over. No, I cannot show my vulnerability to one who bad just hurt me and whom I must now confront.

Some words... Just can't be said without feeling. I can hide behind a screen but I cannot command my body to not betray me.

I do not wish to have your face to read as you listen but do not hear, as your face remains impassive even as my heart tears into a million pieces. I shy away because I know that you will never quite react the way I wish you would, because I doubt, and I believe that you are not in this the same way that I am, because you had shown once, twice, no, many times before, that you are not here with me.

Do not ask to see my blotched face when you are the one who had stained it.

This is why I will never bring up my unhappiness face to face. It makes it real not just for you, but for me too.

It was kinda late at night and I was studying with this guy from my course. Being quite innocent and curious, the topic of anatomy came up... 

In one day, things went from 0 - 100 real quick for me.... Because later that night I went back to my hall and decided to finger myself after taking a dump. I never expected myself to be so moist, but it was also much more sticky than I expected. There was so much on my finger, and I was quite tempted to taste it. I can only imagine how much easier it would be if I had a vagina!

With reference to one of the confessions on upgrading yourself,what if the problem is with your features? You can't really do much to change it then isnt it?

So today is 29th Feb. The day that comes every 4 yrs. Today I have a very... special(?) confession to make. Please bear with me and read it through if you do. This post was made in view of the recent sexual posts such as 'beneficial friends' and 'toying with yourself' . Thank you in advanced.
I just hit 20 today, (yes I warn borne today on 29th Feb) and I am the only child in the family. My dad is American and I have an Singaporean mother. I came back recently to serve my service to the nation and now, I am studying in NUS. (I enlisted early). Long story short, I was surfing facebook today and I saw one of those 'memories' post. It was a private status update addressed to me: "4 years in the future me, look back and recall what happened today. It was a LOAD to digest". And this I shall begin the main reason I wrote this post, my story 4 years ago:
So on my 16th birthday, I celebrated with some Singaporean cousins and friends. I mostly hoped around countries due to my dad's work so while it may sound surprising, I actually have mostly Asian friends. So the gathering was on the night of 28th, we drank (underaged, yes...) at home and got real wasted and a bunch of us started blabbing crap and nonsense. Amongst the spouting of nonsense came jokes such as [being old enough to wank] I recall vividly. Some of the older horny guys started watching porn together and had a challenge to see who climaxed first. I remembered being so drunk and collapsed before I got to this part so i didn't participate. I heard this account of events from another friend.
*DON'T FREAK OUT. THIS IS NOT A DISGUSTING WANKING POST. I WILL NOT SCARE YOU BY GOING INTO DETAILS*
The next day, my parents were out and I was alone at home.  (SINCERELY OUT OF CURIOUSITY], I decided to .....play with myself and..... explore my body for the first time. So I explored my (as the other confessor nicely wrote: Male Reproduction Organ). I vividly recall my thoughts back then now: (So if I rub it, cum will.... come out?)

And I made a mess out of my table.  And computer screen, And Keyboard. And pants, and stationery. And the list goes on.

Of course I freaked out. I recall using an entire box of tissues to cover my mess and I went straight to the showers, washed myself like a dozen times....

And tried to digest this new experience. Went on with my life that day. But this is not where the story ends, it is where it gets interesting.
That night, before bedtime, Dad came to me and wanted to talk to me. Long story short, I was so bad at cleaning up (always have been, even in Army LOL) that mum found evidence of my ...."mess". In my self defense I missed a spot. And Mum speculated. She talked to Dad cus she didn't know how to handle it and Dad came in asking "Did you jerk off today?". My look was a dead giveaway. (Well whatdaya know, it wasn't a long story.) And I shared everything, both thoughts and actions.

Dad spoke to me: Mum wanted me to stop because she doesn't believe it is morally correct (she is buddhist not christain )and that if I were to get used to (playing with myself), I will have some psychological disorder or something. (Don't see how that works out. Women, care to share your unique point of view? Or is it an Asian thing). Back to Dad: Well, basically he told me about how I came to this world, or rather, how I almost didn't.

Mum almost went for an abortion, and it was because they did IT on impulse. I recall what Dad said that night that made me learnt something new, something more about life. "It is not wrong to explore new adventures, so it shouldn't be wrong to learn about sexual experiences. Mum says you should stop doing this but as a guy I know how you feel. I may be a bad parent for you to know so little about sex but I also know that it could have ended up worse. You could have gotten someone pregnant, like I did. And I don't want you to end up like that."

In Dad's words: I don't believe in abstinence, but I believe in safe sex. And frankly, I would rather you wank yourself to death than get someone pregnant.

Now that I reached the end of this post, I am not so sure what this post is for... It ain't a "i had sex and it felt so good" or "i wanked and it rocked''.  It also ain't a 'Listen to me you wild animals who do it in the heat", or a "Since then I have turned into a goody goody two shoes"
But then again, this is a confession page. And I am confessing, while sharing, my experience. I suppose that if reading this posts, can stop at least one abortion, then it's worth my time.  The thought that I could not even exist scares to me hell in words that i can't even describe. Even if not, no harm trying and no harm sharing eh? (i mean, i didn't insult or sexually harass anyone. It is NOT my intention to, so I'm sorry if I accidentally did so)

Also, Happy 29th Feb Birthday to all peeps who share the same birthday as me. :D

Anyone likes 蜡笔小新？I watched it everyday. It's not just because 小新 is cute and funny, but it's because I think having a family like 小新's is really sweet. Watching it somehow warmed my heart. It made me missed home, just a little bit. #小新迷

 Same with you, I'm a girl who also unknowingly found out about masturbation at an early age (around 9, like you), and like you, didn't even yet know what masturbation was. 

I was playing around on a sofa one day, trying to prop myself up with my arms on the back edge of the sofa which is super sturdy. When I did, I started rocking back and forth for fun, trying to keep my balance. And then...I felt something building up. I didn't know what was happening but I knew I liked it and instinctively rocked faster and faster and eventually pleasure rushed through my young body. 

I moved on to explore other ways from then on, and only found out many years later what I've been doing. 

We shouldn't stigmatize and shame female self-pleasure but glorify male masturbation as we're all sexual beings. As long as it isn't obsessive and destructive we should be all good.

To  
Hi, did you do any rebonding/perming /chemical treatment to your hair? Is it a recent hair fall?
Try to think back what is making your hair fall.
You can visit a dermatologist to check your scalp. It mayb due to your scalp may not be healthy. Or otherwise you can go to this EmpireCharme salon at Kovan.  62834128. They have Gingseng scalp treatment. It's very good for hair loss and another problems. I have tried it:)
-
 
Hello ! I am not female but I have had hair loss since Secondary school. Like you, my hair is thin and you can see parts of my scalp. 

First, you should go see a dermatologist. The dermatologist will help identify the causes of hair loss. Hair loss can be due to many reasons, such as genetics, disease, sensitive skin (usually to hair products) or diet. The dermatologist will suggest a treatment plan. 

Second, you need to learn to live with your hair! I know this is difficult. I had schoolmates, friends and dates point out or tease me for my (lack of) hair. But you must accept yourself because, if you don't, who will? But if you feel uncomfortable in the interim, I suggest wearing caps or hats. 

Third, you should stop the use of hair products that cause hair loss. Check with your dermatologist for a list. For me, I can't gel my hair. If I do, my hair will fall. What this means is that you cannot style your hair in certain ways unless, of course, you wear a wig. Also, for females, I understand that tying your hair puts strain on the roots so you may want to avoid that.

Weird fetishes? I claim to have one. It's quite silly, so let me just say this. I wish I was a dungeon master. I wish I had as many contraptions to test the limits of the human body. I wish I had whips, swords and spears to train my martial arts. I wish I had chains that stretch the limits of my imagination.

You see, I have a BDSM fetish. May I have your hand please? ;)
-
 
Been reading about weird fetishes some people have so I think I want to share mine too. It's not as weird as most people's here, but yeah. 

My girlfriend sleeps over quite often and we enjoy cuddling till we sleep, sometimes we just fall asleep mid-cuddle. She drools quite a bit when she's sleeping and I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to find her drool on my face or neck or shirt. I like the taste of it, although sometimes it's quite smelly due to morning breath. 

But I don't like it when the drool tangles her hair up... Ugh that's just nasty.

It's bad that the management is changing back the D1 shuttle bus route to stop at Museum before UTown! The current scheme is great for students and staff who are carrying equipment from Utown to UCC or Museum. So bad they are changing it back to how it was before, because it's too tiring to walk all the way to Museum with a long day ahead! 

And dear OP of , don't forget that there is a bus called D2 which currently stops at Museum before UTown.

Highlight of my Friday: Was alighting the train at Tanjong Pagar MRT station for my internship in the morning. Lots of people alight too, freeing up many seats. This initially-standing Caucasian guy takes a seat and exclaims, "Wow! My first seat in Singapore!"

It's great that the management is changing back the D1 shuttle bus route to stop at Museum before UTown! The current scheme is bad for UTown residents who are coming back after taking the BTC shuttle or the 151, and end up at Museum. Glad they are changing it back to how it was before, because it's too tiring to walk all the way back from Museum after a long day!

I lost my room key, thinking it must have felt out of my pocket on bus D2. Yellow keychain. Anyone found it or saw it can comment below? SSC has closed for the weekend and I don't want to pay $150 for replacement.

Due to the lack of self control, I place "reasoned rules" restricting my behavior - that my outfits and shoes restrict my mobility.

Take, for example, if I wear a pair of slippers - the most I can manage is a slow jog, because it is not suited for running.

If I wear a pair of sports shoes, I can only manage controlled steps and jogs, because the bottom of my shoes are completely smooth.

I can only dart when I wear sneakers, because excessive heat will spoil the adhesive holding it together.

Is it odd, to depend on such rules to govern my own behavior, or does anyone else have such "rules"? 

It would be pretty interesting to hear you out.

I'm not embarrassed to take the priority seats on bus/mrt because I know that I will give it up when I see someone needing it more than I do. People should be less judgemental when they see young and able men on priority seats.

Me: nope, but..
Her: no car?? How old are u? Got condo anot?
Me: 25.. No condo too.. But..
Her: NO BUT! How much ur salary?
Me: I don't have salary...
Her: you not working? Oh ****.. I'm outta here..
Me: sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I own a company, so I don't have salary. I take profit. I don't own bmw Audi or Mercedes, as I'm driving a Lamborghini. This is my key. I don't own a condo, I own a landed property. Good bye.

She's trying to to rectify a situation by saying "oh no I was just joking". But I just ask for bill and pay. And walk away. Satki bo?

Seasons of Love was so poorly ran!!! The food truck was parked so far away from the even itself, I think many people simply didn't know it was there. The overall acoustics was terrible, affecting many performers' set. And the most unforgivable sin - the event started a whole 1.5hours late and the audience didn't even know what was going on. Everyone just sat there is silence although they had a DJ which could have been doing his thing and livening up the atmosphere! Absolute waste of a DJ. And despite the delay, apparently, some of the performers didn't even get their turn to do soundcheck! Just really, really disappointed in NUSSU, and so, so embarrassed since I invited my best friends and told them it would be a great event.

Hi did anyone saw a black colour planner with gold words from the paper bunny in LT32? I forgot to take it after a lecture on 23rd Feb Tuesday 8pm. When I went back to look for it this morning, I only found the papers I placed in between my planner. If anybody found it, please please return it to me cos it's very important to me, it contains a lot of my daily schedule and most importantly, it's a birthday present from my friends so it's very meaningful to me. Thank you!!!
-
 
Is it me or is NUSSU completely incompetent at organising music/performance-related events? Rag2015 soundman screwed up the performers' sound despite having done a soundcheck, didn't give the faculties that performed earlier in the day lighting plots. Fast forward to sem 2 and Seasons of Love was even worse: the soundman couldn't even remember the same settings he used for soundchecking the various items, and they let Gentle Bones overrun the soundcheck 1.5hours past the starting time of the event, then so many other groups couldn't even conduct their soundcheck. For an upcoming event organised by them, they agreed to provide equipment, only to suddenly say that they don't have. Firstly, if it was the same soundman for Rag and Seasons of Love, please don't even use him ever again, he seriously ruined the sound of all the performers. Secondly, how can you agree to something and then suddenly say that you can't provide and then more or less assume that we will provide equipment by ourselves? Wake up your idea: if you wanna organise such events, know what you need in advance, otherwise ask your performers what they need. Absolutely no professionalism from them.

Today I got scammed by NUS COOP. I bought a Wifi adaptor and router for my mac. The router was about 40 and the tiny little adaptor cost 40 dollars. They told me that to make it work with the NUS network I have to pay a setup fee of 50 dollars. So all in all I paid 130 dollars for wireless connectivity.

Then I talked to my friend and I found out the router cost only 20 dollars and the adaptor only 10 dollars had I got it online or at Sim Lim! And the worst part, I did not even need to setup anything in the router. It's literally plug and play, all they had configured for me were my SSID and Security that's all! Got totally conned out of 100 dollars.

NUS COOP is the biggest scammer in NUS and should be investigated for corrupt practices. They are selling items to students, who already broke at exorbitant prices to make ridiculous profits at their expense. I bet even their textbooks are overpriced.

A lot of students should dress more presentably when they attend school. It doesn't have to be a suit and tie everyday but at least dress casual smart with long pants and shoes. A loose T-shirt, shorts and slippers/sandals wouldn't do. It is perfectly fine to wear whatever you wish as long as you are participating in your sport activities or at your hostel, but when you dress sluggishly during lectures or tutorials, you don't seem to be giving much respect to your teachers or the place, even though you may not actually mean it. It is not a matter of whether you have the money to buy nice clothing. Proper clothes do not need to be expensive. However, it is a matter of effort to show you are proud being a smart tertiary student. I am sure when you go out to work, you will need to dress appropriately as well. So please, I urge some of you to do something about it.

Me and my friends were at the pgp study room discussing our start up business plan, then these two people studying at this room came up to us and asked us to be quiet. Lol, nobody said cannot talk in study room please! And we came here first and talked for a while then they came inside, of course we own this room and can continue to talk, they can choose not to come in what, so we went up and told them this, haha so funny to see them speechless. These people really like to mind other people's business, no rules said we cannot talk in the study room please.

To XN from FASS:

You may tire of me as our December sun is setting, because I'm not who I used to be... No longer easy on the eyes, these wrinkles masterfully disguise the youthful boy below; who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for: both a beginning and an end.

But now, he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident.

...On the back of a motorbike, with your arms outstretched trying to take flight and leaving everything behind. But even at our swiftest speed, we couldn't break from the concrete in the city where we still reside...

And, I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn for the sea like navy men... Because now we say goodbye from our own separate sides

@16830: just keep an "I told you so" ready. My friends got into social smoking in NS. When I tried to get them to stop they mocked me instead, saying that I should mind my own business. Well when one of them hit the jackpot with lung cancer the rest quit immediately. The one who got hit with the cancer had to beg everyone around him for money for the chemo. I took his advice to mind my own business and not to meddle in his finances.

I know I'm going to get flamed for saying this but just gotta get it off my chest...

My friend overseas has got a boyfriend, who dresses up occasionally to go on dates (wears a suit), treats her like an absolute princess and travels hours just to see her and bring her out. He texts her the sweetest messages and is able to dirty talk just enough to be a turn on but be classy at the same time. He plays 4 instruments, is over 1.8m, rock climbs, has abs of steel and he has a massive dick.

Then I'm here in Singapore, looking at the unromantic, uninteresting guys around me and all the misogynistic commenters on NUSwhispers with their

Sigh.

Hi OP of , 

This is from the POV of a fellow NS man (ORD) who had been through hell and back in the army. I'm sharing this because I feel that my experience can help explain your feelings. 
Like most guys who started their journey, I took the usual 2 months BMT route via Tekong --> unit or command school. When I first enlisted , I was totally unaware of my own behaviour in front of other people, and how I carried myself in front of others. Throughout my entire primary to JC education, I felt that achieving good results in school was the most important thing in life. I happily retreated behind my textbooks and really, I was the classic nerd. I did not have a CCA from primary school to JC(had lah but I didn't commit to it at all) , neither did I make any close friends. As a result,my whole life literally revolved around myself. Every decision of mine was based off myself, not other people. 

Of course, this mentality which was subconsciously ingrained me began to unravel during BMT. I kept to myself, not bothering to help my buddy, section or platoon mates when they needed it. I remember there was an incident where my buddy was still asleep 5 minutes before falling in for first parade, yet I did not even bother to wake him up. He did not fall on time and my entire platoon was punished as a consequence. My self-centred behaviour continued throughout the 9 weeks of BMT. Needless to say, my platoon mates hated me to the core by then. I, on the other hand, did not realise what was wrong with myself, and instead I still wondered why my section mates were so cold towards me.Despite  being punished countless times for being irresponsible and selfish by my sergeants, I still thought that I did nothing wrong and I lived for myself. At that point, I hated army to the core. I almost contemplated suicide because of the shit I was getting. I could just recount my entire NS story here but it would be too long so let me get to my main point.
Basically, after BMT I was posted to straight to a Ops unit. I still maintained my self- centred mentality and in such an OPs unit, and instantly there was a target on my back. After multiple incidents and punishments where I was pushed to the brink of suicide,  my OC, commanders and my mates decided to talk to me about my issues. For the first time in my NS life, I realised that NS or the SAF was not the problem. I WAS.   I decided to change my attitude and it took a while to do so. By then, I already felt so much better about myself and the SAF, I also realised that my mates were gradually warming up to me. I am not ashamed to say that my first few close friendships that I made were from NS.

Looking back, I still feel that I lost more than I gained during NS. But it also gave me valuable life lessons I otherwise would not have learnt if I had not gone through it.   Another thing, from your rant, I noticed that you have been going on a lot about your own issues. This is what I feel: we don't live only for ourselves, but for others as well. Opening our mind and including other people into your lives and thinking for them will really prevent negative thoughts and feelings from manifesting.

Meanwhile in PGP, the epitome of  a "Country", having a four-people party in a small room even though there's rule stating that no resident is to remain in a room with a member of the opposite sex with the room door closed or beyond 11 p.m. Ironically, the room is just right opposite to one of the RA's room. And most importantly, isn't NUS an alcohol-free place?   
Good job the PGP team for replying all posts on NUSWhispers actively! But do you all mind to spend the time for some tangible actions? 
Chaos within after 11pm is ubiquitous in pgp, transforming a study room into mahjong room during CNY period, leaving bulky items (eg. clothes drying stand) along corridor, bringing in alcoholic drinks and share with others, harbouring a squatter for friends and endless infringement of rules.
Actions speak louder than words, it's time for you to prove that you are not earning easy money and not doing any work. Let's begin with the easiest thing, ask the cleaners to clear all those books which left unattended on those tables in study rooms every morning. #selfish  PGP does have other residents apart from them.
If not, can OSH meddle in this matter?

Regarding  

I was a sergeant in a combat unit. My unit went taiwan 3 months before ORD. To put it simply, yes many of us, even those with girlfriends, went on to clear our rifles during R&R. The hokkien pengs are more open about it. The nerdier bunch who came from jc... I guess there's some form of peer influence at play, that if we are scared to get a hooker we are pansies. Well most of us enjoyed ourselves but we are more discreet, and we bury these fond memories and never ever talked about them to our girlfriends and only reminisce about them together when we return for ICT. My regret is that my PS (my immediate superior you could say) managed to snare the boobiest and prettyfaced chick and I got the not so booby one.

OP of  here, I wasn't expecting people to say there's nothing wrong with my fetish. To reply to some of the comments, yes, i get my VS bras online. The sizes run from 32a to 36D, but i usually prefer C & D cups, especially those la senza beyond sexy gel padded bras. I cannot pass them to my mom/sis without arousing some inconvenient questions and my gf prefers young hearts lingerie. I guess the comment about it being classical conditioning is somewhat accurate, as its become kindof a reward mechanism for me, like survive midterms and bra spree, finish assignments and can reward myself. I once went crazy and spent about 1.2k sgd at la senza(have a picture of the receipt but i think it got filtered). What i meant by masturbating with the bras is that i pick out one or two and use it till it gets too dirty before throwing it away, so most of my collection is BNWT. But would you really want to swap with someone like me?

Anyways I appreciate the admins giving me the opportunity to get this off my chest. I never had the chance to speak to this to anyone ever since i discovered my addiction in secondary school.

 After reading your post, there I would like to share my thought about NS. 

During my BMT, a recruit reported that his handphone got stolen. The sergeant then informs the OC about it.

The OC forced the entire company to sit on the foyer without touching our bag. He told us that if the culprit doesn't own up, the entire company have to stay back until  9pm until the CO finished his work before the CO can come down to investigate.

His action is the same as those vigilant. Punishing the culprit at all cost even at the sacrifice of the public.

Trying to protect everyone and myself, I offered to help the OC track down the phone thinking that doing so allows everyone to be released 

While my action of "helping"the OC actually ruined his plan of forcing the culprit out, you have to consider what NS is about.

NS is about sacrificing oneself to protect Singapore and the citizen living on it. The OC actually did the opposite. On the other hand, I am merely a recruit then but my will to protect everyone is stronger than him.

In Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, the pink ranger asked in the first episode, "You are rich, buy an army" While it wasn't explained why Spencer choose 5 teenagers instead of an army, my guess is that in the army, people care about saving themselves more than others which mean buying an army would be only a waste of money.

I wonder what exactly is wrong with the floor repair of utown gym. Now its delayed to 29 feb:( i am suspecting that NUS ran out of funds and so it will delay till they get the sufficient amount. If not floor repair can't have taken that long...anyone think the same way?

I don't mind her for who she is or her weight, but how do i hint to her that she has to start eating regular meals and sleep more (she sleeps 3 hours daily) to regulate her betamolism and bring her back to her prettier days?

I feel that undergrads these days have a extremely high sense of self entitlement.
I am a postgrad student working in a lab.
This evening, I took the lift down to B1 carrying a heavy load of wet soil. I stood near the buttons of the lift.
Three floors down, a large group of undergrad students entered the lift, from the end of their modules.
When the lift reached B1, I exited first, since I was carrying a heavy load which I could not withstand anymore and I was standing near the doors.
Behind me, a guy exclaimed "Let the girl go first. She is so rude"
Hello, I was in the lift first and carrying a heavy load. You guys were just gossiping about lecturers, coursemates and holding light looking bags.
In the past, in a similar situation, but taking a lift with Professors, other postgrad/staff and even cleaners, they will always hold the lift for me, ask whether I need help etc, even though I do not need any or expect them to. I am grateful for their generosity and warm hearts.
What is with undergrad these days? You are the ones with no basic sense of courtesy.

It was in the lift i met this cute chinese guy, not very tall about 1.5+m because i'm 1.6, had this chipmunk facial complex, very prominent forehead and what's more he has such a smooth skin and fair skin with no hair (every girls' dreams) ?? He offered to carry my books for me to KR mrt. :| I just wished I talked to him more just now and get to know where he's from but i only managed to glance at his matric card and I think I saw his name as Thales Semia? 

I just want to say you made my day today :) and hopefully i get to see you again!

Hi guys, i am a lingerie addict. It started when i found a bra at the void deck. Being curious i picked it up and it stirred something in me. I brought it home and masturbated with it and that's how it started. I feel that i must say that while i have thought of being one of those people who steals lingerie from washing lines, i did a cost benefit analysis and decided it was not worth it. So now i just buy it in bulk online from la senza, Victoria's secret and agent provocateur. My addiction has gotten slightly out of hand now, with a huge lingerie collection (2 drawers and a huge duffel bags worth). I guess I am worried how i am going to explain this to my gf next time when we do get married. Maybe some of you will say i need psychological help, but personally i think that I am not hurting anyone, nor am i hurting myself, so is there really a need?

Does anyone still sleep in the same room as your brother? I'm a girl by the way. Our room is big, we have a separation wall(?) in the middle of the room. So i am not able to see his bed.
So.. the issue is, my brother always masturbates without me knowing. I am not sure what he is doing, wiggling his body on the bed. I can hear the bed creaking lol. Definitely not a HJ, because he was lying flat down and wiggling. 
But he only does this when he thinks i am asleep. It is uncomfortable to be honest. So i made noises to show that i am kinda still awake and he would stop. Should i tell him face to face to stop doing that? Anyway, I don't understand how does he get sexual pleasure from that too. I only know HJ and BJ lol 

PS/ does anyone know if during Commencement day, our slides will show the type of degree it shows? Whether it is Honours degree, Bachelor with merit, Bachelor with pass degree? Thanks

 My team mates also did the same thing. Today, they went to watch a movie.

Need some serious advice here on what to do. I have been dating my bf for 3 years. We have been doing what couples do... Recently however, he has been asking me to fulfill his fetish(asking me to pee in my pants)... Its quite embarrassing to do it outside but I still do my best to give it to him when we are alone. However, what he did earlier today made me cry.. We went out to watch a movie in the afternoon and planned to go back to his house after that(he had told me before to control my pee).. During the movie, i drank a lot of coke(standard size given when popcorn bought) which made me urgent. I held on till after the movie. I told him I wanted to go to the toilet as I could not hold on anymore. He refused and I tried my best to while we were walking around. A few minutes later I told him I needed to go to the toilet as I was on the verge of peeing myself in public. I tried to run to the toilet but he grabbed me tightly(but with no injuries) and told me to hold on till we reached home. I told him that I would not be able to make it as I drank a lot and had not peed for a few hours. After I told him that, he suddenly hit my weak spot(he knows how to make me pee) and i peed myself in public and there were many people around. I was just shocked and didn't know what to do. He walked off after that and left me to fend for myself.. What do I do now... I still love him.. But did he really have to do this to me?

VH, your MILO should taste good right? ;)

I saw you pouring a white bottle of fluid into your friend's MILO. If I am not wrong, that's from you.

Luckily I had a conscience and swapped the two cups.

Taste of your own medicine.

Swipe left... swipe left... swipe right... swipe left...

Oh shit I'm going to sneeze! And as my body tenses that little bit, the in-curling of my thumb accidentally hits the super like button.

Dropped my card holder with my matric card and ez-link in it, and it came after a long day of frustration.

Sometimes I have so little sleep, my mind goes tripping in between classes and in between cycling. Pedestrians walking on bicycle paths ( especially across the Utown bridge and en route to NUS Museum) , 
BEWARE. I knocked down a pedestrian yesterday (he refused to walk the pedestrian walkway, was wearing headphones and was sauntering in the middle of it)

Remember we made a promise to go Budapest for our honeymoon?
I even joked that I will piggyback you all the way from Buda to Pest.

 Sadly, I'm no longer able to fulfill my promise. I used to be a muscular hunk. However, now I'm reduced to nothing but a living skeleton. Even if god is kind enough to extend my lifespan, I could no longer garner enough strength to carry you anymore. Thank you for putting on a brave front, constantly reminding that I will recover and telling me jokes to cheer me up. 

Walls have ears, I knew that you have been crying when I'm not around. However, I have no rights to call you a cry baby, because I'm crying when you are not around too. Whenever, you arrived at the door step of the hospital ward, the friendly nurses will notify me immediately. I will then, wiped off my tears quickly and pretend to be sleeping. I know my own body better then anyone else, it won't last for long. 

笨蛋！I won't let you be the one piggybacking me from Buda to Pest. My body might be fragile but I'm still the same Big Man with a Big pride 大男人! How can I let my little princess piggyback me.

When you read this message (or perhaps you might never even read it), I might no longer be in this world. I wish that a better man will appear in your life and give you happiness that you truly deserve. Even though I’m no longer around, you must continue to study hard because a bright future awaits you. Smile like you always do, be that same cheerful girl who rescued my heart from darkness. Before I close my eyes, I will take every bits and pieces of our memories into my grave. 

Image of you throwing tantrum and messing up my study table, during an argument. 

Image of you stealing away my first kiss

Image of you celebrating my 21st  birthday at esplanade

All the good & bad times, and many more.......................................................................................

Good bye my dear. If reincarnation is real, I will definitely come back to protect you <3<3

Well we are having a lot of it, just behind closed curtains. Pay per view though 

On the contrary, I see a lot of actions over in Cinnamon. Somehow you guys don't have a habit of keeping it to yourselves. For the past two years, I have seen feisty fights (with happy endings), vigorous smooching, bare-it-all windowsill stuff. Keep it going!

Hi, saw a girl at the UHC bus stop yesterday. Didn't notice her at first, since she had her head buried in her hands so I thought she was resting. Only after observing her for a while I realized she was trembling intermittently and it seemed like she was in quite a bad shape. Was going to go over to comfort her/ask if she's okay but some guy came over and walked her off (she was stumbling quite a bit). She was wearing a white skirt and had a green bag with her. I hope everything's okay now and hopefully you're feeling better! Do comment if you need someone to talk to. :) -From someone who has been in a similiar situation before

We have a frenchwoman TA whose nose is super narrow and sharp. Everytime I see her,  I keep having the image that she's bound to break her nose at least once in her life. She wouldn't stand a chance tripping over or even knocking her nose against the kitchen cabinet.

The day after Sem 1 results came out, my ex broke up with me. She was my first relationship. Fast forward to today, I'm unable to get over her and it’s affecting me more than it should. I still think about her all the time.

She moved on pretty damn quickly and found herself another boyfriend before the dust settled. Yet, here I am stuck in the past. I thought I might win her back but how wrong I was. She even confessed they have been sleeping together 2 weeks after we broke up.

In the meantime, I've just been bawling my eyes out.

I guess this song pretty much sums up how I feel towards her and her new man:

Ok this is a kinda embarrasing post. Does anyone has this experiences whereby when you want to move your bowels, you ended up releasing gas into the toilet bowl and the toilet bowl somehow "amplifies" the sound? This is the reason why i always use the handicapped toilet instead of the usual toilet with many cubicles because if the sound can be heard, i wouldn't dare step out of my cubicle for i do not want people to know who was the one who released the gas. I remembered once whereby this incident happened and my friend asked if i am the one but i flatly denied it since there's other people using adjacent cubicles. But i am just worried that some people with sharp ears will know which cubicle the sound comes from. 

Sometimes when i just try to hold it in, the sound of gas running inside my stomach can be heard especially in quiet rooms:( yes this is how bad it is.

I was told not to drink too much cold drinks as this increases gas in your intestines, which i thought do not have any scientific basis. I wonder why is my body so "gassy" and what should i do to get rid of this problem? I don't eat beans or too much fibres so if diet isn't the cause, could it be genetics since my dad also has the same issue? Does anyone also has this issue of gassy stomach/intestines?

I was approached by a group of non-English speaking foreigners/tourists/students who wanted to know how to get to someplace in NUS from Kent Ridge MRT. 

Being the Chinese(at least I hope what that was)-Challenged Socially-Awkward Singaporean I am, I could not understand them and could only watch as they laughed nervously at my failed attempts to get the whole message across. After a few tries, I saw a bus approaching and hastily left without stating why. I probably forgot to say a proper goodbye as my brain was already short-circuiting from embarrassment.

But to my horror, it wasn't my bus.

I was thus faced with several minutes of grueling awkwardness as the group slowly and quietly made their way to the nearby bus stop I had initially pointed them to. I could not face them, for I had improperly terminated communications earlier. I realize now whilst typing this that everything would probably have been better if I had just approached them to explain the situation, but at that time I couldn't think.

When my bus finally arrived I glanced at the group and saw that one of them was looking at me. I instinctively looked away and boarded the bus, pretending that nothing happened.

As the bus pulled away I felt tangs of guilt. It got worse as I remembered that Google Translate exists. 

Sorry :|

In light of Valentines Day.. I think it is finally time that I finally pen my feelings down and get this off my chest.

We met 3 months ago. You made me a coffee. Our eyes met. I blushed. You chuckled.

Days later, I saw you sprinting across the MPSH for tchoukball practice. You looked so handsome. I ran away with butterflies in my stomach.

It's been a while since I've seen you in school. I hope that you're still around this semester. It's killing me that I've not seen you for weeks.

Maybe.. We can have coffee soon? My Tembusu Boy :)

To people who eat alone and doesn't have a clique, don't be sad. There is nothing wrong with you.

If you watched Power Rangers before, you should know that the sixth ranger is sometime a loner. This trend is more obvious in Super Sentai. Does this mean that the sixth ranger is the weakest?

Quite the contrary, the sixth ranger is usually the strongest.

In Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, some doesn't consider the Magna Defender a Power Rangers as he doesn't wear spandex. However, is he inferior in anyway just because he is different? Quite the contrary, he is the strongest and save the rangers countless time.

So don't be sad about being alone. Nothing wrong with being alone.

I often catch myself staring at other girls' bodies. If they are wearing a low-cut top, my eyes just naturally tend to gravitate towards their chest. Likewise for girls with smooth, bare legs. Short skirts and tight pants. Exposed skin and naked shoulders. Just so darn attractive.

I always pay more attention to pretty girls as compared to guys.  

Plot twist: I'm a girl. An evergreen girl. :/

Guys I have a burning question to ask.
So let's say once upon a time, there was Kway chap (guy A) and nasi lemak (girl A). Nasi Lemak began as a simple girl who looked at the world in a simple way. Kway chap saw nasi Lemak at a camp and fell in love with her. Kway chap chased her and wanted to build a house (relationship) with her. Times were smooth sailing until not soon after, Kway chap bought termites (insecurities) into the house and these termites started eating onto the Nasi lemak's side of the house. Furthermore, with the expectations (storm) of Kway chap's Mother for Kway chap to do well in school came to Nasi Lemak side of the house. Nasi Lemak knew that Kway chap was not good for her. Nasi Lemak tried explaining to Kway chap about the termites and storms on her side of the house but Kway chap didn't know how to solve. In fact, both of them kept fighting over the same thing over and over again. Nasi Lemak became battered and tired. As time drew, Nasi Lemak wanted to leave as she knew that she wouldn't like how the house would eventually turn out. So she requested time and time again to leave but however when Kway chap ask her to stay, Nasi Lemak didn't had the heart to leave. Bibimbaps came along and they were good for nasi lemak, they didn't bring the storms or termites and even wanted to provide a garden (good future) for her side of the house. But nasi Lemak didn't wanted to leave as Kway chap was her first love and she wanted to explore every angle to solve the problems she had with Kway chap. Ultimately, Nasi Lemak had to distance herself from Kway chap in order to rebuild herself to connect herself with Kway chap again and to love him again. However, in the very last time when Nasi Lemak left Kway chap, Kway chap found another Nasi lemak (girl B) who was Kway chap's Sister friend. Nasi Lemak was broken and angry as she thought that all her sacrifice Nasi Lemak did for Kway chap would be worth sth. Kway chap on the other hand, was angry that nasi lemak always wanted to leave him. Was it Nasi Lemak' fault?

I spot a cute boy across mrt platform. We make eye contact; it's electric. It seems like forever that we stare into each other's eyes. I have this surreal moment where everything fades except the clarity of his eyes. I feel like I've come home. Then the mrt arrives and the connection is lost. I'm brought back to earth. He turns and boards the train going the opposite direction. It's not until that moment that I notice he's holding an enormous bouquet of flowers and an oversized teddy bear. Oops.

Hi just would like to ask if anyone has this problem... 

I am someone who is used to sleeping at least 8h when i had no school/school start late. I sometimes sleep fr 1:30am to 12pm the next day. But here comes the issue. Each time i know i must wake up at 10 plus am or even 11am for lessons, i got so stressed out that either i toss and turn and only fall asleep at 3 am plus or wake up too early at 7am plus and cannot sleep back, essentially i only had around 4h of sleep. The problem got worst when its very close to the day my menses start, like i can toss and turn till 5am plus before falling asleep:((

I usually had no issues with sleeping, provided i know i do not have a fixed time i must wake up. In fact sometimes i slept so well that i had no issues waking up at 10am since i slept really tight. I also sleep better if the next day start the same day as today. The only problem is when i know the next day i need to wake up 2h earlier then i start to panic. Also, i only had this problem when university starts since different days start at different times (some 2pm, some 12pm, some 10am).

I am so tempted to skip one of my modules' lecture at 12pm since its webcasted. But then again this doesn't solve the root of the problem. Its not that i don't want to choose modules that start late. I had to take those core modules. I also tried sleeping at the same time every night (1am) but it simply don't help as long as i know the waking up time for tomorrow is gonna be earlier than today.

Does anyone had some advice on how to be less stressed over this issue? How to make myself not think about the waking up time? Please help...its torturous each time i think i gonna lack sleep and i ended up torturing myself more with only 4h of sleep:( 

Ps: sometimes the best thing in this world is knowing that you do not have to set an alarm clock for the next day.

I'm an evergreen. I'm always apprehensive about getting a girlfriend. Because of all the atas photos that female friends post on instagram, like going to fancy restaurants or getting them presents, it gives me the impression that most girls are materialistic, or they expect something from the guy everytime.

So here I am listing down what I can do hoping that some girls out there would at least beat their eyelid.

I'm from average income family. No fancy cars. Just a lorry. I can't afford atas restaurants. Just the occasional Astons or din Tai feng. Even macs, I find it expensive and I can't bare to spend on on a fish fillet. I scrimp and save whenever possible. I don't dress to the nines. I don't dress to impress. Just a pair of jeans or Bermudas with a shirt. I don't have a nice physique, just a small tummy. I don't wax or style hair. To me, putting on wax after after shower is like you shower for nothing. 

To sum up, I'm not rich. There are some things that may seem affordable to many, but not to me. Any takers?

My roomie always laugh at me for having a 'little bro' down south. He always tease me 'aiyo so small' 

Well last week wed morning, as I woke up later than him (I slept naked by the way and was erected down south), I walked to grab my towel. The moment he saw me, his jaw dropped and he say 'Bro u got at least 17cm?' From that day onwards, he never made anymore comments about my 'little bro'.

People always say, "爱对了人，情人节每天都过”。( If you found the right one, everyday will be valentines day) . Yesterday should be a romantic day for the both of us, but she just have to screw thing up and turned it into “仇人节”。Can't believe that we shouted at each other in the atas restaurant...........

I kept asking myself, "我快乐吗?"

I meet up with my cousins twice a year, during CNY and Christmas. In recent years, i have found myself falling for one of them. My heart beats faster and i want to dress up more, just for him. I would spend hours looking for the right dress and makeup. I know this is a sin and there is no happy ending, but my heart still beats for him. Now that CNY has passed, I have to wait for Christmas. 

What should I do with this heart?

I'm a guy with natural centre parting and I hate it when people ask me why I put my hair like this. Is not I put one, is the wind blow one!! Dun they get it!! If only I lived in the 90s when centre parting was all the rage and popular. Whenever the wind blows, I either look like cock or people think I have bad/out-dated fashion sense.

Come back to me. 
I miss you, To the point where my mind is fully occupied by you. 
When I hear a song, I think about the times you would send me links and recommend me to listen to them. When I see a word, i think of the times you would spew out nonsense when you're being a jokester. 

I just want you to take me back. To say: I want you. 
I miss you so much, to the point I always shed tears when I replay the words you told me that night. 

I just you to take back your words and to say that you want me in your life. To say that after leaving me you've realised what a big mistake it was. To say I have been the greatest thing that has ever happened to you. 

I miss you. I just wanted you to know that. I miss you. I can say it a thousand times yet those three words will never be heard, for your existence in my life has been single handedly erased by you.

Any1 else excited about the discovery of Gravitational waves? Quote from Ligo :"Now we have gravitational waves we are going to have a whole new picture of the universe, of the stuff that doesn’t emit light – dark matter, black holes. For me the most exciting thing is we will literally be able to see the big bang. Using electromagnetic waves we cannot see further back than 400,000 years after the big bang. The early universe was opaque to light. It is not opaque to gravitational waves. It is completely transparent. So literally, by gathering gravitational waves we will be able to see exactly what happened at the initial singularity. The most weird and wonderful prediction of Einstein’s theory was that everything came out of a single event: the big bang singularity. And we will be able to see what happened.”

HI, any frequent pgp gym visitor? Just started lifting weights but i have no idea if i am doing it right (the weight to lift, number of rep, form and how to use certain equipment). I've been to the gym a couple of times but have only used the dumbbells and machines. Most of the time, i don't really feel very sore(not that kind that makes u feel that u worked out well) Wanted to try barbell and some other equipment today but was too afraid of injuring myself due to poor form. Anyone can advice me or be my gym buddy? -L

I have a secret. I have never cried before when I watch movies because I know they're fake. The actress who "died" will open her eyes and prop herself right back up when the director says cut. The actress who claims she has "leukemia" is just bluffing in front of the screen. The family who is battling "poverty" is pretending to eat cup noodles when you are looking, but dashing off to a five star restaurant when they get their pay from the movie. 

It's not that I don't have emotions it's just that I don't see a point crying when you  know people are intentionally lying through their teeth when they act in movies. 

I've never understood a single percent of why all my friends are shedding tears and more tears during movies. I cry if something bad happens to my family because that's real? I mean, movies are as good as someone going up to you and saying" hi I have a lie to tell you. I am going to die. Haha,I trick you only"???? 

Number 2 of my confession, I don't cry when I listen to songs and I know for a fact a few of my friends do. Songs are even more far fetched (to me at least) because... There isn't even a plot? There's no beginning, no introduction of the characters, and no clear cut ending? Just someone talking about how sad she is without giving at least ermmmm....background info about herself and the general situation? How does crying over a song even feel like, do you just pity the singer who's going through hardships? Sorry, I really don't know. 

I wish with my heart that I can understand how people can cry during movies knowing they obviously aren't real. I also want to pose a legit genuine question to all of you who've experienced crying during a song: what are you crying over? The sad fate of the singer? (I dunno, he didn't get paid by his songwriting company or what..?) what? 

It's definitely not that I NEVER cry. For example, when my sister ran and skinned her knee really badly,I cried because I was genuinely worried about her well being. And it's a real thing,not an actress pointing to a fake wound and saying to the camera,"hi, um, I'm asked to put this fake injury makeup cuz my director told me to". 

When my boyfriend got involved in a gang fight in poly, I cried for him too cuz he's like real? He's not another Hong Kong Kung fu actor pretending to fake die after a fight?

Does anyone feel 2 days of CNY holidays are very short? In Malaysia, where Chinese are not the majority, they get 1 week of holiday. In Singapore, where Chinese are the majority, we only get 2 days of holidays.

Since admission, I liked this girl who works at the school of medicine. Each time I see her my heart would melt and I wouldn't know what to do. But recently, I found a topless photo of her online. My heart crushed instantly I saw that. Should I let her know? So she could have the photo removed

Guys, stop looking at beautiful girls because it will boost their egos (based on my observations). They will pretend that they don't know you are looking at them. But if you look at their faces, you will notice their smirk.

I've had a pretty bad crush on a member of the FASS PSSOC. I think she's really freaking pretty. She's a Sociology major with a smokin' hot curvaceous figure, lush lashes and lovely curly hair. I probably don't stand a chance with her anyway, but I just wanted to wish her a happy Valentine's day.

Today when my relatives visited my house, one of them asked me why I become fatter. I thought this qns is quite unexpected because previous year when she came to my house, she didn't comment on my weight status even though I was 2kg heavier last year. This year, not only did my weight decrease by 2kg, the new shorts I bought had to be 2 sizes down compared to previous year (though I am still slightly overweight based on BMI). 

Can someone please enlighten me on how come I only receive comments on my weight status this year even though my shorts sizes are decreased and my weight down by 2kg ? 

(must admit it was kinda demoralising hearing this when I thought my efforts are yielding good progress).

Ps: the only thing different from previous year is that not only did I bought guys' shirt (I'm a girl), I accidentally bought one that seems a little too loose for my current size so I'm not so sure how much of a difference  shirt sizes influence how people perceive your current weight status.

It's Chinese New Year. Where everyone wears their nicest/new clothes and go out. I'm dressed in something nice and new too. But here I am, getting scolded by my mum, because I'm not wearing a dress. I'm overweight, and I never liked wearing dresses because they just don't look nice. The only reason I have them is because there are just occasions where you have to wear one and CNY is definitely not it. Why can't I just wear what I like? And not just today, at times she goes "it's so ugly". Fuck. Some of the clothes she bought them herself. Is it a sin to be fat? To not look nice in most of the clothes? Besides, so what if it's really ugly? I dress for myself, not for you and if you think I'm an embarrassment, just stay far away from me

When I was young, I bumped my way through Rock Tunnel without using flash. When I finally stepped into Lavendar Town, I felt like a hero.

I'm a Year 4 Chem Eng student going to graduate soon. There is this girl in my course that I really like and she looks especially good when she wears stripes. I first saw her in Year 2 but I am too shy to approach her. Hopefully this valentine, I will be able to muster the strength to approach her and ask her out for a date. Then maybe we can go Nami Island for our grad trip heh.

I realized a lot of the Hong Baos I am giving out are to relatives who should be giving to my kids. Instead, at their age, they are still taking from me. This is a big warning sign about Singapore's future. Our youngsters are not getting married! 

Good sign is that those who got married quickly defended themselves during CNY with a new baby. My kids attacked their wallet for HongBao, they come back next year and attack my wallet for HongBao. No issue about that. I am happy. This is a good sign for Singapore's future. At least the married youngsters are having babies.

What worries me most is that several of our youngsters are not getting married and having babies. There will be no more Singapore in future if there are no new Singaporeans. 

Very worried about my beloved country.

 the world, including you seems to be infatuated with the idea that a murderer isn't really a murderer if he had a bad childhood. And he should be forgiven. Me? I call him, them, and you dogs. Dogs should be whipped if they lap up their own vomit. Shot if they have rabbies.

Don't ask for forgiveness. If you do feel guilty, shoot yourself, please. If you say you feel guilty yet don't want to face the music, you are just a hypocrite.

If you were so good at hiding your deeds, then hats off to you, you've earned you keeps. But do not for a moment ask for forgiveness. You are a shame to all evil doers. We do not ask for or give forgiveness. We face the consequences of our acts with a smile, and deal out vengeance with a grin.

I don't hate evils. I hate evils masquerading as repentant lost lambs.

Advice needed:
My patience has been running thin and I'm getting ridiculously emotional most of the time these days.
I'm so upset about the way some of my family members normalise the sub-human treatment of domestic helpers. For example, disallowing them from eating with us, or eating at the same time as us, or saying things like "they don't know how to eat this..." yes, because a grown human being don't know how to eat chicken meat. Or coca cola.
I'm so upset with them treating strays like dirt. There I am trying to save strays and I get things like "don't be so good hearted, no point one.", or "stop feeding strays because they're vermin.", or deliberately screaming and scaring them so they run away in fear.
I'm so upset with the way they think it's okay to lie, to manipulate, and to do such abhorrently ugly things like speaking the worse of people behind their backs while maintaining a friendly disposition when speaking to the said people.
Why is this world so ugly????

to the girl that caught me looking (more than once) at you while at the changi airport group booth today when we were each waiting for an available person to speak to. 

i just want to say you look really pretty dressed up! that was why i was kinda of 'mermerized' when i saw you. i even forgot what i wanted to ask when the CAG guy turned to speak to me.

i've seen you around campus once or twice, and everytime i'm like just 'wow'. 

stay pretty! :)

CNY fun fact: 恭喜恭喜 is a post-war celebration song.

"The music and words of the song are both by Chen Gexin (under the pen name Qing Yu) and it was written in Shanghai in 1945 to celebrate the defeat of Japan and liberation of China at the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War (World War II). The final lines of this song replicate the typical beat of the Chinese drum. An early popular recording of the song was by Yao Lee and her brother Yao Min.

Because its Mandarin title is also a common Lunar New Year greeting and the song celebrates the arrival of spring, it quickly became associated almost exclusively with New Year celebrations and remains a part of the season's musical canon. Contemporary versions of the song frequently appear on Chinese New Year musical collection albums, sometimes as electronic dance music performances and occasionally also feature lyrics in Taiwanese Hokkien and even English."

When I was young, I often heard voices calling me to "go NUS" while I'm in a deep sleep. After waking up, I would tell my mum excitedly, "Mummy! I got the same dream again!!" and my mum would say, " Then you must get good grades lor" .This motivated me to study hard because I believed that I'm destined to end up in NUS one day. 

Recently, at a family gathering. My aunties asked me why I chose to study in NUS. Therefore I proudly told them about my childhood dreams and how it inspired me to strive for academic excellence in order to come NUS.

But FUCKING HELL! My mum who was sitting at the corner suddenly burst into laughter and told everyone, " Sha bi ! Actually I'm the one whispering beside your ears while you are sleeping."

FML! That's when I realised that my whole life is a lie and my mum is the biggest troll in my life.

I hate my family and this is just one of the many incidents which made me hate them. Last year, my 2nd sis (PL) initiated to bring to my mum to Taiwan for an holiday with my relatives. After some discussions, we agreed to share the cost among us children. The estimated cost was 1000+dollars and I volunteered to pay up to 800dollars and they will pay the rest. When everything was finalised, the total cost of the trip/pax adds up to only about 700dollars. 

Few weeks before the departure date, PL told my 3rd sis (KL) that she didn't want to share the cost because she had to pay for herself and her daughter. She  told KL to divide the cost between the 2 of us. PL told KL an alternative which was to was to let me for the entire thing since I said that I could pay up to 800dollars. PL said, "你们出钱，我出力." KL came to me and told me what PL told her. KL said that it's unfair to share between the two of us only and said that she has her own family commitment and was only willing to pay like 100dollars. To save the squabbles, I told KL that I will pay for the entire trip since it was less than what I  estimated. 

Another few weeks later, I found out that PL went to botox her cb face and KL bought herself a bloody brand new chanel bag. I too have my own commitment, such as the tuition fees for studying part time NUS. Plus, I already don't mind paying more for my mum's holiday. Their behaviours totally disgusted me. I'm not going anywhere this cny because I don't want to see their cb faces.

There is nothing more hurtful and crushing than hearing your crush, whom you know you can never get to have the same feelings for you as you have for her, bring home some random guy from a night out and proceed to have sex for two hours straight. 

How do I know? Because they live literally two doors opposite of my room. And the walls are thin. 

It should have been me. Not some random dude. But you can't change free will can you? 

Heartbreak.

So recently I was having a meal with another guy (he's my superior and slightly older than me) for work-related matters. in the midst of the meal he took out his tissues to use then asked me if I wanted a piece before I politely accepted it. when he realised that I didn't bring my own he commented: "oh you don't have? you're a girl I thought all girls are the ones who will bring tissue paper." followed by "that's how life works"

I admit I haven't cultivated a strong habit in bringing my own tissue papers out, it'll slip my mind sometimes. (doesn't mean I don't clean myself up, I'll use the washroom or use the ones given with my meal) but that's not the point. 
point is, am I wrong to feel mildly offended by what he said? :/

Hi, can anyone share what's the real correct way to measure bra size?

The site I read said adding 4/5 to the band is actually wrong, and that the under bust measuremnt shld actually be the band measurement. Is that even legit? The idea of wearing a D is damn joke cos I'm so flat lmao

Today I watched EH and TH battle it out for the bball(F) championship title and here's just some feelings about it. 

1. I watched TH warm up and it really seemed like they were totally off form. Like basically nothing was going in even the lay ups weren't. At that time I really thought TH was a lost cause.
2. TH was playing quite badly initially, like the rebounds were just not being caught (both offensive and defensive) and there were so many bad passes but that's not what I'm here to say 
3. To TH , you played an excellent game. Your chemistry that you have with your teammates especially   and  is very clear on court. You might not have put in the most amount of points but your number of assists was extraordinary!
4. To TH , the look on your face when you made that 4th foul and got subbed out.. But more importantly, it's how you picked yourself up from there when you went it again and ensured you made no more fouls cause you know you don't wanna let your team down
5. To TH . Seriously the first time I looked at you, I was like this girl so white and looks so blur, can she even play ball? Thanks for proving me wrong haha. Could see you were really frustrated in the late 2nd quarter and started to get overly aggressive! You managed to keep your cool after that and your performance in the second half was just impeccable seriously! Your drive ins were so beautiful to watch!!
6. To TH . You were damn rash initially like you made the game too fast paced and that cause a lot of mistakes. But you managed to snap out of it and really your speed and defence earlier really impressed me!
7. And lastly to TH . To be really honest, I watched your previous game with EH and I was wondering why the coach still out you down cause you made quite a few mistakes there. But today was completely different, your footwork, your under basket shots and rebounds were damn good! Your weren't intimidated by your opponents and you showed them what you were made of, BRAVO!

I really think you guys deserve the win, so good job TH girls (and guys ah)!! 
To the Eusoff supporters, you can cheer for your team when they make a basket or they block a shot. You can cheer to encourage your team on, that is all perfectly alright. But please have some proper etiquette and don't cheer when the other side screws up. How can you say "good fall" and start clapping when  accidentally slipped and fell. How can you scream "YEAH NICE MISS!" when  missed her shot. That's just terrible and shouldn't be in the spirit of inter hall games.

I regret doing the following: start grinding my own beans, making my own coffee, buying artisan, single-origin, medium roasted Arabica beans, and using an Aeropress. Why? The coffee produced is so goddamn smooth, and pleasant that I can drink it straight without milk or sugar (I have never been able to do so), and I drink up to 3 cups per day (it's that good).

Now I can not drink normal kopi (bitter, dark roasted, and drown with condensed milk), Starbucks (old beans, and the coffee is drown in cream and milk), and most coffee chains.

I calculated that it cost me 75 cents per cup, based on coffee beans cost alone. The grinder costs 30 bucks; Aeropress 60 bucks, and a thermometer about 18 bucks (because the Aeropress require 80 degrees water).

Does anyone have this strange condition before? 2 weeks ago, I went for a swim and water went into one of my ears. It was so bad that I have problems hearing with my affected ear for the next 3 days. My hearing almost went back to normal until about a week ago, I started hearing crumbling paper sound in the same ear. It was so bad that even when I move my jaws slightly or when I am walking, I am able to hear that sound. My hearing was also affected by quite a lot in that same ear. However, there was no pain or itch in my ear. It has really affected me badly on my day to day task as well as emotionally. Is that an ear infection ?

Hi! Amidst all the angst on this page, I hope you'll allow me a little of your time so I can share something that really restored my faith in humanity today.

I'm a year 2 business student. I know that there are some stereotypes on how we can be rather focused on ourselves and only look out for number one. While I can't deny that there is some semblance of truth to that statement, it isn't always the case.

This morning it was raining (though not too heavily) and I was stuck at the bus stop opposite Heng Mui Keng. I decided to just run in the rain and hope my laptop and papers stayed dry. However after a few steps, someone tapped me on my shoulder and offered to share her umbrella. It turns out she was a year 4 student heading to school for a presentation. Yet she bothered to take time to shelter me, causing herself to get wet from the rain in turn. 

Just a little while after, I was having some trouble locating a seminar room in the basement. The first person I chanced across and asked for directions turned out to be another year 4 student. He was obviously heading somewhere, but when I told him the room I was looking for, he insisted on taking me there. He mentioned how he understood how difficult it was to find it because he was once lost before. 

To the two year4s - a huge thank you again!
To everyone else - thank you for taking time to read this. Don't underestimate the small acts of kindness you do every day. You never know when it might make someone's day:)

Read this touching story online...hope it helps those suffering from depression!

I was battling my worse case of depression yet and had started counseling and meds yet still did not feel like myself. I read that having a pet helps with Depression and since I have wanted a miniature schnauzer for many years I started looking at local shelter websites. I spotted a picture of a miniature schnauzer with big, sad, scared eyes one afternoon and immediately headed over to the shelter to see her. 

She was already 6 years old, a bit older than I planned yet something about those eyes. When they brought her out she was so scared that she would not even walk. She would not look at anybody and just laid there shaking more than I had ever seen a dog shake. I reached to pet her and she flinched. The poor girl had been picked up as a stray and God only knows the abuse that happened to her before coming to the shelter. She has a healed, broken tail and a toe that looks like someone tried to rip it off. 

I decided right there that I would take her. I held her close as I filled out the paper work and told her over and over that I am going to take good care of her. I called her Precious because those eyes reminded me of the Precious Moments dolls. I was able to bring her home the next day and she claimed the spot right next to me on the couch and always wants to be right next to me. She gets excited when I come downstairs in the morning and when I get home from work. 

The wounded, scared dog has evolved into an exuberant ball of fluff who wants nothing more out of life than my company and my depression has been replaced with the joy of having something that needs me and loves me unconditionally.

Hi everyone, I have a hypothetical situation. If you won some retail lucky draw while buying a birthday present on behalf of a group of friends, will you (be expected to) share your winnings with them? That is, you collected money from your clique to buy a gift for someone's birthday, but wrote down your own name on the lucky draw receipt  since only you did the errand of going down to the store to buy the gift. 

Should the hypothetical prize-money be shared or it okay to keep it all for yourself? What if it was a big sum of money like a car or a few hundred thousand dollars...

This puzzling issue has been weighing down on my chest for 2 years and I honestly need to seek brutally honest advice without being seen as a "troll". I'm in Y2S2 of biz school and I feel terribly weird and different from my "normal" peers-- because everyone else says that one thing I can't understand : that they have "no time"; that they are "busy". 

I'm so free and I'm so bored that I have time to do a part time internship and handle 2CCAs but still have an unusual amount of time on my hands. From the bottom of my heart, I want ask, why am I the one and only weirdo with this much time, what is everyone else doing with their time? Is there something mysterious that they are doing, that I'm not?! 

Mon: 
10-12: seminar 
12-1: lunch 
1-4: seminar 
4-6: seminar 
6-7: dinner
7-9: endless mindless scrolling on Twitter and Instagram not because I am "passionate" in any way about it but simply cuz I'm bored out of my skull? 
9-11: watch movie on daily motion 

Tuesday: 
9-6: internship 
6-7: dinner
7-11: hang  out with Friends like ice skate or watch movie 

Wednesday: 
8-10: lesson
10-12: nothing to do so I go back to my old unhealthy ways of scrolling my phone. Gosh why is everyone doing something else far better? 
12-2: lesson 
2-5: lesson
5-8: CCA
8-10: nothing to do so I watch more YouTube videos? 

Thursday: 
9-6: full day internship 
7-11: CCA stuff 

Friday: 
8-11: lesson 
11-2: more lessons 
2-6: late lunch while walking/window shopping around Clementi Mall/ VivoCity 
6-9: CCA
9-11: nothing to do again so I head to any library and read random books. 

Saturday: 
 10-2: CCA
2-7: hang out with friends who aren't "busy"(what r they busy with our time table is so free) 
7-11: continue scrolling Instagram since I've no life 

Sunday: 
10-12: teach tuition near my house 
12-7: Window shop in town not because I actually love shopping but because I've absolutely nothing to do 
7-9: teach another student tuition 
9-11: back to Instagram and Twitter? Like wtf why is everyone else too busy to even look at Instagram I honestly don't get one bit of it. 

Listen, I need help. I need to understand what is the unsaid/unseen activity everyone else is "busy" with such that they sleep so late. Everyone has the same modules, the same time table. Why am I cursed with so much tine I can't get rid of? 

Please don't troll or joke by saying I'm a time machine. I am not one. And I've already clearly listed my schedule for everyone to take a look. What is missing? 

Can one kind soul save me from this depressing and scary darkness? Just someone who'll knock some sense into me?

不禁觉得人与人之间的关系就犹如由细细的玻璃条牵系着，不但一样般的脆弱，而且一旦出现了裂痕，即使如何的尝试补救也不可能再次恢复到原状。当中更有一些裂痕是粉碎性的，无法修补而只好包囊着厚厚的保护层、尽量避开它，不让它继续恶化；只能不切实际地盼望它能随着时间的流逝慢慢地愈合。

有时觉得命运总爱安排一些巧合作弄人，最近发生的一件小事故竟然与恰好一年前发生的脆异般的相似，只是各方的反应都已淡化了。经过了整整一年的岁月，究竟是我们欣然地做出维持现状的决定，还是我们仍然被未能解开的心结紧紧牵制着？

You know the hairstyle where the sides of your head are shaved while your hair at the top is longer... is it called the undercut or something. Anyway it's been very popular the past few years, and a lot of guys around me have been switching to this hairstyle. 

I think it does look nice on some guys, but honestly, it doesn't really suit a lot of people. It doesn't suit you if your face is round or large, or has a long-ish shape, or your forehead is really high, etc. It fits on people with vertical temples, straight/wavy hair, and if the widest point of your face is at your temples. 

Of course, if you want to have that hairstyle, it is your freedom. Then my message doesn't apply to you. But if your goal is to look presentable and look "good" (whatever that means) with a suitable hairstyle that accentuates the good points of your facial features, please re-consider getting this hairstyle if it doesn't really fit your face shape. 

Guys. You don't have to follow trends to look good! Confidence in being yourself is sexy (-:

Erhem, those staying in RCs, pls roll down your blinds in your rooms to protect your privacy. The RCs are built so close to each other, I've seen lots of things from my windows. I swear this isn't intentional cos I moved my table to face outside instead of my wall. On any night, these are the daily things you can spot: couple making out on the bed, girl changing her bottom, girl with no top showing her boobs, totally nude guy doing push-ups, people sitting near their window ledges smoking etc etc. And no I'm no voyeur, cos I don't obtain any sexual gratification, just a sort of weird amusement on any random night.

Hello, I know it's a bit lag but I just watched the Arts Bash videos on Youtube. The guy in the daily juice video from 0:00 to 0:03 and 1:02 onwards is really cute and charming. The way he talks in the jeans stretch test video is really makes my knees go weak a little. *v* Hello to you if you are reading this. -waves shyly-

I saw this girl today and I think I fell in love. She was wearing a Ra'& Fla' t-shirt, long black hair, rectangular glasses and a pair of slappers on her feet. I think she does engineering and a few breath modules too. I saw her on the D2 bus at 10am. She was drinking a bubble tea and speaking Chinese. What do you think are the chances of us meeting again?

  THANK YOU !!! 
Btw it started from November not Dec .

Seriously the repair time is just getting ridiculous. If you're building a new gym then that's ok . But does floorwork repairing takes that long ?? Seriously it just pisses me off . I really like the environment and the equipment there so much that I prefer it more than Gymbox . 

Seriously OSA really needs to sort this out . If your repairmen are incompetent then u need to hire the correct people . The equipments has been outside for 3 months d . 
Gym is one of the basic facility that a uni provides . I'm just pissed that OSA doesn't take this matter seriously .

I was at a halal certified Indian restaurant when this incident took place. I witnessed a Muslim lady question two young Chinese girls for eating their Bak Kwa at a halal restaurant as they were waiting for their food to arrive. Strangely I thought nothing of it as well, until the Muslim lady questioned them. Have we really become this insensitive? Why do we let things like this slip our minds? What are your thoughts?

When I was 5 years old, I survived a shark attack.
It happened when I was swimming around the kelong at a  malaysia fishing village. For a short moment I thought I'm a deadmeat. Luckily an uncle came to my rescue. He stared at the shark with his pair of bloodshot eyes and told it to get lost. Amazingly the shark chicken out and ran away. Unfortunately, the uncle lost his right arm to the shark when he was shielding me from the shark attack. When we reach the shore, I cried so hard when I found out that his right arm is missing and he is bleeding profusely. But he simply laughed it off and place a straw hat on my head and told me, " This straw hat is a precious item to me, I shall entrust it to you. Return it to me one day, when you become powerful and famous". 

=(  I really miss uncle so much!! I must get stronger so that I can meet him again!!

I'm feel a bit weird when people mispronounce things. Eg. Gong cha.  For chinese, we all know that gong is pronounce in the fourth sound of Hanyu Pinyin. Yet, don't know who started saying it in the third sound. It's either you don't know how to pronounce properly or your chinese is not up to standard. 

Then people say pon lecture. For many of us who knows how to pronounce pon, similarly to Hanyu Pinyin, we say it in the third sound. Yet, people started using porn
 Eh want porn lecture or not. How do you porn a lecture?

just some thoughts: those who always say " wa, don't spoil bell curve leh, so hardcore." "wa, good student uh..", " wa, you hardcore sia.." " eh relax la, i haven't even started anything yet" "wa you don't come spoil market". VERY FAMILIAR RIGHT? honestly, I FEEL these are the people who are the real hardcore people or closet mugger. during consultation or really near exam, these people(maybe some) bring the whole textbook, completed. who is the hardcore one? are you saying all those things to provoke people ?or trying very hard to convince or stopping them to work hard so that you can secure your A or something? if you are those who are not hardcore at all or don't work hard at all, you won't even comment on other people. it's absolutely annoying to hear this EVERYDAY. hardworking is a good thing and it became something bad because of all these people. seriously, A for effort (trying to pull people). F for hands-on (to pull people).
another thing, please like.. JUST SIT DOWN IF THERE ARE SEATS ON THE BUS LIKE SERIOUSLY others can't even get up the bus. if you sit, others can take your place. it's so amazing to see empty seats and then i can't even get up the bus. please have the courage to sit ok, we won't stomp you. 
anyway, ya ikr, rip english. k, thats all, bye. #justsaying

I found a Bean & Pole wallet belonging to Ellen Sem (former Pharmacy student) this morning along Science Drive 4. It contains some money, multiple cards and a photograph of a baby boy. If there is any one who happens to know her, please relay this message to her and ask her to check her LinkedIn account (the only online contact I could find) to arrange a meeting with me so that I can return her wallet back. 

If I don't get a message by next week, I intend to hand the wallet to the Student Services Centre (Kent Ridge Campus).

Thank you for your attention. Please help spread the word.

Was at utown when I heard nus amplified. My subjective opinion, can the drums be softer? I know it's rock, but I feel a bit bad that the singers are straining to be heard over the loud drums. Did they amplify the drums? If they did,  it's better to not amplify. No matter what it is, be it rock or not, the whole point of a concert is to hear the songs and not only the drums.

Lost item:
It may seem like a petty thing, but last night at around 7 45 pm I forgot my red umbrella in TPSR10. I'd left it open at the back of the room to dry and this morning when I asked a friend to check, it was gone. Apparently the cleaners know nothing. So if it someone has picked it up, I'd like to have it back please. 
It's not terribly expensive, but nevertheless it was a gift from overseas. (They have these super cool umbrella vending machines in Hong Kong)
Please help. Thanks.

In my 4 years of studying here, I have never met a single rude person before. Until I met an aunty from the e-canteen in PGPR.

Once I gave her my order, and she asked having here or to go, and I replied, but she was hard of hearing and asked again extremely angrily, like, bordering on rage. Then she remarked to her colleague in front of me "这个人啊..."

WTF lady!? How was I supposed to know you are half deaf?

Aunty, if you didn't want any customers, you shouldn't have opened a shop where your source of income comes from customers. I don't care for your affordable goods, nobody likes to be insulted while waiting for our order to be served.

I’m in my first year of NUS. I’m Chinese, male and gay. I was 19 when I was raped.

At the time, I was new to the scene. I was naive to believe that people were inherently good. I was clubbing with two friends that night at Play when it happened. I lost them somewhere along the way in the crowd when this charming man, two years older than I was, came up to me and introduced himself. 

We talked, danced and had some drinks. Then, we left for the night. I wanted to find my friends, but he assured me that they were fine on their own. He offered a ride home which I accepted. I shouldn’t have. In the car, he started asking me strange questions — questions that made me feel uncomfortable. He drove us to somewhere strange and foreign, somewhere unrecognizable; there, he asked me to blow him. I refused. He persisted, and when he was done asking, he forced himself on me. I tried to fight my way out of the struggle, but after awhile, I gave up. He was physically stronger than I was. I lost all fight in me that night and I let him have a go. When he was done, he said, “I know you wanted it, you fucking slut.” and told me to get out of his car.

I walked an hour, maybe more, before I got on a main road and hopped onto a taxi for the journey home. I got in the shower and looked at myself in the mirror. There were visible bruises on my body and my neck. I cried so much that night as the water ran over my sore body. I felt unclean and ruined. Like something - a core part of who I was - was forcibly taken away from me that night.

It’s been slightly over two years since. I never told anyone, not even my friends, what happened that night. I feel ashamed.

He made me fear intimacy. He made me feel like I’m unworthy.

And unlovable.

I dealt with the situation the best way I could, but today, I saw that guy on campus. He was with friends. I wanted to go up to him, shame him and tell him how much he’s ruined my fucking life. I wanted to kick him in the face, see him bleed and beg me for forgiveness. I don’t know what’s becoming of me. I’m so angry at him, but mostly at myself. 

I feel like I’m back to where I was when I was 19. Like nothing has changed, but everything has. Does that even make sense? 

For the last four months, I've been talking to someone new. A cute Malay boy whom I see a future with. I know at some point, he'll want us to be intimate.

But I don’t know how to be intimate again.

This is a story about love. But it doesn't have a happy ending, and if that is what you are looking for, then perhaps you should stop reading this now.

It was a classic tale of boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Boy loves her back. Until shit hit the roof. But we will get to that shortly. Ironically, it all begun in the most cliche way possible; there I was sitting down at a starbucks with my order of skinny soy latte with extra whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon, when I heard a laugh. It was the kind of laugh that came from the belly, hearty and loud, filled with joy. I look up and find a glorious specimen of a man laughing at something his friend had just said. His teeth were so white, he could have appeared on the ad for some teeth whitening product. Little did I know that this moment was going to a pivotal moment in my life. (One never knows how important a single moment can be, until one looks back in hindsight.)  I would have normally looked away, but there was this insane crazy pull towards him that I couldn't explain, so I kept looking.

You know how when you keep staring at someone, they are bound to pick up on it and will look up too? Yea, that happened. And suddenly he was looking at me. I cannot explain what happened. But you know gravity? It was kind of like that. I felt myself being pulled into his orbit, and I knew instinctively that we would forever spin around one another until one of us got pulled into a black hole.

Life can be so cruel. There he was, in his red teeshirt with some obscure band name splashed on it stretched across his well sculpted chest, with really deep eyes that seemed to suggest that he had tonnes of secrets, and with the sunlight playing around his hair like a halo, he looked like some sort of Adonis who had decided to graciously spend some time among mere mortals. Me, I looked a colossal mess.

So you can imagine my shock when he got up and walked over to my table, sat opposite me and started conversing as if we had known each other our whole lives. Seriously, which planet was he from? Surprisingly, I found myself talking to him and before I knew it, we were laughing together and it was as if we had bonded over something inexplicable.

Continued from   
Part 2
I really don't know why we clicked. I have spent a lot of time trying to think of how we could have connected so easily. We were strangers and then we were friends. Immediately. It freaked me out to be honest. But he was like a hurricane and I was swept up in his ferocity. When he spoke, his eyes would light up and his lips would curl up into a half smile. You just couldn't help but get caught up in his stories. I found myself laughing out loud at his crazy stories of his recent adventure in Thailand. About how he got into a scooter accident and had needed to get stitches at a shoddy clinic. "You want to see the scars? I ripped out the stitches myself!" Before I could say anything, he had already lifted his legs to show me the scar running along his calf. What a strange thing to do in the middle of Starbucks but somehow it felt completely okay to me.

"Do you want grab dinner?"

And that was how I found myself eating chicken rice with him and he was feeding me from his plate, leaning across the table to share with me some chicken from his fork. Is this even normal? Now, you must  understand this about me. I am a pretty much a wallflower. Someone who has spent her whole life being in the background, buried under all the books. Basically, I was a nerd. Guys have always seen me as a dude rather than a girl, and they certainly never fed me food. So why was this specimen, being friendly and all nice with me? I wasn't sure what was going on. But I found I couldn't walk away either.

Just as I thought that the night was over and that we should head back (I really wanted to finish an assignment I was working on), he says," I want to show you something."  He said it so matter of fact with so much confidence that I would follow him without a fight, and that was exactly what happened. "Okay." Even though we had just met, a part of me trusted him completely.

We take the bus and end up at the engin campus. I have never done any modules there before so I wasn't exactly sure where we were going. It was the white building, tlab or something, and we walked in the darkness, his laughs and mine intertwining together. We end up at the floor with a lot of windows that stretched across from one side to the other. The view was breathtaking; the stars were spread out in front of us, twinkling like lampposts from a far away city and it felt like we were the only two people alive in the world.

He takes out his phone, plays some indie music and starts to dance! I stand still, watching him making crazy moves. "You have to dance," he shouts at me from across the room. "I don't know how!" He just gives a smile, runs across the room, grabs my hand and starts spinning me around. I am so taken aback, I can do nothing but burst into laughter. We keep spinning, round and round the room. Soon, I am dizzy! Both from laughing and from the spinning.

We stop and collapse onto the floor. I find myself nestled against him and he hugs me closer to him. I can feel his heart beating against his chest. It's just as fast as mine. The only strange thing about this was how natural everything felt.

For a while we just stayed like that while his music continued to play. Then it was as if a switch was flipped and I could feel the air around just charge up. I look towards him and he was already looking back. It felt as if he was peering into my soul and for the first time, it was as if someone was seeing me for who I was - cracks, nerd, and weirdo - and he wasn't afraid of it.

For my first kiss, I thought it was pretty good. There were no fireworks when I closed my eyes, nor did my toes curl as all the harlequin romance has touted in my teenage years. But it did feel like coming home. His fingers twined around mine, and we just stayed together for a while. Breathing together. And somehow that was enough.

TBC [ sorry, I am writing in parts because just thinking about everything that has happened still tears me up inside.]

Last semester my LSM module had a green-haired girl. She looked somewhat meh in reality, as if her ponytail was a paintbrush.

This semester my LSM module has a gold-haired girl. Also a ponytail. This time, she looks even weirder, as if she was trying to stripe her hair like a zebra, except that it is black and gold.

I asked around and found out that she was pregnant before from a party gone wrong, according to a friend. Apparently, it was a drinking party where she got happy and high on cider and loose with one guy and 1 + 1 became 3.

I see lots of buff guys in NUS. Guys can share how to get a nice body (eg how to workout, what's the diet). I never go gym before so how to start?
-
 
I don't understand why some people's idea of getting fit is being buff. Sure, you got the right sets of aesthetic muscles which can allow you to bench a truck or squat a bus. But do these exercise really make you physically fit overall?

I am in a sport where the advantage goes to the leaner person. My bmi has never gone past 19 for as long as I can remember. The most important muscle in your body, is your heart.

I hope you got to your destination safely and maybe manage to board the lift next time (if failing to was the reason you were climbing in the first place)

Not sure if this is the first time for such post but I just feel really annoyed that the NUS shuttle bus drivers are so impatient. A few of us strangers were waiting at opp NUSS bus stop for D1 but the driver just zoomed past without even looking. Didn't even get a chance to wave and he's gone...

And the bus drivers look like they're permanently pissed with their jobs. Lets have a happier working environment in NUS eh?

My family owns two cars. I was bored so I decided to try a social experiment. One night at abt 12am, I drove the small car arnd nus campus and honked at girls doing their night runs. I got angry glares and few middle fingers. The next night at arnd the same time, I drove the Merc E2000 and honked again. This time the girls smiled and waved. Some even gestured for me to roll down my window. Never realised how superficial girls are. Heh. And yes I know, I have too much time.

Seriously guys, stop peeing on the toilet seats and floor. This type of behaviour is not appropriate for the civilised age and it belongs to some bygone era together with spitting in public places and not queuing up properly for the MRT. Looking at you pgpr floor mates.

Peeing on seats is quite an anti-social behaviour. You are like the person who spoils it for the rest of us like certain old Chinese couples who let their child with open crotch pants shit on public trains, or like gum chewers who stick their gum on train doors which led to the nation-wide ban on chewing gum.

Curse you toilet seat pee guy, curse you to a hell that smells like pee and where the toilet seats are permanently covered with a layer of dried sticky pee residue and where the rain is made of pee.

Martial arts and practicality. First: martial arts has the root from "Mars", meaning the Roman God of War, so martial arts = art of fighting in War. However, if you argue about the "practicality" of martial arts, you are not looking at the right thing.

Second, how you train affect how to fight. In a high stress situation, such as fighting, you lost the ability to think clearly. If you read testimonies of people under firefights or combat, really weird things happened to them. The most common thing is in the heat and stress of combat, your rational mind shut off and you are basically a robot operating from muscle memory. Where does your muscle memory come from? Training.

Third, "train as you would fight" is a common motto. But this is harder than you think. "Training scar" is a term in the firearms training world. It refers to things you do in training that is ingrained in your reflex and adversely affect your ability to do combat. One of the most famous example is the training drill with revolvers. Many cleanliness-obsessed range masters demanded people to dump their spent case in to their hands and put it in their pockets. Then people found dead cops with brass in their hands and pocket. You do not do that in real firefights, yet training scars do that to them.

So what does this has to do with martial arts. The most heavy contacts you get from training in most martial arts today is to don protective equipment and spar. The sparring rule varies from sports to sports. But the general rule is whoever land a hit first wins. Some forms of sparring also concern with counter hits, for eg, after you land a sword cut, you must immediately retreat or cover yourself from a return hit. Kendo is one of the worst if your intention is to train for real combat: shout where you will land the blow, you can only hit 3 targets: head, shoulder, belly (and sometimes throat). You can't hit the hands (despite being one of the easiest place to be hit, given that Japanese sword don't have handguards). Sparring in most unarmed sports is misleading for combat training, in most situations, a single hit isn't going to knock anyone out. If you watch MMAs, bouts frequently ends with people on the ground wrestling.

But do you even want to wrestling with someone in a self-defense combat scenario? Well, it depends. If both of you wear armor, it's the most reliable way to put someone out. But if it's a street fight, it's something of dubious use why? I read an anecdote of a self-defense instructor. He was sparing with a guy twice his size. The big guy pinned him down, then got his throat slashed by a hidden knife the smaller one produced out of no-where. The big guy widened his eye with shock. A spectator spoke up: "He pinned you down first, so you lost". To which replied "I slit his throat". "No, but he pinned you down first". When you do combat sports, sometimes you forgot the lethality of a strike.

The real objective for self-defense by my definition is to escape with the least injury. You identify danger and avoid it. If not possible, fight back and escape. The stress is on escaping. what you want is to fight back just enough to get away, not having a fair punch out. It's not gonna happen, a fair fight that is.

Anyway, my point is most martial arts today is more aptly named: combat sports. They are not really suitable for real fighting. In any case, training for real fighting stresses simple technique. The US Marine Corps teaches bullrush or prison yard rush for knife fight: use one hand to distract and the other stab the other guys 20 times. Some other guys teaches holding a heavy, hard object, like a flashlight, a heavy pens, or a rock in the icepick grip and beat the other guy in the face a few times then run away.

And this is how real knife attacks pan out

In short, they are really nasty work. Not even guns are 100% enough.

如果你真的喜欢一个人，是不知不觉的。感谢那辆车，搭住她肩的那一刻，我第一次发现，心，可以跳这么快。怕她误会，所以不想说太多。不知道为什么，那一天到最后，她好像不太开心。原来喜欢一个人，当你看到她走向她喜欢的人，才突然发现，你对她很坏只是为了想跟他更靠近一点。她说的每一句话，你都会放在心上。‘我们说没事，就是有事。没关系，就是有关系’。
原来喜欢一个人，会没有勇气告诉她。那天晚上，我像流星许愿，希望她的愿望里也有我，即使我知道，能让她快乐的，是另一个人。

我会遇到那样的人吗？

Top make-out spots in NUS that my partner and I had been to:

- NUS Central Library rooftop (or the place where they hang banners, if door is locked, can easily climb over railings)
- Arts department offices (some don't lock)
- Yusof Ishak House (really quiet at night and on weekends; we did it in one of the CCA rooms)
- SDE block classrooms

Part of me is still looking for a good dark anime after Yu-Gi-Oh, but all my friends talk about are gudetama and saitama. Even the current Yu-Gi-Oh has turned into a kids' show.

Anyone has dark anime to recommend? Only when one understands the power of darkness can one appreciate light...

The MRT map in Singapore used to be a joke with the circle line being an incomplete circle and the downtime line having only 6 stations. Now, with 18 stations on the DTL, it looks much nicer on the map

Not sure what are the chances but really want to just try my luck! I lost my wallet yesterday at coney island. The brown wallet contains my nus student card, ezlink, atm card, nametag, some cash. However there are many polaroids inside which is why I really want my wallet back! If anyone happens to be visiting coney island, please do help to keep a lookout! Hope some nice souls will return it if they found them

I wish I have a seriously hot and delicious fwb so we can make out all over the campus. Making out in between the bookshelves in clb while I stroke his nice huge biceps and his hand cupping my butt. Touching under the tables while we're in lecture. Being playful with our tongues at the utown rooftop garden at wee hours of the morning. Yummy :)

I'm wondering. I hardly liked any singers nowadays. Then I was introduced to fantasy music and never left since then. It's albeit a little sad that I cannot go sing karaoke anymore because I hardly keep up with the latest songs. I first learnt that this genre is still alive when I searched for The Hobbit soundtracks after watching The Hobbit movie. Then when steam had sales, I purchased Skyrim and was absorbed into the fantasy. I had also previously played similar RPG games.

Things spiraled upwards. Through Youtube, I found many various artists who still specialize in fantasy music. There, I expanded the genre- exploring celtic music, folklore and the likes. I shall not list the artistes I know because I would be giving myself away to people who know me. I never turned back to mainstream music, hardly listened to radio in search for a new song every time I got bored of my old ones. I could never get bored of almost any fantasy song. In fact, I listen to one of my most favorite song almost everyday but I still love it when it comes on during shuffle. Moreover, they are ideal for studying: they prevent me from singing the lyrics and are uplifting and motivational. When I am feeling down, I loved to listen and imagine to be in the fantasy world as the music depicts. However, it is saddening that not many people do appreciate such genre. 

I hope someone out there has the same interests as me! Comment if you do.

It was raining and I was walking back to raffles hall from EA when I heard a girl talkin on the phone behind me. She had a very cartoonish tone in her voice so I was quite intrigued and I turned. And holy she is a freakin petite cutie pie. Being gentlemanly as I am, I offered to shelter her to wherever she wanted to go and I enjoyed the awkward silence between us as we walked from EA to utown. (I insisted on sheltering her all the way to utown although there is the shelter walkway). She thanked me after that and ran off before I could ask for her name..I have not seen her in school ever since then..:( bye cute engine girl

I was in the public library just now and there was a man in front me and he was using his phone with the camera facing me. He kept stealing glances at me and darting his eyes back to his phone when I looked at him. I felt very uneasy. There was another girl sitting behind him who walked up to me and asked if I knew him. I told her I don't. Then she said he had been taking photographs of me. It's not like I am eating or kissing in the library and deserved to be STOMPED. So we confronted him but he denied it.Then he walked away saying that I "think too highly of myself." -_- I feel Singapore should make it illegal for phone cameras to not have a shutter sound effect while taking photos.  South Korea has already enacted this rule. I don't see why we can't do the same.

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath.

But I think I found the solution to the problem of not having the opposite gender to approach you.

I haven't had so many people approaching me for pictures. Till today. I guess they'd have asked for my number if I actually do look as if I own a phone.

I swear some people need to take some sort of module to teach people to not piss on the toilet seats and on the floor before they are allowed to stay at a hostel. Looking at you pgpr floor mates. 

I dunno man, the toilet bowl is a pretty big target, you must be quite bad at using your dick if you're going to piss on the floor instead. And why piss on the seats, don't you have to, i dunno, fucking SIT on them?

Well if you are one of those who prefer squatting types, then good on you for finding a way to piss off the toilet bowl types then.

Has anyone ever felt so lazy that staying alive feels like so much of a bother? Like, I have to get up and eat, man. I wish I was immortal, so I didn't have to eat. Or breathe, or drink... but drinking should be optional because I like 7-up.

No, I'm not depressed or suicidal or anything. Just lazy. Very, very lazy. I would sit in front of my computer and play games all day if I could, except I have a school I have to go to. Such a bother!

I wish I was a cat, they don't have to do anything except be cute.

Hey OP of  I once struggled with body image issues, and am still struggling now. I used to have beautiful clear skin on my legs, but after an eczema outbreak, it left me with scars. 

In the past I was always trying to cover the scars up by wearing long pants and jeans, and felt ashamed and embarrassed.  But my aunt shared with me some wise words. She said, those people who had to have their limbs amputated, they aren't trying to hide the fact that they lost their limbs. Neither are they ashamed of their scars. I had a pair of strong, long and able legs, yet I'm ashamed of them. How much they would give, to be able to exchange for a pair of good legs again. And from then I kept reminding myself, to be thankful for what I have. 

Hey girl, keep your head up high. Beauty comes from within, and it radiates out. As long as you are confident, people around you can feel it :) be thankful for what you have, think of those victims of burn injuries, people with congenital illness such that it hurts to even put on clothing for them. I know, it's tough to show your skin to the world, where we have a certain perception of beauty. But listen, you are beautiful. The beauty which comes from within, is the most precious of all :)

Since I was 12, I had some problems with the skin on my back and shoulders that's only gotten worse over the years. I've gone to see so many skin specialists and they only tell me one thing: Chemical peels. For that, I've to fork out ~$1300, which I don't have at all. Any money I earn goes to paying the bills since I am the breadwinner of my household.

It really pains me when I walk around school and see other girls in these beautiful sleeveless blouses. I too have desires to dress up like that, especially for formal events, but I simply can't. I did get stares and even worse, questions when I had the courage to wear sleeveless and bared-back tops in the past. I have done some treatment on my back but it not only didn't work, it left me broke and I felt so guilty, so irresponsible that I used money necessary for my household on myself. 

I know it's a bit of a useless rant, but sometimes I do lock myself in the toilet and wonder how anyone but a mother could still see this and tell me I am beautiful.

Hi, I was recently diagnosed with genital herpes and I just want to warn others that even condoms cannot protect you from STDs. Genital herpes is incurable and can spread through skin-to-skin contact (mainly near your genitals) even when there are no visible symptoms like sores or blisters. Please abstain from casual sex, even if your friend is hot as hell and you are staying in the same hall... I suspect that some students here with multiple sex partners are already infected so if you wish to continue, please at least inform your partner of your lifestyle.

Hi, I need some help! I lost my glasses last night and probably left it along the walkway connecting CLB to Engineering (picture attached). Basically, it is likely along here or on the benches outside LT3 and LT4. Would much appreciate if anyone found it could comment here. It is a blue pair of spectacles with a transparent kind of crack in material on the left edge iirc.

Today I met a girl on the train. She's really gorgeous, she looked kinda like Gigi Lai, the HK actress. I really wanted to talk to her, and get her number. But before I did anything, she alighted. It was almost like love at first sight, I looked at her and we exchanged eye contact for awhile, and she smiled to me awkwardly. I returned the smile, but she had to alight at the next stop. Hope that I'll meet you again, love

Some people are so selfish as to buy the course reading/novel from the co-op for their leisure reading even when they're not doing the module.

Why is there a restricted access to Yale-NUS College Library after 6pm? The gates and fences around their campus reminds me of North Korea. Imagine if we banned Yale-NUS College people from leaving their North Korea Campus after 6pm! This practice is anti-liberal. Kapish?

On my way to utown, I passed by a scene that caught my tiny Asian eyes. Your brown tanned skin was tantalizing, it reminded me of dry plants and I wonder whether you are ever green. My mind conjured images of us frolicking in the pristine blue waters, me rubbing your wrinkled skin till a spark is triggered.  The sound of the evening  breeze caressing your hair is like music to my ears. I wanted to plant seeds of love into you.  Your sheer beauty  leaves me in awe, rooted to the spot. 

P/s: I love you, Tree.

Hi everybody. I would just like to ask how many rounds of Dota can one play in a day before it's considered an addiction? My boyfriend plays 8-10 rounds everyday (I counted) and I think he's addicted but he doesn't lose sleep or not eat over playing Dota. He doesn't skip lessons and still goes out for lunch with me. However, he does at times gives up his social life/plans with his friends in order to play more Dota although he claims to be playing with his friends. I asked him about it and whether or not he thinks it's an addiction and he says he's playing a normal amount but I think it's a borderline case and yet at the same time I'm not entirely sure.

Please don't leave comments such as "at least he's playing Dota and not cheating on you" or jokes/funny comments about his mms as I am really worried. Any advice is appreciated, thank you!

Someone just stole my iphone. It's white and gold and has a pink Sakura flower case. It is reflective in the front and back. I lost it at approximately 3.55 - 4pm, at the water dispenser on level 4, med library building. I tried calling it and it has been turned off. I have reported it to the security guard at the medical library building. Whoever lost it, do return it before you are embarrassed.

 Hi Xiao Mei, Friendly Medicine advice. Get yourself checked for goodness sake. Kelatan lane clinic is your good buddy :) alternatively, i offer medical check ups but then again, maybe not.

Haizzzz... 3 hours break is so freaking boring, since I got a lot of free time, Xiao Mei is going to share with you another grandmother story of mine.

This incident happened when I'm in secondary 2. One fine day, while I was in my room, watching some western porn and pleasuring myself. My mum opened the door suddenly and caught me in the act. Her eyes widened in disbelief and she ran forward to grab my head violently and proceeded to mess up my hair. She got so agitated and kept spamming questions at me, "Darling! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? YOU ARE A GIRL! ANSWER ME!".

I couldn’t recover quickly from the shock while my mind simply blanked out. I sank into an emotional breakdown and I cried non-stop and kept apologizing to my mum like mad! Worse of all, my dad forced me to copy and recite some traditional Confucianism book that teaches 三从四德  ("Three Obedience and Four Virtues for Women" ). Woah bitch! I swear! Shoving a 10 inches black dick down my throat is so much more bearable compared to using that Chinese scroll to deep-throat me.

Until now, the sentence that hurt me the most is, "You are a girl". If time can be reverse, I wish that I can be braver at that point of time and stand up against my mum to defend my feminist ideology. As I grew older, I began to realise that sex isn't just a tool for procreation nor it is exclusive to only one trusted party.  Sex is an important communication tool, moreover our genitals are bridges that connect our inner souls with the opposite party. Only when I'm having sex, I can sense love, warmth and feel more like a human being. Different man gives me different experiences, in the sense that everyone has different way of expressing love and care. I don't feel that having different dicks penetrating my pussy makes me un-pure or dirty. Because my vagina is not a drainage system, it doesn't get choke by cum and get polluted. Guys who view girl's vagina as some "lang gao", should really receive one tight slap in the face from Xiao Mei.

I won't share this if I need to put my name to it,only anonymously. I would like to discuss something really,really,really odd about my sense of smell. I am extremely sensitive to smells and I have summarized all the weird patterns I concluded during my time in Uni. 

1. Every semester, exactly 2 weeks before exams approach, two singaporean friends of mine would start having the exact  same bad breath at exactly the same time. Both smell like rotten and damp walnuts mixed with sour butter. That's the most vivid and detailed way I can put it across. Both emit the same smell. And surprisingly, both friends end their bad breath as soon as the exams are over. 

2. I have also noticed a creepily accurate yet inexplicable pattern: all the classmates who have just come to Singapore emit the EXACT SAME BREATH: it smells like rotten cabbage. I have spoken with 30++ people from the same country,and all 30++ of them have the same breath. 

3. Now let me talk about my family. I don't want my identity to be unearthed as this will hurt those closest to me. Both my parents have the same morning breath. It smells like rotten raw meat and at times it smells like the rotten vegetables at the wet market. It's so overpowering that I can stand at a distance of 1m and still smell it. 

Also, every time my grandparents fart, it smells eerily similar. It smells like poached egg and sausages. This,out of all the smells I described in alarmingly vivid detail previously, is the most delicious one. I have never found the farts or breath of anyone to smell good but the egg and sausage smell is a definite Gem. 

I can't share this at the dinner table with anyone. But I really need to see if there's anyone who thinks alike. I need someone who'd listen and share.

Looking at , I'm glad I'm not the only one looking at Yale-NUS students with distaste. They make noise over us using their library while they get virtually free rein over our facilities, and now they complain about our home as well. This is totally the definition of "ungrateful", and definitely more than slightly unfair to us "regular" NUS students.

Hi everyone =) . I'm a carefree year 2, NUS student. You guys can just address me as Xiao Mei from today onward. 

In the near future, I will be contributing my life stories to rectify societal views on casual sex, which are usually misleading and judgmental. 

So yeah... I shall proceed to tell you a bit more about my life experiences.

During my primary school years, unlike most girls around me, my sexual maturity level is high as fuck. When I'm primary 5, I gave my first blowjob to a secondary 2 guy at a HDB multi-story car park. Well... I didn't do it, in exchange for money. The act was committed solely in the name of curiosity. Hmm.. that guy is quite cute too! But sadly we lost contact after that incident, because we are strangers to begin with. My departing words are "hey yeah! Catch you around some other time okay!" and we went separate ways. However the fun was short-lived, soon some CB-kias found out about it and the news of me blowing someone’s dick, spread like wildfire. People started calling me a slut, bitch etc. 

This incident caused me to experience first-hand gender discrimination and turned me into a absolute feminist. Even in today's society, just because a woman has multiple fwbs doesn't mean that she is loose! Girls like me have a strict set of standards/criteria when accepting fwbs. We don't simply spread out our legs to any tom, dick and harry.  I do reject a lot of weirdo  in my everyday life. 

Lastly, I can't tolerate guys who don't respect women. There was once, when a certain prick told me about the "master key- lock" analogy. I got so damn pissed that I poured a cup of water on his pants, right at his private part area and left in a hurry. Moral of the story, "WOMEN are not sex tools, even if we accept fwbs, that doesn't give you any rights to judge or condemn us. Don't view us as pieces of meat that should be owned by someone, because we belong to ourselves and nobody else".

Arghhh! It's getting late, having morning class tomorrow. Panda eyes liao T.T Good night.

Regarding religions and BGR. 

Having a religion is like having a penis,

It's okay to have one but not okay to shove it down people's throat. (when they don't want it, even you think its okay, or someone/something said that is normal/acceptable)

因为我们曾经真的爱过，所以再也不能当朋友了。

Do you remember the night we went star glazing? You pointed to the brightest star in the night skies and told me, “If one day, I can no longer be by your side, this star will become your guardian angel and light up the path ahead of you". Whenever you are right beside me, I felt secured because your warmth washed away all my past scars. You taught me many important lessons that changed my attitude towards life, I cried lesser and became a little braver. However, I knew our secret relationship had an expiry date, I kept the fact that I'm attached, hidden from you. 

I can totally understand why you will always avoid me when we crossed path. It is me, who is responsible for planting those seeds of hatred into you. Till today I still couldn't forgive myself for leading you on. Truth to be told, you are always the brightest star I want to grab hold on and keep it with me forever, however watching your back view disappearing from my sight is the most befitting punishment for a bad person like me.

Only time can heal our wounds, hope you have found the right girl so that you can tell her how hopeless I am and how lucky you are to find a better girl like her.

I'm so afraid of term starting. I'm a Year 2 crippled by social anxiety; in the past few terms I've found myself suffering from minor panic attacks and waves of nausea whenever I'm in a crowd or classroom setting. When I think about having to wade through students excited about getting to class I feel my stomach sink and my head start to spin. I want to attend lessons and learn but I can't be around people or I'll start having delusional thoughts about everyone judging me and end up frozen in a corner covered in cold sweat. I guess this sounds like an exaggeration but it's a reality for me -- I've spent so many days last term all ready to head out the door and get to class only to be plunged into a state of fear. I need professional help, but that means exposing myself to the judgemental gazes of everyone else and the disappointed faces of my parents. I know they'll all eye me with disgust and call me an ingrate. At least my thoughts here are anonymous... :/

There are a few ways to make going to school a good experience. First, increase the frequency of buses. Yes it's been brought up, but somehow there isn't a significant increase. Second, I don't care if the bus uncle play his chinese music or classical music. Just play music on the bus. Third, repair the bus "stop" buttons. The uncles and us sometimes don't even know if got people press or not. Some buttons don't even have buttons. Also, let there be more buttons. Sometimes all the buttons are being blocked by either a person's arm or another person's armpit, and when you try to get their attention and press the bell, they will give you the face. That's all.

About one and a half year ago, when I was sick, you noticed something was amiss when I did not turn up for the gathering. Concerned, you were the only one who went back to our rooms and called my name. I whimpered your name back in agony. You asked if I'm alright. I did not want you to miss the gathering, so I told you I took my own medicine already and probably just need a good rest. Still unassured, you left and asked my fellow roommates to take care of me. 

Now whenever I'm sick, I would call your name and imagine you coming over to check if I'm alright. I would stretch out my hand to grab on to thin air and remember the comfort and warmth of your hands. I would stare into blank space, as if looking in to your concerned eyes. And then when I realized its just nothing but memories, I would wipe away the tears streaming down my face. Because, I still can't face the fact that you left me long ago.

Just checked in my residential college this morning. It feels sad to realize that I only have three semester left in NUS, and will have to leave this school after that. How time flies.

This may not sound related to NUS life but some NUS students watch their childhood movie, Star War, and some watch Digimon Adventure Tri. Hence, I feel that this post is related to NUS life

Anyone still watch Power Rangers, Super Sentai or Kamen Rider?

Which is your favorite season?
My favourite Power Rangers seasons is Power Rangers in Space.
In fact, Power Rangers in Space is top of the list in the WatchMojo video Top 10 Power Rangers Seasons.
My favorite Kamen Rider Season is Kamen Rider Gaim

Laoniang be like WAH. THIS ONE GOOD SIA.

But for real #laobu where are you ah? Laoniang wants to know how her tu di has been faring in the dating world.

Shit really hit the roof tonight. He never thought he would crumble under the tremendous amount of pain experienced a week ago in addition to tonight's event.

He walked away, tears once again escaping his steel eyes. There was not even a single person he could confide to any more. He had no one. Have you ever realised that everything you once fought for no longer had a meaning? And you wanted to turn somewhere but there's no where to turn to?

He wandered to the beach. The night was too stale. He thought of giving up. He wanted so badly for someone to walk up to him and tell him everything would be alright. No one came. No one could see the light gone from his eyes. Even if they could, who would give a shit. He was almost gone.

ya..ya 

If you have a close friend...a love one. Never ever let them go.

Even if I don't need that mod you wanted, I'm gonna dump all my points into it just because I can, and drop it later. Because it's time you people get a taste of your own medicine, show-handers.

I really hates it whenever my mum forces me to adopt her conservative ways. I love cutout shirts and dresses as well as crop tops. While I'm still young, I would like to wear them out which I know I won't if I ever grow fatter in the future. Wanted to get this dress today and when my mum saw it she just straight out reject and gave me a lecture about how I should not show skin. I'm not saying that I'm super skinny, perhaps about average. Really sick and tired of all these. Before you judge me, this is not the only issue present. There are other issues as well such as her complaining that I have been going out way too often. I feel restricted, controlled even though I am already an adult.

Anyone joined NUS boxing or muaythai before? Is it too violent and weird for a girl to join these CCAs on a recreational basis. 
-
 
Just a random post though. Is there any CCA in NUS that offers Wing Chun classes? I kinda got interested in it after watching Ip Man 3 (to the extend of whenever I come across any martial art moves, I would immediately think 'ip man wing-chun). P.S. Pardon my engrish xD

Recently there are some confessions about not wishing to go for commencement. You guys are being too much of a narcissist. Your parents/guardians painstakingly supported you through your education, the commencement is really for them. A ceremonial tribute of sorts to your beloved parents, if I may. And it's not the same if you treat them to a meal/trip to thank them, because you can't thank them enough.

 Are you saying we should therefore go holiday in search of girl? And must go for high-density places?

Something happened tonight that left me fuming. A friend of mine gave me a box of chocolates as a belated Xmas present. But I hated chocolates, and I told him that and rejected the gift. He then said he would throw the gift if I don't take it as he already have "lots of chocolates" at home. I told him go ahead, and he really threw a perfectly good box of chocolates that could easily be given to other people. It was nicely wrapped too, not just some cheapo chocolates you get for two dollars.

At first, I was just angry that it was such a waste of food. I don't regret not taking it from him because I really hate chocolates. But then I think about it, I wonder if he is doing that purposely right in front of my face for something more sinister. I wonder if he actually want me to pick it up from the rubbish bin, or make sure I 'learned a lesson' to not reject his gift or he would throw it away (like a fucking threat). When I asked him if that was his motive, he actually said "Hmm, idea,", as if that fucking motive was worth considering. I asked him if he regret his actions, and he repeatedly said he didn't like the sociopath he is. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. Fuck, I just need to rant this shit.

Last week I saw a girl in the bus stop at UTown. She looks cute, with long and smooth hair. Then I came and ask for her number, just to make friend.

You know how she behaved? She shouted at my face: "Whatttt?", and waved her hand like I was bothering her too much!

Too bad!

Maybe the cause lay in my appearance. Yeah, cheap shirt, cheap jean, flip-flop,...

But, I wonder how she will behave if she knows some truth:

- If she knows I am a prince (I think she should know if she usually watches News Asia).

- If she knows despite my cheap clothes; the necklace I wear is not a normal necklace, it is a limited Cartier made for my family.

- If she knows the guy who ask for her number drives a Bentley to school. But he took bus to go to UTown instead, for the convenience.

- If she know I can call Cara Delevingne but her.

The thing is, I just want to make friend, and see how friendly you are. So, if you are nice, I can take you to my castle for a visit. What's wrong with it? Is a phone number too much for you?

Next time, I hope I can meet a nice friend!

Is our generation really most of them under credit cards debt?

I was buying something at funan buying something then infront of the queue was this late 20s or 30s young man probably not far from me.

He was buying a notebook for about $700+ as I overheard I stand to be corrected. He has try to swipe both two credit card and the salesman has swipe twice but got rejected. They mention to him probably credit limit hit.

So my salesman who has handling my sale use my credit card and swipe it went through the first time. 

The guy ask his salesman if he can split the swipe and then the salesman at ask "How you want to swipe?".

After that I just left as I already settled my bill.

Has anyone ever bought sex toys via Amazon before? I'm thinking of doing so but I'm afraid of how the packaging will be like, that is, if it'll be discreet. Many reviews online say they are, but I'm more concerned about the customs sticker tag usually placed on parcels being sent overseas. (e.g. I once mailed a parcel to the States and I had to stick a customs sticker with information of what the contents were.)

How to be annoying at the gym :

Step 1 : Stand directly in front of people doing squats who are trying to see their own form in the mirror 

Step 2 : Stare at people throughout their entire workout until they finish using the dumbbells 

Step 3 : Don't say thank you when people lend u their weights when they are resting 

Step 4 : Tell people off when people ask if they can share the bench with you 

Step 5 : Finish your final sets then stare at people as you walk pass people while flexing 

Bonus Step : Be a lifter-wannabe or a fat guy 

Seriously people , gym ethics , it's not that hard

She grabbed me and pushed me into the room. She then pounced on me. We looked at each other for a good 10 seconds. It felt like eternity. Cloth started to fly left and right. We then took out our sewing kit and got ready to make our pikachu quilt.

Okay now that I've got your attention. Where do I find beginner tennis lessons in NUS. I can't even find such a sport under sports club. Really? This is no Quidditch.

As you guys may already know, #laoniang found her limpei so don’t have #datingstoriesbylaoniang. But fear not, #laobu is one of her closest kakis and will continue the legend so this is the first series of #datingstoriesbylaobu. 

1. The Overseas Bred

Laobu went on a date with a guy who has lived overseas for a long time and was back in sg for the holidays. Let’s call him Shawn. 
Shawn's tinder pictures were super adventurous and outdoorsy. Pictures of him surfing, diving, snow boarding etc etc etc but one thing that caught Laobu’s eye was his tight abs that are so perfectly shaped they look like 6 mantous fitted nicely in a plastic box when you dapao chilli crab. Of cos swipe right man! 

Our texts on whatsapp and tinder were minimal, it started with the usual getting to know each other but after that, he got straight to the point. He wanted a date and he was going to get it. 

“Do you wanna go out with me this weekend?"
“Yeah sure."
“It’s a date then! Would you like to rock climb, mini golf or laser tag?”

Woah woah. Simi is this?? Rock climb, mini golf or laser tag???? Can meh?? Laobu has been on many dates and this is the first time anyone has suggested such fun things, in Singapore some more. I was totally impressed but it also made Laobu extremely nervous. 
I looked up mini golf outfits on pintrest, googled on mini golf dates, cos Laobu wanted to get a clearer picture on how the hell to behave when playing mini golf. I ended up wishing for one of those “Let me teach you” moments where the guy stands super close behind you, holds the golf club with your hands, macham like grinding but romantic… you know what I’m talking about.

Tomorrow evening finally came. He picked me up from my house and as I was walking toward his car, he steps out, flashes me the brightest smile ever and waves at me like a cute school boy. Laobu’s heart cannot take it man, issit I am your shy school girl??? Issit???

We talked about all sorts of things, but the thing about guys who pretty much spent their teens overseas is that they are untainted by competitiveness in our culture. When he talked about his hobbies, which I really must say were super impressive eg. sky diving license, swimming with manta rays, I didn’t feel like he was trying to one up me. Instead, he talked with such passion, looking over at me with that smile from time to time. Omg. The more he talked, I started to imagine a bright glowing light shining from behind him and an angel descending from heaven mouthing the words “THIS ONE GOOD”.

Needless to say, the date was extremely fun and I was completely at ease. We played mini golf, which we both sucked at and decided to create our own rules like who can shoot the ball into the other golf course etc. After which, we chilled by the river and talked. And when our eyes locked for a brief moment, he leaned in for a kiss and Laobu caved. Hands down, the best tinder date ever.

Lessons:
1. Fun dates. Instead of coffee tea, straight away offer me. (hur hur geddit?) If you find that you really like someone and want to take them on a date, don’t be shy to just go for it. Think of fun dates, actually you don’t even need to think alr, rock climb, laser tag or mini golf. Just copy paste. lol. It sets you apart from the usual guys that opt for dinner and movies, and gives the impression that you are sibei fun. 

2. Talk about your passion. Not everyone has such elaborate hobbies like Shawn but everyone has a passion for something. When you talk about things that you love, it exudes positive vibes that is inspiring and can even get you laid LOL.

I hope Laobu lives up to Laoniang’s legacy!! Till next story, LB.

I will be shifting into PGP next semester.

May I ask if there are cameras installed in the PGP rooms? From what I heard, there are cameras installed so that there would be a deterrent against hanky panky.

But I hope to not have to see those cameras; I feel very inclined to change in the comfort of my room.

Also, is it legal to bring KY jelly?

Well this may seem ridiculous but would like to share what my uni buddies plan for me during my birthday. We had a staycation and my buddies (from NS till Uni) got me a real pretty massuer for a body massage. My buddies left the room and I was blindfolded and laid on my front on the bed with my shorts on. The massuer skill was good and I fallen asleep. Halfway through I was asked to flip over to the front and she continue to massage my shoulder, abs and then suddenly she removed my shorts and underwear. I was stunned but sort of like expected. I was told by massuer not to remove my blindfold and I just follow. Then she suddenly move down south and work her way on my little bro. She paused for awhile and the continue, it feel good untill the route of no return then suddenly my blindfold was removed. Damn it, i was freaking shock as my buddy was the freaking one jerking me off and the other 2 was like filming me with their mobile. It was Damn damn embarrassing with the 'mess' on my abs and chest. Then they say 'Happy 21st Birthday!'.

The pretty lady has in fact left at the moment she paused and my buddy took over. Damn it was a prank and i shouldn't have trusted them.

I am a 22 year old girl whom have a laterally flat chest. I am of average size, 160cm, 49kg. People around me are used to making jokes about my chest being an airport runway. I know they are just joking but some times at night when I looked at myself in the mirror, I felt really Sian as my boobs are non-existent. My cup size are not even a where an a-cup size bra would look too big for me. So I am used to wearing sport bra most of the time. There's once I wore an a-cup bra to I with a nice dress to a friend's bday party and to my horror, a male Friend offered me a jacket cause I kept zaogeng. He told me that my nipples can be since while I sit upright and people had been looking down my chest. After the party, I realised afew of the party's photos clearly shows my zaogeng nipple:( From then, I tried not to wear a normal bra fearing that I might  zaogeng again. My chest are like flat just with nipples protruding out. Anyone out there have the same issue with me? anywhere can I get a normal bra with smaller than a-cup size?

Has anyone noticed that sometimes the bus uncle plays the radio loudly over the PA system? I think it's a great idea to just keep playing for the whole day. It makes me happy just listening to random songs while commuting.

6. The Chosen One
#laoniang is back with the final instalment of #datingstoriesbylaoniang! Disclaimer: This is a long post so save it for next time if you’re busy.

After deleting the app (my second story), my uni kakis convinced me to download the app again and therefore I resumed swiping. Talking to people on the app, unmatching with people looking for sex, going on dates. There was a period of time when I had a date per day and it was sibeh overwhelming. Even had two dates scheduled in one day, so I had to shift one of the dates to another day. Who knew that one could be dating saturated? Prior to Tinder, Laoniang’s dating life was sibeh slow moving. It would always be one romantic interest at a time, but online…….my dating life moved at high speed. It was sibeh fun. I could meet people beyond my social circle, at my convenience. I could kill the conversation when the other party was being disrespectful. Power.

In the last phase of my dating life (last November), I had two Tinder matches chasing me at the same time. Let us call them Dan and Ian.

For the benefit of people who have never used Tinder, most girls on Tinder have many matches while the guys tend to have less matches. In Laoniang’s humble opinion, this is because more males are open to the idea of using dating apps whereas if the social circle of a female are not using these apps, said female might not adopt the app for fear of being judged negatively. They do not want to take the risk of being perceived as desperate or loose, since such apps have a sexual connotation in places like Britain, America and Australia. I have swiped on my travels and yes, it is more common to find people looking for hook-ups on Tinder in non-Asian countries as compared to Singapore.

Each time I opened the app, I would have a minimum of three matches waiting for my reply to their messages. Laoniang over here was talking to both Dan and Ian. I had a date with only Dan and Ian that week, as I feeling quite chuan already. 

Dan reminded me of Tom Buchanan from The Great Gatsby. He was of old money, played golf for sport, had a seemingly limitless supply of money to keep up his expensive lifestyle. What I liked about him was his ability to converse well on the app. Therefore I was very excited when he asked me out for drinks. He was dressed simply but looked handsome, in a grey sweater, black jeans and Sperrys.  We went to a bar, had a decent conversation but Laoniang felt that it was a little bit forced. I got a sense that we were rather different as individuals in terms of frequency, lifestyles and interests. Yes, I do enjoy drinking but I like drinking with my closest friends in an intimate setting like a quiet bar. He on the other hand is the party boy, opening bottles at tables in clubs and with a large group of friends. 

After our date, he told me that he would like to see me again. I was unsure as to whether to see him again or not, but decided to give him another date. 

In between our dates, I went on a date with Ian. Now Ian was a fascinating person. I would describe him as quirky, he was so open and honest about his past. Initially, I nearly swiped left to him because his photographs were sibeh narcissistic and I cannot stand narcissists. Think SELFIES! But he was so damn sexy/cute/handsome/hot that I swiped right.

Ian replied my Tinder messages almost immediately. He told me about how in his past relationships, girls treated him poorly, like a disposable person.

“That’s horrible,” I texted. “What kind of people do you mix with? It sounds like some Korean drama. You need new friends.”

Ian and I also had a common interest: Track. I’ve been doing track for the longest time and so has Ian. We exchanged track stories, techniques and decided to make our first date a morning run. It was on a Saturday and it was my first sports online dating date. It was also the very first date where I went bare-faced with no makeup, no done up hair, in a tshirt and shorts. When we met on the running track, I noticed his smile. It was friendly and he looked sibeh cute.

So we introduced ourselves and ran side by side. He ran a lot faster than me. I nearly CMI, trying to keep pace with him. After our run, we washed up and decided to go for lunch, when it started to pour. We shared an umbrella (hee x4) and briskwalked to the nearest shelter, a food court. We chatted about our lives over hot soup in the pouring rain. I really liked him and I think he was alright with me. I told him about Dan and how he wanted to meet up again, but I was rather uncertain about Dan romantically.

“Aya this kind of boys only want to get into your pants. Forget about him! Don’t meet him already, just be harsh with him and tell him no,” Ian told me. 

But I still met up with Dan because Laoniang is a woman of her word. Meet means meet. Our second date’s location was romantic. It was past midnight and Laoniang had the keys to Laoniang’s niang’s car, so on the pretext of supper, Laoniang took the car and brought Dan stargazing. Laoniang and Dan were sitting next to each other on the grass, not touching and I was really enjoying the cold wind biting at my skin as we gazed up into the infinite darkness.

“You know when I was in Canada, I met this bloody hot girl,” Dan said to me. “She had big eyes, dark brown hair and we had such a good time making out. Damn. We even went all the way.”

Laoniang felt sick. There we were, in such a romantic location, but Dan was telling me about his previous conquest. Is that all he had on his mind? Sex? Haiz.

“There’s also this other girl who I haven’t really gotten over. She’s away on exchange now, but she’ll be back next sem. I really liked her a lot and I was heartbroken when she left. Who knows what’ll happen when she gets back?” he went on.

After the date, Dan wanted to keep meeting me. Laoniang believes that he was either looking for FWBs or just a sibeh confused individual who does not know what he wants, so I did not continue anything with Dan. I decided to have a clean break from him and this decision was aided by Ian’s advice.

Then Ian and I went on the second date. It was at my favourite hawker centre as I wanted to bring him to eat my favourite local dish. Sibeh yummy! Now I'm hungry.

“I need to tell you something, Laoniang,” Ian said as I ate.

“Huh, what is it? Are you……..gay?” I asked. I would be so sad………I thought to myself.

“No,” he said with a disapproving frown. “I’ll tell you later.”

“Why can’t you tell me now?” I implored.

“Not in a hawker centre lah,” he replied. “Let’s go to a café for dessert and I’ll tell you there.”

I gobbled down my food at lightning speed. What was he going to tell me? Simi?????????????? Confirm bad news. Cannot be that he likes me what, this is only our second date, that would be weird. Does he have a pregnant girlfriend? Confirm bad news. Sian ji bua.

At the café, he ordered cake.

“Ok here we are, so tell me now,” I said.

“I want to pursue you,” he said.

“I see, can you elaborate……..?” I replied.

He took a napkin, pulled out his black ink pen and started to draw. Two circles. One labelled “Bad girls” and the other “Nice girls.” 

“In the bad girls circle are the girls I’ve dated,” he explained, penning it in the circle. “Here you are Laoniang, in the nice girls circle.”

That was damn cute, I have to admit.

“I understand. So you want to date me exclusively, is that what you’re trying to say?”

“Yes,” he nodded.

“Okay, I’ll go home and think about it okay?” 

And our second date ended.

Fast forward to one year later, we’re happily together in a monogamous relationship. The journey has certainly not been an easy one. Once, Laoniang had too much to drink because I was upset over life and tried to break up with Ian. I tried to give Ian one of his gifts back, wanting to end things with him. But he never let me go. Through all my crazy episodes throughout 2015, he never left. He has been there for me to massage my feet when they hurt so badly. He’s helped me with my assignments when I’m overwhelmed with so many deadlines to meet, despite him also being overloaded this semester. Fearing for my safety, he has rushed over to protect me when there was violence in the family. Ian has been an angel to me in 2015. Most importantly he takes me to each my favourite local dish every month. Win liao lor.

He is not perfect. Laoniang is not perfect. Yes we have disagreements every once in awhile. What makes our pairing perfect is our shared goal to stay monogamous and to show our love through concrete actions. Chemistry. Shared interests. Mutual effort and most importantly – spending time together. It’s been a little over a year since our first date and Laoniang is glad. I am grateful to be able to spend our second Christmas together.

This marks the end of #datingstoriesbylaoniang ……..I wish all of you a meaningful Christmas and a fantastic 2016. Enjoy the last of your holiday before school begins. All the best in your romantic endeavours.

Bye,
LN

I saw my LSM friend wearing a Physics T-shirt. OMG, the cat is sooooo cute (but she's cuter).

Hi! Suggestions needed :)
Where can I find a quite place in NUS to practice violin like both in group and personally?
I feel that doing it in my room will disturb my neighbors. I'm a picker-up, quitted violin lessons years ago and wanna relearn it. My skills are not as good as before and violin can sound terrible when played badly. 
I tried to go to practice rooms in utown but they need booking. Usually only CCA groups book the rooms. Not sure if individual can book?
Thanks for any suggestions!

When Orchard was first flooded, one of my city harvest friends said it was God's punishment for prosecuting Khong Hee as investigations on him started that year. 

It is strange that there are so many unfortunate things happening this year at Orchard when Khong Hee is found guilty. I bet the city harvest people are making a spin about it privately.

Hi "the throw" is back. We are throwing back with cartoons. I know many fb posts have already did this, but I'm doing this in context of singapore. Specifically kids central. 

So first, remember power puff girls and mojo jojo. That was classic. Oh and there were scooby doo, mummies alive, and pokemon. I prefer digimon though. 

Now for local productions. Kids united that made a few child actors famous. Looking for Nathaniel. Whizzes of the void deck. I remembered I kept pestering my mom to let me use the computer to "be friends" with the kids united actors. 

Now for channel 5. Ah..the ever enchanting charmed, buffy the vampire slayer, angel, and some other mystical drama that I cannot remember. I collected their books too. 

So, another throwback by me the throw.

I found that my tweezer is laid in the glovebox and the tip is broken. My tweezer was put in my box previously. So who took it out and used it carelessly? This is my favorite tweezer. Please stop abuse of using other persons items without informing them, be responsible!

So I visited the natural history museum.

The staff brought us to the aquatic section and asked 

"Who has seen a whale before?"

"meeee", a little boy shouted. 

His mum kneeled down with confusion, "Huh? when did you see a whale?"

"In iPad"  

Welcome to the 21st century boy.

I am the bone of my model,
CAD is my body and paper is my blood 
I have created over a thousand models 
Unknown to errors, I got no life
Have withstood pain to create many models 
Yet, these hands will never hold any CAP 

So as I pray, unlimited solidworks.

At the rate i'm forgetting stuff, i think i've a super high chance of getting Alzheimer's when I get older. Last night just as I stepped out of the shower, I could not remember if i shampoo-ed my hair. I know, this is not the first time happening in the week already. 
So in case I didn't, i stepped back into the shower to wash my tresses (again?)
That moment when I squeezed that bottle of shampoo, there was a flash in my head. Yes i remember doing this.. Still fresh in my head... was it yesternight? Or just? 

Age is definitely catching up....Aiyo

I think I use terms of endearment (dear, sweetie, sweetheart) too often, for both friends and children (my sibling and cousins and tuition kids). The habit is so ingrained in me that I have to take a lot of effort to stop myself from saying it too much. Not that I think it's a bad thing, but friends may misunderstand my intentions and the children get super shy when I call them that (kind of cute actually). I'm a girl btw. Is this calling of endearing terms strange and creepy? :/

When I lost my dad, a very wise friend told me, “You will miss him in waves that you cannot predict.”

There is a hole that never quite goes away and I’ve made peace with it. I accept that part of me will always be mourning that specific extreme loss. I find it comforting, in the most morbid way. The loss of my father isn’t something that gets better in time. Is it manageable? Some days, yes. Others, not so much.

And just like my friend warned, the pain comes in unexpected waves. The tide will wash in one night and I’ll be crippled with an ache I’m sure will never, ever pass. I’ll swallow salt water, positive this is the moment I finally drown. But then, morning comes and it passes enough that I can wake up. I can get out of bed and continue my day.

But I know it’s still there.

I feel like it’s the same with you.

I’m never sure when I’ll get caught in your riptide. You appear on nights I didn’t invite you inside, and I have to remember how I’m supposed to breathe all over again. I wonder if this is what I get for balking at the paranormal. For such a non-believer, I am always surrounded by our ghosts.

You exist in the smallest spaces. Even when I think I’ve scrubbed on my hands and knees, Clorox’d everything that smells like the past, you’ll still pop up in a place I overlooked. You are in other faces I pass by, or people with those kind of laughs that explode after a warning giggle. You’re in artwork, comic books, reunions with old friends.

I used to fantasize about throwing out everything I owned. Anything you had touched. Anything we had touched together. But nothing about me is minimalist. I keep movie theater ticket stubs and birthday cards from 2005. I couldn’t stand seeing our love on the back of a garbage truck.

I do not love you anymore. And how could I? I do not even know you. And you, me. But missing does not discriminate in such a logical way. Memories do not take the time to stop and say, “This is a stranger to you now.”

I still miss you, even when I’m okay. Even when I’m growing and learning and taking on this world. You still exist in my heart. Or who you were, then. Once. TC

#datingstoriesbylaoniang

3. Mr Physical Touch
#laoniang is back! Today's story is about a guy who could not keep his hands to himself. Let's call him Phil. 

When I first started talking to Phil, what struck me was his occupation. In his mid twenties, he was a trader. His working hours were erratic but a lot of money flowed in. In his Tinder profile, Phil had a photograph showing his face and some group photographs to indicate that he has friends. We decided to meet one night at a bar. I reached first and told Phil I was already here. When he entered the bar, my eyes widened. Yes it was him alright, but he was..... But large sized. Good features but huge. #laoniang is ok with dating larger men but I could not help but feel deceived. His profile was false advertising, carefully done up to hide his body.....nevermind, small matter. I liked how his clothes were put together nicely. Clean and neat are two checkmarks.

It was a quiet bar as it was still early and quite out of the way from the main street. Once we ordered our drinks, we started talking. Whiskey for him, a martini for me. Phil told me all about the life of a trader. The ups and downs. Sounds amazing - so much dough for his skills! I found myself drawn to his knowledge about trading......it was very attractive to listen to a driven individual explain his trade.I know nuts about it but he patiently helped me to understand the gist of his work.

As the night progressed, I think the alcohol started to kick in. Phil was touching my hair, hands, arms. Light contact but it was sleazy to me. I felt uncomfortable as I had just met Phil and he was already trying to make a move. In the dimly lit bar, he leaned in for a kiss and I just stared at him and said "no". Maybe he's moved quickly in his occupation, but moving too quickly on the first date is such a turnoff. Even with a lightbuzz going in #laoniang's body, I did not feel inclined to reciprocate his physical advances.

To my surprise, I wanted to meet Phil again, despite our first date being not so rosy. He did not accede to my request because of his busy work schedule. I also think he was looking for a physical encounter with someone as opposed to finding someone to settle down with. At this midpoint in my dating journey, I hoped to find someone to be with long term. So Phil and I did not see each other again. Overall it was an interesting evening.

Lessons learnt: Every date is a learning opportunity. LN learnt that she does not like physical encounters on the first date. It makes me feel like the date is looking for sex > relationship. I also learnt about the life of a trader, cool.

Till the next story, LN.

all these posts abt the christian groups reminds me of my own experiences a few years back. I was studying for exams at YIH student lounge when I noticed that this group of students were coming in the afternoon every day to have bible study/cellgrp/whateveritistheydo sessions. They did not approach me and I was fine with it. It was a student lounge after all. However, I realised after a while that sometime this middle aged couple would come and lead this sessions. The guy seemed like a pastor and would bring some students aside individually to chitchat with a bible.  The couple was certainly not NUS students.  I may have heard wrongly but they may have spoke to each other in korean. Soon more and more members of the public joined their sessions and there was even one time when someone brought a baby(dun think the mother was a NUS student either) into the student lounge. Those who were NUS students opened the doors for them or lent them their matric cards. That was when I felt it wasnt right to use the sch facilities this way so I made a report to campus security. They did not get back to me and my exams ended so I dun know if campus security did anything.. but i did see the pastor looking guy again in sch in subsequent sems...

Looking at all the posts on religion, I recalled an event that happened 7 years ago.
 
I had just emerged from Subway at West Mall and in front of me was a young handsome chap in striped T-shirt and jeans. He wouldn’t let me pass and so I decided to give him a few minutes of my time, perfectly understanding the reason why. It was December and they were there to spread their religion, or at the very least, provide some insights. But that particular day was an unfortunate one, because he had approached a young chap who had no pre-requisite accurate idea of Christianity (In other words, a Suaku). I had brought up in an environment that made me view Christianity as just another religion that didn’t offer joss sticks, and that its members believed in an entity named Jesus.
 
So all was well until the poor chap mentioned that his lord had shouldered all our sins. It was at that moment, having no prior knowledge to Christianity, that I gave him my upmost prized possession I had at the period of time for Christmas.
 
 
I gave him the most confused and perplexed expression I made for the first 15 years of my life.
 
 
Still in horror and absolute disbelief, I later replied to him in the most innocent way that I didn’t want anyone else shouldering the burden of my mistakes. I subsequently apologized for letting him down and not meeting his expectations, and that I had to leave shortly for a departing train. As a parting gift, he handed me his flyer about his church session, which I didn’t dare casually dispose in the event it was some holy article. I did not dare to let my mother catch a glimpse of it either, fearing she would go apeshit and suspicious of me having switched religions. So I kept it, until I was old enough to be agnostic, and simply discarded it the year-old flyer during Spring Cleaning in preparation for the Chinese New Year.
 
But I vividly recall the moment I boarded the train back home, and how overcast the skies were as I peered through the transparent windows of the carriage. That was probably when I realized for this first time in my life, that I’ve been overheard, and how I’ve been set on dead-set route/course towards somewhere unpleasant. Quietly, I whispered to myself, “Guess I really did it now. Perhaps I will never be a nice guy, just a really understanding one.” 
 
Looking back as I cross the bridge to Central Library, I probably found a new goal today: to determine if I’ve always been such an honest asshole or a rude asshole for doing several things that have been uncalled for; especially to the guy in striped shirt from seven years back who had a halo above his head that shone brighter than a 48W circular fluorescent tube.
 
I think it might be too late to apologize now, but I’m sorry. I hope you’re not like Timbaland who’d might reject my apology.

There was this incident that has been keeping me thinking deeply ever since it happened.

It was the last day of exam and then I went to the department's office to settle some admin stuff. 

Well pretty bad that day cause the last paper was doable but i made pretty lots of careless mistakes. 

As a freshie, i was grumbling on how many more years i still have to go taking exams.

On the way down, the lift stopped at level 4 and comes a frail looking auntie, pushing a trolley (cleaner's trolley). 

I have seen her quite often around the same block. Every morning she would sweep the floor around the corridor.
Moving from one level to another.

So, I didn't think much about cause I was still trying to get over the exams.

Then, the auntie spoke to me "finish exam already ah?" 
"Ya, just now 3pm"
"Haha can go back rest and holiday already lor"
"No lar, still got a bit stuffs to do"

I can see that she was wiping away sweats with a white handkerchief  while we had a small chit-chat in the lift.

*lifts reaches level 1

I held the door for her while she pushed the big trolley out. 

"Thank you ah thank you"

"No problem"

After which I walked out and passed her and she exclaimed 
"Study hard ah boy"

I stopped and turned around. Stumbled a bit and replied "ohhh.... okay" with a bit of smile and surprise. 

In my mind i was thinking 'aiya, typical advice from elderly'

So i immediately turn back again and headed towards another door.

But before i can start to walk even a step,

She said something that struck me hard. Her next words keep me thinking of my time so far in the university.... 

Well, i have been fooling around for some time. 

Playing games when exam is just around the corner, skipping lectures more than i go... 

so many not very useful things that i have done that i would not want to list it out here

Her words made me think whether i have been doing it right or wrong.

Whether i am taking charge of my life and responsibilities.

With a hand pushing the trolley, and the other forming a shape of a cup, she said

"Because that's your rice bowl"

Any advice on a exercise programme to slim down MUSCULAR thighs and FAT stomach? I'm a girl btw and I think my thighs are too big but it's due to muscle (when I pinch my thighs there isn't really much fat). Read that I should do long distance running which will help with both the thighs and fat stomach. Any idea on how far and how often and at a high or medium intensity? Thanks!

To whoever stole my iPhone 6 from the D2 bus around 8:10am on Monday morning:

There are security cameras all over campus and on the bus it was stolen from. Both police and campus security are reviewing the footage and I was standing right under the camera when it was taken. They can track you right to where you live. This has been a huge inconvenience for myself and the people reviewing the case, so I hope you have some basic human empathy and just hand the phone in. If you want save us all some time and save yourself some serious trouble, then you can hand it to NUS "lost and found."

Hello. The electronic key below (see attached pic) was found on the floor of the D1 shuttle bus earlier this afternoon. I will be handing it in to the Lost & Found at Student Services Centre, YIH tomorrow (Tuesday) so if you're the owner, collect it from there k? Can't do today as I am in BTC. For security reasons, no requests for direct handover will be entertained.

Best regards,

Sometimes she looks sad to me but when she is doing a kind thing or talking her smile melts pple, makes me want to give her a reason to smile hah hah. just hope to know her name...

I saw quite afew post on abortion and i've decided to share my story after reading 

It was the worst, most traumatising thing i've ever been through. And this is coming from someone with TWO cosmetic nose jobs, liposuction AND orthodontic jaw surgery

My abortion was very different from what 13428 experienced...
Because i was cheapo, i had my abortion done without general anesthesia, so i was awake and fully conscious throughout.

PLEASE ASK FOR GENERAL ANESTHESIAS, DO NOT CUT CORNERS FOR THE SAKE OF $$$

Firstly, IT HURT. I got two injections of local anesthesias into my cervix to numb the pain, THAT WAS IT (the injections didn't hurt though). So when the suction machine went off, I felt everything - it literally feels like your own body is getting sucked out of you - like period cramps on steroids.

Secondly, Its disturbing. The entire room smelt like my own blood, and (maybe because my doctor was incompetent) i got bloodstains on my legs as a souvenir. Plus the tube where the foetus gets sucked out was pressed against my inner thigh the whole time. IT WAS WARM.

Thirdly, my doctor was a psychopath. Halfway through i was crying and begging him for more painkiller, he stopped, came to my face (i was lying down) and said "OK i can stop now. You want that? No? Then stop making noise." Insane.

At the end of it i was pale, crying and shivering in cold sweat

I locked myself in the recovery room and spent a hour bawling. The doctor dismissed it as hysteria. 

I don't feel the "abortion guilt" you see in the media
But really, the procedure has left me traumatised and im seriously considering going to the NUS psychologist 
The only thing thats stopping me is fear of sounding stupid and whiney

Baking is easy they say. Yes it is easy when you have all the ingredients and equipment. You may say, go buy all these lah, but let me tell you, buying needs money. The baking process is easy, follow instruction, but you pay for the things? Not everyone has a food processor or an electric mixer like you. Not everyone can afford to keep buying flour and eggs. Some of us struggle everyday to get by. Choosing the cheapest hawker food. Eating just a sandwich for lunch when we are hungry. Drinking water to make ourselves bloat. Yes that's what I did.

  To add on to the discussion on Open book exam... I am doing medicine, imagine your doctors all went through OPEN BOOK EXAMS instead of one that requires them to memorise everything.

Oh, to everyone else reading this, don't tell me that medicine is a different weird breed subject that should not have open book exam. We are humans too unless you agree that people in medicine has a weird powerful mind.

这是写给世界上最大的笨蛋。一个很喜欢唱五月天的歌，喜欢猪八戒和孙悟空的人，又喜欢在 science library 读书 的大笨蛋。我只想对他说： “你不是没用的男人，你只是笨男人，我遇见过最笨的一个。” 但是我还是要谢谢你那段日子没有嫌弃我，和我做朋友，一起读书，吃饭。你的陪伴让我暂时忘了寂寞，忘了孤独的滋味。坦白说，我有时还会想念在学校的日子，因为跟你做朋友的那段期间是我在学校里最快乐的时候。你对我所做的，我真的很感动。因为我以前都认为NUS 的学生都很冷漠，非常自私。我以为再也不会遇到真心的朋友了。但是你的出现让我回心转意了。谢谢你，一直默默地关心我。谢谢你，没有把我从你身边赶走。可是遗憾的是。。。你却自己从我身边走了。
突然间，我们以前一起玩的游戏现在已经不好玩了，有多闷，多无趣。。

虽然我很伤心，可是我并没有怪你！而且你放心，我以后再也不会来打扰你的生活了，这或许是我写给你的最后一封信。我非常明白你离开的原因，我也知道你离开是没有错的。这样可能会对彼此都好。我会永远记住你这个笨蛋的。 我会记住你的话，要学会对自己更有信心，做个心地善良的女孩。笨蛋，别伤心难过了。我知道你现在在做 Part-time. 从你的 fb status 听起来好像很辛苦，工作虽然重要但是还要好好照顾身体哦！不要病倒。你也要开开心心过每一天！不要学我每天一个人 emo, haha:X 其实我有好多好多的话想说，但是我想你应该读累了。我就在这里跟你告别吧。I'm flying off tonight.再见了，朋友。:)

Since it's Thursday already, I'm back. Call me "the throw". 90s kids hear hear. 

Chinese new year and festive seasons do you all still remember playing with the fake bombs? Those that you press then they inflate and burst out bubbles? Those were so fun.

Also, remember in primary school, at least for me, handprints were a privilege and not necessity? The discipline mistress would always have impromptu spot checks on us, and we had to hide the phones in the ceiling.

Those days were so fun.

Hi, in case any regular gym-goers are still unsure of how long UTown's gym is closed for and missed the OSA notice sent, the gym is closed until 21 December (inclusive). I believe the MPSH 3 gym has extended hours to accommodate this, but I don't think there are barbells there. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

In case people don't believe me, I've uploaded the OSA notice that was sent out. Happy holidays!

Just left from a dinner + long talk session with my extended family. Topic of the day was my cousin, who wasn't present, so we could badmouth him all we want.

He was a high-flier. After getting his Bachelor, he got lucky; the company he joined as a start-up made it big, and since he was there early, he rose fast and furious. Also helps he is quite hardworking, clever and knows how to play politics. Eventually he became GENERAL manager.

In his mid 30s, he's earning over 10k per month. He has an Audi. He was engaged. He's waiting for his house. Everything sui sui for him.

But he wasn't absolutely sure his fiancee was the right one for him, so he called it off, losing a nice woman and his house. He got into a massive argument with shareholders(not exactly his fault, but he was too damn prideful), and resigned. The jobs they offered him later was half or less of his last-drawn; he turned them all down.

Jobless, he had too much time so he drove around everyday, finding friends, eating and such, becoming fat. Then he got into a car accident. Not too serious, but it put him out of commission for a year, and gave him a fear(quite serious) of transportation on roads.

After not working for years, his mind become dull. His temper also become weird, sometimes find argument with people for no reason. Friends eventually left him. Also fell out of contact with colleagues. And his pride prevented him from taking a lower-paying job.

Today, he's in his late 40s. Living in his mother's house. Jobless and living on relatives' expenses. Fat. No friends. Attitude problem. Worst possible loser.

This was once a man who had it all. Pride and misfortune robbed everything he had.

很久很久以前我想过， “如果有一天，一个女孩爱上了我，我会捉紧她的手，紧紧的抱着她，不让她走。”

这女孩出现在我的生命了，遗憾的是。。我捉不住她，也抱不住她，留住她就不用说了。

明明心里就知道她不快乐！我却只能眼睁睁地看她离我而去。

当她伤心寂寞时，我什么都不能说，不能作！因为我已经失去关怀和爱护她的资格了。

明明还是很爱她的，却不能让自己爱她。我告诉我自己， “一定不能心动”。 可是我依然唱着我们以前喜欢的歌，玩我们以前喜欢的游戏，梦见我们在一起的情景。。

我其实是个第三者，我是不是个没用的男人？

Dear ; 
Hi there. You say you're going for an abortion "in a few weeks"? Please don't. Please get it done a.s.a.p. Change gynae if you have to. I recommend Dr Denas Chandra at Parkway East Hospital. I hope you have enough money for the procesure. Early abortions will set you back about $1k, but depends on procedure too. May be cheaper if you're still in early stages where the pills suffice. Cab home. Spend that extra $10. You'll be too weak to take public tpt. Keep your receipts. Rest well. Most importantly, do not feel. Put your emotions aside. Being strong means sticking to your logical side and braving the wind.

I suggest you also get some form of birth control. 

Why should you listen to me? Because I was in your situation before. Don't try anything stupid. Don't smoke/drink/drugs. Just nurse yourself back to health. Don't fuck. Pray if it makes you feel better. 

Excuse me for breaking the reality to you. Abortions are easy if you let go of the romanticizEd visionof the process being where your boyfriend pays and accompanies you etc. Your biggest barrier is the cops in your head and society telling you its wrong etc. also, possibly the hardest part is the financial price.  Be prepared. Be strong.  All the best.

Post finals effects. Waking up everyday before even the alarm rings because of the fear that I'll be late for school. Finished watching all the dramas and movies that I wanted to watch within just a few days, leaving me with nothing to watch now. 

Borrowing books from the library but putting them aside in the end because prep for finals already made me read a lot already. Trying to get the perfect body by aiming to work out everyday but ending up just sitting there on the sofa with a pack of potato chips.

Awkward moments with parents at home with nothing to talk because normally, I will be busy with work. Searching for places to go that are cheap and fun, only to realise there aren't many of these places. Anyone experiencing these after effects of finals?

I'm a straight dude and I consider myself as a liberal person. I've known for awhile now that NUS has many hotspots for sex, but it never occurred to me that I would actually 'bump' into people doing it.

To the two guys whom I saw exiting the same cubicle in a particular toilet at CIT building, and then rushed for the exit, AAAAYYYYYYYY lmao. It's cool, dudes. I really don't care. 

But pick a better spot lah next time. CIT toilet bloody disgusting leh.

Thank you, Prof Jason, for making CM2142 such an enjoyable module (in spite of the dreadful 8am lectures)! Will miss the lame jokes and consultation/chitchat sessions. You have great taste in music! (:

I can't believe someone can be as thoughtless as this. My dad just told me that my relative, who is overseas, is in a critical condition. The thing is what can I do about it now?! It's not like I can drop everything and rush over immediately, and anyway HE wouldn't allow me to skip my exams. Now I find it difficult to focus on studying, with my imagination running wild and the guilt of not being there for my relative. Ughhhhhhhhh

Hungry? Strapped for cash? Still wanna eat pizza? Here's how!

The auntie at the PGP e-canteen drink stall is so damn rude and grumpy... as if everyone offends her by ordering anything.

So, I was doing my business in my own cubicle in clb's toilet when I heard a really loud fart from the cubicle next to me. Next came a smell so bad that I forgot everything I studied for the past few hours. As I picked myself up, whole body trembling from the smell and wiped myself clean, I exited my own cubicle to find the one next to me.... empty.

I don't know what's scarier.. Having a ghostly encounter or someone leaving the toilet without washing hands after taking a dump.

The invigilator at MPSH 2 ate too much explosives.

Last Sunday, I stayed overnight in Lvl 6 Central Library to prepare for my exam. Feeling sleepy, I went out and take a short nap on the wood bench in front of CL gate.

Went I woke up, it was about 1.30 AM. I noticed that someone had put a chocolate bar in my table and wrote in my paper: "For You" and a Chinese text. I feel quite surprised because of that cute thing although I did not understand that string. Today, I asked my Singaporean friend what does it mean, she said "Good luck".

To the friend who gave me that little happiness, I would like to say "Thank you" to you :) You remember me, don't you? Don't hesitate to talk to me when you meet me again (If I still sleep that time, just wake me up).

最近无意间听见了电视剧《起飞》中的一个小插曲【静静看着你】，觉得那带着淡淡忧感的旋律与细腻的歌词带出一种特别让人深深感触的情感，也造出了一首令人听出耳油的歌。所以想在这里分享给大家（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqK8Ga67ZEg），并希望所有面临感情挫折的朋友们不要气馁。

【静静看着你】

有一种旅行没有目的
有一种对话稍无声息
有一种等待不是等待
有一种曾经了无痕迹
有一种眼泪淌在心底
有一种痛楚就像呼吸
有一种守候仅是守候
有一种故事没有结局

静静看着你
隔着远远冷冷的空气
静静看着你
挂着轻轻浅浅的笑意
兜著圈 找不到 那种距离
不是你 就是我 那些刻意
你手心的温度是犹豫

It's been quite a while since GEK2508 ended. I've been missing this guy since. He's quite good looking with his specs. And he's kinda cute.

During the trip to Malaysia, I could not help but to keep stealing glances at him every now and then. Even when we were supposed to look at the stars through the telescope, all I could see was him. Him in the stars and him through the telescope. Not sure how many others noticed this, but it came to a point during the trip when there were little people when i pointed the telescope at him to take photos.

I just saw him on the train, carrying that brown bag with badges. I'm too shy to approach him...

Will I still be able to see him in NUS next time?

While studying for finals i looked for some soothing music and i came across this music from the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack. The song played by Royal Philharmonic Orchestra title The Curse of The Black Pearl. I immediately fell deep into the magical sound of instruments play by the best musicians in the world. The Horn sound was so knn majestic and warm and bright and sibei awesome. And then i was thinking knn my result so jialat confirm kena kick out of school next semester might as well go back to play my French Horn i more happy. Limpeh gonna drop out of school and be a pucking musician.

It's been a while since I go to Science library to study. Recently during this exam period, I've been noticing this girl that comes to study at the library from 10am till about 6pm. She's always with her friends.

I think she's very unique, as she is quite tanned. She uses a purple phone cover. Does anyone know her? She uses a black laptop sleeve.

It's Saturday today and I still see her. Hope she comes to the library till exams are over. I feel like going up to say hi, but she's always with her friends. And I'm kinda shy.

If you're reading this, girl, good luck for your remaining papers! Hopefully I might have the courage to go up to say hi.

gross question here but please don't judge :( I'm a girl having my period and like I think I may have excessively wiped myself down there until the skin there is like flaking / peeling. hurts a lot. plus I've been having diarrhea the past few days which have contributed to a lot of wiping and now I can't wiped myself down there without it hurting. is this even normal?? :( I dunno where else to ask such an embarrassing question

Studying for exam is already so stressful and then baaam! suddenly a call coming in and the volume from the other end of the call went 2 octaves high threatening my peace and safety. 

Thanks uncle, you just upgraded my stress to a whole new level. Oh well. A police report is made. 

Sign off.

To my neighbour on the 5th floor, can you and your boyfriend please lower down your volume? If you want to play loud music, talk and giggle loudly or slam your door, can you please not do it at 2/3am in the morning when your other neighbours are sleeping because they have exams the next day? Must you announce to the whole floor that you are back in your room by slamming the door? I know that there's no damper on the door, but you can close the door lightly still. 

You're driving me crazy by keeping me up in the middle of the night and I'm on the verge of reporting you. To anyone who's familiar with the colleges in utown, does anyone know where or who I can report this to? 

If you're reading this,  please SHUT THE FUCK UP!

Quite late, quite shoddy, but here's my offering to all NUS students:

Twas the night before Finals, when all thro' the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
Textbooks were stacked by the table with care,
In hopes that bell curve god soon would be there;
The students were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of straight A's danc'd in their heads,
And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
I'd settled my brain for a long sem end's nap —
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the soon to fall CAP,
Gave the luster of mid-day to the free S/U trap;
When, what to my wondering eyes came into view,
But a miniature timetable, and eight whole modules,
With a little old student, so lively and quick,
I thought for a moment I was falling sick.
More rapid than eagles his courses they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and call'd them by name:
"Now! ST, now! EG, now! PC and CS,
"On! MA, on! CM, on! GE and SS;
"To the top of the deans list! To the honour roll!
"Now straight A's! Straight A's! A's are your goal!"
As students that after the wild finals fly,
When they have a vacation, mount to the sky;
So up to the house-top the courses they flew,
With the backpack of notes — and bell curve god too:
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of logical proofs.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney bell curve god came with a bound:
He was dress'd all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnish'd with pen ink and moot;
A bundle of notes was flung on his back,
And he look'd like a freshman just opening his pack:
His eyes — how they twinkled! His dimples: how merry,
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pen he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face, and a little round belly
That shook when he laugh'd, like a bowl full of jelly:
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laugh'd when I saw him in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And fill'd all the transcripts; then turn'd with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod, up the bell curve he rose.
He sprung to his notes, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew, like the down of a thistle:
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight —
Happy Finals to all, and to all a good night

Ok let's have a rewind and throwback to the 90s. 90s children. Do yall remember tv shows like buff.  Or charmed. Or the non aircon buses and how we always look forward to aircon ones and not those with no aircon? Oh and mrt cards. Oh and buses cards that we need to press the amount to be deducted. Oh the excitement when we know we can take the red line to orchard because at that time it's the only functioning mrt line other than the green line.

I don't understand why some people leave their laptop in the library but bring their bag and notes with them and MIA for few hours. I always hear the announcement about not leaving our valuables unattended, so does it mean that laptop is less valuable than notes? #logicmissing  #firstworldproblem

Hi. Has anybody found my iPad at the computer room next to the photocopying room at YIH? I have left it there at about 12.30pm today. Please contact me on a0060906@u.nus.edu if you have found it. Thanks!

I saw him today.

It was an unexpected encounter, really. It has been about three weeks since we broke off any forms of contact. Never would I expect to see him in a shopping mall while I was having dinner with my friends. It wasn’t exactly an encounter, to be honest… just me stealing glances of him, as he walked past the restaurant with his two other male friends.

He was clad in a formal blue button shirt, and I almost couldn’t recognise him until my eyes followed in the direction he took for those seemingly eternal ten seconds. These few weeks, though we've been quiet, I've been wondering what he has been up to…. How he has been feeling. And I got to know that he has a finals tomorrow afternoon.

I can’t believe I am still thinking about him, still writing about him, still reading all the things we’ve shared… I can't believe I still miss him at times like this, even after he had taken me for granted.

All I want is for him to be happy. I guess that the thought of him being happy - even I am not the one who make him happy - will be enough.

Very disappointed these two days. 
1. I thought Macs opens 24 hours from 22nd Nov but it didnt when I was super hungry and walked down to check it out. 
2. The street lamp from SoC to Centra Lib are all closed these two days and some werid, stickly animal with cold skin stepped on my foot when I went by. :(((((((( 
What a scary day!

Just a story to share with you guys. So today, I've decided to just cook half-boiled eggs for breakfast. and it also happened that I woke up late and thus my time in the kitchen coincides with the cleaning schedule. So we had a chit chat and from there, I learned that she had been in this job for quite some time. she told me lots of the funny stories of the residences and of course some things that students do that always irks her. 

One is a case where a bottle of syrup was spilled on the floor and left there. when she found in the morning, the floor was already infested with ants and some bugs. and yes. it's her duty to clean it. but the thing I would like to point out here is that sometimes we should be more considerate. One should always clean up the mess after cooking especially if it's that bad. Have a bit of empathy for the people working to do a favour for us. They have feelings too. A little appreciation to their work can make a difference too. Just how many of you actually say thank you to the uncle/aunty who collects plate at a canteen? or even bus driver?

I apologize if the message i am writing is a bit messed up but you should understand my point if you're a human. Btw, I am a noob in cooking and I didn't realize the egg was already partially spoilt when I wanted to eat it. Mak cik stopped me. It could have been a bad diarrhea day especially when I have 3 papers in a row tomorrow. Thank you mak cik!

When you are near to me, all I want to do is give you a big hug. But when you give me a cute look, I sometimes wonder what it'll be like to have you in my bed. I haven't felt this way in a long time. This sounds random but it's because we are both students of NUS ;)

Ever wanted to know the name of that eye candy taking the same mod as you?
During the final exam, find out where she seats and her seat number. Then reverse lookup on the exam seating plan.

I live in utown and I have a neighbour who slams her door everytime she goes in and out of the room. What's worse is that her boyfriend who stays here too does the same. It gets really annoying when they keep slamming the door and disturbing my sleep in the night. Question is, how do I let them know without being offensive?

Came to school early on a Saturday morning. Found a nice seat at Utown, took out my notes and told myself today's gonna be a productive day. Then this gorgeous angel decides to drop down from heaven and takes the seat opposite mine (Facing me). I couldn't help but steal glances at her every other minute. In the end I became so frustrated at my lack of productivity (or just the fact that I got so easily distracted) that I just got up and looked around for another place and by that time Utown was so packed I just left for home :(

I have a room mate whom I can confide in but then I find him weird. He like to sleep naked and would sometimes purposely exhibit himself in front of me by flexing his nude body. I wouldnt denied that he has good physique & good looking. He is attached and his gf study at SIM.  He advise me to sleep in the nude as he say is good for health (i wore briefs to sleep). Very often after lights off, he would purposely pleasure himself and moan just so that I hear and see it. What is he trying to prove?  I think that he is damn stressed academically.

Hi this isnt a story per se but i have no idea how else to do this. hahah. I was at the biz library on saturday the 14th, and some guy asked me to lend him my iphone charger, which i did. But when i left (i left before him) i completely forgot to take it back. i don't remember what he looks like, but whoever you are, could I have it back please. I'm desperate I can't keep borrowing one and I don't have time to get another/ don't want to spend money on a new one. I've been coming to the biz library everyday hoping that you would be the kind soul that you are and return it to me. (It's not in the lost and found). If you're not sure if its mine or yours, it has a little piece of black cloth tape down the middle of the cable. PLEASE I'M ON MY KNEES.

I recently bought a pair of earphones from bookhaven in utown about a week ago. I passed them on to a friend, who informed me today that when he first used them, they were faulty, with audio only coming out from one side. When I went down to bookhaven to request a refund, I was informed that the exchange policy stated that return's were only accepted up to 3 days from date of purchase. The staff also questioned me, on a) why did I not test the earphones on the spot, and b) why did I wait one week before I used it.

My response to her was that 

1) They were sealed in plastic wrapping, and I was not allowed to open a set to test them before purchase. Also, there were no test sets on display to test the audio quality.
2) I got the earphones as a gift for a friend, and that's why I did not open them to test them, and that's why it took a week for me to find out that they were faulty.

Her response to me was that no, the exchange policy clearly states that exchange was only available 3 days from purchase, and that she was sorry. 

Well of course I got pissed. But besides the earphones being faulty, they also turned out to be poor quality, knock off xiaomi earphones. The only reason why I bought the earphones were because I previously owned a similar pair and the earphones on sale were exactly alike in terms of packaging, to the genuine xiaomi earphones. 

One would only be able to discern the difference in build quality on close inspection, which I was not allowed to do until after purchase.
Should a bookstore in a reputable university like NUS be selling knock off products?

Is there anything I can do to get my refund? By this point in time it's not about the money but about the principle of the matter. And heads-up to anyone interested in the cheap xiaomi earphones on sale in utown bookhaven, save yourself the trouble.

To the ang moh (Caucasian) who asked the auntie to keep the change. Sorry for not explaining clearly what the Auntie at foodhut (UTown beside NTUC) was shouting about over the phone. Instead of saying she didn't have enough money to pay for the supplies, I should have told you that it was because her boss had over ordered even though their business isn't very good. Sorry I burst out laughing when she called you back when you forgot your change and you said "its okay keep it".

There was this rather cute guy in air force singlet and wearing a grey cap in UT gym on Wed evening that caught my attention. Like duh, who wears a cap indoor right? He is not particularly super muscular but his lean bod and well-toned arms happens to be the type I adore - the 小鲜肉 type. I am so going to use the gym more frequently just hopefully to catch more glimpses of you.

To the people in clb who chope whole tables for yourselves/for your friends with a piece of paper/some notes/a pencil case/a file... May karma/the bell curve god punish you shitty people. You're depriving those who made the effort to drag themselves out of bed early in the morning to get to school early from getting a seat.  

And to those people who treat level 6 like a discussion room with all their chatting, please learn some etiquette. I honestly feel quite disgraced to know we study in the same educational institute, being surrounded by your ilk and getting my ears bombarded by your irritating voices when a I want to do is get some studying done. 

tl;dr: clb seat-choping/obnoxiously-talking scum, please stop your nonsense. It really is damn irritating and disgraceful.

Is it just me or is the caifan store at techno charging more than what is stated? I just recalled ordering 1 meat and 2 veggie for 2.50 when the price list writes 2.20. While it is just a difference of few cents, i think integrity is the issue here.

Man my mom and dad would always tell me, focus on studies first, BGR can come later. BGR will affect your studies, studies more important. Thus, here I am, 24 years on earth, without even having had a relationship before. Because of my inexperience, I am not confident around girls at all, and I am ashamed to say that even after living more than 2 decades on earth I still stutter when I talk to girls that I find decently attractive, never mind the drop dead hot ones, I can't even get near them without turning into a sweating chicken.

Recently I have been more and more self conscious about my dreaded singleness, because of exams. Why you ask? Doesn't the thought of impending doom that is just around the corner compel you to study, and not think about having a girlfriend? The thing is, I can never study at home, so I will have to travel to school to study everyday during this trying period. And in school, guess what, COUPLES EVERYWHERE. Everyone is attached, even the below average looking ones. While here I am, single, alone, with no one to study with. 

I was at CLB just now trying to up my concentration to 120% on my webcast, then at the corner there was this couple, teasing and touching each other. The guy seemed like a jerk, not smiling at all to his girlfriend, but somehow the girl went gaga all over him, with the girl kissing the guy on his cheek. How the hell am I going to concentrate when they are driving my imagination nuts? Needless to say I spent the next 30 minutes there miserable, slightly angry and turned on at the same time, and I left after which when I realize I can't get any work done with them fondling around in a public library. On my way home, I kept thinking how pathetic I am for not having a girlfriend, and how great it would be to have one. All these stupid thoughts when finals are coming...what the hell man. If I have known this was what awaited me after 10+ years of actively steering away from BGR, I would have smacked myself in the head 10 years ago and gained some valuable experience with the ladies. The irony of this story? Well I am pretty sure I can concentrate on my studies better if I have a girlfriend.

So i've just started playing Metal Gear Solid V recently, and always thought it'd be exciting to sneak around like that.

Little did I know that that's how I sneak around when I see my crush-turned-sour. Oops.

This is just a rant.

I would've taken an image of the person of interest, but obviously I wouldn't as it would be a giveaway to my identity.

so its reading week and as per all reading weeks, most study places in NUS are packed to the brim. and this includes the place of interest, XX.

I walked into XX at 1:30pm, after lunch, albeit sad to find out that every seat was taken and after purchasing my usual drink, I realised that beside the counter, there were 2 tables joined together that only had a computer and a bag. My initial thought was that: oh, is there only one person occupying 2 tables? perhaps i could ask to share the table with her/him/alien. Upon asking the XX counter lady, who is amazing and cheerful and so helpful, she offered to help me shift the belongings of the person of interest, and mentioned that its ok because she knew the person of interest, and that the person of interest was alone. Hence, my companion and I sat at the now empty table, and enjoyed our daily struggles of mugging with the calming aroma of coffee and tea and cakes and whatnot.

Fast forward 15mins, person of interest comes back with a friend and demands for table back, even though when questioned, said yes, there were only 2 people. 

I am well aware that she was at the table first, and that yes it is her RIGHT to have the table back. Of course being the usual not-looking-for-a-fight NUS students, we vacated. So my concern is, why can't you share the table? My companion and I were perfectly fine with sitting at 1 table, but you and your friend need 2 tables? OK.

HAVE A GOOD FREAKING DAY.

So the November BTO launch has reignited some debate about the high cost of government housing. Especially the new Bidadari project.

Actually, I'm genuinely curious as to why Singaporeans think half a million bucks for 99 year leasehold is expensive. I did a cursory search and figured that renting a small (3 room or so) apartment for 99 years here comes up to a figure of a different order of magnitude. Furthermore, compared to many other densely populated cities, ours already looks like a steal. In some places you must absolutely be part of the 1% to even come close to owning any property within a few miles of the city center, or be lucky enough to inherit it. Otherwise you just buy a not-so-cheap-either house in the suburbs (not an option here), and commute from zone 90264728 to zone 1 and back everyday which takes forever and then some.

Am I sorely misinformed in some way? Could someone enlighten me?

So there's these two "feminists" in my hall always complaining about how all men are beasts and rapists. Turns out one of them encountered a flasher along 99bends(the stretch of road behind PGP).

-While jogging Alone
-At 2am
-In singlet and FBTs
-Twice a week

I'm sorry you had to experience that, but no one said you cannot jog at any other normal human time, and maybe with a friend if you insist on jogging past midnight?

You don't see me carrying around my entire savings in a transparent plastic bag.

This is a warning to everybody that is planning to study in Utown during this examination period. Do not sit on the cushion chairs if you can!!! I was studying in one of the meeting rooms in Mac Commons recently and I just sat on one of the relatively dirty-looking cushioned chairs without paying any mind to it. The next day when I woke up, red bumps started appearing on my arms and as the day progressed it appeared throughout my whole body. After checking with a doctor its confirmed its a type insect bite. Its extremely itchy and I've been told it lasts for about two weeks. :( . You have been warned!!!

tl;dr getting flashed/nearly raped(?) cast a dark shadow over my exchange in Singapore.

I'd like to say my experience as an Exchange Student in Singapore has been amazing, but it hasn't been. One of the factors that led me to chose Singapore as my destination was how safe people told me Singapore was. So when I was walking home alone at midnight and a man started followed me, I didn't immediately reach for my pocketknife like I would have done at home (in fact, I couldn't even carry a knife here). I didn't start running. I kept an eye on him and thought how lucky that I was in such a safe country and that I didn't need to be as paranoid as I usually was at home.  I thought of all the measures I would normally take to avoid unwanted attention from men: I would wear baggy clothing and walk in a more masculine way, I would take out my handphone and have 999 pre-dialed, I would carry a knife. Instead, I only increased my pace and chose well-lit streets to get home. Still, he followed. About 100 m behind, but his actions were undeniable in such a quiet neighbourhood. At the next block, I saw in the corner mirror that he was 50m away. I walked faster still, but I could hear his footsteps approaching quickly. I only had 3 blocks to reach home, but all up a steep hill. I spun around to confront him. He was 5m away with his erection in hand, and still coming closer. I tried to keep my cool, I told him to "F*** off" calmly, then turned and ran. I ran past home, down the other side of the hill to the neighbourhood police post. It was closed. Shaking and paranoid, I didn't know what to do. I didn't look behind when I fled, so I didn't know if he pursued me, or for how long. Every moving shadow caused my stomach to clench. I just stood in the doorway of the police station, breathless and shaking. I couldn't call 999 because the crime was no longer in progress. He had probably fled the scene, as I had. So, I tiptoed all the way back up the other side of the hill, hiding in the shadows every time a car passed. There were no other pedestrians. It took me half an hour to walk back this way. I reached home safe and went to the police again the next morning (which was another unpleasant experience) and haven't experienced anything like that again. But this happened in my first week here. I tried not to let it sour my semester. I forced myself to go out still, to meet people and to make friends. But I didn't want to be out at night, even with a taxi to deliver me home safely, or with friends to accompany me. I flinched when men got too near. I was too wary of strangers, which isn't a great thing when you're in a foreign country and literally EVERYONE is a stranger. As months went by, I became more open and was able to get past my first unfortunate week here. The rest of my exchange has been amazing and I truly love this country, but that incident will leave a bad taste to my whole time here. I know these sorts of people are everywhere, and I do not by any means take his actions to represent Singaporeans. It just sucks.

Regarding the recent unfortunate event in Paris, I have so much to say. When I first heard the news, my instant reaction was horror and sadness. The widespread media coverage spread the news very fast around the globe and suddenly I see many of my Facebook friends changing their display pictures to the ones with French flag backgrounds. I see nothing wrong with it at first. It is a way of showing respect for the dead but as I find out about how the media doesn't care to make big deal out of people dying in cases like Baghdad and Beirut. I feel like we are not exactly respecting the loss in other places. I get it. Facebook only offers the option of French flag. Facebook is a western social media platform hence lots of western influence. I feel like by changing a mere dp to French flag, we are promoting this western imperialism and selective grieving over the dead. I just feel it is not right...Okay time to go back to studying for finals.

Dear smokers, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, STOP throwing your cig buds on the floor and dispose of them properly. It's bad enough that you're polluting my lungs, but do you have to pollute the environment as well? I don't care if you smoke, but do so responsibly!

“Nursing clean buttocks only, need to study anything one meh?”

This is the question that pisses me off the most because we are all slogging our butts off studying but somehow our efforts are always belittled.

We study anatomy/pathophysiology/immunology which are essentially deemed as ‘doctors knowledge’. We need the knowledge to anticipate any complications, explain to you the rationales behind your sickness and allay your fears. Doctors are great, but as we spend the most time beside you, we are probably the ones who will spot the first signs of complications and report them to the doctor. They are great, but we are the ones with time to hold your hands before you enter the operation theatre, explaining to you what is going on and why you are going to come out alright.

We study Pharmacology. Yes, we don’t prescribe the medications to you but we are the ones who feed you the medications. We double and triple check to ensure that you are not allergic to it and that your medications do not react with each other. We memorise the drug names, their mechanism of actions, drug-drug interactions and the adverse effects just so that we can be sure that what we are feeding you will not kill you instead. On days where you refuse to eat your medications, we coax you by trying to link how medications can help to you feel better. When you are puzzled as to why you must take some meds in the morning, some at night and put some meds at weird places like under your tongue, we will try our best to explain to you.

Most definitely, we learn Nursing modules such as how to bathe you when you cannot walk, how to feed you when you cannot swallow and how to care for you when you are incapable of caring for yourself. You think it’s low skilled and ‘common sense what’. Honestly, one of the most difficult tasks I’ve faced during attachment was changing a diarrhoea filled diaper when the patient had a urine catheter+ drainage tube+ an arm fracture. We spend half of every uni holidays at hospitals for attachments, waking up as early as 5am and knocking off as late as 9pm. During our breaks, we scroll through Instagram, enviously looking at people shopping in Hong Kong, soaking in the sun at Bali or eating good food at Bangkok. We spend our holidays in the hospitals trying to learn how to apply what we have learnt. We learn how to talk to patients, how to talk to their relatives and how to work with other fellow healthcare colleagues.

OK IN CONCLUSION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO STUDY. BUT STUDYING IS REALLY MADE MORE DIFFICULT WHEN PEOPLE DON’T VALUE THE EFFORT YOU SPEND STUDYING.

I think nurse is a very noble profession and its definitely  not a job for the faint hearted.  Like what is stated in the  confession, nurses are the ones who stayed beside the patient and help them with their daily needs. I started to really appreciate what nurses do after my sis became sick and had to be hospitalized for a long time. During this period where I spent alot of time at the hospital with my sis, I saw how the nurses took care of her. They did all the jobs which we deemed as dirty so that my sis can be comfortable, they comforted and encouraged my sis not to give up, they carried her to the wheel chair so that she could be wheeled to watch TV in the day room. Please ignore people who belittled you as they haven't seen real professional nurses. There are people out there (like me) who appreciate and have huge respect for you all.

I always notice this girl sitting at the back of the middle section of the LT during cm2121 lectures... Although she dresses quite casually with slippers, shorts and t shirt sometimes, i still find her very unique and pleasant-looking. I didn't have the courage to at least get eye contact and smile at her (let alone talk to her) and even waited till week 13...... but she didn't come for the last 2 lectures this whole week 13, even when it was the last important lecture :( Lesson learnt: don't wait until the last few weeks of the sem to get to know/smile/talk to the person you're keen in. So the only time i can see her is during the exam, much regrets and also why didnt i take cm2111 this sem T_T

Hi, I'm a guy. I'm very curious about something. Why do girls wear short bandage dress for presentation?  Is it because it is fun and comfortable wearing it?

Sorry, but I need to vent! So I went to Mustafa Centre just now to get some stuff. As I was looking about, I noticed this Indian lady looking at me for quite some time. I didn't think too much about it and I moved to the next aisle. And guess what? She followed me there and again she was staring at me! So wondering what could be her problem, I just went about picking my items. As I headed to the checkout line, that same very lady was ahead of me in the queue. Noticing that I was behind her, she turned around to stare at me again. In order to avoid the awkwardness, I took out my phone and fiddled with it. As I was doing so, she said in Tamil, “I am sorry for staring at you, but you look just like my son who passed away recently.” I felt really sorry for her and uttered some words of condolence. She said thanks and if I could do her a favour. I asked her what it was. She said in Tamil, “I know it’s weird and understand if you don’t want to, but can you give me a hug and say bye Amma to me?” Not thinking too much about it, I did as requested. She gave me a smile, said thanks and she left. So the cashier scans my items and the total comes to a $136!! I knew something wasn't right, because the items I bought would have only amounted to about $40. The cashier then tells me that my mom told me to include some of her items to my bill. I told the cashier that lady was definitely not my mom! The cashier, pointed out to the fact that I just hugged her and called her mom. Frustrated, I left my things there, and I ran out looking for that lady! I saw her hopping onto her bike. I got to her just as she was putting her leg in, and I started pulling her leg...just like I'm pulling yours right now!Hahahaha have a good weekend all!

ah girl ah, why every time u meet me you are like a warming sun, so fun and cheerful to talk with, and u light up my gloomy world. I felt that there's sparkzzz between us. However, when I whatapps you, you are like a chilly rain, so cold and reply so short. So my world turn gloomy again. This process has continued on for 10 weeks and it's really a roller coaster ride for me. And since our last cheerful sunny session has ended, is my world gonna be gloomy forever :( -

I think not all but a hell of a lot of problems pale in comparison to what happened in Paris. City under siege sounds horrifying and that death toll...

At the same time, hoping that we don't (if we're lucky, ever) get hit. Singapore is my land, my home, and damn terror if terror wants to hit home here.

Just needed to rant. Why are some people so inconsiderate? :/ i was studying at town plaza on friday evening and there was a group of students who were having a gathering, probably a fellowship or smth along that line. The activity was held at seminar room 10 with all the noise kept inside, which was fine. However, after a while, some of the people came out to chit chat and have some food. THEY WERE TALKING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES!? talking as if they own the entire place. Like wow, couldnt you see that there were people who were trying to study? (There were other people there too, not just me) Why did you have to make so much noise? You could have stayed in the room and chit chat all you want (i dont even know what language you all were speaking goodness but that is not the point) but nooo you chose to come out and make so much noise, disturbing the rest of us. I chose to leave because I couldnt take it anymore (plus it was getting late). My music was played at the max volume and I could still hear you all. Sigh, so inconsiderate. And to those people who are going to ask me to stop being a keyboard warrior and confront them instead, save it. Go study or something, those comments are unnecessary.

Can someone enlighten the general ignorant population on a reason that compels medicine undergraduates to wear their white lab coats and bring their stethoscopes to the canteen for meals?

Had my last and worst presentation in NUS yesterday. I have anxiety, so everytime I speak in front of a large crowd, I subconsciously speak a tad too fast. Once, a tutor of one of the modules I took in year one kindly told me to speak a little slower while I was practicing my presentation in front of her. I took her comments graciously and worked hard before every presentation to ensure that I spoke at a 'normal' pace. Throughout my 3.5 years in NUS, it has hardly became an issue to lecturers (not that I know of). Though, I do realise that I speak a tad faster the few minutes into a presentation due to nerves but my pace gradually slows down.

However, yesterday, I was only less than a minute into my presentation when this lecturer suddenly cut me off, telling me that I spoke too fast in a condescending manner, and shook his head that he couldn't keep up. At that moment I felt extremely shocked that he interrupted the presentation in that manner because I spent the night before practising for the presentation over and over again even though it was less than 10% of my grade. At that point, my body was shaking, and I was at the verge of crying and running away from the tutorial room when all the sympathetic eyes were on me after the tutor made that comment. I did managed to pull through the presentation albeit the stuttering. 

it definitely left a mark on me, so much so that I am no longer excited to graduate anymore because I felt incapable of even delivering a smooth presentation. I would accept if he criticised about my pace at the end of the presentation, but he chose to interrupt in such a rude manner, demoralising me throughout. 

-
 
There was this once, at the canteen, I caught an attractive girl staring at me, so I stared back. Not directly, just turning my head every few seconds to eye-candy her as my body was facing the other direction (I was queuing for food), but every time I did, she was staring right back at me, so that kinda got my attention. After buying my food, I deliberately wanted to find a table near hers to sit, but as I neared her table, I realised sitting directly opposite her was my friend, a recent acquaintance, and that girl is probably his girlfriend, and they were probably chatting about me, and all the while when I was eye-candying her, I didn't even notice my friend!

I was taking bus 95 back home. At Science Faculty bus stop, some xmm board the bus, just nice both of them happen to sit in front of me... So I get hear what they talking abt...

Gal B: You mean XXX from our class?

Gal A: Ya lar! Just now during presentation, his mainland accent english really put me off...
Gal B: No leh! I think he is cool!

That guy father bought him the whole single level of Condo for him! He got his own gym, game room and even a mini-cinema in his house. And, most importantly, he drives a BMW to school.

I need some advice if I have to visit the gynae. For months now, my period only lasts for three days! It used to be longer in the past. Also the staining is pretty scanty. No heavy flow even when I start my period. But even if there is no heavy flow, my menstrual pains are extremely bad! I want to see a gynae but my mum thinks my cycle isn't stabilised yet! But I'm already 21! Is this due to exam stress? I was reading up on TCM too. It did mention something about, no free flow of blood = more pain. What should I do? The pain is so unbearable that I even skip school. But I can't do this when I start working! Any advice?

They say you learn something new everyday. I learnt that having Brian Johnson sing "she shook me all night long" doesn't make for a great atmosphere in the car while on your first date after a few years.

Hi everyone! I am JC 1 science student, aiming for NUS. There is this girl in my class that I secretly liked for 1 year, she is really pretty and cute now the year is going to end. One of my friends from an art class told me that the girls in his class where discussing about me, they even ask my friend to introduced to them, asking him what class am I from.What should I do now?

Red shirt guy in science library today (12 Nov):
Maybe you're a year 1, but do you not know you should not be carrying your lab coat around exposed to the environment? I lab in a bio lab and all worn lab coats are considered biohazardous, and I think this applies also in physics and chemistry labs too? Please at least put it in a Ziploc bag.

There's this cute guy who studies alone at FASS Deck every morning. He probably doesn't notice me since he always heads up to the air con area (It's too cold for me).

I first saw him about 3 weeks into the semester. Since then, I started to head over to the deck early in the morning (I stay in a hall) to catch a glance at him. Sometimes when I don't feel satisfied enough, I'll head up to the aircon area and pretend to look for my friend or to look for seats, just so that I can see him for a moment longer. 

Once, I accidentally kicked a chair and you turned up to look at me to give me a smile (could have been a laugh but I don't really care). 

It's week 13 and nearing the end of semester, but I'm afraid that you might stop this routine next semester when you have different modules. If you're reading this, please please please study with me at the non-aircon Deck.

You may not be very good looking but you're definitely my cup of tea!

P.S. I know you like coffee! :)

Looking for a lost laptop. It's a red Lenovo with many stickers such as a Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker chibi saying "Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"; pizza, burger, taco and doughnut stickers. The battery has little part that's chipped off but stuck together with tape. It's also in a black laptop case with red interior.

It may have been left at Science CBLC, Science canteen, Engineering Technoedge, Engineering Classroom E3 06-11 or Arts Room 03-02. I'm an Environmental Studies student, that's why I can travel all around NUS in one day. 

Please comment below if you've found it/or returned it OSA! This laptop holds a lot of sentimental value to me!!

Decided to play a prank on my room mate who at times can be irritating and he for one like to disturb me. So late one night after he has fallen asleep (he is a deep sleeper) and with the help of another partner in crime (3 of us are buddies anyway), we decided to play a prank on him. Heaven is on our side and he didnt use the blanket. We creeped and crawled to his bedside, use a small scissor and trimmed off his pubic hair. We feel like laughing but we control. Mission completed in 5mins, cleared up the mess and we  stopped. I went back to sleep after that. Next morning, when he woke up, first thing he say 'WTF'. I was awaken, act innocent and say 'what?' I looked at him and burst out laughing, laughed because 'our trimming' is awful botak abut there abit here. He seems loss, put on towel and went to wash up. When he is back, i tried to peep and he actually shave off everything. He didnt ask me anything after that. That very night, he covered from head to toes and sleep.

I was 11. Pa had just bought me a new 2-wheel bicycle 3 months earlier as it was my birthday. Being the reckless, fearless kid that I was, I cycled around void decks, venturing out to pedestrian sidewalks, car parks, cycling across roads. Pa was mad when he found out, he removed both wheels as punishment. I hated him.

I was 15. My voice had just started to crack. Pa asked me, "Why is your voice like that? Can you stop talking like a sissy?" Pa. My voice had never changed, it's breaking and I can't control it sometimes. I felt so ashamed of myself I always forced my voice into something deep even though it strained me so much. I hated him.

I was 16. I received my O level results and I did well enough to enter most polytechnic courses and most JC's except for the top 4 or 5. Pa insisted that I went to poly, away from my friends who mostly went to JC. He separated us. I hated him.

I was 19. I had done well enough to enter the local Universities. Pa said he never understood what the point of studying so much was, that I should just start working. We were not rich enough to comfortably afford University, but not poor enough to qualify for financial assistance, just like many other families out there. He didn't want to have to take a loan. I didn't want to stop studying just yet. I hated him.

I was 20. I enlisted and worked really hard, eventually getting into OCS. In addition to having weekdays burnt already, sometimes weekends got burnt too. I saw less of Pa, and we never really talked even on Sundays when we met. My aim in entering OCS was clear: To save as much as I could in order to fund my own University education.

I was 22. I hadn't saved enough to fully fund my University fees, but I told myself that I would give tuition to make up the difference. I had applied and got into NUS before I ORD-ed. I felt a small sense of pride in achieving what I had so far. I thought nothing of Pa. I had grown up hating him over issues small and big, and that resentment stayed.

I was 25. I graduated. Pa and Ma attended convocation. They couldn't have been prouder of me. Pa had worn a proper shirt and tie, with pants. It was probably the first time I had seen him in this attire since I was born, from photographs of their wedding.

I am 30. Pa had passed on due to stomach cancer, late detection. In his parting gift to me was a short letter and a sum of money. His English and Chinese wasn't good, growing up with a mixture of dialects and Mandarin, but he wrote it in English anyway.

"_______, all my life I dont know how to be good father. Sometimes I correct, sometimes I wrong. When you younger, I only want you to faster work so I can rest early. When you pass your uni is my best moment of my life. I look at you and I think that 

"真的長大了
翅膀硬了會自己飛
也不是壞事". 

This money I work very hard when you in NS. I want give you to go uni but you go work. This money you keep for you. Sorry I never love you when you younger. 

Love, 爸"

This was attached with around $18,000 in cash. The envelope was passed to me by Ma shortly after Pa died. As I recollect, I was a real asshole.

He punished me for stealing money. Stealing IS wrong.
Cycling around on the roads is dangerous.

I was selfish for wanting to study in University when my family finances were so. If I hadn't entered command school of any sort, I would be struggling so badly.
Despite his crude preference for me to start working early, he had been working hard during my NS period to raise money for me. $18k isn't enough, but that's besides the main pont.... 

Damn it. He was a good father. And I was the asshole son.

Pa I love you. And I'm sorry that I only saw all these so late in my life, only after you're gone that I appreciate what you went through. Rest assured that I will take care of Ma.

I have never visited the dentist since my secondary school days. That's more than a decade ago. I don't have any problems with my teeth. I brush my teeth twice a day and use listerine. Furthermore, I couldn't afford any visits to the dentist and it has become a habit.

Is this normal? What can the dentist do for me if I have no problems with my teeth? I heard people visit the dentist to "wash" their teeth and I don't really understand the significance of it.

There's this senior girl in FASS who's very popular. She stays in one of the halls and never fails to capture my attention. She's so beautiful she's like a train, driving me crazy. 

You may be running around, but I will always be in your tracks. 

I will never stop until the day I catch up to you, when I can finally say, 

"I love choo."

As a child, I was always fearful of people and would often cower behind my parents every time strangers approach me. I would even have panic attacks in public spaces as a teenager due to the fact that I was easily overwhelmed even by the sight of crowds. I had to miss a whole year of school in order for me to seek professional help and completely pull myself together before returning back to school to take my O levels. 

Nevertheless, one thing my parents observed was that I was really comfortable around animals. I have always been so since I was little. Before going to my kindergarten class, I would greet the morning birds and bid the stray cats in my neighbourhood farewell. I also loved watching my father feed the stray animals back at his workplace. Even though I am an undergraduate in NUS now, my love and passion for animals had never once wavered. 

Most people spend their weekends hanging out with their friends/ significant other, playing sports, meeting up for ‘brunch’, rushing the completion of their assignments / group projects or simply staying within the comforts of their homes to binge watch on their favorite shows.  As for me, nothing makes me happier than heading down to the animal shelter every week to see my favorite animal companions. Should one is able to see beyond their former stray faces, the stories each one of them have is indeed very intriguing. 

Being able to walk confidently with my favorite canine by my side despite the sweltering heat of our sunny island, is one of the most rewarding experiences that I look forward to every single week. Because beneath that extroverted and outgoing self, lays that once insecure little girl who is so afraid of reverting back to her old self. Though it is backbreaking work to clean up after the animals, seeing the smiles and excitement on their faces at the end of the day makes it all worthwhile. All my worries of school and deadlines will dissipate momentarily (at least till I get home and be greeted with my long list of to-do things at my study table). 

It is already Week 13 and stress levels are high as students prepare for the final examinations looming ahead.  Having said that, it is important to note that everyone have their own set of demons they are fighting against. For a person’s smile and laughter may conceal his/her suppressed sorrows or darkest fears that one would never even know about.

This is in response to post . 

Glad to hear of someone in a similar situation. I experienced it while i was on exchange in the Scandinavian region and staying in a hostel. It occured on one of the first few days after i arrived. I still remembered i had just woken up to go to the toilet in the common area. Shortly after i returned to sleep, i experienced the same thing u mentioned. It was a helpless feeling. FYI i dont sleep naked, but only freeball in hostel like many guys do. The  'sex' felt like eternity but when i woke up just before 'coming' it only took like less than 30min from my toilet trip. The only guilty thing was it felt really good. But of course i stopped freeballing in that particular hostel after that, cos i dont think it is healthy lol.

Part 3 (Continued from the #palemandiaries)
The MRT door closed. Something inside me died a little. This was a girl I was definitely in love with (I was 21, that is what I thought love was) and she was seeing someone else, that also a PhD student. How could I ever be better than that ?

School started again, it was 2004. There was no Facebook to stalk her or find out more about her. I had to wait till I ran into her in the canteen.
I was out for lunch, I saw her with Joanna. I could not lose the opportunity. I went over and sat down for lunch with them.
"I heard you and her met in the most odd location", Joanna said.
She was clearly enjoying this tormenting me.
I said "Yah, in borders," with a sheepish grin on my face. If i could see myself, I would have realised my ears were turning red.
Maybe she had broken up with the TA or what ever.
She was wearing a TeamNUS jacket. 
"Are you in any sports team ? " I asked her. I had to clear this awkwardness and get a conversation going.
"Ohh, this jacket this is my bf's" adding insult to injury. 

And this was the story for the next two semesters she kept on meeting me for lunch as a "friend". Something inside me wanted to shout out and say, hey why not me, seriously why not me. Then I started seeing her with the guy she was with. What a douche does not even realise what he has got...what if he disappeared? My days would be filled with fantasies like this.

Courses became harder and harder and I started to realise the futility of my efforts for her. Maybe if I hung around long enough around her, I shall get a chance when she finally leaves the douche.

Sometimes in the evening, when I did not feel like going home, I used to hang out at Central Library and watch old Bond movies. There was something peaceful about sitting there in the evening and enjoy some old Connery action.

It was around 8 when I had just finished watching Goldfinger (I remember the day clearly), and decided to walk down to take a 96. Got down from the CLB lift, and in the so called "Lover's Park", there was a couple hanging out in the nearby bench.

They looked familiar, atleast one of them. I stood for a while trying to make out the shapes properly.
Holy Shit! it was the douche TA who was ruining my life. And he was not even with her. He sat with his arms around another girl, holding her hands on the park bench.
Maybe this was my chance, I needed to go and tell her that she is dating a cheating douchebag.

Please keep reading, this is extend over 10 years, there is love, dissapointment, marriage, PhD, divorce,all around NUS. follow #palemandiaries

I found myself liking this guy who's a house captain. He loves Pokemon and always leaves his room door open when he's in. Sometimes I wished I can do my laundry more often so I have an excuse to walk past his room and look at him more. Seeing him around the college just brightens my day. Maybe we might take the same module next semester? ;)

Hi NUSWhispers. I recently found $200 at TechnoEdge Canteen at the DBS ATM Machine, on 9th November. I shall not state the time so that the person who lost it can verify when finding it back. I passed it on Security Post at E5 within minutes of finding it. To the person who lost it, I hope you find it back.

Talking about ghost, I think places that I have past by when I was overseas was even more scary. My friends and I were hiking up the mountain and one could see many dilapidated houses along the way. Grasses grew on top of it, window panes were shattered and broken. At one glance, you could feel the chills going down your spine. There was also a cemetery near the houses. Worse of all, dawn was approaching and there were very little people around. By little I mean only two people whom we asked for direction along the way. It was so creepy but thank goodness we made it through before it turns dark.

If y'all know anyone who's lost their university-educated brains along with all the trash shown in this photo, please alert them. This photo was taken on Sunday outside of RC4, along Dover road. There are multiple dustbins in the vicinity. But our lovely, socially aware, civic-minded uni students choose to litter and leave a trail of cigarette stubs along with other trash all over the place.

Talking about ghost, I have my fair share of experience during army and in hostel. 

In army, to be frank I slept naked, there was this one night where i feel i was helpless and unable to lift myself out of the bed though I am awake, i could feel 'someone' was playing with my 'little brother'. No joke. Not sure if i am dreaming but it was so real and scary. Back in hostel, I have the same experience a few times initially. Same sleeping habit, i experienced my 'little brother' was being fondled and played with, i couldnt lift myself up nor ask my buddy for assistance. I just couldnt speak. It lasted for quite a while before i actually 'came'. I was  covered with sweat when i am able to move. I dare not move but slept till daylight. Which i confided in my buddy re this. He too experienced it before. 

Eventually, i placed holy figure beside my bed and it stopped and i could sleep in peace. 

Anyone has the same experience back at hostel too? Hope i am not the only one.

My little Priscilla, how are you doing in heaven? Are you causing a lot of troubles for the angels?

3 years ago, I lost a bet with my friends and they forced me to do CIP at an orphanage. It is my worst nightmare to be surrounded by children. I hate to be bombarded with endless barrage of questions and silly laughter. I told myself, “I am not going to do this shit". and laid my lazy ass on a comfortable chair and dozed off. 

Before I could fall into a deep sleep, a huge furry stuff rammed into my face and woke me up in the most shocking manner. I opened my eyes and saw a small little girl holding a big teddy bear, standing right in front of me. 

YOU! PLAY WITH ME NOW!

These are the exact words you used, to command me like some spoiled-ass princess. Before I could even voice out my objection, you forcefully grabbed my hands and pulled me to your masak-masak area and made me your kitchen assistant. MAN! I thought BMT sergeants are the worse psychopaths around, but you proved me wrong otherwise because I had to play by your strict game rules. If those rules are broken, you will turn into a female version of Gordon Ramsay. All hell will break loose, when you started yelling at me and shove that toy eggplant into my mouth without showing mercy. 

Although the majority of the time we spent together are dominated by your sadistic behaviours. You are still a sweet little girl after all.... whenever I set foot onto the gates of the orphanage, you will always rushed out like a crazy fan girl to greet me with a big hug. During departure, my heart hurts so badly when you held on to me tightly while crying till 死去活来. Just like a little girl who refused to let go of her puppy. 

Tragedy struck one day, when you contracted leukaemia. This terrible cancer robbed off all your energy and zest. The treatment procedures are painful and it made you cried almost every single day. I couldn't do anything to alleviate your suffering while the nurse pierced those needles into your fragile little body. 

I remember the day when you threw a big tantrum after founding out that your long beautiful hairs are gone. I had to buy you a pink flowery hat to brighten up your mood. I exhaled a breath of relieve after you put on the hat and looked into the mirror with a satisfied smile. 

THANK YOU! DADDY!

You filled my heart with joy, when you called me daddy for the very first time. Indeed, I truly love you like a real daughter, I want you to live on healthily and call me daddy every day. But my hopes were crushed when the doctor told me that your cancer had reached the terminal stage, I was told to prepare for the worst outcome. I stood outside of the ICU ward for hours, trying to stabilize my emotions before entering.

WELCOME HOME DADDY!

Despite of the intense pain, you forced a bright smile to greet me.  I hugged you tightly in my arms and cried bitterly because I couldn’t suppress my emotions any longer! 

I AM OKAY! PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL BRING ME TO A FLYING PLANE WHEN I GET WELL OKAY?

That night, a phone call from the hospital woke me up at 3am to inform me that your condition had turn critical. I rushed to the hospital to see you for the final time and bid my final farewell.

DADDY, PAT MY HEAD.

Even on your deathbed you are still my precious little princess, commanding me to pat your head and sing a song for you. I placed you in my warmth embrace and stroked your head gently as I sang a farewell song…….  
 
“Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall
And down will come baby, cradle and all “

As your breathing kept slowing down, I wept miserably and my saliva became too bitter to sallow. I kept on calling your name repeatedly but there was no longer anymore response from you.

Priscilla, will you forgive me for being a lousy daddy? I couldn’t fulfil my promise to bring you to a plane. The best I could do is to make you leave this world with a smile on your face.

At  Aw its so sad being a Doctorrrr my life is so hard boohoo. Well then don't sign up for it in the first place. Those that do it because they find meaning won't be comparing pay, whereas those that have their sights set on the pay as a specialist grit their teeth and bear the starting woes. Bet that $15/h pay won't stop you and your ilk from fishing for compliments at any gathering you find yourself in.

I have a lot of relatives in Med and Law and you won't believe the amount of humblebragging they display. Fucking annoying. Imagine my delight when a minister said that Singapore had too many lawyers. Can't wait for Medicine's fall from grace.

I was having a bad week in general but today it escalated and my anxeity came into full force. I began to have a very bad panic attack right in the middle of class and everyone just looked at me which made me panic furthermore. I was about to start to bawl my eyes out and/or faint when one girl stood up and walked down to me. She grabbed my hand and my bag and led me out of the room and bought me some tea and just sat with me. I wasn't ever able to formulate any words to be able to thank her. I was just able to nod and shake my head when she asked questions. I really hope she reads this so I can thank her properly. I didn't even catch her name and I'm so thankful that she took the time and had the courage to help the hyperventilating girl when everyone else just sat and stared.
Thank you so so so much. Honestly it was the nicest thing anyone has done for me and I can't express how much it means. You are an angel.

Anyone knows what happened to the MRT-Suduku couple? I am curious to find out how it went after all the confessions!

I'm confused, what's up with all the Angel and band confessions? Or are they all by the same person??????

Does angel still remember me? Do I cross her thoughts? Because I damn sure do. I remember her scent, the way her hair curled, her laughter, the very unique way of laughing, everything. Every time I see someone else wearing a band or I see a boy comforting a girl, I cry a little bit inside. But I guess what doesn't kill you makes you stronger...haha

I have been cultivating my moustache for a few months now. It just looks like a normal moustache still. Any tips how to make it grow faster/better? I want to look majestic today while I have my Sat tea ah.

Sometimes being too close with your room mate who happened to be your NS buddy can be a pain. 

I recently bought a couple of boxes of new underwear (2xist and renoma) brand. After shower and while preparing to sleep, wanted to put on newly bought undies to sleep, realised that it has gone missing (i might have left it at home i thought). Next morning when i woke up, my dear buddy who returned late night, seem to be wearing the undies I bought.

After shower, my buddy came back to the room and took out another pair of undies from the box. I recognised it was the same as i bought earlier in the week. I waited for him to put on before asking him, 'buddy did u take the underwear on the desk?' He say yup and just laughed. 

I was like wow lao if you want to take at least tell me la... dont just assume u can just take. Anyway i wasnt angry with him over this  (anyway is just underwear), doesnt want to ruin the good relationship between us. 

Anyone has such experience too?

Problems with living in the tropics: the weather is sweltering hot, but coffee is more aromatic when drunk warm, so I still opt for hot coffee then sweat profusely after that and wonder why I did that.  Anyone/exchange students from cold countries have any opinion on this? Will you still drink hot coffee if you can't get a seat indoors (for example Starbucks at utown) where it is air-conditioned?

I sneakily brought my gf back to hostel after my buddy went for lecture one morning. After I came, I just grabbed the towel nearest to me and wipped off the mess and my 'down south' region. We went for lecture after that. When I came back that evening, I saw my room mate was drying himself with that SAME piece of towel and wiping his face, towelling dry his hair etc. I was like 'oh shit'. I dare not speak much. I hope he will not discover anything.

Sorry my room mate, I should have throw your towel to the laudry basket instead of leaving it on the bed. 

Sorry my buddy!

My friend's girlfriend is a student of NUS (same as me) and she always does this thing on instagram where she flaunts her assets. What's annoying is that she will post things like " sorry I was dressed so inappropriately!!! Please don't focus your eyes on my chestal area, my caption is more important!!!" and in another case it was a video of her and her boyfriend and she was wearing only a bra in bed in this case where her boobs were dropping out, and yet told her viewers that the focus of the video was picking her favourite shots of her boyfriend. I understand that men will like anything that has boobs your size and that is definitely one way to garner likes, but honestly i'm really annoyed by how fake you are. 

I'm a straight guy by the way. Not some jealous girl with a flat chest. (the fact that I have to post this disclaimer is proof of how our society is way too judgemental.)

Coming 2016, let's have a casual food tour in NUS. We will have a few students from every faculty who have in depth knowledge about the food in their own faculties' canteens. They will be responsible for recommending the most value and decent food in their canteens, which seats in their canteens are the best, why certain stallholders always give a black face etc etc. It would be awesome if you can provide some trivia, like why the Deck Claypot stall uncle comb his hair so nicely, and that Biz canteen Western uncle actually appreciates you giving him exact change, why Science canteen Hwang's lady shift from Biz to Science etc etc. Interested parties please leave your contact I will pm you :)

Has anyone gotten dengue fever 3 times or more? I had it twice in quick succession (within a span of a couple of years) when i was in P6 and sec 1 and the second time was pretty bad. I had to be hospitalized and stuff like that. These few weeks there were quite a number of mosquitos in my room and house and i'm damn scared one of them is carrying the dengue virus. If i get it a third time i might die since subsequent ones are more serious than the last

To 

I spent my 21st doing my first uni assignment, a 800 words essay. XD

It was also the only day this year I was awake till 4am. Kan chiong me wanted to finish it the night the question came out. My parents and grandma offered to have a party for me because my cousin had one too. 

I am more concerned with attendance for my funeral than a birthday party. At least when the event's unplanned, people who truly care would be there.

It's the quality of the celebrations, not the quantity that counts.

Happy studying for finals people!

Thank you to all the angels that was giving out welfare packs at UTOWN on a Friday night! (with handwritten notes in every single one of them too!!!) <3 #humankindness #NUSpride

I hope you guys see this!

We should have pull up bars installed in all the canteens. So that guys will do their meal regime before eating and girls will get to queue first. Both sides win

Dear users of canteens and foodcourts (Koufu, Foodclique etc),
please be reminded that the cleaners do not clean the tables after you eat, especially during peak periods. 

Please do not eat and throw your bones or food stuff on the table like you do for hawker centres or back in your home country (where ever you come from). Imagine how the next person will feel finally finding a seat but the table's just disgustingly dirty. Sweeping your bones and stuff into your plate isnt clean enough.

Especially to patrons of the Sichuan stall in Foodclique, I know you guys order big dishes with small bowls of rice and share among your friends. I just hope you understand my humble plea in English.

Please use a tray, or dispose whatever food parts onto your own plate. Let's all keep the tables clean for the next users.

Joining NUS is the best decision I have ever made in my life. On the first day of orientation, I met a really handsome and cute guy. He greeted me with a big hug and a radiant smile. Never have I fallen for someone in such a short period of time. Charmed by his charisma and lean, athletic body, I pursued him ferociously. Eventually, my hardwork paid off and he became mine. Nearing our fifth anniversary and thinking back, I have enjoyed every single moment with him, be it having sex every other day or just lazing around in his house every weekend. And his name is the first letter of every sentence.

To the OP of  and  
I'm too experiencing the best of both worlds. Like it really feels good having weekdays bf and weekends bf. Sometimes my weekend bf will have his block leave and he will accompany me during the weekdays. Normally i will block out Mon, Wed and Fri for him while the weekdays bf will find me on Tues, Thurs, Sat. So Sunday will be the day i takes a break. Like those bodybuilders having their rest day/cheat day. It is really cool so don't be afraid of judgements, we are still young we do what we want !

Can i suggest that those who are near the front of the bus say thank you to the drivers when boarding? I think it's a simple gesture that would brighten their (admittedly bad) moods while driving noisy busloads of students over bumpy roads. A simple 'xiexie uncle' or 'thank you uncle' would do! (:

I thought my room mate is not coming back for the night! 

With raging hormones, I stripped to my birthday suit and laid on my bed. Guys I am sure u guys can understand my the moment, as I reached the 'road of no return', it was too late for me to react, the door opened and my buddy was greeted by the scene and the 'mess'! He walked in closed the door and took out a pack of tissue and say 'please clear up' and burst out laughing. 

Damn embarrasing moment in my  hostel life.

Friday night overtime. As I was preparing to leave at around 8pm, one of the aunties who was going around wiping the tables came up to me and asked “那么迟还没回啊？”.

A conversation ensued and I found out that she has been working since 4.30am today. For her, such long hours are a daily affair and happens even on Saturdays. Despite having been at work for almost 16 hours, I don't feel a single bit of resentment or grumpiness from her during our brief exchange. In fact, I don't think I can sound as cheery as her if I were the one to start the conversation. Who am I to complain that studying is tough when there are people like her are working so hard, unseen and unrecognised, to create a more conducive environment for people like me? Thank you for reminding me to not take what I have for granted.

Its me, i have been eyecandying this girl since scamp. And i actually saw her in sci lib today! Thank you for smiling at me, you made my day hehe.

Damn. Studying in utown as usual and was on 2nd level PC commons room. Damn bloody ang mohs were talking at the top of their ******* voices and can't concentrate. Saw a girl leaving the private writing hub room and I thought it was free for anyone to use so I took this chance to enter the study area. But the woman in charge of the whole room say its for students only. Damn stupid bloody ang mohs just get the f off. Inconsiderate. I hate exchange students.

Started playing this game called Ingress last week, and saw a player from the enlightened team in NUS when i glanced at his phone over his shoulder. Didn't manage to see his username but he was really cute, i feel so sad i'm playing for his enemy faction... :(

[Missing Item] Hi all, I lost my Dell power adapter (black, narrow tip) somewhere in school, perhaps DR 9 or it dropped out elsewhere. I went back and found a Lenovo A/C adapter instead (Grey, fat tip).  Let me know if this belongs to anyone or if someone found my adapter!

Part 2
 (Continued from the previous post thanks to the great response) to find it search #palemandiaries on Facebook. 

She looked up from her book.

I stood there frozen, maybe I have been too forward. Maybe it is just creepy to walk up to a girl in a bookstore with nothing to say. What did I know ? I was a 21 year old without any real life experience who has never had a proper girlfriend. I had to say something.

"You are Joanna's friend, aren't you ?"

I remember seeing her sitting next to Joanna in Calculus lecture. Joanna, I kinda knew, through a friend. Hardworking girl, I was not that intimidated by her.

"Yes, I am." She replied. 

I stood there, she did not chase me away yet.

"You are from science aren't you ? You have been in my Calculus and Linear Algebra classes."
I could not believe it, she actually noticed me. Out of so many people in the class she had noticed me. Maybe I was thinking too much of it, Or maybe this is it.

We stood there talking. I asked about her classes. I asked her where she lived. we talked about books. She was a lively person, a bubble of life just pouring out of a person. I made some silly jokes she laughed. 

"I need to head back now." 

I realised we have been talking for more than an hour. 

Turns out she lived on the Purple line like I did. We took the train together.

We were talking about canteen food, the $1.8 Wan Tan Mee from the science canteen when she dropped the bomb.

"My boyfriend likes it a lot as well."

I froze. We had just crossed Farrer Park. I remember the moment. 

"You have a bf? Like in NUS?" I said. it felt bad like something inside was crushing me. I could hardly breathe. I finally got to talk to the girl I have admired and she has a bf.

"Yah, he is a Phd student from SoC. He actually was a TA for one of my module."

Her stop was there. She said bye to me and that we should meet for that Wan Tan Mee.

As the MRT doors swooshed closed, I stood there with hunched shoulders, broken inside. 

Why doesn't anything good ever happen to me? I told myself.

This story spans over 10 years. I will eventually marry her and then lose her again. Keep reading and thanks for the encouragement. #palemandiaries

I wonder if its just me but I really enjoyed the second dance of RH dance last night, especially the one girl of the grp of 4... as they rocked their way through Bruno Mar's Runaway Baby at the SC dinner yesterday... watching those amazing vivid motions made my heart want to runaway with you

In reply to post  (the person who is ecing a martial arts captain) 

All the captains are very much curious and open to talking, so if you wish to know one of them on a personal level, just talk to that person! They are all very much willing to (:

'Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you...'

I was awaken by the noise in wee hours and greeted by about 10 person surrounding me. It was awkward. Damn awkward as I was naked and I couldn't get out of my bed. Thank you my dear room mate aka buddy, you knew my sleeping habit and you arranged this. End up, I was dragged out of bed and made to hold the cake to make a wish and a GROUP photo. There goes my secret! Everyone saw me in full glory. 

My buddies, if you guys are reading this, I will take revenge! Haha...

Luckily none of the opposite gender was around.

My colleague just told me and showed me her newly pierced ears :) Reminded me of the time when I bought ear rings for angel. I guess I just love to buy girls jewelry and feel happy seeing them happy :D Even my mom...haha

Maybe one day, I will be able to see someone's ear rings and not be thrown back to angel wearing the ear rings I bought her :) She did look quite pretty wearing big ear rings though. I bought her ear rings from Bali as well :) But turned out she already had an identical copy xD

I hope she still wears them :) Haven't seen her for long, so not sure xD

I stumbled across Adele's new song "Hello" and it reminded of us. Even though we broke up more than 5 years ago, I guess I still have not managed to move on. 

F**k, I think I'm getting depressed because of this song and flood gate of emotions it seemed to have let loose.

I've had a lot of near accidents with those assholes on scooters and skateboards. They're irresponsible and speed around, causing a lot of distress to the people walking. I hope the school will ban those things soon. It should only be allowed on the roads, not within buildings.

Why do people put their laptop on their laptop cover/bag? Your laptop fan will suck in the dust from your cover and clog up your vent and lead to inefficient heat elimination and then you complain why your laptop goes slow or heats up very fast..

NUS has been the silent witness of my entire love story. I met the love of my life in NUS, married her, and finally even lost her while being at NUS all over the span of 10 years. Curious ? Read On.

I met her in the science canteen in the year of 2003, I was from the faculty of science and she was from school of computing, if you remember SoC used to be just across science then. I saw her in 95 almost everyday getting down with me as we both went to school. Sometimes i would run into her into the canteen, I never knew who she was, I assumed she was from SoC as she took the Calculus lecture with me.

All i remembered was her face when I when to sleep at night, how could I be so close to someone I was falling in love with, yet never managed to go and talk to her ? I must do something. I should be able to talk to her.

Summer of 2004 came with the exams ending and the school emptying out day after day with vacations slowly on the way. I knew I have blew my chance, what if she dropped out of school or SoC, lot of people did after their first year.

It was June, I was at Borders, yes the one at Orchard Road before capitalism aka Facebook ended everything good and pure on this earth. As I walked in looking for my Superman comics, I saw her. She was standing at the Literature section leafing through some book. 

I knew that God might have given me another chance to talk to her. This is it. I sidled up to her (I know not the best way). As she looked up at me ..I could manage .."Hey You are from NUS right ?"
To be Continued.. (I eventually married her)...#palemandiaries

To my inconsiderate roomate, please stop brgining girls back to our room. If you want to do all that stuff,  please get a single room. I totally regret choosing a double room now, my roommate is a jerk who brings different girls every week, and worse of all, once when i was coming back earlier than i said i was, I heard sounds coming out from MY room and when i took a peek, he and some random woman was on MY bed. I have enough of the thought of possibly sleeping on your cum and some other person whom i dont even know's fluids. Thank you.

Oh mine! My room mate is one handsome guy with nice physique and look. We confide with each other alot as we were from same unit during NS. Well, being in a male dormitory I guessed, testerone level are high. Late into the night, as I tossed and turn towards my buddy bed,oh mine he was naked and was humping his bolster damn hard. The butt movement, I just kept quiet and sleep. Next morning, i woke up and before i went to brush my teeth, i use his blanket and cover him just in case anyone come in... #brotherhood!

Over the past few weeks, whenever I walk past the computing club room at night, I always hear all kinds of strange noises. I've heard eerie laughter, wailing, roaring and distorted creepy singing. Once I even heard a girl moaning.

I don't know what's up with our student leaders in computing club. Sometimes I'm worried that they work themselves too hard for us students (did you see the amount of effort they put in for Computing Day and  Halloween?) and end up going insane.

I'm really concerned for their mental health.

This was my first time attending an Indian event ( Diwali night) and it was a really nice experience. The performances were amazing, the colors, everybody looked so beautiful... But guys could you all maybe try booking a bigger venue and have less disorganization, like I could see everybody queueing for the food but nobody actually obeying the queue? I went without food for the entire event and was quite hungry at the end of it..

When I'm walking pass the multi-purpose field on every Wednesday evening, there will always be a group of girls playing softball. I'm hopelessly mesmerized by a particular girl from that group. She is petite ,short hair and most importantly she has a sweet smile. Sadly, for some reasons I haven't seen her for a month. Why they stopped playing softball? Anyone can shed some light over the mysterious identity of this girl?

I REALLY REALLY WANT TO KNOW HER!

Ever since primary school and up until now in uni, people keep saying I'm tiny (short and skinny). But somehow although my overall appearance looks small, my adipose tissues all accumulate at my tummy :( I think the only person who knows is my bf and who keeps making fun of me eg. my "extra tire" (it's literally a roll of fat)  which I don't mind but for my own personal reasons, I also wanna get rid of my "extra tire" LOL. Does anyone have any tips for losing tummy fat? I know diet is a major factor but it's hard to eat healthy (or rather, cook healthy stuff). I would love to steam everything but I have to cook for other people too and they don't like bland food. I've also been trying to do aerobic exercises at home, like crunches and leg lifts, but didn't get desirable results (my abs got tougher but there was still a pretty thick layer of fat over it). I'd really appreciate any advice, thanks! :D

圖書館無聊筆錄 

這是一個寂寂無人的週末夜晚，在校園裡唯一的無停休式圖書館。他照舊地坐在這靠窗的位置，心想「熬過這一晚，學問必定大有長進」。他忍不住，小睡了片刻。「颼。。颼 」窗外刮起了風，他忽然驚醒。從朦朧的雙眼，他看到了時針跳至一點整。館內人數寥寥無幾，絕大部分也都正在閉目養神。此時，他聽到了窗外一聲「碰」！ 吃驚的他轉過頭來，發現玻璃窗出現了裂縫。此時他也發現窗外煙霧瀰漫，心想明早又得埃那可惡的空氣污染， 不禁嘴裡髒話脫口而出。然而此時「颼」 又一陣風，將朦朧的煙霧清去。這時，他眼角裡驚見，想吶喊，但張嘴吐出來的都是空氣！

Was reading through all the past confessions. What really caught my curiosity was the confession about having room mate sleeping in the buff. My room mate, for one, is someone who wrapped like a dumplings when in room. I wonder how many of you guys here have room mates who sleep nude? Like or comment, if you have such room mates.

This faithful weekend has arrived. As someone who treasures sleep a lot, I can't help but feel disillusioned by this natural phenomenon. My favourite matches from the West now start 1 hour later. The latest game starts at 12.30am. Sigh DST, you made me feel so down. March, please come soon. :(

I was at YIH starbucks from 5.30 to 7pm yesterday. There were performers singing Chinese songs on stage and I believe they were from a CCA (Voice I think). It was my first time at YIH starbucks (I am a freshie), so i didn't know that there was a stage for performances. Now, I see it as a potential study area. Just wanna encourage these performers on as I thought they sang well yesterday. Most importantly,  their voices warmed my heart and lighted up my dull day like how my Starbucks coffee did to me. I am actually really envious of them as my singing sucks and can only be confined to my bedroom. It is really beautiful to light up others' days with your voices. Furthermore, it takes courage to sing in public. Keep up to it, performers! What made it better was that they sang my favourite classics. I couldn't really remember the song names though. 
-
 
OP of  here, yeah yeah the one who's ec-ing the small, cute looking red/white cartoonish jacket girl :) Anyway I just realised she didn't join any comm, which explains why I no longer see her around at the science club room :( But it's ok, you still brighten up my studying sessions at the science library whenever I see you there! :)

She gave me a band she had worn for few years in exchange for helping her with her PhD work. I was really touched because she said that she hadn't even given the band to her boy friend. The band had protected her when she back packed through Europe for a few months alone.

The band had become a part of my life. It was always on my hand and I thought of the band as her personification. It was as if she was protecting me like an angel.

A few months later when she stopped thinking so highly of me, she lied to me that she was taking the band back for some time for her trip to Shanghai. She returned but the band never did. When she did return later, she told me I didn't deserve the band anymore and that she would throw it.

It's been a few months since then but whenever I see someone else wearing any band, tears well up in my eyes. I miss the angel, I really do. It doesn't really matter because angels choose humans but for what it's worth, I would like to put it out there that the band was witness to everything I did. And if it could speak out, it would tell her how much I cared.

For those of you who stay at PGP, y'all would know that SuperSnacks barricade their front doors when it's late probably due to the management's order over noise concerns. It's no big deal really, since the rear entrance is just up some stairs. On Friday night, there was this girl who refused to go by the rear entrance and instead brute-forced her way through the main doors and made an entire scene. Seriously I mean that's one of the weirdest shit I've seen in this semester. To help mitigate the situation, one of the employees had to give in and let her through. When the said individual got into the restaurant, she just exclaimed "my bag is really heavy!" So you have the strength to brute-force your way through the doors, the skin to make a total embarrassment out of yourself but don't have the fortitude to respect the employees and climb up a flight of stairs? That's just a whole new level of lazy!!

P.S to the female employee who opened the doors, I felt really bad for the blatant disrespect you received that evening. Also, you're really really pretty! Hope to see you around at SuperSnacks next semester too!

This is damn embarassing! 
I just came back from late supper in wee hours. Seeing my buddy sound asleep, I do not want to switch on the room light as I am afraid to disturb him. I have real poor vision at night and cant really see. Went for a shower, back to the room, dry myself. My buddy hp vibrated non stop, I took up and it show 'home'. I went over and woke my buddy by pulling his underwear but end up I was actually pulling (pinching) on his naked butt!!!! I mistook his damm tanned line as his underwear!  My buddy woke up in fright and say 'why u pinched my buttock!' I switch on the light and apologised and say 'I thought it was your freaking underwear'.... I looked at him and both of us has a good laugh...

 I think the two year period of national service probably played a big role where lots of socialisation goes on there; how guys ought to behave, what priorities they ought to have and how they ought to think etc. If only you girls knew what goes on there :OOO Hopefully the lost sheep will find their way back.

I've been seeing this cute girl after forensic lecture every Friday..usually at paya lebar MRT. I assume she stays in eunos cause she alights there every time. Today after lecture, I went to the toilet at Kent ridge MRT before taking the train. I thought to myself won't so 巧 again bah..she probably had left with the earlier train..let me see her again and I'll talk to her! And then I saw her again at paya lebar! Five weeks in a row! But I didn't approach her. I wonder if she notices me also..cute girl if you see this 我们交个朋友吧!

There is a guy that I hate from my CCA. He thinks he is all that great and always talks in this condescending manner. 

I have been keeping 2 lizards as my pet. Every so often, I will chop off their tails and let them grow back. I store these tails in a jar. When the jar is full, I'm gonna empty the content into a bag. Then when I meet him in school, I'm gonna show him a shower of lizards' tails right at his face. 

Take that, idiot!

We started sweating profusely. It's only been a while since we started. She gripped the rod really hard and did a perfect stroke. I joined in the fun. I reacted by grabbing my own rod and swinging it. The cock flew in her direction.

It was a cold and rainy morning. I lay in bed, lulled into a half slumber by the pitter patter of the rain against my window, and contemplated when I should leave its warm embrace. Suddenly, the early morning serenity was punctuated by a very loud scream. "Harder!!! HARDER!!!!!" The voice reverberated around the room and echoed down the hallway outside. It's that damn neighbour again, I groaned and covered my ears with my pillow. It always happens every rainy day; the excited shouts and loud panting of my next door neighbour would pierce the air and interrupt everyone's thoughts. "OH YES, HARDER!!" My neighbour would scream. "YEAH I LIKE IT OH YEAHHHH.... YEAH BABY!!"
"LET IT RAIN HARDERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!"

I need to find someone. 

We were on the Circle Line towards Paya Lebar from Kent Ridge (Friday 6ish pm). There she stood in one corner, with her round black specs, clad in a pale brown wool sweater & grey Long pants. Though my friend kept yakking away, I couldn't help stealing glances. I wanted to say hi but she herself was with a friend.

Then I had to alight at Bishan while she travelled onto PL. I've totally no idea which faculty she's from. Help?

I have a crush on this arts ragger even though I don't really know her name.

Pardon the rant but I just wanted to tell everyone something.

UTown PC Commons and Mac Commons are places where students can study in a conducive and quiet environment. There are notices on the door that even says that. 

Now for those of you who frequently visit and use these facilities, which part of "quiet" do you not understand? It's not a market or a coffeeshop for you and your friends to come in and chat. Some of us are really looking for quiet places to do our work. It is very ignorant and shameful that you do not understand the meaning of "quiet". 

I've seen a bunch of people doing acappella inside a PC Commons meeting room before. Do you honestly think a meeting room is for you to sing inside when others outside are seriously trying to study? Do you guys carry your brains for decoration? Shame on you. You are already in university and you can't differentiate between what to do and what not to do. Meeting rooms are not that sound proof and I think you know that. 

I'm not sure if I'm the only one who feels this way but please. If you want to talk, go outside and do it. Or you can simply shift your study area to Collaborative Commons. You can talk there. 

Finals is coming and everyone is stressed. Do help your peers study in a "quiet" environment. Thank you.

To NUSSU/ the IDIOTS who can't seem to use the SP charging booths properly:

Can we have something in place to ensure that the locked compartments actually HAVE a bloody phone charging inside?

Like 70% of the compartments are permanently locked but without anything charging inside. And it sucks when I actually NEED a charging port because my phone is flat and I am denied not because someone else needs a charge too but because some inconsiderate prick has locked a compartment without actually charging. Kinda defeats the purpose of a charging booth right...

(Maybe ban those NRIC numbers who chope those compartments. That would be nice. Or maybe use the CCTVs to take mugshots of them to be displayed like wall of shame on the TVs that accompany those charging booths. Because public shaming usually works, unless the perpetrators are serious low-EQ dicks. Then at least everyone deserves to know who they are such that they can fall deeper into the abyss of loneliness)

There's a girl in FASS that goes by the name of a fruit. Sometimes I see her on the northeast line train, but I can't get through to her cause she has this immense aura around her. 

Once there was a train breakdown and we were in the same carriage. I was so tempted to tell her "whenever you go, the man goes as well". 

But seriously, she sweetens up my life every time I see her!

I have a huge crush on one of the execs in my CCA. I can hardy work up enough courage to smile at him and hope he notices.

She's got the name of a Disney princess and all the beauty to match,  pale skin that contrasts with her jet-black hair and eyes that sparkle like stars in the night sky. And she stole my heart the moment she asked if the seat next to me was taken the first time round. Ever since then I've always kept the seat next to me free for her, hoping every week that she'll come sit next to me once more.

Not sure if you'll ever see this, A, but thank you for being my eye-candy every week!

Recently there has been several smart charging stations installed around the school, such as in YIH lvl 2 and EA lvl 1. But many of the cabinets are locked despite not having any devices being charged in it. Not sure if people accidentally locked it, or they are using it as their personal charging station in the future.

There was this cute girl in the science library sitting near me but too bad her back was towards me. I kept looking up every 10 seconds from my laptop to see if she would stand up and go to the toilet or pack up her stuff and leave, in hope of her turning to face my direction.

I have always been a good student, and scored straight 'A's for my alvls. But all changed when I went into the army. For some unknown reason, after completing BMT, I was sent into a mono-intake batch. Unlike the ITE/POLY/JC intakes, almost all the mono-intake soldiers have no education above secondary school. Being from a hokkien speaking family, I could naturally blend in with them, although I'm a JC kid. One friday, my fellow platoon mate asked me if I was free that night to help him cover his gang duties that night as he got arrowed to do guard duty in camp. Gang duties. Sounds funny and lame right? Not so when he told me I'd be paid $500 just to stay outside geylang lorong XX to watch for policemen and undercover policemen outside an illegal gambling den owned by his gang. I agreed because I was very curious as to how all these gangs work. Soon, I began working for his gang every weekend. Activities included being watchdogs for gambling dens and whore houses, to supervising banglah workers who helped them sell contraband cigarettes. Naturally, I was asked to officially join their gang as they were not comfortable of a "free-lancing" gang member. No, it wasn't some lame gang like 369 or anything you have heard of. These gangs are so huge, 90% of their members do not even earn money from it. I was in a small, non-violent and profit-driven gang. It all snowballed from that day I joined. I went up the ranks in my gang, and soon started managing drug mules, who are almost always drug addicts themselves. They'd bring in the drugs from JB and all I had to do was to liaise with the drug providers in JB, the drug mules, and the drug peddlers on the streets of Singapore. I was making big bucks. Let's just say I have enough money to buy a spanking new GTR in the first 3 months I started dealing with drugs. Even after enrolling in NUS, I continued these activities and I didn't see myself stopping. Honestly, these activities are not against my moral codes. Gambling? Look at IR. Prostitution? It's legal in Singapore, but we just manage the illegal ones, since it's so damn hard to get a license. Drugs? There are smokers everywhere and I don't see anyone blaming 711s for selling them. However, with my CAP at a new low, I have thought of quitting gang related activities and just be a good student. I already have more than enough money to spend for the next 20 years, so why should I continue? But then again, why study when I can make more money being a gangster? Still, the thought of being sent to changi prison for 20 years, the norm for activities I'm taking part in, is really god damn scary. I am in a serious dilemma now. Any advices?

I was queuing up for mac at SDE earlier when along came a indian person (not local from slang but anyway not important) behind me. When it was his turn, he pointed to the menu on top and said, "i want one singapore spicy babe". Then, the people in the queue and i looked up, and  realised it's actually the slogan for mcspicy. The auntie armchio and tell him its actually mcspicy. I empathise with him as i think he deeply wished there is a hole in ground beside him to bury himself to avoid embarrassment.

To the guy I disturbed for nothing in one of the libraries in campus: really really sorry about that. Should've checked if the area had an electrical socket first.

Also: you're pretty cute.

As a chef wannabe, I use my knife to cut up the vegetables and pound the meat swiftly. Every movement is so swift siala bang. My knife is so sharp that i have to keep it in a safe place, prevent it from cutting up stuff uneccesarily, that is why i have diamond underwear.

The Quiet Area of the Science Library is not meant for your discussion. So fucking get out of the area if you're not intending to study. Are yall that daft?

I've had enough of this love and no love confessions. Not everything in the world is about love. A little digression from it. Does anyone think that the dillys auntie in engin is rude? The way she treats customers and asks them for orders is like we owe her. But what to do there is only 1 dillys there and a subway.

I thought I did something nasty. To my room mate who has the habit of sleeping butt naked in hostel, I saw the roaches flew and land on your belly button, I wanted to hit it but I scare I might hit the wrong place. Okay back to sleep :)

This is a rant, but I would like some advice too. 
The shuttle buses make me sooooooo mad! This just happened at KR mrt. The bus was queued behind the A1 bus and the driver could've opened the doors and let us in (wouldn't have taken half a minute) and he just drove off! The bus was empty! This has happened pretty often already. 
So, is there some channel I can give feedback to? I'm seriously tired of this.

Sitting front of me
You with such beautiful skin
Would you be my friend?

Slim as a princess
Dazzling with red lipstick
You have very good taste

Today the A2 uncle tried to shut the door in my face. Rude. So what did I do? I pried it back open with my bare hands.

I am the bone of my pen
Steel is my body and ink is my blood
I have conquered over a thousand exams
Unknown to love, nor known to life
Having withstood pain to score many As
Yet, these hands will never hold anything
So as I pray, unlimited grade works.

I am a master student in NUS. I met a handsome boy at the bus station Transview Golf Club near utown on 27 Sep (mid-autumn). His name is Essl, who is in the army now, forgive me for invasion of  privacy cause I really want to meet him again. 

It was quite an amazing experience. On that hazy night,I saw him getting on bus 196, the same bus as me, and getting off at Regent Park as I did. After walking behind me for some time, he came to talk to me. I'd never expected that and he said 'u look so cute'. I was so excited and nervous then and I forgot to exchange our contacts.

I was a SCAMP'15 freshie and have noticed that the female seniors in the OG in front of mine (caterpie i think?) are quite cute, especially the 2 of them who were wearing their caps almost all the time. Lately i have been seeing them around science, and in subcomms too. Heard that the 2 of them that i eyecandy are currently the vd of flag & scamp too. Oh how cute, i can't wait to join their eveents and see them in action hehe. Not too sure if they are single or not cause i have been hearing a lot news about them bring stirreed with guys around, but not sure if they are for real or not either. Otherwise i will pluck up my courage to approach them! Hoping for te best hehehehe

Can the RAs in PGP patrol the corridors occasionally, particularly during the night, maybe between 11pm-1am? The block I'm in gets really creepy at night and sometimes I just feel plain scared going to the toilet/kitchen then so I stay in my room and hold my pee

Sometimes when you are tracking a mosquito and ready to smash the shit out of it, it goes into hyperdrive and disappears into another dimension. Seriously, I watched it blur into the space. Anyways, scientists should look into this for available light-speed space travel technology.

hey interrupting the line of love confessions here but i lost a file in utown (most probably fortune village) last friday 23/10 and only realised after it closed that it was gone. it's a plastic box file with red buckles with notes and stationary inside! the file is super important to me so if anyone found it please comment i'll pm you (and maybe buy you a drink) thank you! 
-
 
All this drama recently about science club, but tbh I don't really give a shit. Perhaps it's because I'm too busy eye-candying this small sized, cute looking girl from there (or whatever subcomm she was in) who usually wears this red/white cartoonish kinda jacket haha. Maybe one day I'll work up the courage to talk to you, but for now, I'm just content with looking on from afar :)

There were a few times where I caught my brother wearing my clothes. (more like cross-dress) I feel very uncomfortable and disturbed with that. I not too sure if he did that frequently when no one is at home. Should I confront him?

Me and my ex girlfriend had broke up for 3 years, and we have never seen each other since then until last Friday where i saw her in Zouk. She was drunk and when she saw me, she hugged and dance with me.  At 4am her friends who know me, asked me to send her home as we both live in the west, whereas her friends all stay in the east. I brought her over to my house instead as i only had a rough idea of where she stayed, and she was speaking gibberish drunk language. Back at my place she suddenly grabbed me and ask me to strip her, but knowing that she had a boyfriend already, i controlled my temptation and put the blanket over her and slept on my study chair. The temptation was so strong that night. Gosh.

To the cute medical student in the medical library today:

I was the girl who borrowed the charger from you. Thank you for lending me your charger so willingly when I approached you (: I'm sorry I didn't have the courage to ask you for your name because I already know your name from your nametag ^^  

p.s. : I actually had my charger with me.

There is this medicine guy that is so freaking hunky:o i see him quite a bit in the med library, but recently he seemed to have gone missing for a bit. According to my stalking, he did rag and multiple IFGs but i just cant seem to find where he is... i really want to hanky panky with him but how do i make the first move :( slip a piece of paper with my number in his damn thick textbook next time i see him in the library? And what the hell, how does medicine win rag and IFG? How i wish i was part of that community and get to know you ...

An open question to those staying in hall/ on campus: how to relieve yourself sexually when you have a room mate?? I keep needing to self pleasure whenever I'm home because I can't do it in the room when my room mate around. And I started experiencing the female equivalent of "wet dreams" which I've never had before staying in hall, is this normal? :/

I figured out the problem with the lifts to CLB from Central Forum! Even though now there are 2 lifts, traffic is still slower than should be because when one lift goes up, it does not come back down until the other lift is filled up and going up! Absolutely ridiculous! During peak hours when there are more people going in one direction, it is as if there is only one lift.

The airport actually holds more than just a functional purpose for me. It is symbolic. It is, for many, the gateway to a faraway land. Some would call it a gateway to adventure. Some will call it a gateway home. To me, its symbolism is one of freedom: the freedom to travel to faraway lands to see and understand people, appreciate different cities.

Admittedly, I miss flying. I wish I could fly to more interesting cities. Here is my wish-list:
1. Tokyo (fast, crazy pace!)
2. New York (what makes finance tick?)
3. New Delhi (how does a growing Indian market look like?)
4. Moscow (beautiful, I heard!)
5. Sao Paulo (I have never seen or known much about Latin America)

(The wish-list gives a hint to where I have visited and thus makes life guessing who the confessor is a little easier.)

Should I be a Krisflyer? Nah, just kidding.

Its not just toilets in NUS are dirty ( Though not all, some are quite clean probably due to lesser people using it). I always see how people leave behind a big mess on the table in the foodcourt in Utown after their meal and the cleaners always have a hard time cleaning the mess.

I realized that Koreans are portrayed to have a high susceptibility to amnesia. Whenever I watch dramas with my mother, there will always be someone suffering from memory loss of some sort. 
Perhaps there is some truth to it? Wonder if anyone published a detailed study on this phenomenon? 
Maybe I shall do it for my phd thesis :)

Sorry no juicy confession here but I lost my pouch this morning at around 9+ at FASS, probably around the pathway from the bus stop, lift, the deck and LT14 or at those locations. My pouch is circular, red and has a mickey mouse design on it. It contains my ez link card, matric card, condo access card and a yellow hairtie. Can the person who picked it up please leave a comment on this post? Or email me please, my matric number can be found on the matric card in the pouch (@u.nus.edu) Thanks in advance! :)

to all the people who complain about getting friend zoned (both guys and girls) please read this: 

taken from (http://heart.tumblr.com/post/119563611937/thoughts-on-the-friendzone)

thoughts on the friendzone:

when i was 5 years old my best friend was a boy named kyle who didn’t know how to knock on doors so he made dinosaur noises outside my window to wake me up in the summer until i demonstrated how to ball his fists and slam them against my doors. we collected caterpillars in my trailer park and built them houses while we traded pokemon cards. he wasn’t the only one. there was ben, and mitch, and noah–but kyle’s the only one who hurt me, because when he tried to kiss me and i asked him why, he told me “because you’re a girl and i’m a boy, shouldn’t we like each other?”

i missed him so much and i wondered why he couldn’t just be my friend like he always was.

in the first grade there was rich and joseph and i got sent to detention with them almost every day with a smile on my face. we built block towers and sang to my teacher’s lion king soundtracks when she’d turn the lights off during lunch time. one day they got in a fist fight over me at recess, and i wondered why they felt they needed to share my friendship, like it was something they owned.

in the second grade zach and i played yu gi oh under our desks during free time and i got moved for talking to him constantly. everyone in the class would tease him and i for talking, asking when we were going to date already, asking him if he’d kissed me, and he stopped being my friend.

when i was 11 i met a chubby boy with the name of a colour who wore puffy vests and unwashed t-shirts, with greasy hair and bright blue eyes and a smile that hid hurt behind it. people didn’t like him because he was silly, but i liked him, because i was also silly. he became my friend the day he bought me 5 giant roses and asked me to be his girlfriend, and i politely declined but promised him i’d be his best friend because i’d always wanted a best guy friend that stuck around. we burnt our feet on the concrete during the summer and walked home with the sunset silhouetting us. he talked often about how he loved me, but never blamed me for being me, even though he refused to move on. that boy dyed his hair jet black and sat on the end of my bed playing songs to me on guitar, and all that pent up rage from before didn’t show until the first time he slapped me across the face and called me a dumb cunt.

in the 7th grade there was a boy named ryan who sat next to me on the bus and talked to me about manga. he’d ask me personal invasive questions but i didn’t mind because it was attention and i liked attention. i was dating another guitarist with curly brown hair, one who was much more kind-tempered than the other, and ryan mentioned how much of an asshole he was every day. i wondered, why, why does he think the love of my life is an asshole? but whenever i asked him, he just told me, “girls only date assholes. there’s no room for nice guys like me.”

i wondered, if he was so nice, why did he say such mean things?

he never stopped with me, taking me to movies, hanging out with me, you know. being friendly. i thought we were friends. but then, how many times had i thought that before?

how many times had i bonded with a boy, thought they got me, only for them to ask me if i wanted to make out?

how come when i told ryan i was coming out as a lesbian, he stopped being my friend, and said “damnit, the one girl i really want to pound into a mattress, and she’s only interested in chicks!”

there was a boy my junior year who stayed up all night with me until the sun rose, talking about life, past loves, hopes, dreams. beneath a million twinkling stars spanning forever, he brushed long brown hair out of his eyes and listened to me talk about the history that made me. then he asked me if i’d ever consider dating a guy, and complained about how he’d never get laid.

when i told him no a couple hundred times, he found new girls to listen to.

i would sit on the couch and play zelda with dakota, and he’d talk about all my favourite games with me. he was the closest thing to support i had, and the letters and poems he wrote me were always so kind and friendly. but he’d put his arms around me on the couch, and no matter how many times i told him i was uncomfortable, he’d still come over every day and do it.

“don’t you know how it feels to love someone and not have them love you back? don’t you know what it feels like to be friendzoned?”

when i meet guys who talk about the friendzone, who talk about the girls who don’t give “nice guys” like them a chance, i always want to just say

when i was 10 years old i met a girl whose brown hair fell across her shoulders and whos eyes sparkled when the sunlight hit them, whose voice was like velvet and whose scent was like mountain smoke, who made me dizzier than a fly climbing a sugar hill. and i’m 19 years old, and i still love her, and she knows, and she doesn’t love me.

but my first thoughts upon hearing her rejection were not “what a bitch,” were not “she just wants a douchebag and not a nice girl like me!” were not “im going to keep pushing her until she dates me,”

they were

“she is the best friend i have ever had, and i am the best she’s ever had, and i would hate to take that away from her.”

so before you play the victim, mr. Nice Guy, before you angrily throw your fedora on the ground and blame the girl you claim to adore so much:

put yourself in the shoes of a girl who thought she made a wonderful friend, only to find out that he just wanted her for sex. that he just wanted her for a relationship. a girl who was just an object to win, a prize. a girl who’s trust you’ve just shattered.

maybe she friendzoned you. but you girlfriendzoned her, first.

I have abstained from masurbation for one month but yesterday while I was taking a nap in CLB level 6, dirty thoughts entered my head and I accidentally had a really bad wet dream that caused the chair to be stained. I really hope no girls sat there after me, I am not ready to be a father yet

It works when you are confident. I've this hall mate whom i known for the past year, she's pretty, smart and outgoing, best of all friendly to me. Sadly, she has a boyfriend.

I decided to just go for it. I went to find her in her room. It all started with a chat and then escalated to a full blown pounding session before i squirted on her chest. Took some pics as well. The only problem was that we both didn't had a condom so we decided to just go for pulling out. We've been doing it for a week already, and she isnt getting morning sickness.

To the dude who bragged about blowing his load across the room, I totally understand how you feel.

There was once before class started and no one was around, my friend bet that she could make me cum before the lesson started. She gave me the blowjob of my life and i blasted it right across the classroom. Later, someone dropped his pen around that area. I smiled. ;)
-
 
My gf is confusing af. During the heat of the moment, she would say things like 'I want you in me' but when I start to slightly increase the heat up a notch, ever so slightly, like bringing my pole near her Vee (without the intention of insertion) , she gets all 'No dont' and weird and uncomfortable. And in my mind I'll be like 'Whaaaaaaat'.

Thats not all. She is so paranoid that she thinks, just by touching her externally with my penis over her genitals will get her pregnant. dafuq.

Overheard: 

"We should not give seats to old people. And the reason is very simple. When you buy an air ticket, the cheaper fares get less service than say First Class tickets. So similarly, old people are most likely using concession fares. So they should receive less service than ordinary people." 

Should I laugh...or cry at this...

Has anyone experienced this? My girlfriend did an excellent job and I blew my load across the room. I'm so proud of myself.

I know this sounds borderline disgusting, but I make use of pictures from a particular batchmate and imagine he was giving me a blowjob. Nutrition for his otherwise scrawny frame.

I should also buy him some new shoes to replace his usual black stripes --- they look too worn out. ;)

Oh my, imagine my horror when I opened my inbox and saw the biggest horror... Is it just me or does the new BME shirt just look ghastly... Do the people in BME club think university students have the maturity of a secondary school kid? sure it looks cute, but the max anyone is going to wear (if any at all...) is going to be during BME events...or pajamas... :/

Hey girl ! I really enjoyed the times we spent together from the bottom of my heart. Only a fool like you will find me attractive ! I'm just a hopeless nerd without any talent, without any goals in life. Truth to be told, you are the only person that will laugh uncontrollably at my lame jokes. Never the less, I'm glad that I can at least bring some light into the heart of a emo and depress freak like you =) . Did anybody tells you that you look like an angel when you are laughing? So you better stop crying like a sissy bitch and smile more okay! This world isn't all dark and hopeless. I wish I can dig my eyes out and transplant it to you. so that you can see all the amazing and miraculous stuffs that I always see. 

Sadly, our carefree days are numbered.... I know our bond has to end sometime, somewhere. We are like two different leafs, brought together by some random wind. The wind will blow once again and set us into two different paths. When that day arrives, promise me that you will fly higher and Soar into the blue skies filled with fluffy clouds! Don't be a burden and fall into the dark cave again, I will not come and save you hehe! 

Muackz ! I will steal a kiss from you before I take off. I want you to hate me forever, remember me as "the greatest jerk".

Hey guys! For those who are living near Eunos Link/Bedok Reservoir/Ubi, do download the app Beeline so we can buspool together at a lower cost. It's currently $4-6. It might be more expensive than the public transport but saves a lot of time. I can imagine myself catching up on work while travelling in the bus too. 
It's a great app for people staying in other areas to get to NUS together too!

To the group using the discussion room in clb on tuesday morning (20/10/2015) at around noon.
The guys were laughing so loudly and SO DAMN OBNOXIOUSLY. Even we who were seated on the opposite end of the level could hear you. And yes, the only word fitting enough to describe you guys' laughter is OBNOXIOUS.
Please be considerate. Its called a discussion room, not a see-who-can-laugh-the-loudest room.

Living in campus accommodation was the first time in my life I have my own room, so I started developing habits like sleeping on no fixed pattern, eating in my room, sleeping naked, watching porn and other disgusting habits.
This year I moved out of campus and share a room outside with a roomie. I managed to curb my inappropriate behaviors, until last night.
The haze was so bad that I had to close the windows and it got really stuffy in my room. Good thing my roomie was out for the night, so I  went to sleep naked. All was well except this morning I overslept and she came home to find me hardly covered in my bed.
Now things are just really really awkward...

Okay. I am thinking of setting up a library police force.  I will take 1 dollar per semester from every student. I will enforce coupons (as with cars) for those students who leave their seats for more than 15 minutes. Coupons last a maximum one hour. Any exceeding will result in their belongings being taken away by the police. To retrieve the belongings the offender must write a 500 word essay  or pay 5 dollars to retrieve the said items.

Would people please stop looking at their phones and be more aware of their surroundings? 

1. Like moving in on a bus so that more people can board. Sometimes a bus doesn't even stop because the front is so full, the poor bus driver can hardly have a good view of his side view mirrors, but the back of the bus is so empty because of a row of phone zombies that are oblivious to the situation. And when the bus driver shouts "move in", nobody moves because they are all have their earphones on. 

2. Going in to a lift, stare at the phone and forget all about holding the open button to people that are coming into the lift. If you really want to do that, because the reception and connection in the lift is great, then don't stand in front of the lift buttons and block all of them. 

3. Crossing the zebra crossing and looking at phones. Yes the drivers are suppose to stop for you, but it's not nice to stroll while being fixated on the small screen and letting them wait longer than they should. 

Whatever happened to the compulsory civics and moral education we had. Probably not enough, because we didn't have phones like now then. Till technology kills society one day...

I picked yet another tome and set it upon the table. All around me are tomes of ancient wisdom, containing all the powers needed to smite my competitors. Dust (and haze) had settled over these books of wisdom. I lifted the cover of one tome. Damn. Written in the tongue of the ancients, a language almost lost through the passage of time. What wisdom, what powers, what secrets can I raise in this hazy room of tomes?

I need your advice guys, one weeks ago I went to Vietnam over the weekend. There I had unprotected sex with two girls I met in the club, a japanese girl and one local. Now I'm concerned and stressed out. I really wanted to use protection but both girls refused! They said it doesn't feel the same.
What should I do? Am I in danger of catching an STD?

That day when I was at this corner in a certain building, there was this soft moaning sound. I decided to explore and true enough, in one of the cubicles were these 2 girls giving this dude a run for his money. Honestly how did this guy do it.

I've lost my wallet since yesterday. It is black male Polo & Racquet Club, containing my matric card and number of debit cards. Last time I saw it was at the bus stop at Kent Ridge MRT (the one that going back to PGP). I boarded an A2 bus going to PGP at around 10.00pm. 

If any kind soul finds it, please reply to this and I'll PM you, or you can send an email to the matric number (adding @u.nus.edu to the matric number without the last character). Really really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance

Does anyone feel like you don't have a voice? I don't know how to describe it.
It feels horrible, when you say something, people can't even see that you are saying something and never listen. It is almost like you are invisible. I feel this way all the time. It is not that I don't speak loudly enough. I do speak at a normal volume. I guess I am not worthy enough that their subconscious completely ignores my voice and their brains wash it away as just another background noise. It is completely demoralizing and absolutely heart breaking when it happens.
Has anyone here ever felt that way? What should I do to change this? Please help. Thank you.

Society has shaped guys perspective of attractiveness as being buff. To me, being buff has its pros and cons. It cannot be denied that buff means getting more attention from girls, looking better in clothes, and of course more confidence. But buff guys on public transport is a bane. The amount of space the muscles occupy can be replaced by an OL rushing to work. Also on the bus too. 

Everyone is working towards the buff zone. Why not stop and think about it. Would you rather be healthy? Or would you rather drown yourself with protein powder.

It was after my JC prom the first time I was hit on, some guy in the hotel lobby said I was beautiful and asked me for my number. I gave it to him, but my friends were appalled. They said it was creepy and dangerous and told me to block him immediately when he sent me a text to check that the number he got was correct. I listened to them out of peer pressure (well, I just told him I wasn't comfortable talking to him) and still regret it to this day - I didn't even get to know the only guy who ever asked me for my number. What do you guys think? Did I do the right thing?

Seriously people, if you guys ever shop at a place that allows you to try on their clothes, do the fitting room staff a favor by returning the clothing in a proper manner (not inside-out or a ball of clothes like laundry). I understand that the staff are paid to handle whatever shit you dish at them but seriously, such actions reflect on your upbringing. 

Like come on, how hard is it to just get the clothes that you took (probably 7pcs or less allowed at a time for most places) back in the correct side out before returning?

Pokemon Shuffle has recently become a trending game that many people are into (if you haven't played it, pls do. It's super fun, but can be addictive - pretty much like candy crush).

But playing the game can be make people want to vomit blood sometimes, especially:
1) when you CANNOT catch the Pokemon at a catchability rate of > 80% *SERIOUSLY?!*
2) when you use a Great Ball but to no avail *fuggg*,
3) when you finally defeated a Pokemon and here comes the 30+ combo you needed as bonus *-.-*

So fellow players, what are some of your other pet peeves or even tips/ strategies you'd like to share?

I am a white male student who is on exchange at NUS currently. I'd just like to share a serious case of pinkerton syndrome that freaked me out so badly!

I was walking from Science Faculty to Yushof Ishak alone in broad daylight. Suddenly a female chinese singaporean approached me from behind. Out of nowhere, she asked me where I'm from. I mistakenly thought that maybe she approached me to ask directions to some place and I told her I am from the States. Then, she told me that she would like to be friends with me and asked for my facebook. Feeling uncomfortable, I told her I was  late for my appointment and I had to go. She walked beside me for a bit, saying 'I know it's a bit strange that I'm asking you suddenly like this. But I would like to be friends with you'. I just mumbled that I'm getting late and I really have to go. Subsequently, I walked away quickly and she stops walking beside me. I was near the University Hall bus stop by then.

Then when I was near RVR, she suddenly came up behind me again. Then, she becomes even more creepy, saying again she wanted to be my friend and then saying something like, 'I saw you on the street last week and I fell in love with you.  You are quite a hunk and I really want to have a baby with you'. At that point, I was scared as hell. So I just started walking faster, and she kept talking and try to walk beside me. I said that I'm not interested in her and I actually had to tell her twice to stop following me and then I walked as fast as I could into Yushof Ishak, into the food court where there were more people around, and thankfully by then, she stopped following me. 

Honestly, I never thought such a thing could happen in Singapore, and it's really gotten on my nerves. How does a complete stranger approach someone like that, and behave like such a creep? You give such a bad name to female chinese singaporean everywhere.

Any advice on what should I do if I see her again and/or she tries to approach me again? 

PS: I knew she is a female chinese singaporean because of her strong singlish accent

Usually guys are the disgusting ones, but I have the opposite problem. My gf has the bad habit of purposely farting in front of me, making me smell her morning breath, and does one of my most-hated things: lying down on my bed in hall after a run. It's not as if I am totally opposed to this (I am kind of growing to like her stink), but at the same time...I don't know...

My friends were not who they were. Firstly, they're people i've known since JC1 (same class), and we've been in the same clique for the past 4 years. However, 2 nights ago we had an ex-class chalet, I just felt like I actually didnt know them at all. 

It all started out normal, we had fun at monopoly deal, then watching a movie , having snacks and a fun time in general. There are a total of 8 of us in the clique, 3 girls and 5 of us guys. Anyway, halfway during the movie, one of the girls (C) said she was tired and wanted to retire at her room. And that was that, nobody paid much attention to that as we were all engrossed in the movie. 

I later had the urge to release my filled bladder and proceeded to the bathroom. When I went back, it was when i noticed that there was only 1 of the guys and 2 of the girls left on the couch, and I asked them where the other 3 guys were. They were surprised as well as they didn't notice them leaving, but they just turned back and continued their focus on the movie. 

Being curious, I went to look for them in the guy's room (there were only 2 rooms; girls; guys), and they werent there. I didn't think of looking in the girls room as C was sleeping there, or so I thought. But as I walked pass the girls room, I noticed that there was this soft moaning sound. I opened the door to the room as quietly as I could just to allow for a small peek-hole. To my horror, I saw C and 2 of the other guys on the bed together naked. There was whitish liquid spewed over her belly area and her chest, and one of the 2 guys had his appendage stuck into her mouth with the other guy had his in her vagina. She was moaning softly as the two guys did their business with her. It was when I realised that the third guy was sitting on the chair near to the door (on the other side), thank god I did not get discovered. The third guy was was cleaning his appendage whilst using his phone seemingly video-ing down the act. It all seemed normal to them and the two guys made some conversation as well with her intermittently whipping it out of her mouth to say a few words.

I was just stunned for a good 30 seconds or so before i regained my senses and hurried back to the TV area. I didnt dare to tell the others as I was simply shocked and did not know how they would react or in turn have an impact on our group's friendship. But now that I changed my mind and felt the need to tell them I just cant, because bringing up that very topic would seem weird and there is no evidence. I just cant view my clique the same way I did anymore.

To the girl I met on thursday at UTown at night (who was wearing black shorts and a white t shirt with maroon vanz shoes); I am just bursting with curiousity and am extremely worried right now. 

That night you just randomly came up to me, asking if im spending the night alone, to which i replied that I was heading back to my hall. Subsequently you asked if you could come along with a naughty tinge in your voice. We then went back and you gave me the blowjob (the first blowjob i ever had, but I was too shy to admit it was my first time) before we had a passionate pounding session for the next 40 minutes through the front and back door. 

Little did I care about the fact that you somehow did not want to use protection then, I thought nothing of the excuse you gave that it was troublesome to get any and it was fine.

But now I am getting worried as the number you gave me the next morning was false and I cant find your profile by your 'name' and im beginning to suspect if something is amiss, please respond if that's you because Im spilling my brains thinking about this the whole day. And to the rest could you guys please give possible reasons as to why this had happened?...

Ok I seriously don't get this, why some girls wear until so daring, especially those sleeveless one can see bra one, then nvm lor , u chio ma , we guys see d also happy, then once these girls catch u looking, they straight cover up, or their friend help them to cover, then u can read their lips one, " eh that guy damn tiko leh staring at ur bra sia "
I mean like wth u wear until like that , then u blame people humsap for ogling , then I go out jogging naked I scold u tiko for staring at my dick can ornot? 
sibeh sian one la, scare people see then cover up lo

That moment when you walk past a corridor and you see a tutorial mate from a past module and you both make eye contact and in your mind you have a gut feeling you both know each other exists and in that frame of half a second you contemplate whether or not to say hi and then you get lost in thought and just walk past them and then now you know you can never say hi to them again.

My girlfriend enjoys it tremendously when I jerk off onto her face and even more so when I shoot into her mouth. She even told me that she likes the taste of my semen. 

However, recently, she told me that it tasted different sometimes, and that she didn't like it as much when that happens. Could anyone give a plausible reason as to why this is happening? Is it affected by diet?

This post goes out to Fat people. 

There was one post asking if anyone will judge if a fat person use the gym, and how long it will take etc.  Yes, this is for you. 

I was like you. I was afraid of judgement, and that resulted in me not working out for a long time. As a result, i became massive. i was close to a 120kg in 2013. I was only 19 than, and doing my NS. That was when pre diabetes, hypertension, and what not started coming in. And i decided to change. 

A little history about myself. I was enlisted into the PES C obese squard. it's reserved for Fat people who cant do BP. Thus, opportunities to work out is literally zero. 

At my peak, I wore 4XL. My JC tshirt was 3XL. 

I started losing weight in 2014. Fast forward to today, I stand at 85Kg, and wearing a size M. 

No, i did not take 1 year 10 months to lose 35 KG. In fact, I took only 5 months. I hit 85KG in 2014 May. 

I am not here to boast, but here to share some tips with you on what works for us, and what dont. I reckon that it will take someone as fat to understand someone who is fat. No, I wasn't fat. I was "Severly Obese".

Lets start with exercises. When your BMI is above 35, ( I used BMI instead of weight because maybe you are tall) PLEASE DO NOT RUN. You are probably gonna spoil and hurt your ankles and knees. Do low impact sports like swimming. Swimming is a good work out. 

When your BMI starts to go below 35 and your weight below 95, start Jogging. Do slow Jogs. Do it at your own pace. The goal is simple, perspiration. The more the better. When you are comfortable, start doing Sprints, do the Tabata Protocol (at least 6 sets in one workout). Weight exercises is not as effective in helping you lose weight. IF you really wanna lose weight, than do cardio. 

Because your goal is to lose weight. You have to try to do at least 45 mins of swimming/running EVERYDAY. Try to alternate to give ur ankles/knees time to rest. 

While exercising is important, the key ingredient here is diet. In that 5 months that I tortured myself, I limited myself to Fresh salads (no dressings), fruits, clean proteins. everyday. No sweet drinks, no nonsense. Is it healthy? probably not. but did it work? hell yeah. If you wanna lose your belly fats, than stop eating oil/fats and artificial sugar. no amount of sit ups will match the effectiveness of cutting oil and artifi. sugar out of your diet. trust me. 

You probably hear most people say, "its all in your mind", "the leaner guy is inside you". YES, that is true. you got to want it. and look at it this way. You are saving alot of your future money on medical care. And you get to wear nice clothes and what not, you get my point. 

I cant promise that you can do it in 5 months. But remember, there isnt a timeframe for weight lost. It is a lifestyle. You gotta change your way of life. Incorporate exercises and healthy diet in your life. If you are going gym to lose weight, that dont waste your time. Get out there, set a timer, maybe 30 mins. and Just run, swim. You can start bulking up or getting ripped when you are lean. 

so what happen after I hit 85? well, this start to get real slow. there is  a certain point in your journey that you wont see results. But its ok! the most important thing is you are now healthier. And of course, if you want to really be lean, you got to increase your intensity and time.  

This journey is tough. so damn tough. But its a journey that you have to do it now! once you pass a certain age, (21/22/23) things will get much harder. Do it once, do it well. That 5 months changed my life. I wont say that I am lean now. In fact im still quite plump. but now, Im "chubby" instead of "severely obese" and that, is a great feeling.

I did a full marathon and vertical marathon late last year. The feeling of being able to complete such a challenge justifies the suffering. 

So all the best in your journey ! 

The only motivation you need, is to just get UP and get OUT. 

And trust me, Life will never be the same again. =)

All these posts about guys and cars... Not all girls only like guys with cars ok. I would like to believe that I'm not in the minority in that I'm okay with my boyfriend not having a car and I actually enjoy the bus and train rides that we get to take together (we live one mrt station away from each other) and that it gives us a platform (pun not intended) and time to talk especially since his attention won't be on driving. Yes it may be inconvenient if we want to go to those ulu cafes or what but it's also an adventure figuring out the way and trying to get there. Also it allows you to perfect the art of meeting on the same cabin on the train.

Has anyone come across a black laptop case with a 13" MacBook Air inside it? The laptop also has a blue keyboard protector. Last seen around town green or the Cinnamon/Tembusu Dining hall between 6 and 8pm on the 15th of October (Thursday). I would really appreciate it if some kind soul would return it if they found it, for obvious reasons.

Hi, i am the OP of  . A great thank you to those commenters who offered the tips for the guide of weight loss and exercise. However, there are some doubts to be clarified. How long will  it take to diet before i could plan the workout in morning and evening if i were to take meals prior to this? Based on my research, it is advisable to diet around 2-3 hours for this right?

I might not want to be too muscular for my arms but rather like my arms to be slim and just nice. Same goes for my legs. ;( I would like to know how i can shelve the fats away from my upper leg thighs. By the way, is the brown rice considered as in low carbo? Is it advisable to have brown rice taken in morning? Yes, i definitely will be having small meals.  

Thank you again!

Hi I'm the OP of . Thanks for the replies, really appreciate it. The thing is my CAP is very low. So why does NUS see CAP if I want to start on a clean slate? I mean the whole reason why I'm changing is cause of I'm doing poorly in science!

Sometimes when I see my crush in school and get horny, I will proceed to jerk off in the toilet and clear the residue using a tissue. When my crush is not looking, i will throw that tissue into her bag, hoping she will touch it when she opens her bag.

It sounds pretty sick but the thought of her touching it makes me feel like I have impregnated her and that she belongs to me...

The person this post is for prolly won't even read it but...that tanned guy in the grey T shirt who got off of D1 (around 2.30 Thursday) and got into the lift at CLB, you were standing close to me in the lift with your back facing me and I had the strongest urge to grab onto your ass ;)
I'm sorry but you're just too damn sexy. Next time be careful of perverted girls like me:P

To those super buff and strong guys in the gym... How long did it take to achieve what you've got right now? 
When I went to the UTown gym my first time to a gym few weeks ago, I was inspired and aspiring to be like you guys since I'm very skinny and weak and beta and etc and couldn't even bench 10 kg per hand lol. Just want to know what should I expect if I were to go on the path of the iron...

Ever since I went on exchange, I have wondered why NUS doesn't have any parties on campus. I don't mean those raunchy sex parties, but those where you hang out on campus and have some beer together. Those are really common overseas and it was really fun to meet other students.

Recently, I finally came across such an event.
(https://www.facebook.com/events/515009721989078/)

I think it is really cool. You get to make new friends, have a few drinks together, play some games and generally just let your hair down on a Friday evening. But now that there is such an opportunity, I am a little worried about being judged.. I am a lady and I am afraid that my friends might think that I am a party animal when I am actually a hardworking student too (my faculty can be quite judgemental). 

I really want to go though. Will more people (especially ladies) go with me so this becomes seen as a 'normal' thing?

I was on my way home from school at around 10:30pm as I usually study in school since it's more conducive. I was walking towards my block when I notice a group of 4 uncles chatting on a bench in front. I thought I should probably turn back and take a detour but in the end I didn't as I thought I may make things worst if they think I am afraid of them. I regretted my decision because the moment I walked past them, one of them called out "Oi Oi!" but I ignored and continued walking and then they started to "hahahaha" among themselves. I am very sure he isn't calling out to someone else as there's no one else already. For your information, I wasn't wearing any revealing clothes, just t shirt and pe shorts (close to knee length) nor make-up so I think that as long as you are a young girl, you have a higher probability of getting "disturbed" by leacherous guys. 

What should I do to avoid such incidences in the future? It's not like I purposely go home late....Why is it that as a female,in particular younger ones, you don't really get the freedom to move around at night because you are more likely to be "disturbed"? 

Most importantly, can guys offer your perspective on why do some males behave this way the moment they see a girl walk past? Is it in males' nature to get very excited in seeing younger girls, only difference is how well they stop themselves from disturbing girls?

Please don't filter this post I really hope to find her! Shout out to the girl whom I made eye contact with on the train and alighted at buona vista. She has purple highlights on her hair and wore a chupa chups tee. I really hope to see you again and I regretted not talking to you because I lack the courage to. Please help me find her!

You know how there have been countless of posts on nus whispers regarding how people have le sexy time on campus or in halls? For the longest time, I have been a subscriber of the belief that all these posts are from trolls regurgitating their wildest, suppressed imagination that wouldn't normally see the daylight if weren't for the advent of the internet and the anonymity it brings us. I have always thought that NUS students are pure and innocent and always have their CAP and future in their minds, so who would have the time to partake in such naughty indulgence? ....Right?

Well, just a few days ago I had to reshape my entire perception of NUS campus life and had a seismic reform of my outlook on life. I live in a relatively unhappening hall, with no scandals of any sort popping out throughout my 3 years of stay here. So one fine day I was sitting at my desk in hall, doing my work like a diligent student should, then suddenly I heard a girl moaning. I was like 'wtf did I accidentally open my magic folder omgomgomg'. After approximately 10 seconds of panicking, It turns out that the moaning actually came from the next door. 

Upon this realization, my reaction went from wtf to WTF, simply because I am living in a guys only corridor and I am pretty sure my neighbor is a guy as well! Further exchange went on between my neighbor and the girl, and its a roller coaster ride again. Various thoughts streamed through my head, and these ranged from happy thoughts like 'wow I can't believe I am witnessing hall history, can I join?' to sad thoughts like 'so the stories on NUSWhispers were actually true, where is my love? And after mugging for 3 years where is my CAP 5? My neighbor has higher CAP than me!'.

Well, so I guess the moral of the story is, there is more to school life than just merely mugging, and that there should always be a work life balance.

Ladies and gentlmen, 

I am a girl who weights 64kg and with a height of 159cm. Do you know there are ways of losing my weight and reducing my arms, belly and leg fats? I have been controlling the diet. 

Have been trying to eat oats twice daily and as for lunch, it varies but of course it will include fruits and vegetables. I just started this month. At first it w was 65kg initially. I would like to tone my 3 parts which I mentioned above . 

Please give advice or tips for this ! It will be appreciated by me! Thanks!

Hoping to lose down to 55kg by this year!

A few weeks back, as usual in the early morning when I parked my car at the SRC, this cute girl who parked beside me came to ask me to help retrieve her iPhone stuck underneath her car seat. I could see her small hands were already bruised from her previous failed attempts. We finally managed to retrieve her phone after some laughter and more failed tries. I believe it was love at first sight, I wanted to know about her but I didn't have the chance to because I was going to be late for my appointment with my professor.

So for the next few days, I tried to park at the same place as she did, sometimes, even waiting for quite some time beside her car, but I didn't manage to catch her. Last Friday, I finally see her again around 8pm. She was alone, and tearing as she walked towards me and her car. Instantly, I felt my heart breaking apart. I wanted to go forward to ask if she was alright but she drove away almost immediately before i could even approach her. In a worried state for her, I followed behind her to make sure she was alright. She was speeding and I wouldn't expect her to be such a good driver, given her probation plate, so I lost her on the way. After that night, I didn't see her again in the SRC carpark, perhaps she parked somewhere else? I'm actually worried for her and this time, I don't want to lose her again. Can anyone here help me locate who this girl is? She has pale skin, long dark hair and drives a grey C class with a P plate.

I'd just like to share something that majorly creeped me out - as a rant against such people and also I guess as a warning to others that such people exist. 

So, today morning when I was walking from Utown to engin, alone but in broad daylight, a man (Indian, I guess) approached me from behind. Out of nowhere, he asks me where I'm from (I'm an Indian girl), and mistakenly thinking that maybe he approached me to ask directions to someplace, I tell him. Then, he tells me that he would like to be friends with me and asks for my facebook. Feeling uncomfortable, I tell him I'm late for class and I have to go. He walks beside me for a bit, saying 'I know it's a bit strange that I'm asking you suddenly like this but I saw you and I would like to be friends with you'. I just mumble that I'm getting late for class, I really have to go, then I just walk away quickly and he stops walking beside me. This was on the UTown bridge, near the Museum bus stop.

Not that bad, right? 

Then when I'm near E3A/EA, he suddenly comes up behind me again. Then, he becomes even more creepy, saying again he wants to be my friend and then saying something like, 'I saw you on the street last week and I fell in love with you'. At this point, I'm majorly freaked/creeped out/pissed as hell. So I just start walking faster, and he kept talking something and trying to walk beside me, and I said that I'm not interested and I actually had to tell him twice to stop following me and then I walked as fast as I could into EA, into the cafe where there were more people around, and thankfully by then, he stopped following me. 

Honestly, I never thought such a thing could happen in Singapore, and it's really gotten on my nerves. How does a complete stranger approach someone like that, and behave like such a creep? You give such a bad name to Indians everywhere, and despite being here for a college education, you still behave like a mannerless, creepy jackass. 

Any advice on what should I do if I see him again and/or he tries to approach me again?

Just wanted to say there's a cool USP grey-haired girl. As if she slapped her hair onto a wall of wet green paint. ;)

Recently, I got molested by a senior from my CCA in the gym. I finally understand why people always say "never judge a book by its cover". He seem like a decent gentleman but deep down inside, he is a beast who preys on weak and vulnerable girls. 

It all started when he volunteered to help me stretched my inner thighs and I accepted his goodwill. He then brought a mat and asked me to lay down and rest my left leg on his shoulders, this position that we adopted is quite awkward . During the stretching process, he pressed his penis onto my private part for a brief moment which made me felt uncomfortable. Initially, I thought that it was just an accident and expressed my wish to stop this exercise but he insisted that we finish things up. Yielding in to his persuasion, is the worst possible decision that  I  had ever made. While stretching my right leg, he proceed on with his pervert acts again! He got even bolder this time round, the duration of his penis contact with my private part, got even longer. I literally froze in horror as he placed his hands near my butt and told me to relax. 

You guys may scold me for not confronting him at that point of time. I'm just a petite girl and he is 3 times bigger then me, my fear simply paralyzed me. After a few days, I finally garnered enough courage to confront him over the phone. Instead of apologizing, he said nasty stuffs to me that insult my body figure. Even though I had broken down and started crying, he showed no remorse and continued to called me " a whore that thinks too highly of herself". My ordeal is not over yet as he went around to spread false rumors to tarnish my reputation in school. Many of my friends believe his lies and started to shun me, while some other guys will stare at me in a contempt way and giggle away.

Lately, when I saw his facebook profile picture with his girl smiling from ear to ear. ...Do I feel pitiful? Is she pitiful? The guy whom you re with now is a scumbag who molested me in the gym. The one who made me undergo counselling and cried every night then. Do you feel sick now? Will you still be happy?

Stop pushing me to my limits! I will bring a knife to school and stab your bloody face, you disgusting scum. You shouldn't have born into this word!

Bus driver of A1 spammed "Please Stand Clear of the Doors" around 10 times. After a guy asked everyone to move in, one asshole boarded the extra space, resulting in move spams. Funny thing is, the door wouldn't hit anyone and there's enough space to safely close the doors ._. Frustrating

Dear cute-dude-I-met-in-elevator, (in one of the UTown residential colleges)
When I'm groggy, sulking and dragging myself to a Monday 8am class, thank you for the dashing smile and wonderful "Morning!". You truly "turned my frown upside down".

I'm looking forward to Monday mornings now!

Hope to see you! XP

Can't help laughing whenever I attend CM1401 lectures...it's taught by Mr Fun Man (that's his real name no joke). He blasts loud  music before the lecture (presumably to make our neurons fire a little) and throws in cheesy but funny jokes throughout the lecture. I don't understand why people find him lame...he's just trying his best to shove new concepts into our gonna-explode-encylopedic brain of knowledge...

to all the guys who say that girls should dress "appropriately" because rape blah blah and believe u make so much sense, here's the deal: you're not. 

because if u don't think u have to dress "appropriately" so a gay guy won't come touch or ogle at you, then women don't have to do the same. 

this is not common sense or "crime prevention". this is just u and the patriarchy telling u it's okay to police how women dress but not okay for gay guys to stop u from wearing singlets that show off ur biceps and FBT shorts that show off ur calves. 

(also most sexual assault misty happens with someone the victim knows, so rly, what u wear has little to nothing to do with sexual assault prevention.)

If someone barged into an old man's house and stabbed the old man to death before taking his valuables, no one would say the old man should have triple locked his house. We will definitely condemn the murderer without doubt. So why is it we condemn the rapist but also say 'ah the girl should have dressed more conservatively'?

TW assault, violence, graphic descriptions

 some numbers from the US
Approximately 4/5 of rapes were committed by someone known to the victim. 
Approximately 50% of all rape/sexual assault incidents were reported by victims to have occured within 1 mile of their home or at their home.
(https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders)

And from a Reddit AMA by a perpetrator, he had been watching his victims, one for a week and one for a month; it wasn't something that happened just because they "walk[ed] down a deserted street at night"
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d3n73/i_am_a_convicted_rapist_released_one_year_ago/c0xbwab

He also mentioned the desire to overpower being more intense than the arousal
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d3n73/i_am_a_convicted_rapist_released_one_year_ago/c0xbgaf

If you don't see how your post is blaming victims yet, try thinking of how often victims of other violent crimes are asked if they prevented themselves from being a victim. A murder trial rarely focuses on how stabbable the victim was, and bank tellers probably aren't advised to wear bulletproof vests and have a gun in plain sight to deter potential  robbers. How much blame would you assign an elderly person being robbed of jewelry in a lift? Should they not have worn jewelry?

I was raped wearing baggy cargo pants and a t-shirt, in bright daylight. Masturbated to wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Molested at a bus stop around noon, with other people around, wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Would your advice to me, then, be to stop wearing jeans and t-shirts? How about your advice to the people in http://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/sexual-assault-survivors-answer-the-question-what-were-you-w who were mostly wearing school clothes, work clothes, or attacked in their own homes?

I always see some very chio and cute girls around campus and also at the gym , wanting to approach them but scared that later she reject me , or label me as pervert, and worse, make fun of me with their clique. 
How to approach girls without resulting in an sibeh paiseh situation? If I'm asking this u can roughly guess that my face and height cannot really make it d la .

To that girl in the Meow or Never t-shirt taking the train at KR MRT today: you're the most beautiful girl I've ever laid eyes on! I would've tried talking to you, if it were customary for guys to make friends with random girls on public transport without seeming like a creep :/

I came from a family that follow strict Chinese traditions. Being the eldest son, I'm expected to set good examples for my younger siblings. Ever since secondary school, my dad had been warning me to keep my hands clean from bad habits like smoking and gambling etc. Most people would developed rebellious tendencies during their puberty period, however I'm really an odd ball. I only learnt to argue back at my parents after I enrolled into university. To make matters worse, I had mixed myself with bad company. I'm sure many of you have heard before the name of my notorious secret society -> XX会。In order to pledged my loyalty and allegiance to the gang, I even went to tattoo it's gang symbol on my body. Every time my mum mop the floor , she will ask me to raise up my legs. I'm worried that she will discover the 反清 tattoo under my left feet and 復明 tattoo under my right feet. When that happens , they will surely disown me and throw me out of the house =(

Hi. I'm writing this post because I'm interested to hear what NUS students think of the hair salon in UTown. Just leave a comment about your impression of it, it can be anything (e.g. quality of haircut, dual-pricing ($5 & $10), customer service, etc.) ^^

Hi, I have really small boobs, around size 26A (if there is even such a size??) or 28AA. Have been playing sports since i was young and I do not know if it affects chest size but I've always been skinny and wearing sports bra all the time. However, now that I've stopped playing (year 3 and studies and internship and work are getting in the way), I have no more reason to wear sports bras and I find that I do not know where to get bras of such sizes in singapore. Please don't make jokes like "boobs so small wear bra for what" because I am already aware of that fact and very self conscious. I know of online shops overseas that has my size but I feel unsure about not trying on the bra before buying and most of them are quite pricey. Please do advice :<

To the girl that offered me a chair at MacDonald's at around 12pm+ today, I would like to thank you for your simple act of kindness and taking the initiative to offer me an empty chair. I hope you are reading this as it did brighten up my day for a moment. NUS needs more people like you :)

Every guy will look at girls.

Some days you see cute ones, sometimes pretty, a few will be hot and sexy, and once in a while you come by beautiful ones.

Then there are those days where you see those that make your heart skip a beat.

Not really gourgeous or some model material, but just someone who just seem so attractive for who they are.

Thank you, girl with black specs in a simple t-shirt in UTown today, for letting my heart take a momentary rest.

Central that was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many. We found a new library, dozens of tables and hundreds of chairs. Each one claimed, a process taking books, jackets and notes, to support exam mugging, to be new Centrals. The Central Library formed the Alliance. Ruled by an indiscriminate librarian, the Alliance was a beacon for muggers. The savage outer libraries were not so enlightened and refused Alliance control. The struggle was devastating, but the Alliance's victory over the Independents ensured the unity of the Dean's Listers. And now everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of our sofas.

I hope this does not get filtered. I believe this is what many of us feel, but do not voice out. Just a (not so) gentle reminder of staying fresh (and CLEAN) even when heaps of academic work pile up. 

We all know what time of the semester it is. But please - maintain a sense of personal hygiene. At the very least, brush your teeth (for a fresh breath so that your fellow course-mates will not have to cringe and suffer). Even better if you can bathe and wash your hair (I don't know what's up with society now - I think it's a joke that some university students see hygiene as a secondary priority over academics - what about public etiquette???). 

Trust me, doing the above will energize you and allow for better concentration while studying. Do not think of it as time wasted. It is not. And it will make it easier for us to breathe in school and on the shuttle buses too. :D

Just another rant as a regular user of CLB (wanted to get this off my chest since my days as a freshie and I am a final-year student now):

Using the female toilet in the CLB appalls me at times even more so when the academic fever sets in at a certain time during the semester. I *really* don't see the link between an increase in work, stress, and leaving urine and poop stains all over the toilet bowl (or even on the floor - YES). Looking at the state of uncleanliness in the cubicles, I really wonder if the users are in fact educated university students (who are adults who should have been waaaaaayyyy past their days of toilet-training). Ladies, clean up after yourselves. Please, at the very least, flush the toilet after use. Please do not shock the next user with an unwanted olfactory and visual attack. You know who you are. 

More importantly, spare a thought for the aunties who work hard everyday to keep the toilets clean. But I guess you are too caught with (literally) getting s*** done that you couldn't care less about ensuring that the cubicle space is kept clean for others, right? 

Shame on you - you careless, selfish and self-entitled users of public toilets. 

Just a thought. What about the toilets at home? And what about your parents (or domestic helpers) who have to keep them clean? Do you treat them the same way? If so, it's time to grow up (again).

I dropped a $1 coin and stretched my hand into the toilet bowl water to retrieve it. 

I'm not proud of what I just did.

Hi all! 

Just wanted to share a vital top 10 bowel movement list that I have garnered from my experience of 4 years in NUS. Points that I took into account were comfort, privacy, convenience and cleanliness (primarily the availability of the water hose/"Bum Gun" in each cubicle). I also disregarded the douchebaggery associated with using wheelchair cubicles. Because we're all guilty of it anyway. 

This list is not meant to be comprehensive or exhaustive! It is just my opinion. I don't travel around NUS taking a dump in each and every toilet, so if someone has discovered a new area of latrine paradise, feel free to share it! :) (or keep it secret to yourself, your own private dump haven)

Top 10 list of places to commence bowel movements (take a dump) in NUS for students - Male-version!

1. Med Library wheelchair toilet - 10/10
- This one takes the cake. By far. Air conditioned. New. Superbly clean. Nice. Like hotel toilet. Bum gun included. 

2. Utown Swimming pool toilet - 9/10
- Nice. Spacious. Quiet. Private. Away from shower cubicles, so ground area is dry. New fangled water gun thingy attached to toilet bowl. Fancy. Showers just nearby if kena major diarrhoea disaster.  
- But if every time tap card just to go in and pang sai maybe lifeguard might suspect something. Although nothing wrong with it.

3. Mochtar Riady 2nd floor wheelchair toilet - 9/10
- Very nice. Air conditioned. Comparable to Med Lib toilet, just not as new and marginally dirtier. Can't remember if there is a Bum Gun present. Will list as no. 2 if there is one. 
- However not conveniently located for most students

4. Utown Toilets behind Koufu - 8/10
- Very big toilet. Spacious. Usually cool. High volume of traffic. But big enough to negate it due to urinals being separated from cubicles. Bum Guns present. 

5. Utown SRC 1st floor toilets opposite rock-climbing wall - 7.5-8/10
- Super private. Super big toilet. Almost always empty. Can yolo and play videos out loud on phone while doing it. Above average cleanliness. Select cubicles have water guns attached to toilet bowl.

6. Utown ERC 2nd floor wheelchair toilets 7.5/10
- Spacious. Bum gun present. Not very private though, high traffic of people. Probability of being spotted going in quite high, confirm kena judging looks. Door locks on some somewhat faulty. Passable cleanliness. Floor sometimes can be very wet. On hot days can be quite warm inside.   

7. NUS Museum Toilet - 7.5/10
- Clearly not convenient. But free entry. And VERY private. Nice. Clean. Relatively new. Very low levels of human traffic. Perpetually cool. But no Bum Gun. 

8. Central Library Toilet - 7/10
- Not too bad. Somewhat air conditioned, if not perpetually cool. Male toilet is literally a "chocolate cake factory" though. Cubicles usually always occupied. Convenient when studying. No bum gun :(

9. Science Library Toilet - 7/10
- Nice. Quiet. Secluded. Moderate people traffic. Usually cool. But quite small compared to other library toilets. No Bum Gun :(

10. Temasek Hall Toilets (Sorry TH! Love the hall though :) ). - 1-2/10
- These are like..the worst toilets in school. To do anything. Very old. Dirty (not cleaners fault, just years of grime build-up). Not well ventilated. Cockroaches a common visitor. BIG cockroaches. Dilapidated. Idea of Bum Gun not even conceived yet when these were built. Don't think I was born yet either.
- Close fight with SRC toilets for which is worse. But from my experience SRC toilets not as many roaches.

Hope this list helped you to make the right choice! Heath is very important for studying, so make sure to clear your bowels regularly :). 
p.s. Perhaps someone can make a list for girls. And completely soil your female dignity in the process.

One day, want to trip all those people who walk and text/WhatsApp/play games/watch videos on their phones, especially in crowded areas like in MRT stations.

 PGP has bigger but older rooms than UTown. I was at PGP to give my girl a good time and realised it was bigger than the time she went to my Tembusu room.

Having said that, you'll be given a black dongle as your electronic access key. No, it is not a black pearl, and so it doesn't carry that kind of value you think it does. ;) Not valued by pirates.

No aircon, thus sleeping with the hot girl I made out with was harder than in my Tembusu air con room.

But you can try the Takagi Ramen Store if they haven't gone to jail by then. Or maybe the next stall will be called Singapore True Ramen.

Hi! I need some advice please! I was thinking of staying at PGP next sem, as I honestly hate travelling to sch everyday. Plus studying at home is distracting. (Not a fan of studying at the lib too) So was just wondering, is PGP nice to stay at? Is it clean? Thanks!

To  and other girls out there who feel like they are unattractive due to their smaller boobs. I have C-cup boobs and even then I feel it's too big. In fact I'm kind of envious of girls who have A cups because you guys can wear those loose tops and not look pregnant or fat, or wear tank tops without looking mildly obscene (I'm not even talking about those super low cut ones even the normal ones). I feel like my bigger boobs make me look fatter (or maybe I am) or gross. 
If you have smaller boobs, there're also a lot of shops that sell push-up bras (like cotton on, and they're not expensive) so you can still look bigger. To me I'd rather trade my slightly bigger boobs with you and be a little slimmer then to have my current body shape.
TL;DR everybody has issues with their bodies and the grass is always greener on the other side, learn to make the best of what you have?

I just cannot study at home, I get distracted easily. I have to study at school, but I live in the east and it takes nearly 2 hours to travel since my house is far away from the nearest mrt station. I look super hardworking in front of my friends since I study all the time, but that's because I know that I will accomplish nothing after I get home. It's frustrating, really.

If I end this confession here, most of you will definitely suggest for me to stay on-campus or rent a room near school. Well, the point is I can't do that. I have health problems which can act up anytime and when they do, I NEED someone to take care of me. Sometimes they happen in the middle of school, and it takes all my determination to force myself to the nearest road to immediately flag a taxi home. When my medical condition acts up, I cannot concentrate on what's in front of me, I can feel my body desperately screaming to me for help, and I end up embarassing myself by not walking straight or collapsing against any bench that I can see since I cannot support myself. I lose the energy to talk normally too. So you guys can see that I really cannot stay on campus, as I need to rest for the whole day, and heck, I don't even have enough strength to drag myself to UHC, much less being able to get back to my room on-campus if I do have one. So it really depresses me that I'm stuck in this situation.

Ok, thanks for reading my boring rant. I just wanted to let it out.

ps. Dont ask me what medical condition I have. The moment I say it, my close friends will know who I am.

pps. To the small bunch of people who stepped forward to help me the very first time that my medical condition acted up in school, I am very grateful. At least all of you are better than the others who just continue to queue for their food without caring that someone is feeling worse than death in front of them.

I had a midterm paper today. During the paper, I suddenly heard a phone notification sound coming from the table diagonally in front of me. I glanced up and I saw the guy sitting at the table blatently taking out his phone and sending a whatsapp to someone. I was shocked but I didn't bother to report anything. After the end of the paper, the invigilators went down the rows to collect the answer sheets as per usual. The same guy then took out his phone and started using it while the invigilators were counting the papers and collecting the last few papers. 

I feel that reporting is the right thing to do, but then again, whatever that guy does is none of my business. Tomorrow, I have a consultation with the prof. Should I confess to him what I saw? I may not know the guy but I have his seat number. Feeling so conflicted.

How to prof in engineering?
- Wait for students to ask questions after your ME2142 lecture
- "Prof, i got lost since this part..."
- Pat his shoulder, look in his eyes and respond: "Dont worry you're found now. You're here.."

So we dad joke now huh

Why the hell are lecture theatres so damn cold? I understand that air conditioning is nice (we live in the tropics, after all), but is it REALLY necessary to make it 10°C colder than outside? I almost have to have two changes of clothes because either I dress for the weather and start shivering during lecture, or I dress for indoors and start sweating as soon as I step outdoors. I feel like this overcompensating AC is a complete waste of energy. (BTW, I am an from FREAKING CANADA, where the temperature right now is below 10°C; I am used to cold weather.

Are there many girls/guy who play league in NUS? You can post anonymously!

I always felt ashamed to tell people I played league because of the fear of judging (Immature / geek etc). I watched a lot of streaming and I really hope one day esports would become big. It sucks when people do not judge people who watch soccer/NBA but esports.
 
It is a pity that people do not know the pain and struggle professional gamers have to go through to get into the world stage. The passion and dedication they put in is no less than any other sports and yet people still hold skeptical view towards them.

Alright now I have to get this off my chest...
I simply had to...
for all ya people out there who're so concerned about those who don't flush the toilets after use, I would like to seek the answer to this question that's been puzzling me for years....
why are the buttons meant for flushing so difficult to push?
over here we have the lift buttons that requires a gentle tap, or that light switch that simply clicks without a switch, or even those buttons on the vending machines that are no mean feat... I mean, just take a look at the ease of typing on keyboards or even atm...
I really hate flushing toilets...those buttons are a hassle... i can't just simply press them with my index finger effortlessly like i did with lift buttons, i had to press it down violently with my thumbs so that it can even so much as flush a trickle of water down... most of the automatic flushing systems don't work, and yet those flush buttons require so much strength that i can't even push them with my index fingers anymore, i simply can't, there's not enough strength, i need to use my thumbs... 
who are the engineers of such buttons anyway? why do lift buttons work just as fine but you just had to make life difficult for me by creating such difficult-to-press buttons? this isn't encouraging people to flush after use in any sense at all...
i need enlightenment....

To , check out ShopIntimates, a local adult toys store. You can buy online and have it delivered in discreet packaging. Their retail store is also in a rather quiet building.
-
 
To  my favourite website for toys and lubrication is Alice Maple (go Google it and go to the Singapore site). Because delivery in Singapore is very fast with discreet packaging. The stuff there is of good quality. Make sure you read up before you buy. Don't buy shady cheap ones (especially those made in China) because it is going into a sensitive area. 

Try out bullet vibrators first because they are less scary than full length dildos and work just as well.

To the girl that helped me out when I was lost on Monday on NUS, thanks for helping me to get to all the way to Clementi station! I really enjoyed talking to you from your degree (Bus Admin(accountancy)) and everything else. I did want to stay in touch with you afterwards but the train arrived, so here's to hoping you see this! - lost Aussie guy :)

to ,

Hi! if you're looking for discreet, a good place to start are Singaporean sex stores that are online. for instance, there's horny.sg, as well as shopintimates.com. they have a wonderful range of products. of course, you can find more through google. 

while i am not sure about the age limit for visiting these shops if you want to see the product in person, i believe they dont have an age limit for buying things online. 

also, be careful of materials! some cheapo dildos may be made of toxic materials that CAN cause harm. it would be wise to find out what materials are safe before purchase. ABS plastic, silicone and stainless steel are generally safe, i believe. ive been using sensuelle bullet 10 - recommended to me as a beginner's toy - and its been pretty reliable so far.

always happy to talk about such stuff!

Somehow, I realised that even though confessions are scattered throughout the day (admin must have some bot to do that), the bulk of confessions get posted from 12-3am. It has been keeping me entertained while I've been doing late night mugging for mid-terms this few weeks.

Since farting is natural, I don't think it'll be such a big issue to discuss. I farted in my bf's room the first time and I just apologetically pinched his nose while I wave the smell away. After that we just started pinching each other's noses whenever one of us farts and it never became a big deal :)

need help regarding applying makeup. my skin is not the best, and I have some acne scars. I have an event coming up so I need to be able to apply makeup for it. have been practicing but the bb cream I put immediately doesn't look good on my skin :-( my skin type is oily inside but dry on the surface. so when I apply bb it looks very cakey? on my skin even right after I put (and I tried applying very little but then it doesn't look even). should I try a different brand or something? I see some girls in school apply makeup so well their skin looks freaking flawless and I'm just like even with makeup I look like crap sigh

Ever wondered how Uncle Wong (Science canteen drink stall) can always count faster than you can even whip out your calculator and type the numbers? I think it's been a real mystery to everyone (although I kinda figured that when it comes to the change, he settles the cents first, then the dollars).

That aside, Uncle Wong and the fruit stall uncle have to be the friendliest vendors in the canteen.

@  Once, My boyfriend took my hand and looked me meaningfully in the eyes and placed my hand on his butt. I thought he wanted to make out or something but two seconds later he let out a loud fart right on my hand. He then grinned at me and continued whatever he was doing. Maybe you could try this LOL.
-
 
, 
I suggest you keep it this way. Earlier on, in my almost 3 year relationship, my boyfriend asked if I mind him farting, I told him to go ahead, and that farting is natural blah blah blah. Little did I know, I had just opened the gates to hell. I later realise that he has this habit of farting EXCESSIVELY after dinner and his farts are NOTHING near normal, his ranges from garbage truck to something-rotted-in-his-intestines. There was once he kept complaining something stinks in my room, ONLY to realize its his own fart. And another time he basically dutch oven-ed my air-conditioned room with the smell of death, we had to air the room for 20mins. I swear that's one smell that had scarred me for life while he laughed through the entire ordeal. 

If given a time machine, the first thing I would do is travel back in time and tell him "NOOOOOO! I am not okay with your alien farts!" 

So cakes! If you are reading this, PLEASE STOP.

Some modules have oral presentation which contributes to part of the overall marks. I am one of those people who dress casual everyday (shorts and t shirt) and I'm a girl. Even on presentation days I have the intention of dressing like how I normally do but my mom is stopping me by saying things like "if anything goes wrong with the marks, your group members might blame you for your dressing" or she may say "the lecturer of course said dressing don't matter but who knows if it might". I even emailed the examiner to check that they indeed never take dressing into account and they said dressing is not considered under the marks. The only thing that matters is your contents and how you convey your ideas to the audience. 

I felt like everytime there is a presentation, without fail my mom and I argued over the dressing part. Why does my mom have to say things that scare me into wearing at least long pants with blouse? I had even seen people present when wearing shorts and shirt so why is my Mom particular over dressing especially when it comes to presentation, whether graded or not? The only reason I don't bother changing my dressing style is simply because I felt comfortable only in shirts and shorts. 

Can some prof or anyone here confirm with me if the examiner will not subconsciously deduct marks for informal dressing during presentation?  If so, then maybe I won't listen too much to my mom's scary remarks.

Anyone has a problem of weight gain after coming in to uni? There was a period where I gained around 3 inches to my waist and needed to buy clothes a size or two bigger. :( My uni lifestyle so far has been quite unhealthy, especially towards the exam period. Sleeping late, snacking an the lack of exercise. Any tips to keep in shape, e.g. by eating healthy snacks or strolling after a meal? Besides having a busy schedule for the upcoming weeks, the haze is also not helping either for me to go out for a jog, and I don't gym.

So I'm in CLB, and I see this caucasian student who sits with his legs propped up on the study table. When he was done studying, he also conveniently left his empty plastic cup behind (Yes, it's his, he drank out of it). First of all, yeah, most of us do break the rules by bringing food and drinks into the library, no harm done there. BUT, I think it's only right to clear up after yourself. Secondly, please have some respect for yourself and carry yourself properly in public. Especially since you're probably not a local.

So... I was in the YIH Study Room today (2nd Oct) and around 7.30pm before I left, I heard people singing outside (from the door on the upper level of the study room). Not sure who they are but I just want to tell them that their voices sound really good!!! Keep singing!!!

There is a guy in my batch who is part of the Chemical Society. Basically, I realised I like him. He's quite effeminate, but mischievous too. More importantly, he shakes his butt when walking, just like a girl. How???

P.S. Guy here, which makes it even more comfusing than it already is. Not even sure if he's attached, but he seems to be always with another guy or two.

There are so many posts here about feeling sad, anxious, low self-esteem etc...

Anyway I rescued this book [1] from pulping or cold storage at the recent NUS Library Used Book Sale for just $1. It's pages are yellowed with time, but the condition is otherwise 9.99/10.

I'll give it to anyone who wants it, but I don't want to do meetup because I don't want to be accused of having an ulterior motive. I can regular mail it to you at no expense of yours if you have a PO box, or put it in your locker if you have a resettable number lock.

Any idea how to send this book to a stranger without compromising either of our privacy? Is anyone here is smart enough to come up with a legal, ethical and convenient way?

Or should I just stick a bookcrossing label inside the book and leave it somewhere in NUS hoping that it will somehow find it's way into the hands of someone who can benefit from it?

How do some people get called on more than once in class to answer questions while I can't get called on at all no matter how often (or infrequently - I've tried being selective) I raise my hands?

Am I supposed to raise my hand and wave it excitedly? Do I grow longer arms? Are the stars not aligned?

OP of  here. I have seen many of my Malay and Indian friends learning basic Mandarin because service staff are all incapable of speaking English, I've seen Chinese bus drivers yell at tourists who do not understand his instructions (given in Mandarin) so yeah, I guess they can 'get around knowing Chinese'. I have also overheard them commenting on the stupidity of our people for queuing. I'm not sure what one of the commentators meant by playing nice. I respect that they need to sun their (very, very smelly) salted fish along the HDB common corridor and I tolerate the smell, but do they respect that curry is a part of our diet?

What do guys think about girls with no curves whatsoever? I am pretty skinny, so I have a pair of smaller-than-A-cup sized boobs, and a flat ass. But I would consider my face to be above average in terms of looks. I really envy girls with average sized boobs and curves, I feel these are more important than just a pretty face. What do guys generally think about girls with pretty face but lacking in the body department? Let's not bring inner beauty into this, to keep things simpler.

This is a true story. I will be matriculating in NUS in August 2016. I came from a poor family, with my father owing a mountain of gambling debts amounting to 100k. I am currently staying in a 4-room HDB with 2 sisters, my father, aunt and uncle. Basically my aunt/uncle takes up a room, my sisters take up another, and me with my father. My problem is, his mistress and her son will be shifting in permanently this coming December and I will be forced to move all my stuffs and sleep in the living room. With some medical conditions, I am extremely sensitive to light and sound and will not be able to sleep in the living room. I need a place to stay. I can't sleep in the same room as my sisters either, as the mistress son will occupy the slot. Even so, I can't possibly concentrate on my studies when the time comes. I am very certain about this because I have been through it. I was previously from an average Junior College and transferred to a Polytechnic simply because I can't focus on my studies, with distractions. I previously slept in the same room as my sisters. Now I'm in need of a place to stay urgently. A quiet place where i can sleep and focus on my studies. I do not have any money. All advices are appreciated. HELP!!

Hi guys i need to get this off my mind, it has plagued me since i returned from exchange.

When i went for exchange, my friends and i couldn't get university provided accommodations. As such, we had to source our own accommodations outside. Together with my friend, we rented a small apartment to save costs. The drawback? rent was expensive and we got an apartment with a queensized bed, for the 2 of us.

In short, I had no choice but to sleep with another guy for 4 months. It was the most awkward experience of my life. It did not help that my roommate was too horny during exchange without his girlfriend. 

There were a few times during the middle of the night when he was jerking off to porn off of his phone. I shifted further away from him on the bed and tried my best to pretend i was asleep. 

Eventually I scolded him about it and he stopped doing it in the bed. I can't view him in the same way again...

Thanks for listening to my story, I just needed to get this off my mind...

I went to the toilet outside LT8 to take a dump this evening. When I first entered, the lights were off. A few steps later the lights turned on by itself and the auto water tap just kept dispensing water despite not having anyone there. It was scary, but my faeces can't wait to see the light of the world, so no choice. The water tap went on nonstop while my anal tap went like Niagara Falls.
As if that wasn't scary enough. Then I turned to my right. OH THE HORROR.

Hi admin I hope this non-Uni, non-relationship post gets up. I just wanted to share something I experienced in school the other day and I hope that my fellow NUS sports fans, especially football fans will take me seriously. Firstly just to share something about myself; I am an avid football enthusiast. I follow football quite closely on a daily basis, knowing the major news and results around the major European leagues(la Liga, Epl etc). I would spend my weekends watching football matches, mostly matches from EPL and the occasional match from the Spanish or German leagues. By now, most of the football fans here would be wondering which football club I support. Here's the catch, I do support an EPL team, but it is outside the current top 4 teams I.e Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea. NO, I don't support Liverpool as I still classify them as a big club although at recent times they have found it rather difficult to hang around the top 4...(sorry L'pool fans!) 
Anyway, I fell in love with this team when I started watching EPL on a regular basis during the 2005/2006 season. I was captivated by the way they played football. It was just pure beautiful attacking football, and I started to love everything about them;the jersey, their history etc. Till now, I still remain their loyal fan despite their lack of achievements and frequent overhauls, and I am sure I will remain one regardless of the future of my club.

Back to my story, so just after the latest round of EPL matches, I was still in the football mood and I decided to wear my club's jersey I bought a few weeks ago to school on Monday. Usually in the past,  when I wore older versions of my club's jersey to school, I would get the occasional stares and giggles from some guys. Well, I have learnt to ignore such things. However when I entered my tutorial class wearing my club's jersey, I noticed a group of 2-3 guys instantly giggle among themselves when they saw my outfit. Alright, I thought to myself, just ignore it. Then after the tutorial, I overheard one of them say "why the **** he support (my club's name) sia , what a joke". I was very offended when he said said that. And sadly, it isn't the first time I have heard people pass such remarks after they know of which football club I support. In the past, some of the guys in my orientation OG in year 1 even said something similar to what that guy in my tutorial class did(after finding out which club I support), furthermore they still said it directly in my face in a non- joking manner. After that incident on Monday , I felt that I needed to voice out some thoughts from my perspective, and also on behalf of other fans of football clubs that are not among the more famous brand names. 

1) many of you may ask why we support such clubs since we experience no success at all and constantly get rolled over by teams such as Manchester United or Chelsea. Well the answer is simple. We don't support a club for its success. We don't support a club just because they constantly win games and imbue it's fans with a "feel good" factor. We don't expect our club to win silverware often, and hate them if they don't. All we wish for is to watch those players give their all on the football pitch for the club, and hopefully at the same time play beautiful football. It's a known fact that we lose games more than we win, but that also makes victory all the more sweeter, and I have learnt to treasure those victories that my football club fought so hard for. This also makes victory against the big clubs all the more memorable. Those rare victories against Man U, arsenal etc are still fresh in my mind despite the fact that some of those results dated  back quite  some time ago. 

2) some of you also said things along the lines of " come on man, no one supports ***, come support (big club), most of my friends also support (big club). Thank you for your recommendation, but no thanks. We "small club" fans don't mind supporting our club alone. I don't feel the need to find a group to support the club together. I have quite a fee experiences where people have tried to convert me, one of the more notable ones which I remembered was when my circle of football kakis tried to convert me to a Man U fan so that I could go to their home stadium at Old Trafford together with them on their "pilgrimage". Seriously-.-. 

3. Lastly, I hope you don't judge a person's football knowledge because he/she supports "small clubs". I met some people before who had such a mentality and it is seriously very annoying. Come on man, you are not a child and you cannot make the distinction between club affiliation and general knowledge? When people say things along the lines of "eh why you ask him about football? He supports ("small club") one leh."
Heck, I'm quite sure I have tons more football knowledge than a girl who decided to start watching football a year ago and support Man U because her new boyfriend happened to support Man U. 

Anyway, I have nothing against those fans of "top 4" clubs. I just hope that you all realise that there is absolutely nothing wrong with supporting a "small club ", and stop judging people for it. As the saying goes, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. To others, my club is a "small club". To me, it is the best club in the world. Cheers.

To the guy at PGP who called out my name outside Super Snacks this evening who had helped me carry my stuff from outside PGP all the way to my block over a month ago (and my block was all the way at the extreme end of his), I'm so sorry - I do remember you! 

I had only forgotten for a second because I had just moved in to PGP that day, and a handful of kind strangers like yourself had seen me struggling and offered to help me carry and move stuff throughout that same day as well, so I couldn't recall for a second exactly who you were. (And it also didn't help that you were standing quite far away and it was dark and I couldn't really see/recognise you.) I feel so bad just thinking about your embarrassed, "Oh my god you don't remember??" (I dooo I'm a fool) 

I don't know if you'll see this, but if you do, thank you so much again - I was dying on the hill outside NUH that night and you were really kind to ask if I was heading to PGP too and offered to help me carry my bags.

I feel so ugly. My facial features are below average. My friends around me look prettier. I had crooked teeth so I wear braces. My left eye is obviously smaller than my right eye due to a birth defect, so I wear glasses to cover it. My hair is so freaking thick that when I tie a ponytail, it looks like a thick bush rather than a tail. I had to strighten it to make it look less thick. I have hairy arms and hairy legs inherited from my dad. Freckles keep appearing on my face even though I put on sunblock. My pimples appear easily but take ages to disappear and they always leave behind a dark spot. I have tons of blackheads on my nose and they just won't disappear. My boobs are smaller than A. I have a resting bitch face. Even my cousins look nicer than me, even though we are supposed to share similar genes. And I don't put on makeup because I dunno how to, my family does not believe in it. Ugh, I just feel so ugly!

Sorry, just ranting. Hope none of you get annoyed. I just feel like I have no hope of a boyfriend, all the people that I see dating in school are so pretty. Who would even give me a second glance?

To the girl (bespectacled, shoulder length hair) in the printing queue at Central Library today (30th Oct, 1.50pm), sorry for unwittingly cutting your queue! 

There were two machines that were not in use, and I didn't realize that one of them was not working. When you didn't make a move towards the machine, I thought that you weren't in the queue. After I realized my mistake, the most I could muster was to ask if you wanted to print your notes, but you said it was okay.

Not sure if you do visit this page, but I'm sorry for cutting your queue!

To the blue/purple-ish hair girl in my GEK class:
I can't help it but to keep noticing your nice hair color, and i lost focus to what the lecturer was saying. Just wanted to say that your hair color is really nice, but you always rush off after lecture before i could say anything to you. Wonder exactly what color (or mixture) you used, and where you dyed your hair. Your hair make me miss my blue hair last time..

Hope your hair don't fade so fast so that i can continue enjoying your nice hair color till the semester ends :D

It was a usual Wednesday afternoon and I was having the runs. I am quite ocd about choosing my toilet bowls. The cleanest toilets nearby that came to my mind were those in CLB. Okay let's fast forward the story: apparently it was a good time to shit and there were no vacancies in any of them, so the next best option I had was the Chinese library toilet at the top level. In I went, the toilet was quiet, stale and perfect for my dump? A few minutes in, I suddenly felt "someone" in the adjacent cubicle, but it wasn't right.. I couldn't hear any foot steps coming in despite the defeating silence which enclosed the toilet. Suddenly, I heard the sound of pee, and immediately I put on my pants and dashed out of the toilet. On the way out, I took a glance at the adjacent cubicle, it was apparently empty.

Honestly more recognition should be given to sportsman/woman. While I'm not one myself, every time I walk pass kuok foundation house in the wee hours back to raffles, you can see almost majority of the lights are still on. How do they even managed to balance their sports and studies with such little sleep?
Kudos to all sportsman and sportswoman.

Today I had my subject pool, and it was basically a business competition between 2 parties. There was no communication allowed. Long story cut short, I was basically "taken advantaged" and I ended up getting a lot less money from it as compared to my counter-part. When the subject pool ended and I was about to leave, she came over and placed some of her "winnings" on my table and walked away. I didn't even have the opportunity to thank her. Honestly, you didn't have to do this, it was just an "experiment". So I just wanted to extend my gratitude to you for your kindness, thank you.

 Took a taxi a few days ago as I was running late for an event. The taxi driver probed and found out I was attending a religious event. He then proceeded to preach.

Near my destination he stopped at a traffic light, and looked intensely to the left taxi. I looked at both taxi drivers, and thought they knew each other.

"Are you trying to talk to him?" I asked.

"This guy you see he look like this, like finding trouble like that. See him must whack." He replied.

When the lights turned green, both taxis floored the accelerator. Luckily nothing bad happened and I reached the destination safely.

For all your know, the other taxi driver just had an eye problem. I didn't feel he was staring at my taxi driver, just perhaps he had a fierce-looking face. I'm pretty sure my taxi driver was looking for trouble, but to do that with a passenger on board is really irresponsible.

This Chinese boy, perhaps he has an eye problem, or perhaps he was really staring at you. You could find out by asking later if he was starring at you.

If you are no longer as upset, you may want to reread these (see below) and realise that these are not facts, but thoughts in your head in the heat of the moment. We all have thoughts, and all sorts of thoughts. Good, bad, random, funny, angry, sad thoughts. There's nothing wrong with thoughts appearing, because that's a function of the brain. What's important is that we do not believe all our thoughts to be true without critically analysing them.

- It's as if he was 'educating' me about why it happened and how this could be prevented in the future and how these Indians should have behaved.
-You think you're doing me a favour?
-You think I'm going to get into a riot anytime soon?
-First of all you ignorant fool, just cause these Indian FWs behaved in such an unruly manner does not mean that every Indian is going to behave the same way.

Please do not filter. I was in class, as two Chinese boys went up for their presentation. Their boring presentation aside, I could not help but notice how the guy was staring at me the entire time while he spoke about the Little India Riots that took place in 2013. Why were you staring at me like this? It's as if he was 'educating' me about why it happened and how this could be prevented in the future and how these Indians should have behaved. He was getting so upset about it as well. Erm , you are aware that I wasn't involved in the riots right? You think you're doing me a favour? You think I'm going to get into a riot anytime soon? First of all you ignorant fool, just cause these Indian FWs behaved in such an unruly manner does not mean that every Indian is going to behave the same way. Can't believe that NUS has uneducated students like them. Fuck you. You need help.

To the cute Malay guy in the black specs and blue shirt in SoC, ARE YOU SINGLE?? I'm 21 and pretty geeky if I say so myself...but I'm not in SoC.  You were with another Malay guy as well, who kind of looked like you, also with black specs.  I could hear you guys talking and laughing all the way from my usual seat just inside COM L2.  Let me know if you like Chinese girls!

During the first day of recess week, my friend was sleeping over at my house. My parents and brother were all sleeping upstairs while we were downstairs watching tv, playing video games and shit. At around 1 am he asks if this girl can come over (he REALLY wants to get with this girl, and I don't want to turn him down so I reluctantly agree, on the condition that she's quiet.) The three of us are hanging out and I make some excuse to leave the room so my friend can have some alone time with this girl. I'm upstairs in my room when I start hearing loud moans. This is bad news for me, but great news for my friend, he's losing his virginity to a girl he really likes. I hear stirring in the next room and I know that their bout of loud lovemaking has woken my parents. The last thing I want is for my confused father to walk in on my friend fucking this girl. What do I do? I go to some porn website and click on the first video I see, crank that shit to 100 on my speakers and let it play for the ~three minutes that my buddy ended up lasting. My dad ended up coming into my room, discovering the source of the noise (I even threw in some fapping motion under the covers) and awkwardly leaving. My buddy ended up having "the best fucking time ever bro" but jesus there were some awkward glances exchanged between my parents and I the next morning.

To the short and cute girl in applied math. You always hang around with a bunch of people. I have been admiring you from afar. You have recently started to come late for math finance lectures. I have stumbled upon you in yoga classes as well. You have always managed to catch my gaze no matter where you are. Linear algebra 2 lectures are not the same as i always find myself lost in your presence. If you are single and available, do hit me up :). I promise to cherish and love you forever.

Last night, my girlfriend’s boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. On the way over, my girlfriend repeated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression.

I calmed her down and said I always make good impressions.

My girlfriend’s boss is a single lady in her forties, so it was just the three of us. We chatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my lame jokes and my girlfriend seemed happy.

Soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.

Now, I've had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer welldone, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could've resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak.

Claim vegetarian? Not possible because I had feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.

Just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 4th story apartment...I knew what I had to do.

I knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.

Here's the big time FU. The window wasn't open. It was the cleanest freaking window you've ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.

My girlfriend - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. 

My girlfriend’s boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.

I just didn't know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. I then did what I had to do. I walk towards the piece of raw meat and and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. 

I remained pretty quiet for the rest of the day.

I saw this really cute guy in uni-y camp. He was in the wolverine og. I personally think fat guys are cute and chubby. I dunno it's my taste. I have been afraid to approach you for a long time. You have always managed to capture my gaze. I had come down to support you during the flash mob. Even though you may not have the great body as your fellow og mates. I think you are my kind of guy. I wish you would notice me one day and hit me up ;)

小时候我家很穷，穷到家里只剩下钱，其他什麼都没有了。
爸爸忙著算钱，妈妈忙著扫钱，弟弟睡觉时没有被单，只好用钱，
妹妹大便没有卫生纸，只好用钱擦屁股。

爸爸常常在我出去外面玩时，塞了一大堆的钱给我，叫我花光。
我手上堆著满满的钞票，我很难过，因為我怕别人笑我。
所以我常常把它们都丢进了垃圾桶，或者水沟里。

因為家里什麼都没有，所以我每天晚上只能利用烧钱的光线看书，
于是近视很深。

离我家最近的便利店要花三小时才可以到达，而且要开法拉利去，
如果开奔驰还得要开五小时。

我每个月都要固定放火将我家的一些钱烧掉，因為真的是太多了。
多到我们都不够地方住了。必要时还要用炸药。

我妈妈也常常叫我不要读太多的书，以免长大以后赚更多的钱，
那我们的生活就更辛苦了。

有时听到隔壁的妈妈骂他的孩子说长大以后要成為有钱人，
我也会替他难过一阵，好几次晚上还睡不著觉。

每次我一想要我家的情况和坎坷的过去，泪水便忍不住地夺眶而出……

I love fashion, but I'm a plus-sized girl. While I have good taste and style (not self-praise, all my friends say this), and can advise my friends on what to wear, I'm always wondering what to wear myself. It's difficult to find something flattering because of my size. I've always envied slimmer girls who can pull over a great tight dress, whereas if I were to wear the same dress, my tummy and flabby arms will show. It has been so demoralizing, but I'm still learning to create looks for plus-sized girls like myself. The recent fashion shows and looks for curvy girls have been very encouraging for me, but I still lack the confidence to wear those pieces sometimes. I just wish that I can muster more confidence in myself.

I got cheated today. I feel very hurt. My faith in humanity has been shattered. This was the last time I probably trusted someone so much. The moment you turn around, people do something behind your back. Are all people like that?
I invited my friend for dinner tonight. While I was eating, my mum called me to change the TV channel. When I returned, I was so shocked. My friend had put his fish on my plate. Now I have to eat one more piece of fish and I eat so slowly anyway. He got away with cheating and I was the last to finish. As usual.

Once upon a time, there was a restaurant that auctioned exotic fruits. It was situated in the most affluent district in a metropolis. The selling prices of these fruits are totally out of this world, a small packet of pink cherries from the refrigerator has a starting bid of $300. On the other hand, those cube-shaped honeydews that are placed on shelve, has a starting bid of $500. The rich would party and feast every single night in the restaurant, occasionally the selling prices of these fruits could hit astronomical figures. 

A young boy and his dad would always walk past the restaurant every night after collecting used card-boards and empty cans. They lived a life of extreme poverty, residing in the slum outside of the city. The boy would always drop his belongings and rushed towards the glass panel to admire that brightest apple which was illuminated by the chandelier’s light. 

“Daddy look! Why this apple cost $100? Does it taste better than the overly-ripe apples that we purchased for 20 cents?”

Even when he is outside of the restaurant, he could still hear the crunching sound  produced when the fruits are consumed. The sight of juice flowing from the mouths of the riches did little to curb his craving; it only made him hungry. To a boy who suffered frequent starvation since his birth, the restaurant seem like heaven to him, something that is so near yet unattainable.

Not long after that, his father had contracted a terminal disease and he was screaming in agony on his death bed.  The boy attempted to save his daddy by searching for help in the city on a cold winter night. However, his efforts are futile, nobody would listen to his pleadings and nobody cares about his sorrows.  When he arrived at the door steps of the restaurant, his legs finally gave in because he hasn’t eaten for 3 days. An angel appeared before him, while he was waiting for his death on the ground filled with snow. 

“Are you going to die just like that? Don’t you have any regrets? Look at that brightest apple! Don’t you want to know how heaven taste like?” said the angel.

The angel gave him $100 and disappeared into the darkness. He picked himself up and went into the restaurant to purchase the apple before running into a dark alley.

“My dream had finally come true! Just one bite and I can die without any regrets.”

He took a big bite and chewed the juicy apple vigorously in his mouth before swallowing it down. Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp.

“Unbelievable!!!!! Fantastic !!!!!”, he uttered loudly.

Tears started flowing down as he continued to consume the apple like a hungry beast. Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. It didn’t take long till the whole apple is fully consumed. The boy descended into a eerie silence before falling onto the ground and started cackling.

“HAHAHAHAHH daddy, I finally knows how it tasted like! Amazing! IT TASTED EXACTLY LIKE THE OVERLY RIPE 20 CENTS APPLE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! I GET IT NOW. I GET IT NOW. THIS IS HUMANITY!”.

The angel who is secretly observing the boy, took off her mask to revealed her true demonic identity. 

She gave an evil-looking smirk before saying, “Heaven uh? Unfortunately, I can only show him hell”.

With response to the large amount of "but NTU is so inaccessible" replies to , I'd like to say that yes, while NTU would take a relatively longer period of travel time, it's still one MRT ride + one bus ride, just like our regular eastie "travel whole green line + public/shuttle bus" route to school. It's further than NUS hence the longer travelling time, but it's just as accessible as NUS is. NTU gives 4h to and fro school from pasir ris, NUS gives about 3h to and fro from pasir ris. We're about 75% in need of at least a shuttle bus service from tampines/pasir ris to NUS.

Am I the only one who thinks that the counselling standards in singapore sucks? All the counsellors (I've family issues) that I've visited use textbook answers to address my issues and they lack a human element to it. What's worse is that most of them will look at the clock once in a while to keep track of the time. I have totally lost all hope in counselling.

My claim is that there are many people who travel to many places. But not many people are able to make sense of their existence. And it's not difficult. You don't have to travel to another exotic places.

"Without going out of doors one may know the whole world; without looking out of the window, one may see the Way of Heaven. The further one travels, the less one may know. Thus it is that without moving you shall know; without looking you shall see; without doing you shall achieve." ~Lao tzu

Some people just have evil emanating from their faces. The moment you see their face you just know they will do something bad to you. I have met many people like that. They leech to you for your goodness and kindness. They suck the life out of you and leave you a soulless person. They call themselves your friends and ask for your homework and assignments. At the end of the day, you are just stuck in a abyss of hopelessness of what to do with these people.

So due to the haze, I'm really can't study during the recess week. I've just got an academic warning from NUS last semester cause my SAP was 1.90. And now the news say that the haze will last until November because of El Nino! I am really scared that I will do badly again this semester because of the haze. I really hope the haze will go away so I at least have a chance to get my cap up to 2.0. :( :( :(

To  I think you misread - it was regular HAIR REMOVAL cream that should not be used down there, not regular shaving cream! The latter's fine! Careful not let it get "inside" by accident though. And then just shave as per normal.  Haha, I never understood why this is such a common question when how else can one shave? 

Since you've never shaved down there before, I'd recommend you to trim the hairs down as much as possible with a pair of scissors first (better if you have those tiny ones, usually to trim brows I think?), before applying the shaving cream and then shaving as per normal, against the direction of the hair for a cleaner shave. Also helps to pull the skin taut as you do it. It might leave little bumps or even itch a little for your first time or so as your skin is not yet used to it, but it should be ok with time and practice (less fumbly). 

Though I do personally shave, I don't see why I even bother, considering they grow back at the speed of weed. Why doesn't the hair on my head grow that fast

I lost my thumb drive within the last two weeks somewhere at engineering and have been frantically looking for it. It is a sandisk 32gb black in colour and has my FYP data which I really need! If anyone has seen it can you comment here so we can get in contact? HALPPP!!

Can anyone share about how you shave 'down there'? I saw the previous whisper that regular shaving cream cannot be used (never done it before so I have no idea what can or cannot be used, should or should not be used/done). I dont think people actually go for waxing so often that you dont have to do anything at home to clean it up right?

Hi I'm the OP of 
Thanks for your feedback but well I'm still lost as to how to go about doing it. Do I smile at the guy, chat him up and then idk..give him those gazes? How would he know that I'm fine with him crossing the proverbial line?
From the comments: App? Hm no kick. Fast food delivery....what...?
And I know some guys who are all high and mighty and wouldn't do "such things" and they're the ones most likely to reject. And you can never identify such guys until you try it out.

I was raped. When I finally had the courage to make a police report, the first question I was asked was 'What were you wearing?'  This struck me hard. Should it matter whether I was in shorts, a skirt or jeans? Shouldn't I be able to feel safe? Even though I was wearing provocative clothes, I felt slut shamed by the questions that were asked as if it were my fault. Isn't looking and acting upon those desires totally different things?

I found you quite cute but was hesitant to ask for your number. Hope you see this and reply!

It was a hazy night. The roads were dark, with nothing to light the way, save for some dim streetlights. As I slowly walked along the streets, I realised that there were no cars, no buses around me - I was alone. 

Panting, I cursed under my breath, for studying until such a late time. Inauspicious, I said, as I continued trudging my way. Ridiculous, I muttered, cursing at the incoming mid-terms.

All of a sudden, I heard creaking in the distance. It sounded like rusty chains. Something was moving. I stood still, alerted to the sound. As I took a defensive stance, I was not even sure if I could tackle what was going to come.

The sound grew closer. Over the road, I saw an irregular silhouette in the haze, slowly making its way towards me. My heartbeat accelerated. Sweat was dripping down my forehead. I stood there, cold and frozen.

The figure grew closer.

It moved its arms.

It walked closer.

I could hear his footsteps.

I could hear my heartbeat.

Buh dup.

BUh dup.

BUH DUP.

I had a primary school classmate. One day I even found in his notebook he drew many middle fingers! It was shocking to me because during my time we don't even use vulgarities openly. Today he's a lawyer.

Another secondary school classmate would use a long ruler to swipe the ass of other guys (that were weaker than him) like a credit card. Today he's a doctor.

Once a senior I trusted and a classmate tricked and scared the hell out of me. Prior to it I've only heard of the phrase "lao chhi sai" (have green diarrhoea). That very night I experienced it first hand, and learned the green comes from bile. The next day, I lost faith in religion and became effectively an atheist for the next decade.

I guess people do change. Nobody wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says, "I'm going to be a bad person today."

As for the senior and classmate, I used to hold it against them but no longer do. It's just a data point which contributes to the "don't blindly trust anyone" rule.

 why are you so busy during recess week? Why are people so busy during recess week?? I don't recall having to study 16 hours a day for a week.. ever. In my life. Recess weeks are for breaks, and you sound like you desperately need one!

I remember travelling a bit during recess weeks, like from Friday evening to Wednesday I'd go KL or Bangkok to shut off my brain for a while. And then come back and spend 3 days studying extremely efficiently.

Fresh Life Sciences graduate here. 2:2 hons, extremely happy, and still doing pretty well out here! It's not the end of the world if you don't get A/A+ for everything!

I'm worried for my roommate. I think he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. For the longest time he has been using an alternate Facebook account to live an alternate lifestyle. So much so, that his original account has fallen into disuse. 
Nowadays, his posts on the fake account are getting more insensitive and inflammatory. It used to be funny but it's not funny anymore. 
I'm worried that he needs to see a doctor. I also worry for my own safety. Sometimes I see him holding a pair of scissors to his hair cutting off snips here and there.

I dunno what to do.

On Wednesday, 23 September 2015, at around 6 pm, a bright yellow Honda Fit with registration number SGD8502L driven be a woman with short cropped hair in her 30s / 40s almost caused an accident with NUS bus A1 around Kent Ridge / PGP area. 

Earlier on, I noticed this car didn't give way to pedestrians crossing to PGP terminal bus stop. The woman was driving from NUS business side to Buona Vista MRT direction.

At around 6 pm, with bus A1 almost full to capacity, she made a sudden stop which jolted our bus driver to hit the break. Thanks to his quick reflex, all of us escaped unharmed although some did get thrown to the ground and hit one another.

If you have any information pertaining to this unsafe driver, please let the NUS community know. The woman may even be from NUS and thus actions are necessary to prevent the same thing from happening.

Hi NUS people, I'm a victim of a hit and run incident that occured on the 22th September 2015 at NUS carpark 12(beside biz library) between 1030 and 1600hrs. My stationary motorcycle was hit/pushed by the culprit at the photographed location during this period and has sustained hefty damages that include a broken throttle. My motorcycle was covered by a gray canvas the whole time. The culprit left no note or indication of responsibility in the matter. 

I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, had parked at the said carpark and has an in car camera that can help me to uncover the culprit, or any information that can help my case. I can guarantee your anonymity should you wish so if you step forward with information. 

You can contact me at 9062 5248.

For any others who wish to help out a fellow distraught student, please help to share this post and spread the word. Thanks!

For the past two years as an NUS student, I have resorted to selling soiled panties as a quick and easy way to earn money. For almost no effort, it seemed as if it was a good mid-way point for a girl to make some pocket money, while not selling my body away as a social escort, not to mention the risk of STDs. 

However, as I sold these panties, I had a few requests from guys who want to buy my pee and poop. Oh a few were into blood too -.- I initially turned them down, but got round to it since hey, why not? So here I am, literally selling my waste products to some extremely creepy and perverse men. 

I do it purely by mail though. But customers are discerning, they want to know that a (young) girl made it, so I usually send a pic with the customer's "name" and my butt. And they usually email me back disgusting things like "wow this shit is from a smart NUS girl, so fragrant". I won't elaborate on the worst emails since its too obscene. 

Why can guys be such creeps? I know I'm a hypocritical bitch since I'm selling my waste for cash, but it makes me not want to believe in guys anymore. I'm just an average-looking evergreen girl btw, so doing this is seriously turning me off from love.

To the girl who boarded bus 31 just before TanahMerah just now(4pm+ mon)

Though I'm not even sure you're from Nus or will ever see this, but u wore a runnus/sports club singlet, I saw you a few times at bedok gym. I have always wanted to approach you since then but it's always the wrong timing when we meet. And today was the second time we saw each other as you boarded the bus and I was alighting. I just wanna say I think you're really cute and would want to get to know you more! (I'm secretly hoping you do not have a bf hahah)

P.s. I was wearing green fass shirt, and I know you saw me. I will gather my courage and smile at you the next time we meet! Will you do the same?;) Hope to see you in sch too but no luck till now

I just saw my BMT platoon sergeant, let's call him H, in NUS. Found out he is doing the same course as me. Couldn't really stand his face and really felt like giving him a punch. He was the most stuck up sergeant in the whole company - no flexibility and no care for soldiers. All he wanted to do was lick the CSM's boots and behave like a bloody a-hole. 

Well initially it wasn't personal. But then he just began to kena aim me as if I was his enemy. Like for example, he would just tekan me extra for nothing even though a couple of people around me were slower in reaching push-up position. In fact, he just gave me one day extra for coming in late when I wasn't late at all and those who fell in later than me for booking in actually got nothing. On that particular weekend, he then purposely made us clean the company toilet and the entire company line. I felt really disgusted at his behavior and right then wanted to just give a few good blows but realized that nothing good would come out it. 

He recently appeared in my dream too and I blasted him into pieces with a grenade. Wish it was reality... I really think such people deserve a good whopping. Now I don't really want to get involved with the law and decided to let bygones by bygones for now. But if you are listening H, if i ever get a chance to get even with you, I will make the most out of the opportunity.

I'M SO UNPRODUCTIVE AT HOME DURING WEEKENDS!!! I only get school work done if I head out to some cafe/coffeeshop/fastfood restaurant outside. 

Any advice on how to have the 'feel' to study while at home? :/

To the half maori/white exchange student from NZ. I think I like you a lot...you're really funny :) but I'm not sure if you're the kind of guy that would take it that far. I have restless nights thinking about you performing the haka on top of me. If you're up for it, we should play some sevens sometime.

I just realised that once you are in uni, most people don't give a shit which JC you are from...even bishan jc.

Just a reminder to everyone about how important it is to stay hydrated. Always stay hydrated.

A long time ago, I used to like myself. Having joined a performing arts CCA, I started painting my face with makeup in secondary school. I was vain. I dieted, I read all sorts of fitness books and exercised regularly. This all paid off as it gave me a fit body that was able to capture the attention of the opposite sex. Whenever I had a major exam, I would study my ass off. This also paid off as I managed to do alright for all the national examinations and ended up in NUS, studying something I adored.

Fast forward to this very day as an adult: I hate myself. I'm jaded. Life and all the shiny things in it that I used to run after have lost its lustre...I am totally numb to the metropolis and the lifestyle that comes with it. Physical appearance, knowledge and attention from others are things I no longer seek. Friends have suffocated me with expectations. They want me to spend money on things that I don't want to spend money on. They think I'm a cheapskate, when in truth, all the social activities that are considered "adult" are meaningless to me.

When I'm not pretending to be a normal, sane person, I spend my free time questioning my existence. My bed is a place where I rest my physical body but ironically, it is also the place where I endure mental torture from my own thoughts. I want to re-enact the scene from that forgotten Chinese movie. I want to stand on top of a mountain and shout out to the universe, "我是谁!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????" What is the meaning of life?

Not meaning to throw shade on that Herbert guy (okay, maybe just a LITTLE shade) but isn't his Fessup app exactly like YikYak? YikYak was made for college communities/campuses too ._.

P.S. Everyone please get YikYak so my feed @ NUS will be more interesting heh

I have a love-hate relationship with my uni friend. When I get my answers right, I hail to him like a god. But when I don't, I wondered why I ever wanted him to be part of my life. He's the most mysterious shades of grey ever and his master is an escapist of my mind. He's none other than Planck constant, his master, the Schrödinger Equation.

Where?

I paid a surprise visit one day to my boyfriend's room and I caught him masturbating. To add insult, he was drooling at facebook pictures of his female friends in their swimwear. Gave him a tight slap and left. 

He left me many apology texts for a few days but I have not replied as I don't know how to and whether I should forgive him. Is this normal for all guys? Do you need to release behind our backs even when we have been intimate regularly?
-
 
I stay in hall and my friends and I were walking back from Ameens a few days ago after having supper. We were not dressed provocatavely just in tshirts and fbts. However as we were walking back, these two middle aged Chinese men catcalled at us from across the road. We're all girls so we were all quite freaked out. They made the whistling sound and called out things such as "show more legs girls" and "unf unf unf" (the sex sound). I don't understand why men would do this? Its disgusting and rude and not at all flattering in any sense. Please don't tell me to order in supper next time or not wear fbts because it just promotes the fact that men have an edge over women and are able to control our actions. I just needed to rant and also let other girls know to be careful.

As a person who rides a bicycle around school daily, this is my reaction to all the recent rants about public transport/ shuttle busses.

To confession , the announcer is the same as the one used in europe. Got tell you where the stop is better than dont have. Live with it. Stop complaining. Complain so much, use your own voice.

SERIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE NEED TO MOVE IN THE BUSES. like you don't just stand there and watch as people struggle to squeeze in when there's a huge SPACE to your left/right. hellooOOOoo -__-

I think there should be a teo heng in sch. Imagine the crowd. And can provide lunch or break karaoke session to let ppl sing their hearts out and relieve stress.

It has been two weeks since I bumped into this canoeist at the deck and I've been going back there just to see him again. I made eye contact with him multiple times but I dare not go up to him. I wonder if he feels the same wayy

I overheard his friends calling him by the name of a vegetable. so cute
-
 
So guys I don't want any judgement, I guess I'm in the right place. It's more of a advice situation than a confession.... Ok so... This is so hard to say because I'm so embarrassed. I met a guy and he was great and we've got the stage where we want to take it to the next level. If you know what I mean ;). But the problem is that I've not trimmed down 'there' for a while and I went to guardian in clementi last weekend and purchased hair removal cream...no big deal... I've used it on my legs in the past but when I applied what can only be called "hells lotion" down there my body reacted badly. So I now have a rash on my 'pink panther' and my boyfriend is coming over tomorrow evening to do the dance, so to speak. I mean the hair has gone so I can recommend the product to a friend. But if anyone has any advice that would be great thank you. 
-
 
I do not pay for your shuttle bus service.
But I ride it anyway.

-
 
I don't know why ppl from science don't want to walk to kr mrt when they can. It's just a short distance. They pian pian want to squeeze up the bus and take 1 stop to mrt. Really I don't get it. You rather be squeezed like sardine than to walk at your own pace to the mrt. I understand you pay for it but sometimes you even wait for another bus when the current bus is full. Like omg. 
-
 
will you guys support the ramen stall at pgp/btc?
-
 
This is just a suggestion about the Internal Shuttle Buses. Do you guys think that A2E should stop along some bus stops along the way to Kent Ridge MRT if it is relatively empty?These bus stops could be say UHC bus stop or University Hall bus stop! 
what do you all think?
-
 
Today I chanced face to face at Utown with my ex who left me for another girl he met in camp. It suddenly brought back all the pain I hardly ever got over a year ago. I was all alone, awkward and wanted to hide. Is it right for me to call them shameless? 
-
 
To the OP of . We Science students will do whatever we please. If we feel like taking the bus, we will. Like you said, we paid for it. Anyways, a lot of people do get down at Science most of the time.  So, its only common sense for us to get on right? And its not like the buses weren't already packed when it arrives. Will it kill you to just withstand a packed bus again for just two more stops? Like omg.
-
 
Is it just me, or are the new NUS shuttle buses distinctly worse than the old ones? The new shuttle buses seem to be smaller than the old ones, have less seats, so they carry less people than the old ones. Not only that, it feels like the acceleration and braking forces on the new buses are even more severe than on the old buses, and I nearly sprained my ankle once when the bus braked in front of a zebra crossing. 

Also, NUS should really consider adding more D2s or Kent Ridge - Utown direct buses on weekday nights, considering that so many CCAs have shifted their operations to Utown facilities.

Ever since I've upgraded to Windows 10, I have seen so many fantastic photographs so scenery and travel on the lock screen.

Dear friends from NUS, I recently lost a red coloured thumbdrive with a little gorilla keychain attached to it at approximately 5.30pm on 17 Sept 2015. I think i might have left it in the printing room of the PC Commons in Utown when I was printing some notes there. There are many important files inside it, and I need to retrieve it urgently. If you happen to be around that area at that time and have seen it, or know of friends who could have been there, PLEASE PLEASE contact me @91784264 immediately. Please also help to spread the message around if you can. Thank you very much!!!!
-
 
The smell of the new buses in NUS are so bad that I feel like vomiting after taking them for one or two stops. It doesn't help that the drivers drive in such a jerky manner that my stomach lurches along with the bus. Once, I got off the bus 4 stops before my intended destination and stood bent over the side walk coughing because my stomach refused to function as a stomach. The worst part was that everyone just blatantly stared at me as they walked past and not one single person asked if I was okay or if there was anything they could do.

This is an old note but I thought it might help some of you out there who are struggling with heartbreak. The world is much bigger than that one person. I did consider editing out some details to maintain anonymity but I felt it would destroy the essence of it. So friends who have actually read this note before, please keep this secret to yourselves :)

Dear X,
How are you doing? I ask because you blocked me on Facebook. No actually, it’s really just for formality’s sake. A few months ago I would have thought that breaking up was the worst thing that happened to me. Today I am thankful that it happened. Do not be mistaken, however. It certainly hurt like hell. It might have been a somewhat short relationship but know that it really meant something to me. However, today, I am not typing this out for the sake of opening old wounds. Rather, this post is to thank you for setting me free.

I am typing this from a hotel in Hanoi. My room is the top most room with no other way up except for a winding narrow staircase. A drunk guy stays just half a flight of stairs away and the door needs a key to lock from the inside. The toilet makes random noises whilst the aircon spews cold freezing air despite setting it to 30 degrees. There is a creepy cupboard with a mirror facing the bed and the walls have some really bad leak stains. tl;dr - a really dodgy hotel imho and I really hope that there isn’t a fire tonight or I probably wouldn’t make it out.

Despite being slightly drunk, completely drained (because every trace of coffee has left my system) and pretty fucking sure I won’t get a good night’s rest, I am happy. For once, I am able to look forward to the next day.

It has been one hell of a trip. I booked this trip one week in advance, with completely no clue as to what I would be doing when I got here. I couldn’t sleep the days leading up to the trip and I think I ate something bad the day before. I downed a cetirizine, two panadols and a charcoal pill before I got on the plane. Time really flies when you’re having fun. In the blink of an eye, I’m counting down my return to Singapore by the hours. I’ve had so many firsts on this trip – first meetup with a foreigner I only exchanged a few messages with over the internet, first female (probably a prostitute) that asked me for sex over social networking, first Caucasian match (more than one actually) on tinder <more to be filled in later>. All of these would not have happened if I was still traveling with you.

I now have stories to tell. This particular one I told a few backpackers I met along the way: I arranged an airport pickup by my hostel. Before I got on the plane, it didn’t occur to me that I should have at least looked at the map to figure out which direction my hostel was from the airport or roughly how long it would take to get there. Upon exiting the gates, I was immediately whisked away by a woman holding a card with my name and hostel name. I tried in my very best sign language to convey a need for a SIM card and money changer before we got moving but to no avail. So here I was, all alone in a foreign country, following a random woman into a random car. The journey took about an hour. I didn’t even know if I was headed in the right direction. I counted every second of this journey. I stared at building after building, farm after farm pass me by, all the while crossing my fingers that this lady was not trying to kidnap me. If I had gone missing then, it would have been all your fault.

I am now convinced that I don't need to travel with friends. I can make new ones wherever I'm headed. I met so many backpackers on my trip. I’ve learnt so much about everyone else. Almost every one of them were in the midst of multi-week trips through SEA. I listened to their stories like a child. Suddenly, everything clicked. They were living a much more meaningful life than me. There were these two girls that only met up once before they flew off to teach English to the poor. There were these two girls that were so oddly different in characters yet they decided to do a 10-week travel through SEA.

(this is where I went to bed)

I am intrigued by the people here. I have not experienced any crime yet. I am now typing the rest of this out from a café that overlooks chaos. The view is magnificent. For the past 5 minutes in particular, the traffic has been at a standstill. No one wants to make the first move. Everyone just sits there and honks. Pretty ridiculous tbh but immensely entertaining. I have decided to update the craziest thing I’ve done in my life to “crossing a road in Vietnam”.

Thanks for opening my eyes to the world. I think I have typed enough. My life is no longer a boring script. It is now a picture album. And I must go fill it with pictures.

Ciao.

Ok so basically I was on the shuttle bus and I was sitting behind this guy. He is my friend, but I didn't call out to him since I was too lazy to start a random conversation in the morning. He was browsing on his phone, so I tilted forward towards the back of his shoulder to take a look on what he's doing on his phone. He was scrolling through his newsfeed on Facebook. Nothing special. Then, he clicked on Photos and start scrolling through as well. Oh My God! His gallery is filled with photos of random girls and some of my friends. These are photos they uploaded on Facebook and he must have downloaded it. Then I saw my own profile pic in his gallery too... D: You know who you are. Please stop doing that. I will not embarrass you by confronting you since you are pretty cute I have to admit, but please be a gentleman.

What's with all the fuss about haze?
The PSI Levels in my Biz classrooms during lessons have always been this high.

Once again, one of the guy's toilet in central library is flooded with pee. I must be so unlucky today. I did not know it until I stepped on it and it soaked my slippers and splashed onto my feet and legs. I really swear that it is that bad. Imagine the frustration I had as I still have lessons. Now I have to wash away the stench of pee on my slippers. Thanks god I did not slipped. Really boils my blood to the max.

Admittedly, one of my top on the iTunes hitlist is...

B777-300ER take-off.

To the point that Youtube keeps on recommending a whole bunch of other aircraft, but only the B777-300ER takeoff engine sound is powerful enough.

This morning I was on the train, standing in front of a row of occupied seats. And suddenly for no reason, I started having a boner with no way to hide it (i was wearing tight jeans). The ladies who were sitting front of me started smiling and I was getting embarrassed. But after awhile I decided to embrace the attention and it felt good.

Some people just need to learn some table manners. To the group of people who ate at foodclique in the evening (15/09), is it that hard to clear your own mess? Gosh, the poor uncle had to clear this entire mess for you people.

The boy was a charming talker who could get any girl he wanted. The girl was a top student who had never bothered with a relationship because she just wanted to focus on her studies, and take care of her younger siblings.

She wasn't extraordinarily pretty, but she was pleasant-looking. Many guys had tried to chase her but in vain, such was her resolve and focus on her priorities in life. When they first crossed paths, he thought nothing of her, and she even less of him. But why not? Seems like a decent challenge, to him anyway.

He tried but never succeeded, until he discovered her weakness: she would always feel obliged to help classmates whose studies were poor. He was a smart boy but lazy and generally preferred playing and fooling around. Fair enough, she started helping him with his studies. But despite helping, she refused to go out with him on dates. He was a smoker and a drinker, and she wanted to deal with none of that in the future. Or so she thought.

They eventually got together because he was so persistent. She saw the change in him, from someone who dated around a lot, to just focusing on trying to win her over. But she was never happy about the smoking. Despite her many many warnings to stop, he'd slow down but never stop, and eventually pick up the pace again. 

Fast forward 35 years, and he got diagnosed with lung cancer. Does she blame him? Yeah, of course. But that didn't stop her from supporting him 100% right from the chest pains, to the many ferrying trips to the hospital for scans, biopsy and eventually the surgical removal. She was always there before he enters and after he leaves the operating theatre. And she would spend the whole day just sitting with him and tending to his every need: Adjusting his pillow 5cm, massaging his stiff neck, scratching an itch he can't reach, wiping sweat due to excessive pain. 

Love, today, we try so hard to define and make sense of. But a love so deep cannot be defined, has no restrictions and transcends all rational thinking.

I'm so proud of papa and mum. :')

To the 8611, I love girls with braces and I think they are damn cute ! I don't know why but some boys do like it !
Do not think in a way that society wants us to think ! If your friend has said you look cute, it means you ARE cute, so go ahead with the guy u have a crush on, or else,

"I don't know who you are, But I will find you and appreciate your beautiful cute smile".

Cannot propose lah coz I got a girlfriend, she has braces too and If i start a relationship with you, I too will have braces soon coz my g.f. will break my teeth ;) 

All the best! And keep smiling! The shyness in your smile will help you find the right guy ! :)

Imagine a movie scene. 

The camera rolls over the seas, with birds flying over it. Now, the camera turns up overhead, and in the distance, you see an island covered in mist, much like those shaolin temples on top of misty mountains.

And as the camera comes closer, the mist slowly goes away, revealing the mystical place, with 2 mystical towers.

It's the MBS. And it's covered in haaaaze~~~ haze haze everywhere!!!!

"Women who choose not to date short guys are just as worse as men who choose not to date fat women. Actually, they are even worse because you can change your weight but you cannot change your height." 

However, that being said, being short or being fat would have been disadvantageous for survival in the past. Hence, please do not blame us for instinctively seeking better options and overlooking you if you are genetically predisposed to obesity or being short. 
Note: If you are obese, there may still be hope in that you can control your diet and exercise. If you are short, God bless...

This is weird but sometimes I avoid places like UTown Koufu / some specific toilets cos of the bad lighting. It reveals blemishes on my face and makes me terribly self conscious. I can't be the only one right. Thats why I always go to places where the lightning are more forgiving on my skin.
-
 
I don't get it. Why do people always feed food to those more greedy animal? They eat so much food aldr you still feed them.  Can't you see the more quiet animal behind them waiting for you to feed them. AND YOU KEPT ON FEEDING THE GREEDY ONE. MAKES ME SO ANGRY.

What a accurate depiction of the world. Nobody ever notice the less aggressive being. So cruel. All attention on the gregarious one. Regret not buying food and feeding the more quiet swan yesterday who is waiting expectantly to be fed:(((

I'm turning 21 in about a month but I'm still so childish it's not funny.

When pokemon go was announced and I'm like omfg so cool super exciting i want to play but wait!! I'm going to be a freaking adult soon?? Isn't Pokemon aimed to little kids???

My peers around me are maturing into fine young men and ladies. They start to wear more sophisticated clothing, and take up more adult hobbies like.... idk? Baking? One day this late bloomer will join their ranks.... after I become the no. 1 pokemon master………..

Doing a poll here: what do people think of peeing in the shower? I mean, it's not like it's unhygienic or anything since the water and soap will wash everything away. Plus it saves water from flushing too. I think it's just social stigma that people don't do it more often, although I'm pretty damn sure people do do it. Especially guys I'm willing to bet haha

Hi nuswhispers

Is it weird to put baby powder/prickly heat on your groin area? It soaks up moisture there and keeps it clean and smooth. My GF saw me doing it one day and she was genuinely surprised. I thought it is a rather common thing for people to do. Oh serious.

Also, mandatory shoutout to awesome GF!! <3

i see alot of young sinkie couples are like that.

grad from uni, work a few years, decide to settle down by buying a house.

but wait, don't want not any hdb flat, but want condo.

sign up to buy $1 million 2 room condo, get $200,000 from parents  to foot down payment.

next, need to buy a satki continental car, at least a bmw, so that friends won't laugh at them behind "got money buy condo, no money buy car". another $500,000 gone. if buy "economy" car, very sia suay. need to live up to the condo image~!

next, wedding banquet must be held at 10 star hotel. otherwise, said "friends" laugh behind their back again "got money buy condo and bmw, no money for hotel wedding banquet". if hold at normal banquet locations, very sia suay. another $100,000 gone. need to live up to the condo+bmw image!

1 year on, everyday quarrel due to financial stress, break up, lose money time and heart.

the problem is the "need for face". no "face" will die meh? are people living for themselves or living up to others' expectations and opinions of them?

I stay at home most of the time on weekends. Even on weekdays, I usually go home after lessons. This gives me a lot of time to study and chill, but I feel like everyone else has a more exciting social life and that makes me feel lonely. I appreciate having time alone but it can get frustrating being stuck at home with your family all day. 

Is this lifestyle unusual? 
-
 
I got choke on my haze 跟 dust ice cream just now. I jiak ba bo sai pang so come and confess.

What a weekend it has been,
So many things have been seen.
First people went to vote,
Then they came to gloat.

So many posts and comments,
Yet few making any sense,
But then came along a Wong,
And proved everybody wrong.

While wondering these days,
What's happening with the haze,
People asked Prof Ben,
How to hook up with men.

With the mid-terms fast approaching,
I'm getting down to chionging,
But then I keep wondering, while reading my texts,
Where are all the posts here, on relationships and sex?

Sorry I am not a poet, but may be someone can write one better.

"Call uncle," a neighbour told his daughters.
"Huh, not call kor kor meh? " I thought.
Then I remembered I'm older than him.
I'm still non-deciduous (lest the egg explode in microwave). Not that it bothers me, but I suddenly feel so old.

Question for people who go to UTown Pool: can girls wear bikinis there? 
-
 
My family and friends sometimes will ask. Eh you so skinny why still wear loose clothes. Eh why never wear button clothes and be stylish. One thing I know is. I'm fat. I appear skinny, but behind the fabric facade, I have a tummy. And I know I won't look good in button clothes because I've tried them before. Ppl staring at me like I'm from some other world. 

Eh why never style your hair. Cos I know I won't look good. That's why I always ask the barber whether got hairstyle that look nice without gel or wax. On another note, I don't know why ppl still style their hair when they play sports. Yes I'm referring to photos of ifg. You sweat leh. Why still bother.

Was wondering if the ghosts are only allowed to book out during the 7th month, why would there be spirits around during the other months...
If we can be late for school or pon lessons, you think the ghosts cannot pon hell meh?

Saw the posts about hunks in the medicine library so I went to check it out myself. For the past few weeks I wasn't disappointed (there's this year 3 student that always sits in the corner) but... Recently he's gone!!!

WHERE DID HE GO

I'm the OP of . In case you think I'm a stingy girl who tries to save every cent by hand-washing everything, no I'm not :). I do use the laundry room, and I think I should share on the types of clothes that we should hand-wash :P
1. Those that are labelled "hand wash only".
2. Bras. Girls, if you want your expensive bras to last long, you MUST wash by hand! Or at least use the most delicate mode of the washing machine!
3. Panties. Panties should be washed right after use. So washing your panties by hand everyday does a lot of help to the environment.
4. Your working shirt's collar & underarm area. Those are the areas that tend to to gather most dirt and sweat from your body that the washing machine are not able to clean thoroughly. It's recommended that you go through these areas by hand first before throwing them into the washing machine.
-
 
I actually prefer having people wash clothes in the pgp kitchen. At least they leave nice scents. Some people in my cluster like throwing left-over food into the sink and let the fermented smell fill the kitchen -_-

Gosh it's ppl like you that makes PGP miserable. I too stay in PGP, and while the facilities there can be run down or malfunctioning, it's the terrible behavior that makes it a sad place.

Washing up in the kitchen sink. Are you kidding me, it's a place for ppl to prepare food.

In my time I have seen ppl wash their feet in the toilet sink, seen ppl leave their poop in a perfectly functional toilet bowl, and rubbish everywhere in the kitchen except an empty rubbish bin, which is also right next to the chute.

Can anyone help me understand why some ppl are so messed up?

Since there are so many recent posts about medicine and dentistry, let me share will you guys what i call the "Dummy's guide to the medical library". This guide is modelled after my 2 years of experience at the med library, and how i eventually got attached;) 
Identification - just so you know, not everyone in the med library are from med! People, like me, love to go there for the comfy seats, and the hunks;) but there are ways to identify these medical students! Dental students are easy, they always wear this brown lanyard around their necks like medal like that. Medical students are a little harder. The upper years of medical students are almost always in formal wear, but one thing that stands out, their sleeves are always rolled above their elbows! They too sometimes wear a lanyard around their necks, or some pulley thingy around their crotch displaying their matric cards;) The lower years are more difficult... either they are wearing a medicine tee, or they cant be identified. what i havent got to understand is the colour coding, it seems that they have green, red or blue stickers on their cards. Well who cares, i found my hunky future doctor already;) all the best fellow searchers

Hi I stay in PGP and I would like to share my perspective on washing up in the pantry. When I first moved in PGP, I thought it was really weird seeing people doing all those things too but after a while I realised there are reasons why people do it. Firstly, the toilet and pantry use different kinds of tap, one that requires user to press again and again for water (in my cluster's toilet there's one that isnt working and one whose flow stops the moment you stop pressing it T_T) and one that doesn't. Obviously the one that has a steady flow of water is preferred. Secondly, the water from the pantry tap is much much stronger than the weak flow of the taps in the toilet. Using the pantry tap thus saves a lot of time and effort. Thirdly, the sinks in the toilet are small and it's hard to fit in our plastic basin for washing clothes. They also take a long time to discharge water.
So even though it's not a nice scene, who cares as long as it serves a purpose. I will continue to do this unless the PGP does st to improve the water flow in the toilet sinks. Of course I do not let any of my clothes/raw food touch the sinks (be it the pantry sink or toilet sink) directly, the cleaners always use lots of pungent chemical for cleaning them and you never know what other people do with it/throw into it when you're not there.
P/s. I hate PGP, for PGP everything is all about money or they will not care. Once, at around 1~2am I realised I left my transponder in my room and could not open the block gate to go up to my room. I did not call any friend for help but went to FCC to ask for assistance. When I reached, the security guards on duty were dozing off, they told me I would have to pay $20 for them just to press 1 button. I said no I don't want to pay and left. I think they continued dozing off...

#policyslogans:

For ISB:
#BagDownBenny and #MoveInMartin when on the damned ISB. Also, let me introduce #SitDownSiti when someone vacates a seat to get off. (Don't understand why some ppl just stare at the empty seat dumbly and continue to complain no space to stand). #GiveWayGary to let ppl alight and board the buses.

For PGP residents:
#FlushItFrancis when you finish using the toilet, be it for pooping or peeing. #WashHandsHannah after you are done. #LiftSeatCoverCarina when you guys pee, #LiftSeatCoverKanina. I'm sure no one likes to use a disgusting toilet. So please, 'gentlemen' of at least 18 years old, civilized students of the world's top 30 universities, clean up after yourselves #CleanUpClarence.

Lastly, pardon the irony, but when you wanna complain about poor school services without having constructive ideas to contribute, please, bring out the #DiamDiamDanny in you.

Seasons may change, winter to spring. I'll love you until the end of time. I'd give anything to sit on a roof, kick off the moss and get cross with the verses of her song. One girl came close but I guess you only miss the sun when it starts to snow. I should have told her, but I just held it in. I had a black space but I didn't write her name.

Don't filter pls :(

I don't get why we must always have a need to give up our seats on the train to 'old people'. Sometimes they are so rude and unfriendly that you don't even want to help them. I know how it's good to do so and I give up my seat if I see someone who needs it like a pregnant lady or a frail elderly person. But sometimes I just don't give a fuck.

Being rejected from dentistry makes me really sad and angry. So I always take my No.2 in the dentistry building toilets to release my anger ( also cause the toilet is nicer and cleaner). When i feel really angry and upset with my rejection then I will purposely not flush after I am done. 

Oh btw, I am a girl.

Let's draw up mock electoral boundaries for NUS

GRCS: All the different faculties, and UTown
SMCS: UHall, YIH, Ventus, UHC and all the non-UTown residences

lol ok back to work...

One of the OPs mentioned that medicine is full of pretty/handsome, smart people who can do everything. It might disappoint you to know that NUS  medicine has countless elitist, judgemental students who aren't very nice after all.

To the one who take my laptop charger(HP one) in SoC:
Please return it to the same place or send it to the security post beside the ATM near Biz canteen because life is really hard if I can't access to my laptop. I can't submit assignments, can't make applications either. I will really appreciate if you can do so.

There was this girl in a black dress two days ago on Monday, watching Sunig basketball. I felt something when our eyes met. Not sure about you, but if you feel something too, then I will hunt you down. Or you can hunt me down, Thursday 1pm to 3pm I'll be at Utown Starbucks, usually outdoors. Hope to see you!

Been seeing quite a number of young doctors wearing stethoscopes around their necks in Science canteen and NUH foodcourts, and putting said stethoscopes on the tables when they eat. It's freaking unhygienic! Can any Medicine student or graduate enlighten me why they are doing this? Do they even sterilise or disinfect their stethoscopes before using them on patients?
-
 
There's this guy in dentistry I think.. some days he comes in a black long sleeve tee, some days in extremely well fitting shirts. I always see him coming to the medical library and I secretly undress him in my mind every time he walks in... Please stop making me so wet...

There's this new guy in the med library the past two days. I've never seen you here before. I've been wanting to say hi but you have too many friends around. You were in a grey tee yesterday, sitting opposite a girl. Is she your girlfriend? ;( I wish I could muster up my courage to go over and say hi...  Why do you have to be so damn irresistable.

I'm a Varsity athlete and have represented NUS in many sport competitions over the past 3 years, but I have a secret, a confession. I'm a heavy smoker. I smoke before and after almost every lecture and training session, but somehow have managed to hide the smell. A few months ago, I tried quitting for the sake of my health. One of my relatives suffered from lung problems due to smoking and I saw how everyone close to him suffered, emotionally and financially. But today, I realized that all my efforts were for absolutely nothing because all the Facebook posts about GE2015 gave me cancer anyway.

I'm reliving my childhood everyday. I see lots of Ultraman on the street cos of the current trending guy hairstyles. Nice.

I sometimes wonder if medical or dental school interviews factor in looks. The people in med and dent look so bloody amazing its almost ridiculous. Can study, good looks, tall buff hunks, chio next door girls in flowery dresses... one thing im sure, my visits to the med library will increase from now on:)

Goddamn pissed off. There's this particular bus uncle(might be more than one, not sure) who just skips stops. Crowded bus stop he just zooms right pass without a second glance. Was at science bus stop at 9.24pm on the 7th, A1 went right past a full bus stop of people after training. I got on the 95 right after and saw that he stopped at later stops.

Possibly related to the other A1 bus uncle who just skips com centre and goes straight down to biz. Convenient for those not going there, but not so much for those stuck inside waiting? Pretty fucked up job attitude if you ask me.

I know I'm a uni student, but who cares. Anyone still plays Yugioh and has old/new cards about? Let's plunge NUS into the shadow realm. Everyone's dying anyway, so why not have a little fun? ^^

People honestly need to move in on buses. Every bus that I've barely squeezed into have so much space in the middle, and people don't even have the basic graciousness to move in more so that more people can board or make the trip infinitely more comfortable for the people jam packed at the doors. I've even seen a group of 3 people forming a circle in the middle leisurely chatting when everyone's squeezing at the doors. Gah. 
-
 
Used to know this dude in JC. Seemed pretty chill, not the highest self-esteem kind of guy, but a pretty ok friend to hang out with. Lost contact and fast-forward 3 years later in uni: he's become pretty much the douchiest guy I know with that rooster style hair and gym-rat lifestyle. Idk if i never knew him that well or what, but srsly wtff it's like he's overcompensating for something.

He comments frequently on this page; whenever the keywords 'gym', 'muscles', 'good-looking' appear on a confession, he's there.

I had this dear friend of mine. We were in the same poly for 3 years and came to NUS. We are both in SOC. Tomorrow we are supposed to print some stuff for a tutorial. I asked that fker to print he say he too lazy to TURN ON HIS PRINTER. Reality check, do i need friends like him? I am so hurt now. Why cant he just open his printer and help me print.

Reading  and the recommendation of using tampons remind me of when I first tried to use one. I was horrified by the idea of putting something inside myself. Don't get me wrong - I have a healthy sexual relationship with my body, but somehow I fainted trying to put it in. I even contemplated getting my boyfriend to help me. Guys, would you help your girlfriend put on a tampon? Am I weird??
-
 
Guys. Stop it. Stop all the gymming. Yall look weird. Tight clothes and all that. Yes, you look good with ok muscles. But bulging muscles. No. You are occupying space on the bus with your muscles. On the mrt too. And you are tiring out the machines in the gym.

to  you can try rolling up some toilet paper and placing it in your buttcrack. As long as it isn't too thick, you'll hardly feel anything. Hope this helps.

Can anyone show me an example of this yellow ceiling? I was lamenting the other day about the weather being fine when I bring my umbrella but when I leave it at home for just one day, it rains. My senior told me that NUS is connected and there are sheltered pathways, I just have to follow the yellow ceiling. That conversation was during our tutorial. So after class ended, I tried to look for this yellow ceiling but I cannot find it. Is it because my lesson was held at a newer building? Does this yellow ceiling rule not apply to every building in NUS?

People have been complaining about how crowded the shuttle buses are recently. A2 frequency seemed to have increased a lot compared to last semester. However the frequency for D1 has reduced. And last semester used to have a lot of blue UT-CLB direct buses too. I ever waited for 40 mins a few times around 5.40pm as I couldn't get on the bus at all. 

I realized that there are posters encouraging students to walk from Utown to CLB. However the weather is so hot and there's a slope at YIH-CLB. I'm not complaining but I've tried and I perspired like crazy. 

Would it be nice if NUS campus can have a tunnel system like MIT (refer to the map attached)? I believe a lot of people are willing to walk to school. Besides, we can still travel to school even though it rains heavily.  Isn't it an awesome idea?

Went down this evening for a run, met this old uncle who asked me if I know where is (insert political party's name)'s rally tonight, I said sorry I'm not sure. He was like "vote for this party! We always help our people and listen to their voices, unlike other parties!" He then went off to ask another passer by if he knows where the rally is. I continued jogging, approached a road where I didn't see this step and fell down. A car sped past me and was THIS close to hitting me. I sprained my ankle, it was really painful and I couldn't get up for a while. It took me a minute before I could pull myself up and bring myself away from the road. The old uncle was only like 10 steps away but he just stood around looking for other people to ask where his rally is. I mean ok if this is how you help the people around you I'm not really impressed.

Anyone else felt that the rides at universal studios Singapore are very mild, except for revenge of the mummies and battlestar galactica? Most of the rides I would say are meant for kids. 

Also did anyone think that $74 is a little too expensive for so little things to play? Thankfully I managed to get the $20 ticket for passion card holders to visit USS for the first time yesterday night, and I must say for the rides in USS, $20-30 ticket price is ok but definitely not $74. They should at least have given Singaporeans some discounts like in gardens by the bay flower domes tickets.... Anyone else agrees?

So many posts on bus. Here's what I feel. The old bus is better than the new bus. Is it only me that feels that the capacity for the old bus is bigger than the new one? And the new one the PA system is so extra. And it breaks down quite often. And the frequency of the bus is so so so unpredictable. The system in the past is so much better. At least I know whether I can choose to walk or to wait. Now, I walk a few metres, the bus come I no chance rush back to board cos ppl will already be there to squeeze up. I nearly waited to tell the person holding a clipboard and sometimes videoing the buses, I call him assessor, to return to the old system. Did the committee actually try out tgt with us? Like squeeze up with us?

Do guys expect their girlfriends to have a flat tummy? I'm skinny, but I'm not one who gyms constantly so I have a small tummy pouch. Granted, its not visible even when I wear slightly tighter clothes so I know some of my friends think that I have a completely flat tummy. However, I know I don't and I'm insecure about it, especially when I think about getting attached...

i'm in a dilemma now. i was surfing some singapore porn sites (don't judge) and came across pictures of a girl masturbating who looked like a friend of mine. upon checking facebook, i found that it is her sister!

should i tell her? i dropped a report on the images but i doubt they work. what should i do??

Why is NUS shuttle buses getting increasingly crowded? Partly because the design of the new shuttle buses. It may seem ironic that it can hold less people even though lots of seats are freed up as standing space in the middle of the bus to increase the bus capacity. Here are the problems I have observed:
- Bus size itself is smaller as compared to the older one which was super long
- Very large spaces taken up by some engine compartments at the front and back. 
- Wasting space when there is poor design to have left too much space between the seat and the divider
- Super narrow corridor at the back and it's super difficult for people who wants to alight to squeeze through

And those announcements for the next stops aren't really necessary, and it's hilarious how the system is getting a bit rusty with the words getting stuck like those spoilt old cassettes.
-
 
@, girl, as long as your tummy isn't as big as mine, I'd date you anyday. I'm a guy and I have a tummy too. I do gym, but I must be doing something wrong lol. But like you, it's not visible even when I wear slightly tight shirts etc. 

I wonder if you, or girls in general, would date a guy who has a tummy?
-
 
To students who like to stand under the sensors at the exit of our shuttle buses, for god's sake, either open your mouth and ask others to move in a little or quit wasting everyone's time and alight to wait for the next bus. I understand the frustration for not being able to board, but seriously when the doors are unable to close (I assume you have ears to listen out for the alarm), JUST FREAKING GET OUT AND NOT LET THE WHOLE WORD WAIT FOR YOU!! I have lost count of the number of times the bus drivers had to raise their voices at these students. 

Just yesterday on board A1 to school, this driver shouted again in mandarin, "门不可以关!!!" (door unable to close), and then he muttered "cha tao" (hokkien: 木头/wood). I want to giggle so badly.

one reason why i love NUS is that there's a lot of cuties around

Ladies and gents of NUS. None of us like to miss a bus. So can we adopt the Bag Down Benny attitude and squeeze more people on board the buses? We are already uncomfortably packed. I think it is way better to squeeze more people than to be packed against bulky backpacks.

I have a dark secret that has been gnawing at me for a very long time, but I find myself unable to tell a living soul about it. I am a zoophile. Seeing the stray cats wandering about campus distracts me as much as most straight guys would be by a gorgeous girl walking past them.

I never knew that NUS had a school song! Gooooo NUS!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upSiYPaafJA

Lyrics:
Through our friendships forged
From our treasure store
Of bright golden days of old;
The minds that spurred us to greater heights
And the hearts that made us bold.
The distant shores before us rise
The world awaits our enterprise
For we¹re sons and daughters all
Set forth from Alma Mater¹s Halls.

In the years to come
We will draw new strength
From past golden days recalled.
And set our faces toward the light
Of the challenges in store.
Our dauntless hearts will we unite
To seek the good with all our might
Bringing honor to the fore
To NUS forever more.

The fruit/drinks stall at biz canteen has two queues, one on the left for people buying from the shelf (fruits etc) and the other for people buying juice from the right.

Is it acceptable for a guy if his nipples' shape is visible though a t-shirt? It's not a tight-fitting shirt, and it's neither light-coloured nor translucent (so can only see the shape). I don't want to have to wear an undershirt as it'll defeat my intention to keep cool (temperature wise) and minimal (no nipple tape or bra please).

Thank you.

Is it just me or have the shuttle bus rides been delivering a worse experience this sem? With that extremely loud annoying beep that keep dragging on and on and the swerving and braking of the bus that literally sweeps people off their feet (I suspect oversensitive brakes but i'm not an engineer so oh well).
-
 
I seriously think that ppl shouldn't be so obsessed with appearances. Like for instance, I want to jio my friends out for a meal. What do they reply? Oh I going to the gym now. Maybe next time. Wow your body is more impt than your health. To put it blatantly, society's view of appearance has already marred our senses and understanding of how we should actually look. One should look healthy and fit. Not humongous that you occupy too much space on the bus. Or too skinny that you can squeeze between 2 lamp posts. Exercise to be healthy. Eat when you are hungry. Eat well. Be well. Stay well. And not drink excessive protein powder or diet tea.

I'm a non local student staying in Hall and I don't join in their activities, not because I do not feel welcomed but I am a very shy and introverted person. I am very pressured around people and I have this feeling that everyone is judging me and staring at me. Recently they had a block gathering that I was unaware of and I needed to use the toilet for a number 2. I walked out and saw a lot of people near the lounge area so I decided to use another block's toilet instead. However, there were many people there as well but they had already seen me so I just continued. I went in, did my business, and the whole time was worrying about how to face everyone outside that I forgot to flush. The next thing I knew, On my way out, three girls proceeded in with the block activities. I fled the toilet straightaway. Now in my room Thinking back, I realised I should have went back in and flushed the toilet because they would have knew it was me who left it there. I can't even face anybody in my block now and I am just waiting for the news to spread out on the block chat. Please help.

Just a random few rants. Why don't more guys watch K-dramas. I know a lot of girls watch it. And somehow people have the stereotype that many koreans are "plastic" and korean pop culture is pretty crazy, and I think that's pretty unfounded. I also find their songs, drama and reality shows pretty entertaining. I'm just your regular dude who watches quite a few kdramas and I enjoy it for their plotlines and nice camera angles...lol. And the girls are pretty too ;)

For all those people complaining that school is lonely and empty, even living in hall or residence, I have a real suggestion for you. Back when I used to stay in KFH for one year, I felt the same, and did something about it. It might seem random or outright creepy, I did it anyway. I slip a note into every room on a few levels, asking them if they would like to have a home outside of home. If yes, how about making lunch together every Saturday. They for the remaining levels, I knock on everyone's door and ask the same in person.3 camps of people emerged – 1) the bo chup 2) those who think I am creepy 3) those who volunteer as tribute. Glad to say, among those tributes, some move on to be my good friends after University. Shame is temporary, face your fear and be the change u seek.

hmm thanks to this anonymous platform here's a question I would really like to ask: can I ask what's the general opinion of a girl who has dark armpits? I wish I could ask my friends about this but I'm guessing it'd either be too embarrassing or they'd just say they won't judge me but then again they'd probably judge me inside their hearts even though they're just too polite to point it out...
I've tried shaving and waxing and hair removal cream in a bid to remove my armpit hair but somehow I ended up with a dark patch of skin on my armpit :( Now I'll never get to wear sleeveless dresses unless I apply foundation cream or something on my armpits? Would that work? Now I'm really fretting over where can I find a wedding dress with sleeves....

To OP of ,

Unfortunately all you need really is self discipline :( Try and run/skip for 30mins every day to reduce overall body fat percentage, and if there are specific areas you want to slim down, do exercises that target those areas. Food wise eat only till you're 70% full, cut down on carbohydrates and make yourself full by eating more vegetables meat etc. Following the recommended calorie intake is what some do when they diet, but personally I dont think it's really necessary to achieve an average body figure. Eat clean, avoid oily food and sugary drinks (especially canned/packet drinks, bubble tea etc) Whenever you feel like snacking, don't do it.

The first few weeks will probably be the hardest to keep it up, but it'll become a habit after a month or so. Good luck! :)

Some people think its ok to pick peak printing hours to go ahead and print their whole goddamn textbook. I even saw a girl printed her 100+ mb textbook. Seriously, what the f**k? Of course nobody has the rights to stop you but at least be a bit thoughtful yeah?

Up till now I am still reminded about the magic of Seattle, the first time I visited it when flying to Seattle-Tacoma through Tokyo-Narita.

I hope to return someday there just to continue the exploration of such a fascinating place (hopefully SQ will do something like SIN - ICN - SEA in the mid-future). :)

Someday... I will return.

Pre-monday blues are horrible. My sunday evenings can literally be ruined just by my sheer worrying and dreading of the next day. To the extent where I don't like to schedule fun stuff on sunday evenings, because I know I'll somehow remind myself and spoil the fun :( Oh how I miss my Monday off-days.

I've been frustrated with this but have not had the time to write a post here. To those who take shuttle bus around, please do take a seat if there is a seat in front of you. I meant, unless there is somebody else nearby who needs the seat more than you do or somebody who actually wants the seat standing next to you and you don't mind standing, you won't get judged sitting down. To me, it is actually a better act of kindness for you to sit down and allow people to move to the rear instead of standing there and blocking people especially during peak hours. I know all those stories on STOMP about people getting judged by sitting down comfortably on MRT and all but please use your brains...

I'm a girl who is very very very addicted to games.

But the point is, I think my addiction is starting to affect my studies cos now my work load is quite high but I still spend most of the times on games..Anyone knows how to quit gaming

Since secondary school, I have never been the skinny kind and tried to go jogging and do simple squats and sit ups around 2 times a week outside school. It would last like 2 to 3 weeks each time then I lose the motivation to continue, and will start again a few months later.

Now as we become adults, people are more and more concerned about body image but I really don't have the motivation to go exercise.. Plus I eat a lot, I think I sub-consciously reduce stress and boredom by snacking.

Any advice for me? (Confirm those hard core gym people will laugh at me.) I think what I really need is self discipline. :(

During many of my lectures, I have nothing in front of me on the table, I just look at the screen. However, when I look around, I notice many people have laptops or writing materials in front of them.

During my primary school days, I used to be ogled by the same man in my block whenever I walked past him. Back then I did not know that it was called ogling but I know it is not right for a guy to be staring at another guy. (I am straight) I was quite disturbed by it so I can understand how girls will feel being ogled.

Sometimes, I feel I am a bit weird for a guy. I don't watch soccer, i don't game and I don't watch porn. Somehow, I don't find joy in doing those stuff.

Not a NUS student, but just another NSF who's now serving his duty to the country and who will be leaving back for the States after ORD. So earlier this evening, I was sleeping on the train journey headed from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon to tank a duty for a friend who's having some serious family problems. At JE, I was wokened up by this dude in a NUS shirt. He asked if I was heading to a certain camp in the far, far West (lol) to which I nodded my head in a "simi?" fashion. Then he said to me, "5 more stops. Don't sleep anymore" before making his exit. 

I looked down at my bag to see a sneakers bar and an attached post-it that read, "you look shag, rest well buddy" I don't know who you're, but brooooo, you seriously made my weekend!!! That was a freaking nice gesture. I'd have been so proud to call myself a NUS student and even prouder to call you an awesome human being. *BRO HUG*

On one of my 10am Fri lecture at LT1 1 week ago, there was this girl who came to talk to me after my lecture. Unfortunately, I was in a rush for my next lesson and did not have a proper conversation with you. Really sorry for that. I have not seen you for the subsequent 2 lectures after that. Are you taking the same module as me? If you are, I hope to see you for the next lecture. (:

I ended school late yesterday and managed to reach home at 7pm. Because i wish to play basketball and practice my drills, i went to the basketball court near my home to play. The basketball court was such that half court was occupied by 2 guys and the other half by me. I only managed to play for 15mins before 2 bangladeshi guys walked from a distance. I just continued playing anyway as i did not think much could happen, until they decided to sit at a bench directly facing my half court. Out of so many benches around that area (including one bench facing the 2 guys playing basketball competitively), they had to sit at the bench directly facing me like wtf?!?! 

Yes i know my parents asked "who asked you go play basketball at this time (7:30pm)". But what i could not comprehend is why as a girl, i appeared to be an object for ogling, especially to leacherous guys? Why is it that as a girl, it is so difficult even when i wish to play basketball, i can't have the freedom to play without being watched? Why does the differences in antomy cause a problem to girls in particular? Why is it that some guys have to make me so uncomfortable such that i must end my basketball drill in 15mins and go home immediately? 

In my opinion, the 2 guys playing competitively are more interesting to watch compared to just one girl practicing drills. Don't you all think so? 

I am sorry for the rant but i just hope you guys could give me some insights about what is so interesting to see about a girl, and what should i do to minimise such incidences from occuring again? 

Note that i practice at the courts near my home for convenience sake and i can only do so at around 7pm due to my school schedule. I never wear any revealing clothes too when i play. And please do not say i am inviting such problem if i need to practice drills in the evening and just because i am a girl, i have to expect such problems. Any constructive advice would be appreciated...

I always hear people said the older you go (starting from 20s), the easier it is to get fat. What they meant was when you are younger, you can eat junk food without getting overly fat but from 20s onwards, its very easy for the weight to balloon very fast. How true is this statement? Is it because metabolism starts slowing down at 20s?

The top few things that annoys me most.

1) People looking at phone (facebooking, video etc) and walking too slowly, obstructing the pathway especially when the place is already damn crowded and people are rushing.

2) Youtube ads. Yes i read that YouTube requires more bandwidth because of all the videos and such and the ads help some with the cost. But why last time don't have problems with cost and thus no ads?

3) people leaning against poles on buses (nus ones included) or mrt when other people need to hold too (forgivable if the person is old but not so for young fellows).

4) Walking into a toilet that is just washed. Well it just seems gross and disgusting to be stepping on wet floor...

Like if these 4 things annoys you all to the max.

Anyone else annoyed by people who pretends to graciously form a second queue beside the main queue when waiting for a train to arrive. And when the train arrives, they will be the first few to enter the train, effectively cutting the entire main queue. Wonder how this can be prevented. Sorry for the rant.

Is it true that people can tell whether you're staying in a hall in NUS or not? My third year staying in hall and my non-hall friends are always asking me why I dress so slip-shod for an arts student (much stereotype here). I merely wear hall/school based tshirts with denim shorts and slippers for lectures and tutorials although sometimes I do wear fbts to deck or biz for lunch.

This is the second time this year that my underwear has been stolen from the laundry :( It's quite annoying because I might find myself in short of underwears for the week, but at the same time I somehow feel aroused by the thought that there's some guy (or girl!) out there who fancies my panties.

I don't intend to report this, because quite frankly it's not that big a deal. I'm really curious though as to who it might be. I've been thinking of ways to bait the culprit out but just seems to much trouble. Aiya anyway even if it's some not too bad guy also don't know what to do. 

Just hoping it's not some slimy disgusting dude, or one of those cleaning ah peks.

I am a guy and I absolutely love wearing FBT curve cut shorts as they are unisex. I do understand the length of these shorts is quite short, in fact very short for a guy to wear. I am not very tall, medium height, well built and I go gym regularly and I believe these shorts are very comfortable. I usually wear black or blue, not any fancy colors.  The problem is , sometimes I get some strange looks from boys and girls too in gym, public transport and other places and they stare at me. I wonder why ? Can you guys help me understand? Am i right in wearing these shorts or wrong as I am committing a fashion blunder?

Thank you NUS community for all your concerns, I'm the OP of .

A miracle occurred and prevented me from taking the corrupted path of no return. By coincidence, I bumped into my ex-boyfriend (He is working there) at the airport and we had a short chat. When I told him that I will be going to U.S. for competition, he immediately sensed my lies. (He might be the only guy in the whole world, who could read my mind.) I got no choices but to confess everything to him. He felt worried and attempted to persuade me to stay, however I kept assuring him that I had made up my mind. In the end, he gave me his blessings and we parted ways. My mood became complex afterwards and I went to the washroom to cried it all out. I looked at the mirror and started to scold myself for being indecisive at such a crucial moment. 

It took me awhile to stabilise my emotions before I dragged myself to meet my client. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath to clear my doubts for the final time before taking a step towards the departure gate. The most bizarre event of my entire life occurred! I felt a pair of hands grabbing me from my back and lifting me up. I lead out a shocking scream before realising that the abductor is my ex-boyfriend. I began to hit and scratch him vigorously like a mad women, at the same time yelling, "let me down!". He replied with a cold tone, " Shut the f.. up, you are coming with me". I stopped my struggling and placed my arms around his neck and rest my head on his chest. While he was carrying me and racing away from the direction of the departure gate, I kept pleading him to "stop" . However my true feelings contradicted my actions, deep in my heart I felt really happy and it's crying out softly, "save me! save me!".

He brought me to a quiet corner and dropped me down. I didn't gave him any warning before I delivered a slap to his face. I broke down completely, and I kept hitting him and called him a murderer. He then screamed at me and proceed to lecture me harshly in order to knock some sense back into me. I began to realised how foolish and naive I was....

In the end, he offered to pay for the medical expenses and I promised him that I will not commit any silly act again. The nightmare is over now, but I felt really guilty for my ex. I was the one who cheated on him and my current boyfriend was the third party that snatched me away. I have done nothing to deserve this kind of treatment, why he still treats me so well?

I'm flying off to United States now. I lied to my friends and parents that I'm leaving for 3 weeks to participate in a "Global Design Competition". The sad truth is, I became a social escort and my job is to accompany a middle age businessman to U.S. This is my first assignment, once the plane takes off there will be no turning back. 20k, yeah.... it's the price which I sold my virginity to him. 

There are no rooms for regret now. I'll just have to close my eyes and everything will be over soon.... I'm not a money hungry slut, my boyfriend is lying on the operating table right now. 

Forgive me, everyone.

Today is the launch of NUSGo - app to find your meal buddy! You can jio friends, or place a marker and let other jio you - all with a single click on the map! 

Are your friends too busy to dine today? No prob! Make a new friend today!

Visit www.nusgo.net
I think the shuttle bus should increase in frequency especially closer to lecture timings eg 8,10,12,2,4, not the usual 15mins interval. Worst the app is simply not accurate. I rushed through my lunch today thinking the bus would come in 6mins as shown by the app, only to realise the next moment after refresh that the bus had arrived-.- 

The app used to be pretty accurate in bus prediction before the new batch of bus arrival/changes to the bus system. Why did the app accuracy go down with the new system??

Anyway, is it just me or does anyone else seems to realise that frequency of A buses/D1 or any other buses going towards CLB have a higher frequency compared to D2? If so why is utown bus deemed to be less prioritised compared to CLB buses?

When I was staying in PGP , I recall an incident in which I walked past the pantry to see my cluster-mate 'drying' his socks in the microwave. I stopped using the microwave from that moment on.
Now, 4 years later, I wonder if that same microwave is still there. I'm not going to say which block it is, because its more fun that way :P

Guys, be careful of some of the frequent commenters and be wary of messaging them privately. They are not what they seem. They sometimes talk behind other people's backs and they don't take people's problems seriously enough. It's like a game to some of them. DS and M. Ng are okay. The rest you should be careful of.

I am a Year 4 Science student. Just casually had a chat with my secondary school junior who joined Arts this year.  Asked him how he enjoyed NUS so far and he went on excitedly telling me about all the fun he had during orientation - all the pretty girls and all the crazy things they did ... such as dunking in water at the beach during their orientation camp.

I recall two years back, one of my course mates became semi-paralysed while undergoing dunking in Sentosa during orientation. He had been a super sun-shine kinda guy always smiling and cheerful. But after the incident, he became incapacitated as his spine was injured and his whole nervous system were affected. He was no longer the all-smiling guy we used to know. The thought of my coursemate just made my heart sank when my junior reminded me about dunking.

Should we allow dunking in our orientation activities? 
Should our camp organisers risk people's lives in exchange for the fun?
What do you all think?

I had a health problem a few years back. When it was minor, it was already discovered so I went for treatment and physiotherapy to treat it. But it got worse. So I went for more treatment. I thought it had stabilised, but then it suddenly got way way worse. So I went for surgery. One of the result of the surgery is my restricted movement. Now, I want to step out my comfort zone, I want to be more fit. But because of that stupid surgery, I cannot do sports. I cannot dance. I cannot do what I want. I cannot stand for long periods of time and it is so embarassing when I have to sit on the mrt even though I look normal. But I'm not normal anymore. I cannot do what I want. I hate it. Why must it happen to me? Why did my condition get worse even though I discovered it early and tried to treat it? Why do I have to live with limited choices for the rest of my life? What did I do to deserve THIS?

Well OP of , you asked for more realistic ghost stories. Here's one: 
When I was about 10 years old back in 2005, my father used to travel on business around the world for various projects. Some of these trips could last for a few months so my mother and I would accompany him. We spent a month or so in Capetown, South Africa. While my father would be at the office, my mother and I would go sightseeing. We visited beaches, the downtown area, the botanical gardens, the planetarium and natural history and history museums. 
One lazy weekday afternoon, we also happened to visit the Iziko Slave Lodge. One of the slave lodges used by the British during the colonial days, it is now a museum and relic of the days of apartheid. The various rooms housed objects belonging to both slaves and slave owners. There were detailed descriptions and narratives that transported visitors back in time. The whole place carried a sense of deep sadness that oddly contrasted with the bright afternoon sunshine filtering in through the barred windows. 
Being a working day, there weren't many local visitors with kids old enough to understand the exhibits and there weren't many tourists willing to spend a bright sunny day contemplating one of the darkest moments of human history. I was a kid with rather unusual interests in history, art, politics and civil rights. So there I was, with my mother, poring over the seemingly petty odds and ends that had once belonged to very real people. 
It was in the room full of children's toys. I have no personal recollection of this at all and what I am about to describe to you now is based entirely upon my mother's account of events. My mother is quite the rational person and always falls back on the scientific explanation of things. She isn't superstitious and has never told me strange stories or discussed the supernational in any way other than in jest or in serious consideration of people's beliefs. I therefore have no reason to doubt her intentions in telling me this. 
I was apparently looking at some little porcelain figures or what have you and she was generally taking it all in. There had apparently been one couple who were the typical tourists who entered to merely check whether they had missed anything and had left in a matter of minutes. We were well inside the small room and its entrance was a short distance away.
She says that the old white man was wearing very old-fashioned clothes. 
She doesn't remember if she saw him entering the room or not. He had his back to us and appeared to be looking at the exhibits as well. He had white hair and clothes that nobody in their right mind would wear these days, even if they were older people. 
We've discussed this incident a few times in the many years following it and have speculated about it. It is after all a state-run museum concering slave history and they are liable to have people dressed in the clothing of the relevant time period in order to help bring history to life. 
But my mother made some key observations that don't sit quite right with that premise. His neck. The back of his neck appeared extremely old and weather-beaten. The skin seemed worn away beyond commonly recognised skin conditions. "Like in Pirates of the Carribean" she says. 
By imperceptible amounts after the tourist couple left, he apparently kept moving closer and closer to where we stood in the room. She says that regardless of what situation might have been, she didn't feel quite right about it at the time. She doesn't know if it was her, but the temperature of the room dropped quite significantly despite the sunlight. As he approached, keeping his frayed-garment clad back to us, she felt an unknowable dread growing within her. In the extreme silence, her panic grew and grew until ....... "I just took you and ran out of there." 
Within minutes we were back outside in the warm sunshine and within an hour we were back at the apartment. She didn't discuss this with me until after a couple of years, back in Singapore. I don't remember the finer details of the museum visit but given that she recalls the event in such great relief, I have scratched my head and tried to remember as much as possible. I remember the toy room and it's powder blue walls. I remember the general layout of the objects in display trays lining the walls. There was a partition in the middle of the room with some information displayed on it. I presume she had initially spotted the old man through the partition and began to panic once he made his way slowly around it. I remember the couple and the insensitive, haphazard way they moved about. I remember that we left in rather a hurry. 
And I am sure that had I seen a member of staff dressed up in the colonial garb of old, I wouldn't have ignored and then forgotten him but would have instead been utterly enchanted. Funnily enough, the fact that I hadn't seen the man and do not at all recall any element of danger makes me find my mother's recollection even more credible. 
She is not one to maintain a false story for over a decade for the mere purposes of amusement. She is not one to indulge in meaningless fear mongering and incitement. There is a reason I was completely oblivious that day. There is a reason this was not my experience to share. There is a reason that my highly rational and logical mother decided to suddenly run out of a perfectly safe and secure public museum in broad daylight.

My indonesian maid once work in a factory in her village with friend A and B. One night, my maid and her 3 friends decided to go toilet together as the toilet is pretty far down the road and its getting dark and creepy out there. In the toilet my maid and friend A decided that 3 of them should share the same cubicle since they were scared. However, friend B decided to use her own cubicle so my maid and friend A shared a cubicle. After my maid and friend A were done, they knocked on friend B's cubicle but received no reply. They waited a further 10 mins before deciding that they should return to work. Upon reaching their factory, they were shocked to see friend B already back at the factory! To their horror, friend B even said that she did not follow them to the toilet in the first place! Who could possibly be the one following my maid and friend A to the toilet?

Let's share ghost stories here shall we? Would be very interested to hear true ghost stories from you all instead of made up ones. Muahahaahaha

These days I have been hearing about finding of parts of condoms or sex toys within an exclusive society. Did the exclusive society I join in really had an exciting sex life? I never once remembered my senior telling me about it.

I found, so far, a vibrator ring package, a condom wrapper, but neither the vibrator nor the condom. Alas, I decided to re-hide the wrappers just so that more will know about it to help me spread the word that there's a horny guy/girl among us. Maybe it's one of the couples that has regular romps in the room of ours. ;)

I recently got one of my wisdom tooth removed at nuh and to my surprise,  it was done by nus dentistry students. So this cute girl extracted my tooth and she was so nice to me. The process wasn't smooth but she had ensured her best to calm me down and even held my hands. After the extraction, I forgot to ask her name cause I was traumatised and went back immediately. Now I wish I can see her again and I look forward to have another few wisdom teeth growing out. Any idea how to make wisdom tooth appear faster?

hi , posting here in response, instead of using my own facebook acc (for obvious reasons, haha). i'll try to answer some of your questions, but this is just one girl's thoughts, so you may like to take it with a pinch of salt. it also varies from girl to girl. 

yes, it is quite obvious when guys (or girls, for that matter) look. think about it this way. one minute your eyes are looking at the other party's eyes, the next minute, your eyes shift downwards. heck, i think it'll be quite obvious if a lady stared at your nether region halfway into a conversation. 

to the "age-old" question... some dresses/tops just have such "cutting"? personally, i may like a particular dress (think - prints, length, flare, etc) but the neckline happens to emphasize the cleavage? i don't really find your question sexist. it's a legitimate question. 

ALSO, from the perspective of a guy, have you realized that some guys (or most guys) are taller than their female friends? how should we, as females, know at which height, can guys have a "birds' eye view"?! it's not everyday that we buy tops and bend down in the fitting room to see if we will get downbloused, right... 

my own dressing can be considered conservative. but there will always still be people (males and females alike) who like to stare...there. you don't expect every girl to dress in a potato sack, do you? 

to reply your question of "select few" versus "anyone to look"... no, i do not have a target audience, neither do i dress up for the male eye. but at my age, i would prefer not to attract looks from old men?! hahahah. not really discriminating, but put yourself into young girls' shoes - would you want someone of your own dad's age, looking at you in *that way*? 

hope this is helpful! i am also keen to hear other girls' views. :)

(p.s. it is quite disturbing when i catch my guy friend doing that. especially if it is a close one. girls never forget. so, boys, please!! be less obvious even if you have to stare!)

This happened in my freshman year:

I took part in RAG that year. We played Angel and Mortal in the last few weeks to push each other for the final show. After RAG, we were supposed to get each other a final gift to congratulate each other for completing RAG. I bought my mortal my favourite cookies but could not find her even 1 week after RAG. So with a bit of a friend's encouragement, I gave in to temptation and ate my mortal's cookies during some lecture.

I work at Yio Chu Kang. Everyday there is this old auntie, sitting on a wheelchair, selling tissue paper just outside the entrance of the mrt. Every time I see her, I feel bad for her because I've never seen anyone stopping by to buy from her. I have been wanting to for some time, of course I won't even mind spending $2 to help her every day - it's just a small amount to me. But somehow I feel this is not a permanent solution.... yet I feel too small to be able to help her in a permanent way. What should I do?

Has anyone encountered this. You enter a toilet cubicle and an unclean toilet seat greets you. As in shit stains on the top periphery of the hole. And in the bowl. You are urgent. So you tried your best not to think about them. When you are finished, you come out. Only to find another person waiting for your cubicle. And what greeted you also greets him. 

Here's what I did. I heard a soft gasp. And I said. Not me. 
And left the toilet hastily avoiding eye contact. Don't know nowadays how ppl can shit until like this.

I signed up for runnus and in the racepack there's this instant fair vaseline lotion. I was opening it to check it out but the lotion spilled when I jerked the lid open, and the lotion got all over my hand. I rubbed the lotion all over my hand and now I can't stop smelling my hand because.....

it smells like a girl.

Sincerely,
An evergreen guy

I stay with my boyfriend in his hall (basically illegal squatting because i stay too far away from nus), and most of his neighbours here have their girlfriends staying over often as well. Once when my boyfriend went off for training, his neighbour's girlfriend came into the room. She wanted to borrow a pad, so i got up and rummaged through my drawer for one. While finding a pad for her, i made casual conversation with my back turned towards her. She suddenly started touching my boobs from behind. I was shocked but i must admit it felt good, better than my boyfriend does it anyway. We then locked the door and made out on my boyfriend's bed.

I'm pretty sure i'm straight but after this incident i'm no longer sure. Could I just turn bi like this? Should I tell my boyfriend about this? Also, the girl winks at me when i bump into her in the corridors. Help.

OMG!!! Why is everyone talking about sex in NUSWhispers these days??? Why can't you keep private parts and private matters to yourself? It's making the poor virgin me very insecure. I mean I was actually hoping people would use this platform to, I-don't-know, give away tickets to Imagine Dragons, Pharrell Williams, Maroon 5, or Taylor Swift concerts and make people happy.

Kinda Disappointed :(

I love watching cooking videos, the type which shows how muffins and cupcakes rise in the oven, and how the meat patties change from raw pink to juicy brown on the grill. I love these videos more than porn.

To the couple at one of the male toilet nearby CLB earlier (19 Aug 2015). We could hear the moans of your girl together with your voice in the locked corner cubicle of the toilet. You were too engrossed with whatever you're doing that you didnt hear us even entering the place.

Just wanna say, dont worry... We were the only ones who entered that toilet during your time there. And if anyone asks, in accordance to The Bro Code Article 14, both your identities will remain a secret. Just find a new place to do it, coz we had to search another toilet to take an urgent dump so as not to interrupt y'all.

I think it was love at first sight.

To the bob-haired girl in black top, denim shorts standing near the staircase next to AS6 at around 12.30 pm today (19 August 2015),

Can I see you again? Same time, same place one week later. 

Hope to see you there.

It's only the second week of the school term, but somehow every place that I go to on campus would be filled with memories of the times I had spent with you. Everything feels empty and different without your bubbly smile and chubby cheeks.

While staying on campus with you for two whole academic years, we have slowly made nus our little home. Each little spot in school has its own set of memories. From our quarrels, to exercising, to late night suppers and studying sessions. When you slept in till late in hall, I would buy back whatever food you loved in between my lectures so that you wouldn't have to wake up hungry. I hated tomyum so much, but you adored it. You were my best buddy, my confidante, my lover. 

We made a promise to always try our hardest to pull through difficult times, and to never part ways. Why did you ever give up on our relationship. Why did you ever give up on your fatty. No matter how disappointed, angry or upset I am, I would never have given up on us. That promise meant a lot to me. All the dreams that you told me all the time about having a family and children with me, still haunts me till today. 

Even till today, I'm still wishing so desperately that we can be whole again. 

I miss you so much L. Without you, I'm a mess.

I feel quite sad that so many girls like to wear circle contact lenses these days. I mean it's your own eyes you can put whatever the hell you want on them but have you ever looked at your eyes up close in a mirror? They're beautiful, much more so than contact lenses.

Hello! Do anyone else talk to your bolster/pillow or chou chou? I talk to them everynight and I'm quite convinced they are alive and are able to communicate with me. But I'm also convinced that I have some mental issues. What do I do? Help.

one of the smoothest pick up lines I have ever been on the receiving end of was this occasion when I was grocery shopping at ntuc by myself. it wasn't very late at night, probs around 9ish 10pm and this guy approached me. he asked if he could hold my hand because his ex girlfriend just walked in with her new boyfriend and he didn't want to feel like a loser and that his ex had one up above him. he was quite cute and it was bright in ntuc so I figured he wasn't gonna rape me or what anyway so I was like ok. after 5 mins of walking around in ntuc I realised that we were the only 'couple' there. that's when I realised how smooth his pickup line was. #truestory

Spotted: another green-haired girl (or is she the same one?!) at LT20. I'm seated somewhere and am constantly being mesmerised by your hair. :)

The green looks notoriously similar, though, so I am really not sure.

Is it a girl thing that they like to drop their hair in paint and colour part of it? Why not just colour from root to end?

During work, Kevin and James were chatting:
Kevin: James, I've been attending night classes for 5 months now and I have an exam next week.
James: oh!
Kevin: For example, do you know who is Graham Bell?
James: No
Kevin: He's the inventor of the phone in 1876; if you take night Courses you would know this.
The next day, the same discussion took place:
Kevin: Do you know who Alexander Dumas is?
James: No
Kevin: He's the author of "The 3 Musketeers", if you take night courses, you would know this.
The next day, once again:
Kevin: And do you know who Jean Jacques Rousseau is?
James: No
Kevin: He's the author of "Confessions" , if you take night courses, you would know this.
This time, James got irritated and said: And you, do you know who is Yevgeney Kafelinkov?
Kevin: No
James: He's the guy who's screwing your wife!! If you stop night courses, you would know this.

 We can welcome you to join our sex parties. We rotate between various locations in NUS. Sometimes outdoors, sometimes PGP, sometimes the notorious CLB staircase.

On a more serious note, if NUS is not to your liking, I could open my house near NEX, if it suits you better. Condition: I must join in the party.

I'm the kind of girl with low self esteem. Ever since secondary school I have been despising my body figure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not obese at all, in fact I'm quite slim. However, my boob size and butt size are really pathetic. 

Whenever I enter a lingerie shop, I will always take a C-cup bra into the fitting room and wondered how I can fit into these? In the past I had even came out with crazy ideas like, "stuffing tissue paper" and "using water bag". What irritate me the most, are the sales girl that will constantly remind me , "小姐 wrong size 了. Sometimes it really pissed me off to the extent that I told them, "bitch please! ikr!". 

Every now and then.. some people will describe me using 飞机场上，两个钉子 (airport runway) or  洗衣板 (washing board). I always pretend to be unaffected by all these sadistic remarks when I'm in front of these people, but I will always cry myself to sleep in the night. 

To make matters worse, my self esteem problem has affected my relationship. Due to the fact that my boyfriend's ex has a really hot body that i envy, I will always question his love and commitments to me. I learnt from my close guy friends that, "guys would of course want to fuck the girl who has the bigger breast". I started to doubt whether his love is genuine,hence I always threw random temper at him out of the blue. 

Yesterday night, I gave my first time to him. During the sex, he kept on moaning while fondling and groping my almost non-existence boobs and butt. I began to suspected that he was faking an orgasm! My inferiority overcame me and I burst into tears. My boyfriend immediately stop and became worried hence I confessed all my problems to him. He hugged me tightly and told me, "Baby, I sincerely love you. I don't give a damn about your boob size at all. I'm not faking an orgasm, your P**** is really damn tight. Oh yeah, I really like your p**** shape, it's so beautiful".

Till now I still can't comprehend the meaning of his last statement. Although, it sounds quite gross and super weird! I couldn't stop laughing non-stop because it is really funny too. In conclusion, "my boyfriend is a fucking sick bastard!" and we continued our unfinished business.

This morning, my gf for about 3 years came over to my place just like every other Sunday. My parents are usually out in the morning till late afternoon hence we have some private time. We would usually just laze around, talk about stuff, watch TV or play PS4. However, today something really unexpected happened and I really cannot get it out of my mind.

We took turns to play GTA V and whosoever got arrested or killed during gameplay passes the controller over to the other player. Suddenly, when it was my turn to play, she kissed me on the cheek. I was taken aback and looked at her. She was looking into my eyes and then at my lips. For the past 3 years of our relationship, we had never kissed, and the closest body contact we had is a full bear hug. And without saying anything, she grabbed my cheeks and reached forward to kiss my lips. I didn't move as her lips contacted mine. 

My face felt really darn warm and my heart kept pounding when her lips kept smooching on mine. Then, I felt her hand reached into my shirt and onto my chest, and realized she is trying to pull my shirt up, while the other hand reached for my groin area. Her body was pressing against mine. I knew what's going to happen next if I reciprocated. But I got so scared and I jerked away from her and asked if she's alright. She said yah and then I picked up the controller and continued with the game. Then everything settled down and both of us did our stuff as usual. I guess she didn't want to talk about it, neither do I. Thank goodness.

I'm not a dense idiot. I obviously know she is trying to take our relationship to the next level. However, I just cannot envision myself having sex with her. To me, she's beautiful, sporty, got a great body and all, but it feels very disgusting to do it with her. Like most men, I do have desires too (yes I FAP), but.... I dunno... it just feels weird to be screwing with someone I like. So I need some advice. Has anyone of your bf or gf made a strong move on you without warning? Will it ruin our relationship based on what I did, or did not do? )-:

Some people just do not know how to "zi dong". It is this type of people that cause inconvenience to others.

Other good examples include: 
1. People who leave their belongings at the library table and go for a long lunch break.
2. People who chit chat at the quiet section of the library.
3. People who hog hawker centre/canteen seats (e.g. chit chatting when they are finished eating) during lunch time.
4. People who stop at the end of the escalator.
5. Motorists who park their vehicles and obstruct traffic. The best ones are not even there to shift their vehicle when the need arises.

The list goes on...

Granted, OP of  can obviously "open his golden mouth" to ask whether he could use the PC for a moment. But the root of the problem lies with the person who is misusing the system and depriving others of the shared resource. The burden of alleviating the situation should fall on the person who created it rather than the person who is being inconvenienced. So, just look around--is it crowded? And spare a thought--should I be surfing the net and hogging the place? Not wait for someone to ask you to share the PC. This "act-blur" and selfish mentality has to stop.

A workstation is a workstation. How about surfing the net at work and telling your boss you're "taking a break"? There's a time and place for everything. During working hours (0900-1800), the PCs  should not be used for recreational purposes, especially when there are no empty slots.

People need to think about others and do the appropriate thing. Otherwise, stricter rules and enforcement is the only way to go.

The courtesy lion cries tonight.

Hi! I am very desperately seeking everyone's help! I lost my wallet last saturday afternoon (15/8). It is light pink and rectangular. I am not very sure but i think it may be at or nearby the McDonalds in Engineering (ie. the circular staircase ). Everything from my atm card, matic card, etc is inside. Please comment if you have seen it. Thank you very much!!!

Guys, do you prefer your girlfriends to wear makeup or not wear makeup?

I held my breath. My hips went up and down, thrusting my pelvic bone deep in the position, leaving me breathless. I couldn't keep holding the pressure building up in between my legs. The urge to release it was just too great... Sweat started dripping down from my face. And yet I held on as long as I could. A few more thrusts, I thought. A few more until my hands give out, until my legs tire out. 

I was finally relieved when I managed to rep out 10 reps of 225 for my deadlifts :D

My roommate's girlfriend sometimes has the key to our hall room and she would then drop by to look for my roommate. One morning while i was still in my room sleeping and my roommate off for his lecture, his girlfriend entered the room to pick up something from his cupboard. 

So she just came in abruptly and saw me half-naked as I woke up. We then started making small talk to get rid of the awkwardness. To cut the story short, we ended up making out and going all the way. To my roommate who I know will read this...I am sorry.

There's this girl that steals glances at me during lectures since I was a freshie. I haven't talked to her before as I skip lectures often due to sleep deprivation. I think she's pretty and am worried that she will be attached when she goes for SEP. Should I do something before she goes for SEP. :/

I met an international student at an open house in NUS last Tuesday. I didnt get the chance to talk to her, but I overheard a conversation she had with someone and I think her name is Masha. I deeply regret not talking to her. I wanted to, but I had to be somewhere and when I got out, she had already left. I've been going to common places like Central Library and Utown, in the hope that she will be there, but there's just too many people in NUS. i have no clue which faculty she is from. How do i find her, if not for coincidence? Masha, if youre reading this, it is me with the tall friend, and we had caricatures drawn for us. Please reply to this :)

I really do not understand why some people love durians to the max, while I hate it the max. A lot of my family and friends like to talk about eating durians and even posting pictures of them online. I do not see people talking and enjoying the other fruits such apples or watermelons to that extent. Ever since a kid, I disliked the smell and taste of durian. It's so yucky! I can't even describe the stench. I remembered being forced to eat it once by my bf and I puked all over his pants. No offense to anyone who likes durian, but to me, I can withstand the smell of the garbage chute, but I cannot do so for this so-called "King of Fruits." Maybe it's because of my taste buds? I don't know. Anyone here dislike it as well?

Holy crap I stay at PGP and a girl always hangs her underwear and bras outside on the handrail in the common area. Am I the only one who is quite disturbed by it? Plus it's next to the toilet and I need to pass by there every time. Erm, if you read this, can you hang them somewhere more private please? And what's with the people at PGP mostly refusing to make eye contact when you see each other in the toilet/ common area? Once I said hi to one and she gave me a weird look.. LOL!? 

Anyways I have nothing against them, it's just a little weird. (I used to stay at one of the residences) I don't know anyone here so anyone wants to hang out? I heard there's a WA group?   
-
 
After classes or CCA end for the day, I always walk back to MRT along the main road to exercise a little. I will have to pass by NUH Mortuary and every time I see people seated along the corridors, my heart will sink a little and wonder what happened and when it will be my turn.

After reading a post on the FASS (arts bash?) photos, I went to see what all the fuss is about; and I was indeed shocked by the suggestive photos. I don't understand the wet t-shirt shoot. it's the suggestive nature of such photos that cheapen the concept. Can't it be something classier? Is it necessary for a wet t-shirt shoot to make the point that they are all slim and pretty? Did everyone in the pageant like and agreed to the idea of a wet t-shirt shoot? What....can't believe FASS club endorsed this.

First week of school ended and today was a Friday evening. I met up with this girl I met from orientation and we went to her hostel after dinner. Realized her was a shared room but she assured me that her roommate had went home. We went all the way and while we were at it. Her roommate returned. OMG SHE WAS MY EX IN SECONDARY SCHOOL.

Was on D2 (very crowded). A guy wanted to exit the bus, so there was some pushing and squeezing to get to the door. His hands brushed my chest by accident and he looked pretty awkward about it and apologized before exiting. But the thing is, I kinda liked it...

Today some girls in my class were eating snacks. It is understandable to eat some things bc it was lunch time. But it was quite annoying that they made a lot of noise. I don't eat anything in class even when I'm hungry. I think that's a sort of respect for the teachers and other students.

A well-hidden gem to all who stays in the North, Northeast or even the East side and travels to Utown, Engineering or YIH area in the morning peak hours:

Take the BTC shuttle bus from Botanic Gardens MRT station.

Will probably take just 5 more minutes, but guarantee able to board first bus and no squeezing in A1/D2.
-
 
At around 12.30pm today, I was running for the shuttle bus at utown when I lost my footing and fell, with the student life goodie bag I was holding spilt on to the ground. No one came forward to help, except for this girl in a floral shirt, denim shorts and hair tied up in a long ponytail. She has a cute dimpled smile and an appreciable demeanor. Most of all, she had a kind heart. Despite missing the bus because of me, she even made sure I was ok before we walked separately to the bus stop. All I know is she studies economics. I wish I plucked up the courage to ask her for her name...

So for this semester, I've chose to stay in a double room on campus in NUS instead of a single room. It was my positive experience bunking with a room mate in an overseas programme that made me make that decision.

The experience was pretty good so far, room mate was a pretty relax dude, quiet, but easy to hang out with. He was understanding with most matters, doesn't really mind the difference in lifestyle. Here's the problem, throughout the past two weeks, I've learn from our daily interaction that he actually bought over his peers in NUS to our shared room in between breaks. I was uncomfortable, but I understand that both of us paid rent, he has every right to invite friends over.

It was suddenly when I bump into my room mate and his friend around campus, through my conversation with his friend, I've discovered that my room mate promised him that he could always come to our room to sleep over anytime.

My room mate though it wasn't an issue the whole time and never check with me if it was ok or not.

So after the encounter with his friend, I approach my room mate to check with him with regards to this issue. After all, we still have a semester to go as room mates. I've express my concern with his friends coming over to sleep. I wasn't comfortable with people running through my things. I tend to leave my laptops and my wallet on my desk in the room sometimes for short lectures.

I stated an example, where what if cash or valuables are missing from my belongings in our room when his friends are visiting, he told me it was my fault that I am not locking it up in my own room. He told me he trust them completely. If anything is missing, he is just "sway".

But then again, I've only met my room mate for a week, and I don't know his friends at all. The though of my personal space being publicly accessible is nerve wrecking for me.

I don't know what position I should stand now, I was bought up in a family where one should feel safe in one's own home. It was actually shocking for me to meet someone that has a different perspective on this matter.

NUS Whispers Readers, thoughts? Advices?

It's 3AM in the morning and my friends and I need your help to answer this mind-boggling mystery.

When using a squatting toilet, do you face the flush, or the door?

We would greatly appreciate your input (or output, geddit?) below. This is NOT a troll... We are sincerely curious about this and have had differing opinions from our friends so far.

Have a shitty weekend!

It was 1am and I was sitting on the living room sofa with my dog. Suddenly, my dog stood up on all fours and started to bark ferociously at a glass door that led outside the house. He ran over to the door and made several low, menacing growls that I had never heard him made before. I realized that his head was tilted upwards, as if he was looking at something standing just outside the door. But there was no one outside.

Worried that he might disturb our neighbours, I got up to calm him down. “Jo?” I called out his name. However, as I walked towards him, Jo suddenly stopped barking. As if whatever he was barking at had disappeared, he nervously paced around the door and looked left and right outside before finally turning around apprehensively.

The first thing he did was to look at me. Then his gaze shifted a little to the side, behind me. That’s when he immediately cringed and let out a small whimper. He began to back away but his eyes were still fixated behind me. 

I realized what was going on.

I felt all my hair raising and goosebumps all over me... and I turned around…

Yesterday 12 June: I witnessed my crush walking around U-Town holding hands with a guy. My crush is very beautiful and the guy is very average. I pursued her during the special semester but she rejected my initiations. Sigh.. I am no handsome chap myself but what does he have that I don't? I still think about her day and night, and I hate her slightly for making me lose focus during summer lessons as I spent my time staring at her. Why can't you love me back?

Girl, can you not wear white shorts the next time you are wearing pink undies? It's distracting.

Thanks

From my point of view, Singapore is really impressive and always give me surprises. We have around 800km of waterway ( Unfortunately most are covered if not we will be the Venice of Asia ), we have one of the best university, one of the best international airports ( project jewel and terminal 4 and 5 coming up ),one of the world longest underground expressway, one of the best public housing ( duxton ), one of the most spectacular stadium ( with its own shopping mall, library and museum,   where else do you get this kind of museum ) and many more.

My room was messy. But I know where to look for my things when I needed them. After someone cleaned up my room, I lost this ability to look for my things easily. Lesson: Not everything that is messy should be cleaned up in an orderly manner. There are higher orders within the mess itself. Now I have to wait for entropy in my room.

On 5th August at about 1130pm, I had the unfortunate realisation that my wallet was missing. Tried searching for it at FASS and YIH, as those were the two places I was mostly at, but to no avail. Fortunately, I received an email from Tembusu College yesterday that one of their residents had found my wallet. To that kind soul, I don't know who you are but if you are reading this I just want to say thank you very much for returning my wallet. I really appreciate it!

I got to know this adorable girl after passing a used course text to her. We spent some memorable moments at the Southern Ridges and Little India (random!) late at night, before sending her back to her dorm. Unfortunately, the friendship didn't manage to advance. We both have moved on with our lives but still holding on to this interesting part of varsity life.

Just came back from overseas. And i realized how unfriendly Singaporeans are. When i say "hi, good morning/afternoon!", "How are you?", or "I'm <insert name here>. Nice to meet you!", people in the country that i visited and some of the non-singaporeans here will reply "hi!" "Nice to meet you!" Etc. But if i greet my fellow country mates, they will just say "Do I know you?"

I like girls in pink dresses. But wearing a big white ribbon reminds me of fairy tale characters. I am amazed by my classmate's dressing sense and my friends and i were restraining ourselves from bursting into laughter. I really don't know how to tell her to dress less glamorously. Maybe it is time that NUS conducts a Dressing 1001 module for girls to improve their style in dressing.

I find that most female Caucasian exchange student in NUS are hot-looking!!!! Also they smile back when you give them a smile. On the other hand, if you smile at a local girl, sometimes she will give you a black face. If the local girl is good looking, she will pretend as if she doesn't know you are checking her out by shifting your head to the side. Of course it could be due to shyness.

Here's my dirty little secret...I used to be seriously full of acne, like my face was
just oozing in the hideous crap. Anyway at the end of one summer vacation, upon the start
of school again, the outbreaks had stopped and many of my friends/acquaintances that I hadn't seen in a while commented
on how clear my face was, how much better I loked, how I'd done it etc. etc. I just smiled
and told them I used some over-the-counter skin cleansing remedies...but the truth is,
I'd just used my own jizz, applying it regularly every night or so. And it worked...

Last sem, just before lecture started, i exchanged a few sentences regarding assignments with this girl sitting in the row to the front left of me. Halfway through the lecture, because the table was wonky  i moved one seat to the left. Apparently the girl took it to mean something, because when i left for the washroom and returned, she moved the whole way across the lecture theater. The theater was extremely empty, so i am guessing it was to avoid me? I mean come on, i know i am not super good looking or something, but i am not some deformed person. Was it necessary to be so dramatic? Maybe to you it is insignificant, but that was really hurtful and that really did not  help me trying to get over my insecurities... Or maybe its something else, though i swear i shower everytime i leave the house :/

Seriously why are there so many tourists in NUS? There are many instances when i see them aligting in large groups from tour buses at utown. Just today a group of tourists taking the shuttle bus hogged the bus door and prevented people from alighting. 

I'm not against outsiders coming to NUS occasionally, it just gets annoying when they try to compete with the student population for already strained resources.

I am a girl who exercises regularly and my kind of exercises involves full body workouts that work on most muscle groups throughout the body. My dad had been saying that ever since i started exercising, i became fatter. I was very sure that i did not eat more than usual and neither did i eat more unhealthily compared to last time and my mom knew that too. I find it completely absurd that someone could get fatter when exercsing regularly and not eating more than usual. I have a feeling that because i am below average in height, i may have appeared "fatter" once i become more muscular. Also i realised that once i stopped exercising temporily for a month or so due to exams, my weight drop by 1kg even when i eat my usual portion of food and i suspect there is some muscle loss going on here.

Also can exercising makes one's bone wider and bigger? Thus another illusion of "fat" for someone short? 

If indeed exercising more can make one fatter without eating more/unhealthily, someone please tell me how this could happen. I would be interested to know the scientific reason behind this rather than groundless theories from my dad.

Hi everyone, I've got a rather random question for you: did anyone redeem the SG50 tote bag designed by Dick Lee (i.e. The bag with handwritten lyrics to "Home" printed on it)?

The thing is, that song means a lot to my girlfriend, and she's really bummed that she didn't get that design... I know it's down to luck and all, but I figured I might as well help her out a little by asking if anyone of you would be so generous and amazing as to exchange SG50 tote bags with me (should you have the Dick Lee design). That'd really mean so, so much to me. So thank you in advance!

So just leave a comment on this post, and I'll get in touch with you shortly! Haha

My bf and I finally did it and it was his first. I lied by telling him is was mine too. Fact is, I lost mine early at primary 6, when my brother tricked me into doing it with him. He only stopped when my period started half way into secondary 1.

10 years since i saw a team like you. i walk through the empty streets trying to think of something else but my path always leads to the stream. i stare at the screen for hours and try to wake myself up from this nightmare. i watch other teams play but it is no good. i masturbate and try to resist the sadness but it is all meaningless. the Secret is out. i then usually listen to some Yung Lean and cry myself to sleep.

Is your social status much lower if you are using a Windows Laptop? Because if you walk into a lecture, most people are using MacBook. If you walk into StarBucks, most people are also using MacBook and drinking those expensive drinks.
So it seems like:
Windows user == Noob
Linux/OSX user == Pro
MacBook is too expensive for me.

Topics on NUSWhispers seriously range from BGR, politics and foreigners to m*st*rb*t**n. Actually jo has a lot of benefits if it is done in moderation.

It prevents cancer. Guys who ejaculated more than five times a week were a third less likely to develop prostate cancer. Disease-causing toxins build up in your urogenital tract and when you rub one out, you flush the bad guys out of your system.

It makes you harder. As you age, you naturally lose muscle tone...even down there. Masturbation prevents erectile dysfunction and incontinence.

It helps you last longer. Taking yourself to palm prom may help you stretch your sack sessions. If it usually takes 2 minutes solo, try for 3 next time. Or count how many strokes you need to get to your happy place.

It ups your immunity. Ejaculation increases levels of the hormone cortisol, which usually gets a bad rap as a havoc-wrecking stress hormone, actually helps regulate and maintain your immunity in the small doses.

It boosts your mood and sleep. Masturbating releases a slew of feel-good neurochemicals like dopamine and oxytocin that lift your spirits, boost your satisfaction, and activate the reward circuits in your brain. A brain scan of someone having an orgasm looks like a heroin addict's.

I was caught red-handed just now. It was mid-afternoon and I was sitting at my desk in the bedroom and jacking off my D. I was not thinking of anyone or anything, as if my muscles are doing it involuntarily. I got the shock of my life when the door suddenly swung open and my father came in. He was stunned for a while and he regained his composure. My mind totally went blank due to the embarrassment and then he told me to go outside (living room) as he wanted to speak to me. 

I was frustrated as I did not get the chance to release my seeds of life into the tissue paper. But l was mostly so ashamed and I just sat in my room and not wanting to go out to hear what he has got to say. I really did not expect him to come home from work so early today and caught me forcing my D to vomit.  It was very very awkward and I feel a little disgusted at myself. After a while, I settled down and went out of my room.

My father was sitting on the couch and then he began his lecture. He first told me what I did is normal for young men and he even said he did the same thing when he was just 15, but he gave that up after meeting my mother. I had goosebumps and didn't say anything.

Then he continued to say it is not very healthy to be fantasizing intimacy with someone else especially when I already have a girlfriend. I told him I was not thinking of anyone while doing it, and he gave me a cynical look. Goodness! 

Then he further elaborated that I should conserve my sexual energy for my future wife after marriage because it is only right to give the best in everything to her. I kept looking down. And he told me if I do it once a day, it is ok. If I do it twice a day, it is unhealthy. If I do it thrice a day, it is an addiction. And I do it more than that, it is a problem. He told me to be responsible and not view women as playthings. I apologized and told him I will definitely control myself next time.

Super unlucky to be caught today. Imagine a 25 year old guy getting lectured by his father on such a sensitive topic.. I am just worried he may tell someone else, especially my girlfriend, for whatsoever reasons. My reputation is on the line.

So I made a commitment to myself, that I will never jack off again. However old habits can be very hard to change since I am typing this post with only one hand.

My Facebook feed decided to ruin my day by showing me a picture of you, the girl I once loved. The one I bid classes hoping you would be in, planned schedules so that we would "accidentally" meet. There’s a guy with his arms wrapped around you, but this is not what I notice. What I notice first is your confidence. Not caring that a camera has captured the both of you for eternity, or the repercussions that this picture would entail. Your details are freckles, braced teeth and a white pearl necklace. You laugh, truly unaware of the consequence this laugh will have.

NUS flag day people. I see you guys outside mrt stations and smiling at every one passing by regardless of their reaction. I don't know how genuine it is of course, but it must take something out of you to be able to do that. To the folks stationed outside Tiong Bahru mrt. I saw you this morning standing in that "covered" walkway despite the rain. You probably dont remember but I'm the girl in the black dress on the way to work who said sorry about not being able to donate. I really got no small change. I now have some after I bought lunch so if I see you on the way back - I'm donating! Keep up the good work. And other fellow NUS students who aren't participating, let's show some love to those who are :)

I dropped him off at the same bus stop like I always did. I watched as he flipped through the stack of photos I had just handed to him earlier. I could almost see the tears form in his ageing eyes. As I drove off, tears formed in my eyes as well. I could feel his loss. His son was now all grown up but he had missed it all. The stack of photos might have been trivial to me but it was all he had. I cried. Even though he was the one that broke this family up, I feel he has suffered enough. Over 20 years, I saw him change. I saw him grow a heart. I wish everyone else would forgive him. I think I have. Oh what I would give up to have a normal family.

Recently, there are so many inconsiderate people having their camp activities outside CL. They always screamed out loudly with their weird group's slogans. The staff at the door counter did not do anything to stop them though the noise had penetrated the glass door and permeated in the PC areas. I wonder if the same freedom will be granted to Mainland Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Indonesian (of course, with their native languages as they yell), or just merely Singaporeans only.

It's ok OP of , at least the lady only laughed it off. Once I accidentally walked into a female toilet on campus...to change clothes. Halfway through the process it dawned on me that there weren't any urinals around and I had the greatest panic of my life. Then it got worse. A female security guard walked in. I had to put on my clothes at lightning speed and spent the next few minutes apologising and explaining that I was, in fact, not a pervert or a potential rapist. Greatest FML moment ever.

This holiday, I chose not to do an internship like I always do. Instead, I worked in a part-time job that required little to no brain work in a fashion retail store. It was a much welcome change, honestly... 

I was feeling exhausted today after a late night shift, and was walking back to the train station when I needed to take a pee pee... I walked in the female toilet without realising it, got into a cubicle, peed and then it occurred to me.. Fuck, why got disposal bin in the toilet want? Since when male toilets got bin and actually, smells nice?! Then I heard some girl's voice outside at the wash hand area... at this point, I was like FML. I waited 10 min (seriously girls?? what do you all do in the toilet for 10 minutes??? not pee and go meh?) in my cubicle while playing Farmville, hoping they'll leave... but when she did, other women came in... I was bloody sure I was going to miss my last train. So after an additional 10 minutes, I finally got out of my cubicle... Wanted to make a dash when a lady opened the door with a stunned look on her face. Explained briefly (LOL) to her I got in the wrong toilet by accident and she laughed at me. I blushed like siao and walked away quickly to the station T_T 

Should've known something was amiss when I walked in and thought, "Wah, smell so flowery all."

I'm a regular female gym goer and I keep seeing this other regular as well in the gym. It irritates me that he's a guy and he can't bench more than 135lbs, and he keeps seeing the need to advice me and spot me when I bench. I mean, seriously, your bench is so weak, do you even lift?! Come back and talk to me when you finally touch a real 225lbs bar to chest bench.

My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease five years ago. He died of complications from it last year. When he died, I stopped playing the violin because I couldn't without feeling sad. He was a violinist who, in his 20s and early 30s, had played for orchestras in parts of Europe. Later, in his 40s, he retired and taught music, playing occasionally on invitations at private events. Towards the end of his life, when his illness robbed him of his musical abilities, I became his violin; each time I played his favorite piece, Vitali's Chaconne, a piece he taught me but for which I am terrible at, I saw this indescribable joy in his eyes as though he recognized, by ear, the notes his fingers used to play. 

Today a year after his death, I took out his violin. A layer of dust now lightly powders it. I played the same piece and felt not sadness but joy. Joy for the memories he gave our family, for the music he filled our home with, and for the simple life he led. Music was never my passion, it was his, but his passion led me to understand what happiness was especially in difficult circumstances. Though our family was financially poor, we were very much a happy one. I miss my dad, but I'm glad to say that I miss him a little less with each day that passes.

'A key that can open many locks is a good key, but a lock that can be opened by many keys is a bad lock.' Im sure many of you know this line used to describe players, sluts or man sluts. However every lock has only one key that would fit in perfectly and unlock but all the others would just get stuck. I think this is the vital concept we need to take note of instead of that logic

To add on to , I believe that we can have a little more 同理心 towards people working as a dishcollector as their job is not easy. I know it is  not easy because I did a part-time job as a dish collector at a coffeshop for a month, for 5 hours per night when I was 16 and at that age I felt that the job was super tiring. The job requires us to stand the whole time, rush to clean tables, send the dishes for washing, empty the smell and heavy bin and of course as a service job we need to 看顾客脸色. 

I am sure we all know that majority of the people who are hired for these jobs are foreign workers or elderly. If i felt that the job was tiring at the age of 16, how about these 大叔/大婶 who are there doing full shift or even part-time? How tiring is it for them? Given that their low-salary is not something that can be addressed in the short-term, what we as customers can do is say a little thank you when they walk over to clean our tables，to appreciate them not just for their hard work, but also their ability to 吃苦 and work at such an old age. 

真的，一句“谢谢”对我们说来可能不多， 但“谢谢”也是我们大家繁忙生活中，能给予收碗的大叔大婶们最简单却也最真诚的一句话。

Have been seeing posts by the Singaporeans that Singapore's cleaners have too low salary (or allowance). I think it isn't justifiable for the work they have done.

I eat frequently at hawker centres and kopitiams- you really don't know how much they have done until you see it for yourself.

For cleaners who collect cardboard boxes also, after their 'standard' working hours. They have to rush to collect cardboard boxes which can last till 1am or 2am On sunny days or rainy days, no matter, they will always be there to clean and collect our plates after we finish our food. The money they get is never enough to make up for their time sacrificed.

 "I have not see the cleaner for very long, he is not doing his work ." Given number of plates he has been cleaning and collecting, he is doing other work or probably resting his tired legs from walking the entire day.

People really need to get a fuller picture of what is going on before shooting their mouth off. If i were to comment from the perspective of a consumer, I haven't seen my cleaner collect the dirty plates for the past five minutes either - but I know he is somewhere out there doing more important work than talking to me and asking me how am I.

Have been seeing posts by the opposition parties that Singapore's ministers (or MP) have too high salary (or allowance). I think it is justifiable for the work they have done.

I volunteer with several grassroots and constituencies - you really don't know how much they have done until you see it for yourself.

For MPs who are also Ministers, after their 'standard' working hours. They have to rush to their weekly Meet the People session which can last till 1am or 2am (and volunteers would have to stay till then too). On other weekday nights, there are house visits or meetings as a grassroots adviser. And weekends they spend time going for community events (which can last up to a full day). The money they get is never enough to make up for their time sacrificed.

 "I have not see my MP for very long, he is not doing his work ." Given the number of blocks in a constituency, if he is not visiting you , he is doing other work or probably walking another block.

People really need to get a fuller picture of what is going on before shooting their mouth off. If i were to comment from the perspective of a resident, I haven't seen my MP knock on my door for the past five years either - but I know he is somewhere out there doing more important work than talking to me and asking me how am I.

Although I pretend whine about them, I secretly like having muscleaches or scars on my body. It shows that I've gone through some stuff, and overcame them. I feel strong and accomplished with them. But my friends and parents think I'm weird, especially the scars part. I've been told to wear clothes that cover up a surgery scar on my upper arm. After a number of such comments, I've stopped wearing sleeveless tops or dresses. Why are scars not accepted? I think they are beautiful and they form part of who I am.

I really want to take this module that is 7-10pm but I live in Tampines... I take minimum 1h 30m to get home.

I understand this is totally not a problem for most of us since we sleep really late, but my parents sleep really early(before 11pm). Yet if I come home late, they will always stay up and fetch me from the bus stop because they are worried. Yeah I know this makes me look pampered... but it has been like this since forever. I always worry when I go out with friends because I need to get home early(ok this is off topic. Lets stop here.)

So, I don't want my parents to stay up late because of me but I just cannot convince them. Should I take the mod?

I remember the first time a girl flirted with me (I think.) We were just chatting at a canteen bench at an off-peak time and she was sitting opposite me. I can't remember exactly what we spoke about, but I clearly remember what she did and how she made me feel. I had my bottle on the table and she played with my bottle. As if it was not clear enough, she rhythmically swung her leg to gently hit my leg (not my third leg). At that point of time, I was a little frightened and didn't know how to react. But I am not into her so I left shortly and didn't talk to her much after this incident.

For the past 22 years of my life, I have been a hopeless virgin. Last weekend , I came really really close to breaking it. Met this small petite chick on my first visit to a club. She got a hot body that makes me release steam! Those over-sized boobs on her tight little body and that firm round ass OMG! 

We had a fun time dancing and grinding each other, this is the first time I had ever got so intimate with a girl. Being  a little tipsy, I agreed to her suggestion to open a room at hotel 81 to do hanky panky business with her. When we got into the hotel room I stripped her naked and started to finger her. After 15 or so mins of foreplay, I managed to get her wet and she was begging me to penetrate her immediately. 

However, my Christianity side took over me and I kept apologizing to her and I told her that " I want to remain righteous and holy before the eyes of GOD". She gave me a "sibei sien" face and she almost wanted to slap me.

One week had past... Instead of rejoicing my victory over those sexual temptations, I'm regretting my decision. I wished that I'm thinking with the smaller head that night =(
Being an active cell-group leader, I am supposed to be a good role model for my juniors brothers and sisters. But I'm so lap sap.... Plz tell me what to do? =(

I have been dating my girlfriend for almost a year but every time I go out with her, I realise she is either in jeans or shorts. She is far from being a tomboy and I think she will definitely look very good in a skirt or dress. I was thinking of buying a few dress for her for her upcoming 21th birthday. Is that advisable?

Hi community, its 5am and i cant sleep, the holidays have screwed up my sleeping pattern. My story has been my struggle with my body and the issue of self-esteem. 
It started pretty early, in primary school cause i had sweaty palms and sometimes when the teachers made us hold hands the other person wouldnt want too. it made me feel bad. nowadays though, i use a roll-on product to keep it in check.
Later on, i became aware that i had a more serious case of dark circles than everyone else like it isnt just below my eye, it also extends to the side. the doctor told me it just so happened that i was born with thinner skin there so the veiny part was more visible. i just had to live with it, ppl will be like asking me to get more sleep etc. ppl and even a teacher would call me panda. i still have them till this day.
then teenagehood came i  had bad acne. i rmbr that i would cry at night thinking why i had all these problems.i did everything right when it came to hygiene but the acne was relentless. i rmbr asking my parents to send me for laser treatment but sadly we didnt have the money.
then JC time came and the pimples improved, but then i found myself becoming more conscious about my weight (i was overweight). this was the only thing that i realise was controllable and i managed to reduce with the help of NS.
With my weight in control, something else happened, Alopecia Areata, the medical term for bald spots. basically, in a span of 1 week, a good part of the top of my head just became one big bald spot. this illness is an autoimmune one where the cause is unknown. that crushed my confidence and especially since i just about to enter university and will be meeting lots of people. ill save the story for another time but basically i just shut myself from the world. if i need to go out, i would use this product meant for balding old man and i was just 20/21. today i still have to take injections to keep it under control but its better,
In addition, i've had this condition that was what i hated most about me and i had since 12/13. gynocomastia, or man-boobs. now even after i lost the weight, my chest was still cleary puffy/pointy. now it was mild enough such that you could tell something was off, but not bad enough, that people thought it was ok to make fun of it. this was the thing that sucked most of my self-esteem. again, all the teasing and self-hate is another story. i have since verified that it is indeed oversized glands and have undergone surgery with the NS money that i have save(basically 2 years worth of pay).
sry, im just writing this as i think so it may be rambling. but like i just think i was dealt all these crappy stuff. Now i know like theres this endless pursuit of beauty, but i feel like for myself, its this pursuit just to be normal. i dont know man, i just feel that i was dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. i know i should be thankful i have all my senses, limbs, but cmon most ppl do and i just want to be like most ppl without all these shit.

NUS is full of civilized and well-educated university students? No, I beg to differ. I say NUS is full of assholes.

If you go to the U-Town toilets in the middle of the day, especially those that are less-frequented like ERC's, you will notice something. That the toilets are extremely foul-smelling, with shit stained  onto the side of the toilet bowls, and toilet paper strewn all around the cubicle. I shit you not, that is exactly what I witnessed. Not just one toilet, but three toilets. 

As to how anyone can have the cheek to do such shit and not clean up, I can never fathom.

NUS university students? Pui.

Why are there so much drama about the CS module? Life is about eating chocolate, listening to music and watching pretty girls. No matter what are your grades, you still have a healthy life and is 99% better than the rest of the world. Be glad that you are alive and is able to see all the beautiful trees around you. Be grateful.

I've been in a Cold War with my brother for the past 2 weeks.

The reason for our quarrel? His egoistic and proud personality. He loves insulting and ridiculing me, every time when I'm with my friends or relatives. Fine, I can tolerate it because he will just say say and stop after a while. When my cousins came for a vacation in Singapore a month ago, he did it again. We spent hours together 3 days in a row, and he just shooted at everything I say. To many to list, but basically, from what I remember as of now;

I asked my cousin to show me a video of his girlfriend dancing. My brother then suddenly cut into our conversation and say: Please, you see other people dance for what? Don't need to see also know you lousier than her, you so lousy I don't even understand why you practice so hard for what!

When we were discussing which level of escape room to go, I told them not to choose so hard because I had friends who went in and struggled badly. My brother replied: You are so noob, you are scared of ghosts and all shit, obviously right? He obviously treated my suggestion as nonsense. Guess what? When my other cousin shared his experience with escape room being a scary place, my brother went: oh no we better choose a easier place to play with!

When I was playing an IQ game on the phone, he said: why are you so slow? This IQ game so easy, can you hurry up and send me the link? You got so stupid anot, need to think so long how to solve the puzzle?

He also criticized me for not being able to multi-tasked when we were with our cousins. He said my phone game COC (if you play you will know what game this is) is so stupid, he said I raged at people when I lose a battle. Criticizing the game I play is bad is fine, every game definitely have some haters.

But all these times when he was there showing off and criticising me... I just kept quiet, as my cousins awkwardly looked at one another. I was so, so, upset beyond words. As much as I want to rebut back, telling my cousins that my brother himself has attitude problem as well, throwing chairs, shouting F*** CB!!! when he loses his computer games at home, I did not. As much as I want to shoot my brother and say that he rages at people too, he has mood swings, and that he is very immature, I did not. I did not want to pick up a fight with him. But he just continued to throw criticisms at me....

The night before our quarrel, I cried and told my BF that I've been tolerating his behavior and idk how long can I take it. I know everyone is not perfect, I know I am not that intelligent, not that good or whatsoever. But does my own blood brother really have to go around shaming me, his sister? I don't even do that to him? Why does he need to go and tell everyone how "bad" I'm?

The following day, I flamed up at him in the public, because he did it again, saying that if I don't know anything I should just keep quiet. I almost threw my glass of water at his face. I left the restaurant in a huff, with my cousins looking very shocked and my bro, rolling his eyes, and everybody staring at us in the restaurant.

Ok, I've no idea why am I writing this post for. A confession I guess. As much as I'm really very mad at him, I secretly hope to talk to him again but seeing him at home still makes me really angry. Obviously, up till now, he still thinks I'm in the wrong. But is it really my fault. I feel so hurt.

Face it. NUS wishes halls didn't exist. Their new babies are all the RCs, but they can't just demolish the halls without some outcry, so they just slowly put pressure on halls. The almost passive-aggressive approach is incremental. Its all the little things, slashing budgets, closing down exposure camps, reducing hall camp to 3 days, raising fees. One cut, its barely worth reconsidering your stay in hall, especially with the culture and friends.  A thousand little cuts, and before you know it you're bleeding on the floor (sorry my metaphor falls apart here).
It hasn't happened yet, but one day all the little things are gonna add up and one days halls finally have less than full occupancy, or too many people get fed up and keep toeing the line they've drawn. Whatever the excuse, they'll step in with some plan to phase out these sterile halls(which they had no hand in, they swear!) and all and future generations of students will all be in their neat, sanitary colleges. Yay. (Nothing against RCs though, don't know really know how it is in there because no one I know ever talks about it.)

I live with my mum in a matured estate in Tampines. We're a Chinese family and most of our neighbours on the same floor are Malay. They're predominantly in their 50s (like my mum) and already have kids my age. Except for one unit on our floor, the rest of them have actually seen me grown up and were there for us when my dad passed away a few years ago. I'm friends with some of their kids who were also my playmates when I was a boy.

Every raya morning, without fail, they'll give us some food (ketupat, rendang and some pineapple tarts) and we'd do the same for them when it's CNY (mum cooks a halal portion for them). Every raya, without fail also, I'll get fat and then have to hit the gym hard the following week.

This is gonna be my last raya for at least the next two years. Leaving for work overseas next year. Don't know why, but will kinda miss celebrating festive events like these. Anyway, Selamat Hari Raya to Muslim friends on NUSWhispers and to everyone, enjoy your long holidays!

So I finally did something that I always wanted to do at my workplace yesterday. I was always disturbed that the toilet paper in the toilet cubicle was "under" so I decided to take things into my own hands. So during lunch when no one was near the pantry, I went to flip it around so that it was "over". Once done, I felt this little tinge of joy and inner peace and I went back to do my work with absolute productivity.

When I was about to pang gang from work, I went to the toilet to relieve myself. To my horror, the toilet paper was flipped back to "under". I mean seriously?!?!?! So when no one was looking, I went to flip it back to "over" and ahhhh.... that inner peace and serenity again. Here's to me sincerely hoping to go back to office on monday to find it still "over".

It'll make one hell of a ragy angry monday blues if I were to find the toilet paper flipped back to "under" when I go back to work next week.

I'm not fat. Just that I have a tummy. Every morning I wake up, I got the perfect beach bod. But after a cup of water, even water, the tummy becomes bloated. I do abdominal exercises everyday. I seldom eat fast food. I drink a lot of water. I think I'm leading a healthy lifestyle. But my tummy keeps showing. Any fitness enthusiasts out there who can give me some advice?

Of course, I can don't listen, but I'm still a Singaporean - it still matters.

Nicely done that was quite a straightforward one. This one is not really a riddle, just a story, but you still need to think a bit to understand the ending:

I found an ancient book on black magic. It explains how to put a curse on someone. This is what is written in the instructions:

“If you follow these steps exactly, the curse will be place on the person of your choosing. However, if you make even one small mistake, the curse will be placed on you instead, so be careful. Do you still wish to proceed?”

Of course I do. I have an enemy. There is someone who I hate with all my heart. Someone I wish would die horribly. I want to place a curse on that person. That’s why I searched for this book of black magic. I want this curse to work, so I will follow the steps exactly.

“Step 1: Close your eyes and imagine the face of your enemy.”
That’s simple. I couldn’t forget this person’s face even if I wanted to. OK, what’s next? Let’s see…

“Step 2: Imagine the curse you want to place on your enemy and what it will do to them.”

I want this person to suffer the worst kind of pain imaginable. I want them to be suffering so much that they wish they are dead. Alright, what’s the next step?

“Step 3: Open your eyes.”

I just realised i wont see you tomorrow. Hari raya will really be so different without you nagging at us to do well in our career/school and bugging us to get drinks from the fridge. 

I do hope you were able to see me graduate from up there. And i hope you were proud enough to tell all our relatives and your friends up there about how your granddaughter makes you so proud. 

I miss you. And i love you so much.

Haha I know one that's very similar to the previous riddle posted :P

A few years ago, my older brother went crazy. He stabbed my sister to death and attacked my parents. The police managed to subdue him before he killed them too. He's been in a mental hospital ever since and we never visit him.
This morning, we got a letter from him in the mail. The postmark was yesterday. I opened it and inside, I found a strange note:
"Tonight the wind blows colder still.
All I know is darkness, never light.
The pain will break strongest hearts.
My dreams still escape my grasp."
I couldn't make sense of it, so I went to the kitchen and gave it to my mother. As soon as she finished reading it, her face went pale and the note slipped from her fingers. She rushed to the front door and started screaming.

As usual, please do not google -_-

I live in a one room flat above a shophouse in the geylang area alone with my mum. (Just imagine a living room sized room with a kitchen attached and a toilet). We don't have beds nor pillows, just two mattresses with clothes stacked up at the foot of the mattress. I've been wearing the same set of formal clothes for presentation throughout my 4 years here.

My mum works tirelessly for more than 12 hours everyday 7 days a week selling fishball noodles in her stall nearby. She has been doing this alone since I was 12 as my dad left around then due to large gambling debts. Both my mother and I just came home one day and never saw him return. She is the sole family member I know (as for the rest of my relatives I am not remotely close to, they look down on my mum for having a gambler husband).

Despite this, she still managed to put me through jc and uni, although we did manage with bursaries and scrimping and saving where ever and whenever we can. I'm 23 and yet to have sat on an airplane or travelled further than Malaysia.

Every holiday period and almost every weekend, I will head down to help her tend her stall, usually helping with the money side or rolling fishballs. 90% of my friends do not know this side of my life and those that do always comment that I have a hard life balancing studies and helping my mum. They don't understand but my mum has it way harder than me. 

Recently during graduation, my mum took her first off day in years just to come down to nus to watch me graduate. Even though she didn't understand a word of the speeches or what I have been doing these 4 years, the smile on her face is something I won't forget for many years to come. With first class honours I'm really thankful to say it wasn't difficult to land a job (CAP matters guys) and my mum can finally retire in a few months time. I can't wait for the day where I can drive her around or buy her a proper bed where she can sleep in an airconditioned room.

Ma, this one's for you.

Today at my internship, I walked into the washroom and noticed a co-worker packing up after pumping. Now that loo despite the cleaning staff efforts isnt the cleanest place on earth to transfer breast milk from pump to bottle. She will feed her child with something that was exposed to so many germs. It didnt sit right with me that she had to go do it in the washroom. I don't know her well, so I didnt comment. My thoughts nevertheless: 
A) if the office co workers arent comfortable with it - that's not a very good  thing. Why is breastfeeding taboo?
B) if she isn't comfortable with it in public - that's still a product of society's perceptions of the breast and breastfeeding. 
That's all a little upsetting. If someday I want to be a working mother, I ain't gonna pump in a loo. I'd at least go get a meeting room.

Hey  , you'll be glad to know there is someone worse than you out there! At least your romantic daydreams consist of a character somebody else put time and effort into creating. That character is created purposely with a universally appealing personality and in many ways has real people behind it (writers, artists, editors, voice actors). 
I on the other hand, fell in love with a character I invented in my own mind. If it seems strange, that's because it is. 
I have the habit of making up wild scenarios that feature my alter-ego doing fantastic things I would never do in real life. Maybe from reading books or watching too many movies - i fantasize a lot. And i have several, intensely complex storylines I can choose from. This isn't just regular day-dreaming, this is next level. Like each story has its own setting, list of characters and plot line. All created entirely by myself. Some of my stories have spanned years. 
So far I've been a French gangster/mafioso, a guitarist in a world-famous rock band and a Navy seal. All of these stories have me being fitter, better-looking, with a stronger character/values than i could ever be. I also am often involved in love triangles or am dying in dramatic, sacrificial ways. It seems hilarious but i think i developed it as a coping mechanism to having less friends, wanting to bolster my ego and wanting to escape mediocrity. 
So now we come to my fictional lover. We've been together 7 years. He features in various plotlines (think of it as movie reboots - same essence - but no continuity). His looks are based roughly on this famous model i was a fan of back in the day. Any small flaws were corrected by my mental photoshop.
Personality: mine + those of people I admire in real life
Character: a bit weak/flawed, so i can come to the rescue and be the bigger person 
How we always meet : i am an enigma who enters his deeply complex and confusing world and my sudden arrival (im an exchange student most often - since i can then kid myself that it could all someday be possible) sets the story in motion. 
For a very long time I was hopelessly addicted to "tapping into" these fantasies. I used to like to zone out of my real world of academic/boring responsibilities. It honestly gives me a sense of superiority and boost of confidence. 
"I seem like a regular person to you huh? Well you don't know the half of what's going on in my head. My imagination kicked your imagination's ass." 
Whenever I feel inadequate in a social setting, I never show anything outwardly but instead i escape inside my world. 
So yeah, here I am - an evergeen unattractive social misfit, who never lets on that she isn't quite ok, but instead chooses to "spite" others by hanging out with her imaginary boyfriend. 

Cheers. I think I beat your post :)

With regards to the confession about winning enough through gambling, I sincerely urge all who read it to take it with a pinch of salt. GAMBLING KILLS. Don't think for once you can stop yourself from the adrenaline rush or desperation to recoup or losses just because you think you can keep your cool. As long as you are playing to 'survive' and earn a living, you will always be susceptible to crossing the line of a life of debts and more debts. I know how much gambling can ruin a family. I lived through the horrors of having recalcitrant gamblers as parents. They said they played to earn a living but look what happened, we were evicted of our home because they gambled it away. And this happened multiple times. Please, from the bottom of my heart, please stay away from gambling. It kills. It kills you and those who love you. You are all smart people who are degree holders, find a job and spend your life being good at it and money will naturally come your way. But even if all fails, do not throw away your family by gambling. :'(

We used to lead a simple and carefree childhood in Malaysia, living in a kampong. She had a special nickname; all the guys in the village call her 母老虎 (lioness). 

In our village, there are 3 notorious brothers who would go around terrorizing the weaker children. When I was 8 years old, my physique is smaller compared to kids of my age. Hence I became their primary target of bullying and abuses. On one fateful day, they pushed me into a pit filled with animal dung because I reported them to the teacher for bringing a terrapin to school. Whenever I tried to climb out of the pit, they simply ignored my cries and kicked me back in. 

Just when I thought that I'm a goner, a girl appeared with a thick wooden branch and started to whack the bullies. 2 of them ran away and left behind the elder brother to fend himself. I literally froze with my open jaws when I saw her pounced onto him and bite on to his arm ferociously. The little devil up fell onto the ground and begged for mercy, but this girl refused to loosen her jaws. I quickly tried to break them apart before things get messy. During the scuffle, she accidentally threw a punch onto my face and knocked me out. 

When I regained consciousness, she was sitting beside me while holding on to her nose. She accompanied me to the little stream where I washed myself up. We started splashing water at each other and had a fun time under the evening sun. I thanked her for coming to my rescue and vowed that I will be the one protecting her when I grow stronger. She gave me an unconvinced look and burst into laughter. “你傻傻笨笨的，整么保护我？ (You are so blurr, how can I rely on you?)”. I was very pissed off by her comments and I kept grumbling, “让我保护你！让我保护你！” (Let me protect you) throughout the entire journey back to her home.

When we arrived at her house, that 3 despicable brothers and their dad is already there to seek vengeance. Their father is the landlord of our village, he is an arrogant guy that everyone fears and don’t wish to offend. 母老虎 was forced by her mum to kneel down before the three brothers and apologize to them. Given her personality, she simply refused to deliver the apology and that’s when things got nasty. Her mum picked up a feather duster and hit her back repeatedly to make her apologize. Despite of the intense pain and she held her tears in and refused to even utter any sound of suffering. All she did, was to stare at the brothers with a pair of cold blooded eyes, while they are smirking at one side.母老虎就是这样，小时后是这样，长大了也是一样， 从不认输。(She hates to be defeated). 

Let’s fast forward to the year when I’m 16 years old. Every single day whether rain or shine, I will always wait for her outside the school gate with my bicycle. 5 mins of waiting would seem like an eternity .Whenever she rushed out of the school gate and hopped on to my bicycle, she will asked me, “ 你要带我去哪里？(where are you bringing me?)”. I would give cheeky replies like, “带你到教堂，今天你要嫁给我了 (To the church, we are getting married)”. I really love her warmth when she is hugging me from behind; sometimes I wished that I can paddle my bicycle forever. That is the happiest period of our lives, we have no worries and we don’t have to face the cruelty of this world. There are only smile and laughter, kissing her can be as sweet as tasting a candy floss and I enjoyed caressing her smooth and silky hair.  Puppy love is the simplest, yet it is the sweetest.

Ever since she was born,母老虎 lived with her mum only. Her dad is a successful business man from Singapore, apparently her mum was the third party and 母老虎 is his illegitimate daughter. She always dreamt of reuniting with her daddy, which is also my greatest fear. Deep in our heart we knew that our relationship has an expiry date, she did not deny the fact that she will not hesitate to break up if she gets the chance to reunite with her dad in Singapore. Perhaps this is the reason why I didn’t officially confess to her.我们不不顾一切，还是傻傻的爱下去，到最后我们都受伤了. (We ignored the reality and continued the relationship, in the end both of us got hurt). 

That fateful day of departure finally arrived; I hugged her tightly and refused to let her board the bus. She kept apologizing, “对不起，我只能说我不好 (I’m sorry, it’s my fault)”. I told her with a broken heart, “我要的不是一句对不起，等我可以吗？ 我会来找你的 ( I don’t want to hear “sorry”, can you wait for me? I will find you there)”. She told me to move on and forget her. I tried to contained my tears but I just cried like a sissy bitch, 母老虎 was no better ,she started bursting into tears when the bus move off, she don’t want to let me see her weakest side of her. Later on I found out that, before her departure she went around and begged my close friends to keep an eye on me, she was afraid that I might harm myself.  Still putting on a brave front and protecting me, when we have reached this point…..

From then on, we lived in 2 completely different worlds. I studied really hard so that I can secure a scholarship to land myself in Singapore. On the other side, she is leading a harsh life in Singapore. She and her mum received constant verbal and physical abuses under the hands of her dad’s legitimate wife and family members. There was one occasion when the cruel wife slapped her face and called her a “小野种 (little bastard)” in front of the guests during Chinese New Year. Despite witnessing all these atrocities, her fking useless dad chose to remain silent and did not even lift a finger to help. What a prick! Soon, 母老虎’s mum couldn’t handle the pressure anymore and she sank into depression. 

The worst has yet to come…. Her dad died 1 year ago and did not leave a proper inheritance for them. Hence the wicket family members exploited this loophole and threw them out of the house. From then on she has to slave day and night to cover the heavy medical and living expenses. But another tragedy struck again, she was knocked down by a car and this accident robbed her ability to walk. When I visit the hospital to cheer her up, the women laying in front of me is no longer that strong and invincible lioness. She will lie on the bed emotionlessly for the entire day and refuse to eat anything, I tried to feed her but she shove my hands away and said,”让我死吧” (Let me die). 

I never felt so helpless in my life before, all the cheap talks about protecting her. I’m laughing at myself now.. I’m just a useless dreamer. All these years, I was never ever able to be at her side when she needs me the most. It really hurts so much to see the most precious women of my life, losing her will to live. I have been cursing and swearing at heaven for being so unfair to her, I told god to transfer all her karma, sins whatever to me and let me suffer everything for her sake. 

I'm sorry for this long rant. Don’t worry guys, I won’t give up, I will married her one day and truly protect her. Although she has lost her legs, I shall become her legs then. Piggyback her and bring her to all the four corners of earth to see every beautiful scenery that this world can offer. Piggyback her till my hair turn white我愿意！ 真爱是不离不弃. (True love is “not giving up and not abandoning her”) I will never let her endure this darkest period alone by herself.

After reading a couple of posts here about being male escorts, I am actually quite intrigued. Why do older men or women use such services? What are they going through? I don't need the money; I can imagine how eye-opening the experience can be. Is this actually legal? Any agencies to recommend?

Hi everybody, today's been a bad day so far. Has anyone had a day where tiny things just pile up one after the other and just make their day shitty? And when you narrate the events to other people you feel like you've just listed a bunch of first world problems and have been acting like an entitled prick. But, why aren't we entitled to feel bad about small things. Isn't that something to be thankful for? 
Here's what happened to me:
1) Last weekend, I went to the gym after a super long time. So now I'm extremely sore and have trouble moving around. Typing this is agony. 
2) This morning as soon as I got to my internship, I noticed that my water bottle had leaked all over the inside of my bag. Because I hadn't shut it tightly enough. So I had to empty the bag contents and turn it inside out on my desk to dry. 
3) I opened my email to see a response to a presentation I'd submitted last Friday. More than my efforts, people were bothered about the fact that I'd CC-ed the project manager instead of addressing the email to him. So I received an email from another manager about proper email protocol. That by the very act of using "CC" instead of "To", I am 'disengaging' the PM. It hadn't even occurred to me - it was an informal discussion. But ah well, I learned something new.
4) I have nothing to do. With no word on this presentation and them having set me no other tasks, I've got to sit this day out doing nothing.
5) Do you guys know what Berocca is? Those vitamin C effervescent tablets? Well, I fucking love those and today, I had just one left at the bottom of the tube. These tablets fizz when they come into contact with moisture, and somehow the water vapour in the air in the tube was enough for the tablet to get stuck nicely to the base of the tube. And this isn't the kind of thing that'll come out if you tap it politely like a ketchup bottle. This shit is strong enough to hold a house together. 
GODAMMIT. 
I had enough. Despite the searing pain in my sore muscles, I tore the metal tube in half and then pried the lower half open with a stapler. When you try tearing such a tube, you effectively bend it in half. So you have the added challenge of opening up the bent/torn half. Ignoring the cuts the sharp, exposed bits of metal gave me, I extricated the tablet and dunked it into the leaky, shitty water bottle. 

Fizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. 

And then for a brief moment, all was well with the world again. 

Until I realized the entire office had been watching me wrestle with a small metal tube containing the grown-up equivalent of Tang, all while sitting at a desk littered with various small objects. 

So yeah, I think I'm entitled to a little self-pity.

Whenever I see a pretty girl I quickly avert my gaze because from generalisation from a certain few, some girls like the visual attention they receive. 

Not that they care. But somehow it probably does bug them. That one pair of eyes or that one head that doesnt turn. 

And when I see a pretty girl I tend to look at the guys around me and laugh inside when I see them staring.

I heard that guys stare more at sexy, curvy, big boobs female body compared to a girl with pretty face. Is it true that a nice female figure, but not so pretty face overall attract a guy's attention more compared to a girl with simply average body figure but pretty face?

Today i went for the first time into an anteroom at utown, its supposedly a waiting/chillax room with sofa and coffee table. Wanted to turn on lights to study, then a man who was sleeping there dont let me. Being a nonconfrontational female, i tried my best to reason why i need to turn on the light to study, and why the anteroom is better than foodclique and more conducive. This prc guy was like crazy and keep on repeating he's here first so he had a right. He also claimed to be a staff. i turn on again and he shove me away to turn off. I got a shock. I mean, a man who turns violent to a GIRL STUDENT?! Things escalated so i called the police but he got away. So the matter just ended like that. This is important, what do you think we students should do next time such things happen? How can I ask NUS to help or make a rule that suggest to turn on the lights in the presence of people? I mean there were passer bys but I doubt they will seriously help if things got worse.

I have a question. In the upcoming LGBT orientation camp, do the males/females sleep together (2 in 1 room) in the same room just like normal camps? Or everyone mass-sleep together in the sports hall, with males one side, females one side?

Isn't that..... controversial?

My father never liked to give me money directly. Since young, it was my mother who receive grocery money and in turn pass me my pocket money.

He would give me NTUC vouchers instead, and lately he began to give me winning betting slips and tell me to buy more bets with the remainder of the payout.

So I bought toto, 2 set of 7 numbers ranging from 1-49. The 14 numbers I bet on are all unique, there are no repeated numbers.  

What is probability that none of my 14 numbers matches the 7 numbers in the result?

I was very upset with myself. 

It was in the mid afternoon and I was about to take a public lift in Toa Payoh MRT station. As usual, people rushed in and crowded the lift. When everybody was in, some people press the close button. For a brief moment the door didn't close. Then, there is an old uncle shout with demaning tone, "Eh girl, you stupid ah!"

Apparently, there was a primary school kid standing too close to the sensor. The exhausted looking girl then moved in  silently and unamused. As the lift goes up, the particular uncle rudely say to the girl again, "you so stupid, why you study." The girl's face then turns very bitter, while the rest of the crowd just chuckle. I can feel the sadness on her look as she left the lift.

The first time the old uncle shout the word stupid, I was pretty shocked and tried to figure out what was happening. It was just a small mistake while stupid is a pretty rude word to describe it. The second time he said it, I felt very angry, very very angry. Yet, I didn't do anything about it. I just let the obnoxious uncle ruined the little girl's day.

I was very upset with myself not to stand up for her.

If it is wrong for guys to just enter a female toilet, why is it socially acceptable for female (cleaners) to just enter a guys toilet without any warning?

Part timers cannot make decisions so casually. So when a customer paid for her purchase with Brunei dollars, I was taken aback and didn't know what ti do. I said we don't accept it here. 

Then she said why the kopitiam gave her. I said kopitiam gave her but we are not kopitiam. Then another customer came to her aid and said sg can use Brunei currency. 

What the customer said next really irritates me. She asked whether I'm a Singaporean. I said yes, but I don't use Brunei notes in sg. Now I know we can use Brunei notes also.

Because I lost a bet, I had to wear my two piece dark blue bikini to commencement under my grad gown. 

It was quite embarassing but I'm glad no one noticed. Phew.

hey guys, just got scammed recently thru an online platform. just a food for thought: never accept someone called Trishia Ying. She targets guys and will ask for skype video chat, then when things got hot and shit the person will start recording whatever you are doing, and will threaten you to spread the video unless you pay him/her money. 

NEVER GET SCAMMED GUYS. I was stupid enough to fall for this but let my mistake be your lesson guys.

I saw the  magic the gathering post. 

Any duel masters players out there! I used to enjoy the game a lot during my secondary school days! I kept my decks and threw out the rest of the cards for memory sake. I once brought it up and got strange stares from friends and they were like 'serious bro'. I'm the typical sporty cool kid so not many ppl I know play them. Anyone here play them!  BTW I'm a freshie, staying in hall,  so we can spend all night playing!

I have serious body image issues because I have been overweight all my life. My kindergarten principal humiliated me in front of everyone at age 6 by asking me if I needed a bigger stage to dance for graduation. I never really belonged in primary school but I tried to make myself fit into a clique. At age 12, this clique made up a secret language that they didn't know I managed to decode. And one girl told the other girl that my nose was so big and ugly. I really feel like going for liposuction and a nose job now. Should I do it?

I'm a recreational athlete, work out regularly, don't really watch my diet, so I have a body that's somewhere between dad bod and Joseph Schooling. However, in secondary school I used to suffer from a lot of acne not just on my face but on my upper body as well - and this has left a lot of scarring on my body. As you can imagine, I'm incredibly self-conscious about this so going topless is a big no-no for me unless I'm at home. Why did I bother to describe my body in the beginning? Well I would like to pose a question to everyone. Say you're at an orientation camp and a particular activity requires an absence of shirts. Which would be the biggest turn off? 1) fat and flabby guy with clear skin, 2) dad bod guy with clear skin, 3) muscular guy BUT with bad skin. No offence to anyone with any body type that's not underwear-model-esque. Obviously the model answer is to be comfortable in your own skin, don't mind the haters etc. But let's just be honest for a second, looks and physique do matter, if even for a fleeting moment of first impression. I know my question is shallow but please entertain me on this :)

Dear OP of , sorry for your loss. The same happened to me while I was on exchange.

"20 or so years ago, I was a staff nurse in a trauma ICU. We had a patient come in who had a life-threatening head injury from a car crash.

Most patients that come in in this condition receive a number and a fake name -“unid-1234″ – until we can track down their family.
Well, the first person we tracked down was this guy’s mother, so we called her in.

She was in charge of all the medical decisions we made for this guy. It was up to her when he had surgery, if we resuscitated him if his heart stopped – all kinds of things. It was also up to her who we called in case of an emergency and who we allowed to come visit.

Well, turns out, this mother hadn’t seen her son in over twenty years. She had disowned him because he was gay and because he had fallen in love with a man and decided to live with him.

Anyway, our hands were tied.

We eventually tracked down the guy he’d been living with for the past twenty years. They had bought a house together. They had purchased furniture together. They had built a life together.

Anyway, our hands were tied.

The patient’s “family” had already established a list of rules of who could and could not visit. The man’s life partner was not on the list.

We had to – legally – comply with everything the mother asked of us.

One of her most adamant requests was that the life partner of this man not be allowed to visit.

We had to comply.

We had no legal choice.

I spent weeks leaving work and buying a coffee for the poor man in the lobby who was crying because he couldn’t visit his partner of twenty years. I couldn’t even legally tell him of his partner’s condition because of HIPPA violations.

My hands were tied. And my heart was broken.

I was going to spend the rest of my life fighting for marriage equality.

This SCOTUS vote means more to me than any of you will ever know."

Top three things that make Singaporean men turn their heads (from SGAG as I can't upload that picture):

1) Chio Bu
2) Luxury sports car
3) Opening a can of coke during outfield

For the first point, is it really true that a universally very chio girls make ALL guys turn their heads? Actually I thought only those bold guys who can't control themselves do that whenever they see a chio but walk past. In general I observed that for guys who are very shy or very highly educated, they tend to be able to control themselves to only stealing glances but not turn head and stare even if a very pretty girl walk past. 

This is simply from my observations so I am very curious as to what makes some guys able to control their ogling at a chio bu to just stealing glances while some simply lost control and stare like nobody's business? Education level, level of shyness? Levels of testosterone? Anything else?

Sometimes I feel so different from the rest of my peers because of my esoteric interests. I am not interested in watching cartoons or animated movies that are so popular these days (e.g. pixar). I also do not watch Hollywood movies or english drama sitcoms. It does not help that they tend to have loud and violent effects. In fact, I do not really like to watch movies because I find them too short and boring. Neither do I listen to many english songs (except if I chance upon something I like by accident, or for some musicals like phantom of the opera). I am not really into mainstream culture like english and chinese pop music, and rarely listen to it too. This makes it difficult for me to connect with others as I have no idea about the latest popular singers (except for the names being bounced around) and do not share their taste in music during karaoke sessions. Most of mainstream music have heavy drums or bass which I find noisy. I only like soothing music. I prefer listening to traditional chinese music or folk songs, as I like the melodies and find the lyrics beautifully written and poetic. Some of my favorite singers are mongolian but I don't know anyone in Singapore who listens to such music at all.

I myself was stuck at orchard (wrong day to go town and shop rofl) during the time of the breakdown of the NSEWL and I couldn't get onto any buses. Ended up walking to esplanade mrt to get to the circle line before going to paya lebar which is the east-iest that it can go, then changing another 4 buses to reach home. Overall a rather eventful night.

I spent the whole morning today lying in bed reading rants about the mrt breakdown. No one ever thanks the govt when the mrt is working perfectly which is nearly every day, only making noise when it doesn't. I'm not saying the transport minister isn't at fault or anything, but ultimately it is largely a thankless job because Singaporeans have taken public transport as a given right.

Talking abt fetishes, I would like to share my strange fetish.

I have a fetish to get kicked in my balls only by girls. I knw it sounds dangerous but i do not intend to get kicked in a way which can damage it. Only mild kicking. It gives me mild pain but pleasure too. I have active sexual life and I am good in bed as well but I have this strange fetish.

How weird or strange to girls find it ? I would not prefer guys commenting and abusing. I would like to see the perspective of girls.
-
 
I know I shouldn't judge others for whatever....unique interests they might have. But reading these latest posts on peculiar fetishes kinda creeps me out, no offence. 

On a side note, is anybody else stuck cause of the breakdown? The queue for buses at amk is CRAZY long oh gosh. The sad moment you keep checking nuswhispers but only have these posts to entertain you while you wait :(

Hi I'll be graduating soon and my prarents are coming for my commencement. Then I discovered the fine print on the commencement entry pass that says the attire is "shirt and tie". I am from a low income family and my parents are blue collar workers, they don't own any formal clothing and my dad doesn't own a tie. Will all the parents there be wearing very formally? My mom is actually quite worried. Hope you guys can help,wondering if I should borrow a tie for my dad. Will the occasion be very formal and are a lot of parents attending?

Um I just opened YouTube on my computer and it was logged into my bf's account. We've been together for 2 years and well... What I saw was kinda unsettling. Like the videos he watched mainly are those with static thumbnails of women/girls scantily clad/lingerie/bikini ( the content is not obviously sexual, but generally involves women with big boobs) it clearly enticed him to watch it. And there's quite a few of them too. Makes me question if the stuff we do is not enough?? (Not sex because he said he would wait but all sorts of other stuff) That he needs to go seek this sort of entertainment or release. Just for comparison I went and checked out my own YouTube channel and I haven't exactly watched videos with hot men in them or anything. I would think our hanky panky happens quite often but now it makes me question like whether he's happy or not. Is this normal for males in a committed relationship? Just hoping for some advice. This isn't something I should mention to him right?

I have been told that I have good complexion for a guy. I actually use regular body soap to wash my face. Sometimes even hand soap from public toilets if I feel like I need to wash my face throughout the day.

On a serious note, I stopped using face wash, particularly ones with microbeads for exfoiliating, when I found out such microbeads get past our water purification systems and eventually end up in the sea. The microbeads get ingested by marine animals and may cause various problems to the ecology.

Probably the best thing over attending orientation/FOC camps is to travel :)

Having a whale of a time in the San Francisco (for a summer program) where the girls are hot!
Just made out ferociously with a girl whom I find her adorbs, while watching the 4th of July fireworks, and then going to the Grand Palace of Fine Arts to have a picnic with friends.  Climbed on top of the Dome, and we smooched there. Raunchy!

“You don’t think I’m cute meh?”

“Cute lah, but I cuter.”

That was how our relationship began four years ago. A and I met at a New Year’s Party a mutual friend held. He was sitting alone across from where I was, sipping champagne in a tall wine glass and looking handsome in his red flannel and khaki pants. He was the first person I saw at the party. I was completely smitten by how immaculate he looked and carried himself to the crowd. 

The host, our mutual friend, noticing that my eyes hadn’t left him since I arrived, introduced us. We spent the rest of that night in each other's company. I wasn’t at all interested in mingling with the other guests as I was in him. Later that night, when I sent him home on my bike, I asked if he would like to go out sometimes. “You’ve to ask for my number first mah!,” he cheekily said. 

We went on many dates following that party, but kept things friendly. He had so much to offer, and I didn’t want to rush all in or lose interest too quickly. Exactly four months later, I asked him to be my boyfriend. He said yes. To this day, that was — still is — one of my happiest moments in life. 

-

Hello everyone, I wrote . In the earlier submission, I mentioned briefly that I thought about ending the relationship I had with A. His struggle with manic depression had strained our relationship so much that I was beginning to feel exhausted, and I questioned myself, time and again, if I should stay or leave.

Two weeks ago, on Friday morning, he asked if I was available for lunch. I told him I was. It was my last week of internship and there wasn’t much left to be done. I had been busy with work, and he had been avoiding to go out altogether. Except for the daily texts and calls to check in how he was doing, we hadn’t a chance at all to meet since semester break. I was surprised, when I got out of the office building, to see him standing under the shades with two Japanese bento boxes he had prepared himself at home. We sat at Raffles Square where we talked and ate. He was all smiles and laughter that day. It was nice to see him in good spirits. I hadn’t seen him that way in such a long time. I told him to wait for me to finish work and we could go out for an unplanned dinner date.

Later after work ended, I made my way to Starbucks where he said he would be at. I watched from afar as he read Murakami’s "Sputnit Sweetheart". I’ve always enjoyed watching him read... he always looks like a little boy lost in his own little world. 

We had a nice dinner and after, we walked along Clarke Quay. It felt exactly like the good, old times when we were just starting off as boyfriends. We reached a part of Clarke Quay where there was a street musician singing live to Jason Mraz’s, “I Won’t Give Up”. And then he did something crazy. He extended his hands out to me and asked me for a dance. At first, I refused because there were too many people and unlike him, I wasn’t out to a lot of people. But him being persistent, he wouldn’t take no for an answer. 

I gave in to his request and slow danced with him for the first time that night. Immediately, as we danced, it felt as though everything else in the world had gone grey and it was just the two of us left. I didn’t care at all what people may have thought nor did he. 

“What you thinking about?” I asked him.

“That night we first met when you sent me home on your bike.”

“The night you screamed like a scared little boy while on my bike ah?”

He lets out a laugh. “Yeah, it was the same night you told me not to be afraid. That you would make sure that I was safe.” 

He apologised if I ever felt, in any way, like his illness was a burden. He said he would understand if I left. I looked at him in the eyes and knew I had found home. I’ve never felt anything like this for anyone. I’ve always been quite a playboy, never staying with someone for longer than after sex. He was — still is — my home, my true north. I knew, in that moment, as the music played and we slow danced, that the choice between to stay or to leave was obvious. I chose to stay even if it is the hardest thing to do in the world. It was a nice touch too when the music stopped and the lead singer applauded us for our courage to dance in public. It was such a memorable night. (=

To the two girls (if I remember correctly) and Colin who left a comment on that post, thank you so much for taking the time to respond and for the offer to listen. I've my feelings sorted now. He's been on medications since his JC years. He’s found the right ones, but sometimes, the relapses come and go That is what worries and pains me most actually, the relapses and the feeling of helplessness (on my part) that comes after. My greatest thanks too to  for writing in about your experience. I wish you and your partner many more happy years ahead. (=

I've always have what is known as the 'third eye' - the ability to see supernatural stuffs beyond the normal people's vision. Trust me or not, there are some specific places at which 'those stuffs' like to congregate/gather in NUS. I haven't been to all the places to NUS, but these are three places in NUS that I know, and you might want to consider avoiding at night:
1 - The garden just in front of the co-op and Central Library.
2 - Car Park 11 (the car-park beside the biz canteen)
3 - Near LT22 at Science

You can choose not to trust me, but I'm writing this out of goodwill. :)

To my fellow travellers/people on summer programme/SEP, we are fortunate to live in a safe city. Beyond our city, we need to always be careful and do not let people take advantage of our kindheartedness and trust. While in France for summer school, I encountered daylight robbery. While I know that I should never donate to anyone in France (they are famous for their trickery), I thought donating a dollar to a pestering fat lady maybe harmless and she will leave me alone. Turns out I was TOTALLY WRONG. I opened my wallet and she instantly dipped her fingers into it and fished out a £20+£5 note. I quickly snatched it back from her. When she start to beg for it back, I ran to the opposite tram station and got on to the opposite train. I swear, never again will I do it. I know that I should never do that in the first place (unfortunately, that's the darker side of beautiful France as everyone who have been in France would tell you). But one would think that donating a dollar is harmless and you probably won't be a victim. And also, I was in Grenoble and not Paris. Apparently, this rule applies wherever you are (Paris was more infamous for petty theft). Never let your guards down. I was fortunate enough to escape unscathed. Just remember, it doesn't always pay to be kind.

To  Hi, I just wanted to say that I related to your story very much. I truly believe that you are a good person for thinking of your family first. I'm a NUS alumni who graduated last year. Like a few others I know, I survived on financial assistance for each phase of my academic life. I just wanted to share with you and the other readers my story.

I came from a neighborhood primary school where I was often teased and taunted for having a karang guni father. It started in one of the Chinese lessons. Our teacher made us write an essay about family. I chose to write about my dad's occupation because I was genuinely proud of him. He would always bring back "treasures" from around Singapore and then tell me stories about them. But when they heard my father was a karang guni, they just laughed at me. I remembered walking around in school with my head low and feeling like shit that day.

I was lucky that I got into a good secondary school based on my sports abilities. I wanted to start fresh in secondary school and so decided to keep my family background a secret. Whenever I was asked what my parents do for a living by peers whose parents were bank directors, politicians, CEOs of companies, I always felt ashamed and I told them that my father was an item collector which, if you think about it, is not a complete lie. They made the assumption that my father was a rare item collector. To tell you the truth, I was afraid my classmates would find out the truth and think lowly of me. I was a neighborhood primary school kid in an elite secondary school where the majority of my classmates came from very rich families. There was already a lot of negative stereotypes attached to being a neighborhood primary school kid. I didn't want them to further see me as a "charity case", the token "disadvantaged" student.

I made it through secondary school without anyone finding out about my background... Later in my JC years, I became more upset and frustrated that my family situation was the same as it was years ago. I carried the same bag since secondary school, one of the many "treasures" my father found at work. I had no phone, no MP3 and no other luxuries that many of my peers did. Even small luxuries like a tub of ice cream was hard to convince my dad to get. My father would always say that he didn't had enough money to buy ice cream when we go grocery shopping. I never brought any of my friends back home (a 1-room flat) for project work or revisions because I was ashamed at the state of things. There were always so many stacked "treasures" — random objects, newspapers, old TV sets, old maps — that my father got from people but couldn't find a buyer for. I don't remember a time when our house was not empty. Sometimes it becomes so hard to even move around at home without knocking over some things.

There was so many occasions when I got so angry at my dad that I said some hurtful things to him. Things like: "you damn useless lah!", "why our house like this? i cannot bring my friends home leh!". I remembered saying that I hated him for not trying hard enough to get us out of our situation. I even got mad at him for not being able to buy me a new school bag... He always patched the tears in my bag but being immature and unaware of the struggles my dad had at the time, I didn't want a "patched" bag. Looking back, I truly regret my words and actions.

It was in army that I wised up and realised what a great person my father is. I had a good officer whom I talked to about my situation at home. He made me realise many things that I, as a teenager, overlook. I thought back to the times when I stayed up late at night to study for my A-levels. My father was always seen sleeping in a rocking chair in the the living room (which is also my "study room"). Every now and then, he would wake up, make me coffee or tea and some food even though I didn't ask for him. He would place them on the living room table where I studied, smile at me and then gave me encouraging words.

In uni, I became more comfortable about my family background. It's still something I don't talk too much about especially with strangers or classmates I barely know. The only people in my life who know and have met my dad is two of my best friends from army and my girlfriend whom I met in NUS and who by the way comes from a rich family. Her parents aren't very enthu about our relationship but we are still fighting hard after years for their acceptance. But that's another story altogether. I still live in the same 1-room flat with my dad. A lot of the "treasures" from my teenage years are gone (sold actually), but the remaining ones, I've helped him to organise. He still works as a karang guni but he no longer puts in as many hours as before. I've told him to retire and to let me take care of him since now I'm already a very good income in finance, but he insists on working. Nowadays, our situation is better and often now, I get to enjoy ice cream with my dad in our living room. These are small luxuries in life, but they mean the world to me and others like me. Haha... thanks for taking the time to read. It's nice to read the confessions here (:

 Thanks for bringing up this topic. After reading your post, I felt embarrassed about my poor knowledge of current affairs and news.

In reponse to comments on post , i very much agree that its usually aunties who refused to stand to the left to let people pass and it puzzles me why. Is it merely because their reaction too slow? Too talkative? Or simply don't care?

 hello there. I'm one of those super skinny girls you mentioned. My BMI is 15. I just wanna say that us skinny girls have our own problems too. Being too thin actually brings about health problems like anemia, low blood pressure, etc. I get tired very easily(cannot concentrate in lessons) and I can feel faint often(I fainted in school before and had a lot of near-faint incidents). I would actually prefer having image problems than health problems...So I guess we both envy each other... I wanna become fatter too but my weight just wont increase no matter how much I eat.

There's nothing wrong with being fat. So cheer up!

I have recently been discovering (at an internship) that being a professional engineer involves some fluidity in roles. For example, one can go on-site, work at the office, attend a client meeting,etc all in one day. So that's how I ended up at a swelteringly hot train depot (followed by a rather outdoorsy hawker centre) wearing a very expensive silk dress and heels. 
Looked like an idiot, I did. 
Ruined a dress, I might have. 
So today's takeaway about work attire was:

My bf think he playing me by cheating on me but I be playing him, using his KR room for free stay + bringing guys to screw around with when he isn't around

When I was in secondary school, I was in Chinese Orchestra and I played the suona. 

I played it very lousy. When I was in sec 3, even a sec 1 could play it better than me. 

When I was in sec 4, my teacher choose  me for SYF and I decided to practice everyday for it.

Initially, I didn't make any improvement. Once, someone asked who wanted to get gold for SYF and  I raised my hand. She said,"huh you want to get gold ah ". I was merely a COP(certificate of participation) level at that time.

Everyone looked down at me and no one believed that I can succeed. 

I continue practicing everyone and people finally started to see some improvement. 

I went for SYF and the school get gold. If you have been in  Chinese orchestra before, you will know that suona is one of the loudest instrument. Yet I entered SYF and he school get gold. Imagine How much I had improved? 

So when Should you give up?

Never!

Does anyone seems to notice that every time during peak hours, it doesn't matter whether you stand on the left or right side of the escalator, the people on the right hand side who's supposed to walk up didn't do so, resulting in a terrible bottleneck at the bottom of the escalator. This is despite the fact that the platform isn't totally crowded and it's possible for the people to walk up but i don't understand why there is quite a number of inconsiderate people who occupy the right hand side of the escalator and not walk up, which sometimes causes you to miss your train as you have no way of cutting through at all. Even taking the stairs is terrible as there's blockages there too.

Worst, on train, sometimes its so bloody packed that you felt stuffy, hot and sweaty and then by the time you alight, you are stuck in a bottle neck for the escalator again (referring to buona vista as an example here).

The trains for both directions in circle line always arrive simultaneously, resulting in a worse bottleneck. I don't know if they have any economic reasons for making the trains arrive simultaneously or is it merely poor planning, but judging from the fact that this always happen, it appears like its purposely planned this way, though the reasons were unclear.

I told my parents that it would be better that i get a car in the future but they said that another problem would surface, for instance i would be stuck in a traffic jam.

Sorry for rant, just wanna vent out my frustration from having squeezed MRT almost every day when going work..

Hi! Does anyone has anything to suggest what to do in Singapore?

My cousins are coming to visit me next week for about 4 days and I've absolutely no idea where to bring them to. So far, they've been to USS, adventure cove, sea aquarium, food hunting, zoo, night safari, trick eye museum and that's all I think?

They're around 15-18 years old! Any suggestions of places to hang out will really be great!!!

Once every month or two months, i will take a short weekend trip to indonesia where i will visit one of the local farms and buy a fresh chicken for myself to satisfy my sexual urges. White, fat ones are my favorite. I don't know why but i find the feathers attractive in a weird sort of way. 

Sickening yes, but can't help it. When i'm at home i tend to satisfy myself by watching such animal porn as well. 

Sorry guys. I want to tell someone but i can't, cos this is too disturbing for most people. Probably will take this secret with me to my grave.

I came across a horrible article about how we get meat for consumption. Weeks ago there is a huge debate about the fact that we shouldn't eat dog meat. Well this article mentioned how animals such as dogs and also chickens get killed by boiling or flaming them alive and the pictures grossed me out. It makes me wonder why humans can bear to do such a horrible acts to the animal. If we do indeed want to consume meat, fine. But i don't understand why some humans kill these animals in such a slow and painful manner instead of doing it fast by sliting their throats or at least sedate them first. I also came across a video of people killing chickens by throwing them against the wall repeatedly. Seriously, are these people sadist? 

The main question is why the humans who's supposed to kill these animals for consumption do it in such a slow and painful manner instead of making it fast? I am sure they as humans would not want to die in such a manner.

To , you can try this =P

Tell her, " I have never ever seen a beautiful and stunning magician like you, do you conduct magic classes?".

She will reply, " I'm not a magician".

Then you tell her, " Stop lying! You have just performed a miracle. You took away my heart yet I'm still alive somehow."

"Can I have your magic numbers please =)?"

I used to be a ugly nerd when I first entered university . Skinny body, jagged teeth , wearing my pants so damn high and probably the last guy on earth still adopting center-parting hairstyle in the 21th century. After serving 2 years of NS with relatively little contact with the opposite gender, I became socially awkward when interacting with women. I got creep-zoned by my O.G mates in every single camp that I participated in. My secret pal simply just walks off when she discovered that I'm that "Creepy Guy". All these series of events brought my pride and confidence to the rock bottom. Looking into the mirror became a nightmare to me, as i began to detest my own appearance.

When school starts, everyone formed their clique and attended lectures together while I'm the odd ball that is left out. I began to question my worth and sunk into apathy. Luckily I'm not the only odd ball that exist in this world. Our story began in LT7, two odd balls sat beside each other. Fate caused her to drop her pen and we sparked off an intense conversation after I picked it up for her. Two complete strangers simply clicked together just like that, perhaps it's because we are both rejected ugly-freaks hence we are able to understand each other's agony.  Ever since that day, I always look forward to meet her during lecture, she is my sunshine. Her presence erase every single traces of loneliness and sadness inside my heart. 

We done a lot of foolish stuffs together. There was one night we kept lamenting about our ugly looks, appearance  and how we are doom to remained "forever alone" in life. She suddenly touched my face, looked into my eyes and told me that I'm a handsome boy. I laughed so hard, before I can utter a word ...she kissed my lips. I was so damn shocked and she quickly withdrew her lips and looked away. My impulse took over me and  I grabbed her face and kissed her back. We had a really long passionate kiss that night, I  pulled her face back wanting more, whenever she broke off in between our intimate act. What a silly way to lose our first kiss isn't it? Soon enough we took our craziness to a whole new level.....we got drunk and lost our virginity too. However we still ain't attached after all these events. I promised her, if we are both still single when I hit 30, I will marry her. As despicable as it sounds, I never wanted her to be my girlfriend because I felt that she is not good enough for me. I had other plans...

Eventually, I hired a fashion consultant. I hit the gym 6 days a week and built up a muscular body that would made every girl go wild. My makeover fee costed almost 12k in order to turn me into a "handsome guy". As my physique and appearance got better, we drifted further apart. When I made new friends, I ditched her and left her to attend lectures alone. She finally couldn't contained her sadness after 2 weeks hence she called me to find out why I had isolated her.
 
I told her, " I'm leading a new energetic life now. XXXX you are a really nice girl, I have always enjoyed your company. But I firmly believe that you have potential to become a really pretty babe that every guy desire. 天地下没丑女人，只有懒女人. Jia you!".

There was an awkward silence for awhile followed by her weeping voice, " I never wanted to change! Is it a crime to be ugly? 原来这是你的真面目, 我好笨！You have changed".

Instead of pacifying her. I replied coldly, " Yes, I have changed. Thank you for noticing that I'm a handsome guy now. If you don't improve yourself nobody can help you! It's your choice to remain ugly or not. I'm not gonna lie to you". 
I was foolish enough to think my words can spur her to become a hot babe and she will thank me in the future.

" The nerdy and ugly "you"that I love, is dead now". These are her last words.

"死的好！I'm so glad that I had killed him", I replied. I'm not a cold-hearted bastard, I did shed a few tears during the conversation. Every single harsh words that I uttered, felt like tearing a piece of my heart out of me. After all she is still an precious and irreplaceable friend.

We entered into a cold war afterwards... there are times I felt like siting beside her during lecture to patch things up. However I'm always surrounded by female friends who want to sit with me and I gave in to peer pressure time after time.

I went into a few short-lasting relationships. Although all of them are pretty babes, I wasn't truly happy at all. No matter how good looking I am, how much effort I have put in.. they never truly appreciated me. In the end, I got hurt pretty badly with emotional scars all over me. She is the only person that came into my mind, when my life hit the rock bottom. I searched high and low for her everywhere, but she is no where to be found in school. It's impossible to contact her because her mobile service got terminated. I got worried and I rushed to her home as fast as I could. I never sprint so fast before in my whole entire life.I kept praying, " Jesus, please keep her safe! Please keep her safe! I can't afford to lose her!" 
Heaven played the biggest joke on me... I arrived at the doorsteps and found out that she had already move out. 
I went completely insane at the stair case, I broke down in to tears and started laughing at the same time. I scratched my head vigorously and punched the wall to vent out my agony.
 
I didn't gave up still, as I went around in school to ask for clues from people who knew her. I was shocked to found out from her tutorial mate that she had quit school. It's really unbelievable because she is a hardworking girl with CAP 4. The next piece of information shattered my heart completely! I was told that she was last seen in school, crying really badly during lecture in LT7. Her tutorial mate gave me a fierce glare and told me, " 她为你这种臭男人哭，一点也不值得!"

I dragged my half-dead body into LT7 and sat on the spot where we first met. Scenes of her crying in the LT suddenly flooded my mind, I can even hear the voice of her weeping. I couldn't hold back my tears as I realised that I have lost the most important women of my life. I destroyed the women who have always protected me......

I know you are still out there in this world, I won't blame you if you refuse to see me again. 千错万错都是我的错，我没珍惜你，失去你了只能后悔. Thank you for your love! When the whole world despise the ugly duckling, cursing him and tossing rotten eggs at him. You are the only one who is willing to shower the ugly duckling with love and kissed him. If I'm provided with a second chance, I will hug you tightly and never allow you to leave me ever again!! 

Dear readers, instead of asking me "你算什么男人？". I'm  going down on my knees and beg you to share this post. Please let her see this post. I REALLY REALLY REALLY NEED A SECOND CHANCE TO REDEEM MYSELF! I DON'T WANT CARRY THIS UNBEARABLE SCAR FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

Hello guys, just want to say that I am 1/8 of a NUS student because I'd been to local exchange in NUS. I must say NUS certainly has the greenest grass because of many reasons. It has many libraries (Central, science, medicine and many more!) with many tables and chairs (many floors which consist of entirely tables and chairs!), there is never a shortage of a place to study even during the exam period! Many buildings in NUS, from whichever faculty, also offer study rooms or labs that students can utilize to study, unlike elsewhere whereby we have to queue very early in the morning to chop seats in the "only" library.

The LTs in NUS are always equipped with power sockets! Especially the UTown auditoriums and LTs, every seat has a socket nearby and everyone will have a chance to use them! Even the older LTs, like LT27, have power sockets that are easily available. Unlike in the other side of the land, power socket are very expensive for reasons unknown. Not only does every LT has power sockets all over the place, every table in the library has power socket too! Whereas in my school, we have to bring extension cables for each long table if we want to share the power socket, or else, beg for the guy sitting nearest to it to let you use it!

NUS has many functioning bookstores, near Central library there is one and not to mention the one at Science. They are absolutely great (and they give discounts to students!)! Unlike in the shitty place on the other side, we are having problem with bookstore and they didn't inform us timely enough about the closure of a certain bookstore. Now, we are left with a tiny Popular located in a not so convenient place ><!

FOOD!!! NUS has so many nice canteens, Deck, TechnoEdge and Science canteen! Omg, noodles stall at Science, YTH at Deck and laksa at TechnoEdge OMG!!! And the prices are definitely way more affordable than the canteens elsewhere which are showing off their teeth at ravaging on poor students' wallets (and in one of the canteens they have a seriously dumb card payment system). NUS management has definitely keep a good promise to make prices affordable for students, unlike elsewhere (again) whereby the management has lots of profit-making will.

UTOWN!!! It is so big, so well-equipped and beautiful! The food at the canteens are a little more pricey though but they taste pretty good still. The accommodation in UTown is very expensive but I can understand the rationale given NUS premium location, it is so convenient to travel to NUS! Especially so after Circle line was utilized!

NUS modules are generally harder to score but I feel the content is much more enriching and prepares the students well for both future work and further academic studies! The lecture and tutorial hours are longer but the content is sufficiently deep and can very well pique students' interest. Unlike elsewhere, the modules are poorly structured and many concepts are not even mentioned before more advanced concepts are introduced. I felt so deeply engaged intellectually in NUS!

Even though I hear frequently that the transport in NUS is not up to standard, to a certain extent I agree. Given NUS has utilized a bigger land space for their undergraduates, students need to travel within the campus almost every hourly. Therefore, I think they need to beef the transport up so that students will have lesser chance of being late in lectures etc. That being said, NUS transport is actually better than elsewhere. In my land, buses are not only filled to the brim, they travel a long route all over the campus and there are only two routes, no buses A B C D but only two colours. Buses filled to the brim is not an issue, the issue is with the drivers. They are F1 drivers and they always try to cut corners by not slowing down near the zebra crossing, in a sense they are playing with the pedestrians' mentality that they will walk fast across the zebra crossing if they see a bus speeding towards them. Not to mention you can see them slacking off at one corner in the school, instead of driving.

NUS also has better recreational facilities, more gyms, more swimming pools and more courts to play games. I am so glad the school has invested so much time, effort and money in making these facilities fully functioning and well-utilized. On the other hand, even though we have a larger grand total of land area, we are using it to provide greenery.

I also feel NUS staff are more approachable, more friendly and generally responsive (although there are always unfriendly staff everyone, because some humans are just not very good at fulfilling their roles). E-mails work very well and very often, things get done and exceptional requests put up are very often acceded or at least, rejected with a proper explanation. Professors and tutors are also generally very approachable, negotiable and talkative (of course there are exceptions everywhere). They love to share insights, ideas and also about their personal experiences which again, contain lots of anecdotes that one can learn things from! They are also more straight-forward and express their opinions more directly! They always put up consultation slots, warmly welcome you and are totally patient with stupid questions.

I really enjoyed my stay in NUS and I am grateful for everyone I met there and spent time with. It is indeed worthy of its ranking and reputation!

TL;DR, NUS rocks!

Does any girls feel that whenever you are in the heartland areas (those places where you have many not so modern facilities and mainly coffee shops/hawker centres) or places near construction sites, the men like to oogle and sometimes they may even try to stand close to you if given the chance. They do it in such an obvious manner! This makes me very uncomfortable but my mom told me there is nothing you can do as there will always be people like this everywhere. Seriously?? People always say this happens when the girl wear revealing clothes but truth is, my clothes are simply just shirt and pants, nothing revealing at all. And i definitely do not have a slim and sexy figure, simply an average figure, and neither did i have any make-up on my face.

Is it really true that men behaves like this every time they see a young girl (whether she wear revealing clothes or not)  Why do these men behave like that? Why can't they control their staring? 

Girls, in particular those who do not wear revealing clothes nor make-up but yet got ogled at, please like this post if the same thing happens to you.

P.S please do not blast me for this post. I am simply looking for some opinion on this issue.

I feel like I am in the wrong major nowadays, feel like I should transfer to Civil Engineering. 

Have been feeling a lot of frustration at the blardy hot weather when I recall my profs teaching us about how deforestation causes an increase in Singapore's average temperature. Arghh... So HAWT. Gosh, I'm not even talking about how hot my body is. Im talking about how we haven't had any rain for days. Even Megan Fox's body CMI compared to the heat.

BLARDY HOT SIA.

The USA should have legalized cloud marriage, so the clouds can marry each other and give birth to rain sia.

I have an embarrassing problem, a bit NSFW, so ladies don't read it if you can't view it scientifically. 

In the middle of the night or in the mornings, I find myself erect and humping my bed unconsciously. And this can continue subconsciously for some time until I finally gain control of myself and either wake up or go back to sleep. It almost never results in ejaculation and it affects my sleep a lot. Googling this problem doesn't help because a lot of results are about dogs humping things. I just want to know, is there a name for this? Does anyone else have this problem?

Most of the time when I meet new people, they'll be like, "hey, you look very rich leh". Um hello, how do you "look" rich? I just wear shirt, shorts, and slippers, and carry a normal backpack which doesn't have a brand name on it, and I look rich? I have nothing branded on me, ok? It's annoying, so stop saying people look rich, because I for one is broke as hell (okay, maybe not that broke but you get the point).

Is it a bad thing that I love places more than I will ever love people? I recently visited New York City for the first time for a week and it was love at first sight.

 eh siaoeh u wanna act garang, sign on lah eh! Outside camp, I dun give a shit ABT ur NS, cos it is pathetic to boast of earning peanuts each month. I'm from a specialized force which most PPL probably NV heard of but I dun dare to boast ABT it. Everytime I just tell PPL my general vocation. Tell u what, although my unit is super garang when u know it, we all sleep in bunk most of the time, that is not cool. So, the next time someone boast ABT their NS garang experience, you can safely doubt that. Most of the time, like 90%, its sleep, slack, late night movies, Xbox PSP, maggi and wayang!

  Ok this one is harder (I think)
My friend and I are both huge fans of photography. One time while we were talking, a stranger walked passed us and said we should go take some ghost photos. Crazy as we were, we went to this old house on a mountain road where someone has been killed. We went late at night, because ghost don’t show up at daytime, right? We broke the front door and went from the front hall to the living room, the washroom, the bath, the kitchen, the study, then up to the second floor, and back downstairs. Then we each took some photo’s of us with the house behind us.
The next morning, we looked at the “ghost pictures” we took and we were surprised.
There was absolutely nothing. I mean, nothing out of ordinary. We were just standing there in the pictures. But no ghosts or anything that seems off.
“that’s really weird isn’t it?”
“Maybe they already left earth? Like went to heaven or something?”
“Yeah probably. That was a waste of time. So no ghost pictures for us then?”
“I saw a house, pretty distant from the rest. We can try there next.”
“Really? It’s empty?”
“Of course not, there were people there. Let’s go tonight?”
“Okay, understood. I’ll get ready.”
“I can’t wait, this’ll be a lot of fun.”
Pls DO NOT GOOGLE or you'll spoil the fun :P

Too many serious/depressing posts these past few days. It's Friday so I want to liven things up a bit, so here is a riddle I saw online:

This evening a masked robber attacked my wife. I was on my way home from my job at that time. Fortunately, she protected herself from him with a butcher knife. When I received the phone call from her, I went to the police station immediately. When I picked her up from the station, she told me the whole story. “When I heard the bell I thought it was you, but it turned out to be somebody else. He jumped on me and tried to rape me as soon as I opened the door! I was so lost and didn’t know what to do!”
“Don’t be scared, everything is fine now”, I said, and I held her tightly.
One of the police officer asked: “Did you see how he looked like ma’am?”
“No, I didn’t. It was so sudden. My husband always come home around the same time, so I thought it was him.”
My wife can do the most stupid things sometime. I always have the keys with me. But I kept my mouth shut.
As I tried to calm her down, the two of us walked towards home.
“Don’t worry, the masked robber will get caught soon. I will stay home together with you for a few days.”

Despite the husband's kind and loving concern, someone is in real danger here. Who and why?

Don't google the story it's quite easy :)

My mum works in NUS as an admin lady. Earlier today, I was in school doing work and met her for lunch. Over our meal, she asked me, "Ah boy ah! Just now my cor-league show me the NUS weez-peer. How come so many sex post ah? You and your boyfriend got sex not?!"

"Huh? What? No?" 

There you have it, biggest lie I ever told.

 Omg i lovee this kind of riddle. Here is one that I liked :P
"I hate it when people stand near each other when it’s hot. Crowds, I really hate those. I’m exhausted from work, and miss the rush hour train to get home. I walk all the way back to my apartment building and go inside. I live on the 6th floor, so I wait for the elevator lift. Another damn crowd in there.
An old man and his wife, a college student, a businessman in a suit,  a mom with a baby on her back and another holding her hand, and two twins from elementary school.
We all get inside the lift. And as the elevator doors are about to close, this girl in a black dress slips past them. The weight buzzer goes off. The elevator doors open up. Hmm, I guess that makes sense. The elevator lift only supports 9 adults. Two kids have around the same weight as one adult, I guess. She looks embarrassed and tries to get off. I smile and step out of the lift. She’s smiling back at me as the doors close. Really cute. I didn’t want to be stuck on a full elevator anyway, totally worth it. I don’t feel like waiting and decide to take the stairs instead. I enter my apartment and turn on the TV. The news is talking about some girl that’s gone missing. She was last seen with a black dress and near the place I live as well. It remind me of the girl I’ve seen on the elevator. The news shows a picture of the missing girl. Aah, it’s not the same girl."
Any problem?

I have travelled almost all the South East Asian countries and realize that almost all the time, the drivers always treat pedestrians as invisible even at pedestrian crossing or when the traffic lights are in favour of the pedestrians . The only time they will stop is when they are only a few centimeters from colliding with the pedestrians, only to hear the drivers venting the frustrations at you after they have stop. These have made crossing the roads a nightmare. It just makes me wonder if Singapore is the only nation where the drivers will stop at pedestrian crossing and when traffic is in favour of the pedestrians.

In reply to , I believe the best way to train your core and abs is to start doing hanging leg raises. If you are a beginner, I would suggest that you start with hanging knee raises. And depending on what your aim is, for example if it is for definition and aesthetics, dun forget to train your obliques and serratus anterior as well. Add in some twisting motion and resistance to your normal sit-ups and crunches, and you will soon see the results. 
As for the diet, if you want your abs to show, keep your body fat percentage low, all standard stuff eat less fatty or oily stuff. Remember to add in some cardio to burn off any additional fat. 

That's all for my advice :) All the best in your fitness journey.

To 

If anything a lady in a gym gives gets, it's respect. Yes the gym racks are extremely judgemental area but in a positive manner. Anyone who needs a spot or needs any advice whether you skinny buff overweight tall short, you get it. And no one will look your body fats in a negative way, the frequent fitspos will just think "she's here to make a difference in his/her life,  if she asks I'll give her a hand" anyone who's not with me on this 100% isn't a gym rat. I'm referring to kids going there to curl a few 5s and text on their phones or take some instagram photos. 

Like this post if you're a gym rat. And you go girl, we're all here for anyone willing to make a difference to their own body. 

PS. If you're looking to lose some good weight and be healthy. Eat more smaller meals, swim and run. I personally prefer swimming. Running is too mentally exhaustive Haha! 

Cheers folks!

I feel like I have been living a lie my whole life. I come from a place of deep repression—very religious and traditional family (Your trip got girl? Can't go! Stay home and pray!)—and growing up, I've been very careful to be the perfect son that my parents always so proud of. Got my As, my CCA, my CIP, med school, cell group, church band, you name I've got it on my CV. My friends all think I'm this shy innocent guy because I'm usually very polite and don't talk so much at school. I know they love me but I hate my life because I feel like I'm just renting it and it doesn't belong to me.

Three years ago, I was on a trip overseas and I was in a club and the guys convinced me to get drunk. I felt guilty but I eventually relented, the whole time thinking of my mom weeping in shame and my dad nailing a crucifix to my forehead. Next thing I knew I was waking up in a bad part of town (the roads were unpaved and I was basically sleeping in a pool of vomit and why was the water black?) with my shoes and wallet gone. I somehow managed to break an arm and had a searing pain on my left buttock (a tattoo, it would later turn out). Long story short: I went to the police station, found my useless friends, who said they lost me in the club, and then fell sick for the next three days. I was either in pain, asleep, or throwing up. I had a tube shoved up my urethra and a fever that I now think probably did some brain damage. It was the most horrible experience of my life. And also the only time that I ever felt like my life belonged to me. 

I think it broke something inside of me. They still think I'm the good Christian son and you'd probably still just gloss over me at school. It's been three years and now I have a secret girlfriend and an even more secret guy I'm seeing on the side (digressing... if anyone has any advice, how does one casually ask for a threesome?) and I know it's lame but I look for stray cats to antagonise into attacking me and at least once a week, I dare guys in the bathroom to punch me in the stomach.

I wish I hadn't passed out on a chance to study music in Russia under the private mentorship of a respected violinist. I remembered her telling me at my audition two years ago, "Your talent must be cultivated." Despite only having played the violin for three years then, that was the first time ever in my life I felt truly recognized and by someone I deeply admire no less.

Because now I'm just crunching numbers. And while I'm excellent at it, I can't help but to imagine how much undoubtedly happier I would have been had I the courage.

To  do you compulsively release yourself (to pornography or with no stimulus)? If you do and do it often your reward pathways in the brain could be slightly messed up. When you get to the real thing you might find it difficult to carry on the whole process as the control your hand has is never the same as the walls of the vagina. Also what gets you off could be the plethora of women you see behind a screen numbing your bodily reactions to real sex. Try abstaining a while.

Just watched the 9 o'clock news on channel 5. There was a story about drug abuse on the rise. Some dude started taking cough syrup and ended up on ice & heroin! Call me extremely sheltered and naive, but how are such hard drugs even entering Singapore??? With the legal system, CNB and border controls, how is this possible? I'm seriously asking this question. Seriously, if I ever meet any such idiot i will personally take my slipper and beat them black and blue like an Aunty.

There's this cute senior/OGL from a freshmen camp I recently went, I wish I was in his house cause he was coaching them for the inter house game.  Oh and at Sentosa he was topless cause of some game mission. Too bad I didn't bring my shades if not I wouldn't need to take sneak peeks whenever he's nearby :((

Hohoho.... Man do I love the durian season. Maybe someone should bring sacks and sacks of durian to school to eat and share together???

Not a NUS related rant but still something related. I noticed that Scoot has received much flak about recent delays and I saw nasty videos of the service staff being shouted at. My heart goes out to the Scoot staff. 

Another example is one taken from this Scoot site - I'm not sure where these people get the idea that they deserve more, especially from a budget airline? Funny how things work sometimes.

My point here is that I hope NUS students (I have graduated a while back) do develop some humility and empathy for other fellow human beings. On top of stepping in to stop such acts, we should also give our thanks and appreciation. This includes cleaners in canteens and toilets, bus drivers and even canteen store owners. 

I hope after reading this, you do give thanks to people around you - Let's make Singapore a kinder place :)

Its durian season now. I really wish the drink stall in NUS canteens sell durians then I do not have to make a trip to clementi to purchase when I have craving for durians while in school.

Now that we are all adults, I really miss the fun we had in secondary school. Do you still remember the cute girl in class whom we all had a crush on? Prancing around in her short skirt and her dyed hair, she was the most adorable girl ever. Remember the ahbeng from the NA class with the dragon tattoo on his back? Legend has it that when he asks you to go to the toilet with him, you'll come out crawling. What about the joker in our class who went around pulling people's chair when they're about to sit? We would skip school to take bus rides from end to end, or rush to the arcade after our supplementary lessons to compete with the neighbourhood kids in daytona. Remember the PE lessons where we cut the HDB buildings around our school for our 2.4km runs only to get bao-tohed by the nerd in class? We've all grown up, but these memories will stay with us forever. ;)

Dear NUS Whispers, I have my professor on my Facebook friends list. He recently posted a status update saying he hated people who posted mouth-watering photos of durians on Facebook. I was halfway into strongly agreeing to his statement and feeling his agony silently in my head when the next post I saw was a picture of him with mouth-watering durians. Now my mouth refuses to stop watering and I am not sure if I should hate him or agree with him.

Why is it that the libraries in NUS are not open to the public whereas NTU libraries are open to the public? i understand if I can't borrow books from the library since I'm not a student of NUS but why can't they just allow us to read them in the library instead? I know a few school that allow the public to have assess to their libraries just that they can't use the facilities.

I can't believe my life in university is somewhat like the music video of Lady GaGa's G.U.Y video, and when I tell my friends that, they go "Oh you're just an overzealous fan of hers". Please guys, if you bothered to even find out the background behind the song (Not referring to the sexual innuendos of the lyrics or "occult" monarch programming conspiracy theories).

P.S Just because I listen to some Lady GaGa songs doesn't mean I'm her "crazy fan". Its just a comparison!

I live in a hdb estate, within which one of those low-rise hdb shophouse-market compounds exist. My family has typically patronised one of several GP clinics there for the twenty-or-so years we have lived here. However, recently, we had to visit another clinic when my mother fell ill as our usual clinic was closed. 

While waiting for my mother's turn to consult with the doctor, I noticed how the clinic's appearance was quite dated; even more so than that of the clinic we usually visited-- the two wall fans in the waiting area had rusted (albeit clean) caging, the floor tiles were tinted with age, the posters on the wall yellowed and faded.

When it finally came to my mother's turn with the doctor, he had a warmly-professional bedside manner, taking pains to make us feel at ease (even including myself in the conversation). I noted how his office, like the rest of the clinic, was slightly dated (though well lit), with but a single wall fan located within. The doctor was still visibly perspiring; and I couldn't help but feel a surge of admiration for his ability to maintain such a cheerful attitude throughout his workday, every day.

Later on, when my mother approached the counter to pay for her consultation and medicine, I was truly floored at the fee charged: a measly FIVE DOLLARS for consultation AND medicine. Immediately I concluded that this GP (and his assistant) must not be making a profit from running this clinic; and yet this clinic has been running for as long as I can remember.

Right now I'm torn between feeling bad (a sense of having 'taken advantage' of their charity) and boundless admiration for the generous, giving souls who are the doctor and his assistant (both of whom appear to be at least in their 50s to 60s). Coming from a middle-low-income family myself, I am realistically unable to do something as drastic as financing a renovation for their clinic, but I was wondering if anyone knows any way I could possibly help?

This GP has truly inspired me to endeavor to grow in generosity. Even though my undergrad training may not lead towards a career path that allows me to contribute in as urgent/pertinent areas as fulfilling the medical/legal needs of the community, I've really been moved by the humble charity of this doctor and I hope to one day be able to support these silent, giving do-gooders in any way I can. Amid the torrent of LGBT debate posts recently on this site, I hope this inspires all the to-be doctors, lawyers, and everyone else out there reading this as much as it has inspired me.

TL;DR - Inspiring GP. #faithinhumanityrestored

 Hey OP, I can recommend a good Anime series to watch to feel better. It's called Saishuu Heiki Kanojou (Saikano). You can find all 13 episodes on Youtube.

There was this one time, I blocked a friend I haven't seen since primary school, because she kept posting stuff about her prada bag, rich boyfriends, etc. (like wth man, seriously? are expensive bags really that great? My gunny-sack bag can do better, guy here btw). 

Later on, I bitched a lot about her, and apparently, I was friends with her other account... Well that was a loooot of butthurt there. Though today, a year or so on, I am still contemplating on what happened.

A few months back, I had an argument with my ex-girlfriend and the cold war lasted for a week. In the end, I decided to forgive her wrongdoings and patched up with her.
Instead, of appreciating my tolerance, she compared me with her pet dog- blacky.

She told me, " You are just like blacky. Whenever I ignore him, he will throw his temper and run away from home. But as soon as he gets hungry, he will come back home to me and swing his tail"

After hearing such demeaning comments from her, I decided to give up in this relationship and play along. Day after day I found her to be more and more disgusting to the point that I washed my mouth with soap after I kissed her. Bath 2 times after having sex with her. At one point ,I have even considered wearing 2 layers of condoms too. Then one fine day.... I got real sick of her "princess illness" and I broke up up with her. She tried to act cool and gave a "don't give a shit" attitude in the beginning. However when she realised that I'm leaving for real... She came to look for me and started crying and hug me, begging for forgiveness.

I held her chin an said, "小黑乖，不要哭了哦“.

-15/06/2015. The arguments have yet to end.-

I fell from my bed, and found myself grimacing in pain. Looking at the clock, I realized that I have slept exactly half the day away. A dark storm arrived, and a light gale swept the trees in one direction.

Yawning loudly, I rushed to the restroom to wash up, and switched on my Samsung Galaxy S4 just to connect to my WiFi, interested in looking at the recent developments on NUSWhispers. My heart sank as my fingers scrolled the screen upwards.

Arguments.

A long list of them. People for and against issues like LGBT. I was hoping the subject would switch away from these controversial issues. I never really understood how the posts really served their intended purpose, because I was always very apathetic towards these issues. But I was a really weird guy who was spending summer unproductively. So I decided to redeem myself, and thought about its importance on the subway.

I sat on the train headed for Bishan, and scrolled through the posts once more. Gradually I began to understand the different viewpoints of each other. But I could not imagine myself doing anything about the controversial issue.

So I looked around the train for passengers, and I noticed a guy who looked like me. I stared intently at him, trying to figure out if he was interested in men or women, but I failed. Subsequently, I tried to determine if he was a guy who liked coffee, but failed to determine his level of interest in the black bitter beverage.

Finally, I tried to imagine myself in a scenario where I was in complete understanding of his interest, and wonder what I would do.

But even after reaching Bishan, I realized, that there was nothing I really wanted to do.

Sure enough, the guy might have hated coffee, and probably me for staring intently at him. But there was no impetus for me to confront him, and he looked rather peaceful sleeping on the train, and I figured that he could have been a really nice person, just that he really probably would not like coffee.

I sat down at Starbucks, and found my friend waiting impatiently for me. He motioned me over, and I greeted him with a brilliant smile.

“So what’s up Kelvin?”

“Nothing, just spending my time reading NUSWhispers.”

“Oh. Is there anything that’s been interesting?”

“Yeah, they’re talking about LGBT.”

“Is that, like, a forum?”

“Well... Not really. What’s your stance on the matter?”

“Nothing. As long as I can afford my 3 meals a day and still get my pay, the sexuality and interests of others is really something secondary.”

I heaved a sigh of relief, knowing I was not the only weird and apathetic person in the world. I sipped some coffee, and tapped the rim twice in agreement.

“I wholeheartedly agree.”

The rain began to subside, and the clouds were beginning to clear. The popcorn shop had closed for the day.

Just like that, another day of summer ended, in the blink of an eye.

I'm attracted to handsome guys and pretty girls. I can't stop ogling at dem good-looking people. I can join my girls in gossiping about cute and sporty boys. I can also join my dudes in discussing about hot and sexy girls. The best of two worlds.

I am a guy, my favorite hangout is at the Utown gym because I get to drool over the hot guys working out. I try to be discreet over it and pretend I am completely focused on earning my gains because I do not want to be known as that weird gay guy. But if you do make eye contact with me please come over and say hi  :D

Watching a film on Youtube (recommendation from a friend, but no idea why he recommended such an old film).

Thinking about life now, so what if I have turned my backs on the people whom I thought I could be good friends with? I have friends elsewhere. So what if I am seen as a Slytherin by some people? I don't need to care about their opinion.

Even if I may never be able to see light of day, I know I have a purpose. I don't need to be the most popular. Neither do I have to be the smartest or most athletic. All I know is that, I have a mission, and I'll do it well. I don't care about public opinion.

But, just as  said, I will eventually play Monster Reborn to bring myself back to play and wipe out the rest of my opponents' Life Points! 

(I admit to missing card battling too, but I dare not ID myself.)

I still remember when I was 11 years old. I stood by my corridoor looking down at the ground. I was contemplating whether or not I should jump. Somehow, I convinced myself everything will be alright when I grow older. Today, I am in NUS. I have a CAP of 4.5. Yet, today, I regret not taking the step. I have a verbally abusive mother. My parents fight day and night. My elder brother does not care. To make things worse, I am fat and have horrible scars. I went to the gym and lost weight during NS. but now, I am gaining all back. I am stuck at home. I want to find a job but I have very bad esteem and anxiety issues. I find it so hard to speak up. I feel so ashamed of myself. I look at myself in the mirror and want to spit at my useless face. Why do I have to live? At least back then, I had the courage to jump. Now, I dont even have that. I wish my mum had aborted me.

Im doing an internship at an engineering company. There's a combination of people roaming around in boiler suits and some "office flowers" in pretty dresses and high heels. I find it funny how the "smelly" unclean fellow is 10 times as successful as the well-dressed sweet looking girl. No hate on anyone. Just a casual observation on how appearances can mean nothing in this world:)

Update to  - I still have some dyes to give away. Pink and one of the reds are reserved, still waiting for reply on blue. I'd like to give away the rest this week while I'm still free before starting work next week (and dye-ing my hair back to black ;_;), so again, drop a comment here letting me know what colour you want, I'll message you to follow up (after adding you to make sure it doesn't go into your other fb-message inbox without notifications)

Also, to the SIM student with a weird username and a display picture of a naked dude who commented on  - sorry I'm already spoken for.

Note that you get better results if you bleach your hair, the more bleached the better usually. I'll give advice and/or recommend my usual hairdresser. These dyes are semipermanent so the colour fades over a few weeks. 

Jars in photo, left to right then top to bottom:
- 1/3 jar white toner (neutralizes the ahbeng orange/yellow after bleaching to a nicer blonde)
- Small amount of black (closer to very dark blue, fades to rich blue then teal and green)
- two different kinds of dark red, one half jar and one just a bit left. Fades to light cottoncandy pink eventually. <<one red is taken>>
- Dark reddish-purple, half jar. Fades to a tulip colour.

Tubes:
- Small amount of electric blue, this one needs lots of bleaching, fades to green. <<awaiting confirmation>>
- half tube neon pink, this Japanese brand is great. Very intense colour that fades to cottoncandy pink. <<pink is taken>>
-

I was at Phuture yesterday night with my friends and a guy tapped me on the shoulder at the end of a song and gestured, asking me to dance. He made eye contact and held his hand out! He was with two other friends. I think I took a full two seconds to respond because I was stunned that someone would be so polite in a club here in Singapore! +1 for Singaporean guys hahaha. Sadly I didn't respond, not because I didn't want to dance with you, but because I was leaving soon! I'm sorry I turned away without explaining, it only occurred to me after I left. Thank you for being the gentleman we hardly see anymore and please don't change your style, I would definitely give you a dance if we met again :)

In light of all the premarital sex and promiscuity, let me just say that being  'stud' who sleeps with many girls > 'slut' who sleeps with many guys. Look at it this way, a stud usually needs good charms good looks and possibly deep pockets to get himself "girls" to sleep with. A slut on the other hand just needs to throw her self at guys and will automatically get her catch. In other words it would take much more "effort" or better circumstance to be a stud than to be a slut. You can find not so good looking or to put it bluntly below average sluts. Chances are studs don't work the other way round unless they have money or power.

With all the guys confessing to sprees of release. Is it normal for a girl to masturbate?

I am decent looking guy. Sometimes while walking towards a girl I noticed her looking down at my groin area. It's not like I forgot to zip up or anything.

She probably wants the D but it makes me feel 'eye raped' and dirty after that. All I want to do next is to take 10 showers to cleanse myself.

Free giveaway! I'm one of those kids you see around NUS with very brightly coloured long hair and I've run a full range of colours in my 4 years here. But now that I'm graduating, I've to go back to black, so I'm thinking of giving away my dyes to any juniors who want it. Just drop a comment here letting me know what colour you want, I'll add you and then message to arrange a time to meet and deliver. Note that you'll have to bleach your hair, usually quite light (2-3 times) for the lighter colours, I'll give you advice for that and/or recommend my usual hairdresser who has pretty good rates. These are semipermanent so the colour fades over a few weeks. Available colours:
Jars, left to right then top to bottom:

I'm an evergreen male NUS student starting third year in AY15/16. I don't think I'm good looking, but I'm sure that I'm of a decent standard. Not fat, but neither a bamboo or a cloud. I always dress properly: t-shirt, jeans and covered shoes (but not track shoes) is my baseline in school. Behaviour wise I am courteous and approachable. Being evergreen I don't know what to expect, and we might end up as nothing more than being buddies for chilling out. Any girls interested? Leave a message!

I wanna share a "go for it" advice i got from a friend of mine which backfires completely for me.

Bringing this story back in February and all the hype for valentines day. You see, there was this one girl that i had a crush on for the longest time. And it dawned on me that if i didnt do anything, she would just see me as just another guy from the canteen that keeps stealing glances at her. So, 3 days before valentines, i found out her twitter account and added her up. We chatted for hours on twitter's DM. And i really could feel she was pretty receptive of me. 

So when i told one of my best buddies about this, he told me to "just go for it". I made a really pretty valentine's day card (No, i didnt buy it over the counter. IT WAS HANDMADE AND ALL) and bought a fresh flower to go with it. I even tipped the girl who sold the valentines flower in our faculty to send my card and flower to her.

The person who send it over to her said she was really excited to receive it and even asked who it came from and all. So i waited on my phone to see if she would text me to say thanks or post something sweet on twitter. What happened next was that she unfollowed me on twitter and from that day on, she didnt even glance nor talked to me. Just like that, i have lost the right to ever call her my crush and a potential friend was lost. 

So yeah... "Go for it" advice didnt work. But i dont get it. She unfollowed me but i didnt unfollowed her back on twitter. So i can see the occasional "if only a guy can do sweet things and sweep me off my feet" tweets from her... Seriously? GIRL. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

I am a freshie matriculating this year. I was at NUS in the morning to listen to a welcome talk. I was on the way to Techno Edge food court at noon when this uncle(60-70?) approached me and called me xiao mei mei. His tone was just not right - like you know those creepers/serial stalkers. He wanted to ask me if the canteen was open when in fact it is just a flight of stairs away. It is that obvious that it is open. There were 2 other guys in front of me but he didnt approach them. I said I wasn't a student there (which is true as of now) and I dont know if the canteen is open. Then he asked where I wanted to go and he insisted on bringing me around in case I got lost (we talked in Chinese btw). I am sure he is familiar with NUS but he seems really suspicious. Does anyone have similar experience? He is rather small built and has white hair.

I don't know if anyone felt the same way but don't you find the term "wanderlust" overused to the extend that you suspect the user have no f**king clue what she is talking about. YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL, PERIOD! I am pretty sure half of the world's population does not actually have wanderlust.

Hi I am a female, chinese local. Year 2 next semester. From the faculty of Biz. I don't like putting on makeup or other girly stuffs. My friends have told me I am pretty even without makeup (*blush).  

I am single and looking for a date. I prefer guys that are athletic, not too muscular. Don't have to be too good looking. If you are interested drop a comment and I'll pm you. :)

I don't deny that  starbucks is somewhat a nice coffee brewer. But how do ppl order it so easily. Whenever I approach the counter, a few things happen.

First I will squint and try to look at the signboards and price. So small how to see. Second I will think of what size. Grande or tall. Ironic when tall is smallest. Can't I just say medium. Next with all these in mind I will worry that I will take a long time to decide and delay the queue. And the special offers and products normally position outside the store. You don't even put the price how you expect me to know. 

Maybe I'm just not fit to drink it. No wonder I prefer coffee bean or the plain kaya guyiu coffee at yakun toast.

I'm not the luckiest guy with the opposite gender, but this is just a shoutout to a girl whom I got to know recently (embarrassment embarrassment but might as well cause confessions woohoooo)

I think her name's Elaine (spelling?), and iirc she's a freshie from FoS. She's impressionable, lively, gives an effervescent disposition and feels like a caring person:) shame I didn't manage to know her really better cause I was running all over the shop!!:/

So just wanna say that I would like to know you better! Though very unlikely our paths would cross again but....who knows?

From the guy who thinks you stand out more than your red hair :D

I was washing my hands at the Science canteen when this girl waved at my direction. To my surprise, she walked to me, said hi and asked a question, in a informal tone as if she knew me. But I really could not recall (my social circle is tiny furthermore), or knew who she was, and I did not get what she was asking. So I asked her to repeat the question (with a pause hoping that she had perhaps recognized the wrong person). I still couldn't get what she was saying for the second time (due to an accent), but it was something along this line: "When is your practice....". Well, I was gonna have my practical exam later on so I just stupidly replied "Today." So, she just replied and walked away: "Oh, today!? Ok, see you." 
  
I'm very very sorry if I had failed to recognize you, and if I had aggravated the situation badly.

Hi I am responding to the gay guy from chem engineering. 

I am around 180cm, sporty but do not pump heavy iron in the gym. I pump something else.. anyway I am from the biz faculty, also going into year 3 next year and also looking for a guy to love me. 

But I am afraid to identify myself here so maybe we could work out a way to bring us both together?

10 years since i ate mcdonalds curry sauce.i walk through the empty streets trying to think of something else but my path always leads to mcdonalds. i stare at the counter for hours and try to summon the sauce. i tried other sauces but it is no good. i flame their facebook and try to resist the heartbreak whenever the cashier told me still no stock but it is all meaningless. the end is near.i then usually look at some curry sauce with fries pictures and cry myself to sleep.

After reading the comments of .

It really sadden me that the advice from my beloved and respected mentor, Hong is being ridiculed. 

Maybe I should let you guys know more about Hong. He is 43 years old this year. The remarkable thing about Hong is that he got rejected by hundreds of women for 38 years of his life before he finally succeeded in hooking up a women who will later become his wife. I can't imagine the psychological hurt of being subjected to constant rejections for 38 years. A normal person like me would have ended up with depression. However, Hong is an extraordinary man. He picked himself up everything he failed and  invented new pick-up lines and ways to interact with the opposite gender. Hong had never imagined that he will become a pick up trainer one day.... 2 years ago a tragic event happened to him. His most trusted wing man snatched away his wife and made him wear green hat. Despite the occurrence of such an unfair event, Hong did not hate his ex-wife nor his wing man. He decided to organise cheap and affordable pick-up training for evergreen & nerdy geeks like me, to impart his 38 years worth of experiences.

God bless Hong, a good man.

Everyone knows about those premedical checkups that companies make you go through before you start work right? Well I went through one recently and was told a few days later that my X-ray had some weird lines in it. Some "abnormal shadowing in the right lung". So I had to go fetch a previous X-ray film of mine for comparison. The most recent one was in the NUS University Health Centre database (from the checkup everyone has to do before matriculation). The folks at UHC were very kind and printed it out for me. 
It turns out both the images (this year's and last year's) are identical. I'm still waiting for the final verdict from the clinic, but what are the odds some random GP caught something UHC didn't? And has anyone ever been called back after the NUS Checkup for whatever reason? I ask because I'm not sure if UHC checkup wasn't legit or if the clinic doctor is being extra cautious. I don't have any external symptoms so I sure hope it's just some old scar tissue showing up. Any med students out there or folks who've had this sort of thing crop up? Pls halp.

To the engineering guy who approached me at Central Forum on Thursday, I'm sorry for backing away so quickly!

Last semester, I had a really weird experience in an NUS toilet.

It was a clear Friday night. I was out stargazing on the bridge between Engine and LT3/4 with a few friends. Halfway through, I excused myself and went to the male restroom near LT3/4.

I was stunned when I opened the door.

Right in front of me was a totally unclothed guy, standing in front of the mirror. He was busy admiring his male appendage. (FYI: this toilet does not have a shower facility.)

He quickly retreated to the furthest cubicle, and closed the door. An eerie quiet descended on the toilet. It was as though no one was in at all.

Was it a trick of the imagination? A prank gone wrong? Someone's kinky fetish? I dunno man. I'm not even sure if I want to know what goes on in that toilet.

All I know is this: this has got to be one of the most awkward pees of all time.

Hi guys! It's troll knight once again. But I'm not gonna share a troll post today. I will share a story of guilt instead.

I was meeting my friend for dinner at a coffee shop tonight ,when a middle age Indian man came to beg for $2 from me to buy food. I judged his appearance immediately and concluded that he must be those kind of people who exploit the kindness of others and use their money to gamble, drink etc...therefore I told him to go away, but he still stood there. I gave him a pissed off look and passed him a $2 bill. After awhile, I saw him walking towards the mixed-vegetable rice stall and brought a packet of food with that $2 bill and went off.

My friend came shortly and i asked him, " what kind of ingredients can you buy from the mixed vegetable store with just $2 only?".

He replied, " $2 dollars, you are kidding me?? A rice with 2 kinds of vegetable (excluding meat) already cost $2.30".

His words struck my conscience like a hammer and made me realised my mistakes. I looked at my bowl of fish soup which cost $4.80 and I felt my ashamed of myself. After my dinner, I went around to look for the man in order to give him more money. Sadly he was no where to be found. I couldn't forget this incident until now...... I'm guilty for being so arrogant and judgmental to a person who threw away his pride to beg me for a simple meal, so that he can survive for one more day. 

I wished I could do more for him, but it's already too late. I learnt a valuable lesson today and I hope you people don't repeat my mistakes. Even in Singapore, there are a lot of unfortunate people out there ,who are struggling to survive on a day by day basis. We are fortunate enough to have lots of meat,rice and vegetable on our table for every single meal. These food may look mundane to us, however these are what these poor people dream and wish for ,everyday. No one has ever gone poor by sharing and giving, always lend them a helping hand.

I am doing internship right now. I have enough sleep every night (8 hours okay right?) but don't know why, I always feel sleepy during work. So rather than caught sleeping on my work desk, I always go to the toilet and sleep at the cubicle. So yesterday my colleagues asked, whether I was okay. I told them that I had a very bad diarrhea. Feeling guilty right now, but really feel sleepy every time. What should I do?

So here's the story. I met a lady around her mid 30s at Starbucks. Her whole table was flooded with bills and medicine. She suddenly approached me and asked how old I am, and saying that she needed a guardian. She is homeless, orphaned and her husband is abusive. 

She then approached the starbucks staff to see if they can bring her XXX Hospital. The staff was merely 17/18 y/o and look distressed and helpless so I offered my help. This lady showed me all her hospital bills, passport, birth certificates etc. To my surprise, the bill states that she has mental illness (not sure what), been abused before and has been to the hospital several times. She was just discharged from Hospital A today. So I called Hospital A to ask about her medical history and what not, and if they can if possible come pick her up? I called a total of 3 hospitals. Here's what they said. All 3 hospitals have her medical records btw.

Hospital A: I'm sorry I can't pick her up as she is not unwell until she needs to be hospitalised. Please send her to hospital B or C if possible. 

Hospital B: Mam, I can't send an ambulance as if would cost $100. If she is well enough (CLEARLY SHE IS NOT? DUH), she may come to the hospital by her self and a doctor will attend to her. If you wish, you can come with her but the wait is 3h long. (It was 10pm and I have work the next day)

Hospital C: Hi thank you for your call. We are unable to send an ambulance. You can get her to hospital B if need, or our hospital if need. 

TO MY DISMAY, the 3 hospitals actually hesitated and unwilling to take her in. Yes I know, she is not bleeding, do not need immediate medical attention, but is she not worth that concern? Left with no choice, I approached my neighbourhood police. GUESS WHAT. The dear police officer claimed that she has been around for months and she is "like that de la". And I was like, "so you're just gonna leave her on the streets like that?" 

3 hospitals, 1 police station. All disregarded her just because she is "usually like that", "cannot be helped". And we claim to have the best medical services. I was then reprimanded by my parents for being nosey and what not. Yes perhaps she is faking her illnesses (well I did see medical proofs and social worker notes to her), but does that mean we shouldn't help her? 

What kind of society are we in? How can a hospital demand that she is not sick enough to be hospitalised? THEN WHAT IS THE HOSPITAL FOR. C'MON MAN 

I hope those in social work major could help improve this situation and assist those with mental illness. They need our help as well.

During my orientation, I got a chance to experience hostel life by staying in one of the halls. Not bad. Nice bed. Nice surroundings. Just..when I went to the toilet to pass motion, I was faced with a lump of it in the toilet bowl. 

I didn't care much, flushed it and carried on. The next day, the same thing happened again. I was disgusted. Somehow, only my og mates and I used that toilet from our orientation. And I don't think they did it cos I was the one using the toilet more than them and I never see them in the toilet much. So who could it be? 

I'm really shocked that till now, in a civilised society, there are still people who do not flush.

 In response to this, no, not all doctors are into big bloody surgeries. Plus, we do need to go around in the wards, run clinics and it is NECESSARY to appear presentable. "Dissect and repair?" LOL you need to watch something more than Grey's Anatomy.

I (a guy here) was undergoing the health check-up that everyone had to go through before official enrolment into NUS. At the urine test stage, I was told by the lady in UHC to just "follow the arrows on the ground" to the toilet, and so I did. I followed the arrows on the ground, went into the toilet, and went straight for the cubicle to collect my urine sample. It was only after I was done that I realised three things:

1. The walls are pink
2. There was a bin for sanitary pads in my cubicle
3. There were female voices entering the toilet

Lo and behold, I found myself in the most awkward situation I'd ever been in my entire life: a dude stuck in a cubicle within a female toilet that was filled with girls

After what seemed like eternity, the toilet was finally empty again. I quickly walked out of the toilet as fast as I could (while holding a cup of urine in my hand), only to bump into two screaming girls as I opened the door.

I'd since graduated two years ago, and this remains as one of my first and most embarrassing memories of NUS. I still don't know who those two girls are, but if you're reading this, I'd like to clarify that I'm not a pervert.

Before I say anything, no offense to both doctors and engineers. 

Just a random question. Why do doctors have to wear until so nice? They all aspire to be in the operating theatre handling some big surgeries right? Then they will wear the blue or red outfit, making their appearance plain and ordinary. If that is the case, then wouldn't wearing a polo tee or a t shirt be sufficient? 

Comparing a doctor's job and an engineer's job, they are somehow identical. They dissect and repair. So why the vast difference between appearances? Engineers get down and dirty with their repair, and so do doctors with the blood and all that. Maybe it's the culture in the faculty perhaps. 

-
 
Can i just know. Is it me or is there someone else who will like this and watch it just to make you feel better, that you are not the only engineering failure.

As the distractions of the world fade away in the darkness of night, and you wait silently, fearfully in bed for sleep to take you, the weight returns. It slowly sits down on your chest, weighing it down, and seizes your mind. It reminds you of the feelings of helplessness in your life, the loneliness, the sidelong glances, the slow laughter and biting fists. You wrap your blankets around you, and tighter still, but the cold persists, lingering. The fear freezes your blood, and you dread the morning, the light, the people, the routine. the emptiness in abundance, the agonising pointlessness of it... It is tiring.

And yet when the dawn arrives, you decide to fight. You see time for what it is - the potential for hurt, but also the potential for change. You dig deep and recall, the dreams of a life that you once saw you would have, the joys you would know when you step into that world. You push, inch by inch against the weight of despair, and roar in fierce indignation, defiant against the judging eyes, against fate. You would not settle for this. This will not be the end. You would write your own story, not others, not anyone but you. The weight disappears in a flash. It paces silently, out of reach, but never really gone. And you know that you would have to fight again.

I met this guy today while walking towards medicine after lunching at kopitiam. He was quite good looking and most importantly, he was kind. I dropped my notes and they started to fly all over. But he was the only one who stopped and helped me to pick them up even though he was carrying bubble tea. I dint ask for his name cause he seemed to be rushing for time. The only thing I remember about him was that he was carrying a brown bag and was wearing a nerdy glasses. Thank you kind soul! Hopefully I can still see you around again!

I have a question for the ladies here, what would your response be if a guy inform you about your wardrobe malfunction? There was once where the back of the girl's skirt was up and i wanted to inform her (we were near the corridors of the toilet) but hesitated for a few moments - thought i might be called a pervert and of course she realized and adjusted.

Male toilets in NUS vary in "quality". Some are clean, air-conditioned and lightly scented, while some are incredibly dirty, smelly and revolting. 

Good toilets:
1) Sci faculty LT32 building (upper levels)
2) Biz mochtar riady building (upper levels)
3) Arts AS7 shaw foundation building

Horrendous toilets:
Nothing beats U-town toilets. Toilets there are absolutely stinky; basins contain disgusting food remnants; door knobs are stained; toilets bowls reek of urine/shit smell during EVERY VISIT. Oh, and if you are gonna take a dump in utown, be sure to check for toilet paper first.

Sorry this may not be relevant, but none of my friends are really interested in Pokemon or have played any of the games as far as I know, so short of me annoying everyone to death, I'd have nobody to tell this to.

I miss Pokemon so much, it's like a really big part of my childhood.. Though the only game I ever played was Pokemon Ruby, and I still remember the day I first got it and all the excitement I felt. (Thank you parents for buying it for me!!) 

I recently listened to the soundtrack again, it has really lovely music :') For anyone who feels the same way, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVrb7X134Hk here's the ending scene and credits. The (beautifully sad) ending song starts from 1:52. I feel like my heart breaks a little every time I defeat the Champion and watch the credits roll and Brendan/May cycling along the grass by the seaside, and all my Pokemon appearing onscreen one at a time as if to say goodbye...it just reminds me that a beautiful journey has come to an end :'( (although I never officially completed the Pokedex or anywhere close)

I still vaguely remember planting berries in the 'loamy soil' and forgetting about them after awhile.. and getting funny items for my Secret Base. and hopping around on the Acro Bike; pacing around Lavaridge Town trying to collect enough volcano ash for a Poke Flute; having my heart skip a beat whenever 'Oh! A bite!' appears while fishing..
It probably wouldn't feel the same way if I play it again now, I suppose. And I doubt my GBA is up for it either. It really was fascinating back then :')

Sorry if I've been silly/melodramatic, hehe. Sadly I doubt I'll ever outgrow Pokemon. I miss you, Blaziken.

I am a building in NUS that everyone has been to. 

I am a building that makes people emotional.

I am a building that saw some of the greatest champions being born.

I am a building that saw some of the greatest minds being tested.

I am a building that students will flock to me in thousands.

I am a building where epic life decisions are made. 

I am a building that is part of your university memory.

and I am a building that you will not see again after this.

Thank you for your contribution.

So I'm gonna try something different.

Here's for everyone who is feeling sad, empty or unloved. For the rest of this week I will be sitting on my own at the top floor of the central library, and at 1230 sharp I will get up and leave for lunch at engineering or science. Here's the deal: if you would like to talk, say hi, or have lunch, you're more than welcome (and lunch is on me). I don't judge, and there's nothing too mundane or too embarrassing, or too geeky or weird for my sensibilities. Everything you tell me will stay with me (even if its criminal or shocking).

How do you find me? Look for a tiny pink teddy bear clipped to the corner of my latop screen.

Ever since that incident that happened 3 years ago, I made a vow to not consume any alcohol for the rest of my life. I haven't enrolled into NUS then.... It all started at a JC class chalet. I participated in a drinking game which I will regret for the rest of my life. Being a weak drinker, I easily got drunk and my friends have to carry me up to the 2nd floor bedroom and placed me on the bed. I can recall that my friends left the room and close the door afterwards. My worse nightmare is just about to begin.

The perpetrator is my JC classmate Alex ( not his real name) ,whom I'm not really close to. He came back to the room after awhile and started to undress me, he then proceed to lick my nipples. His actions really freak me out! I wanted to scream and push him away, but my body simply won't obey my commands. My head felt dizzy and my whole world is spinning. Deep inside my heart I kept on praying that this is just a nightmare , hoping that it isn't real. It took me awhile to regained my consciousness. When I woke up, Alex isn't there anymore, this gave me a little hope that everything that occurred is just a dream. Hence I decided to make a trip downstairs to see what are the rest doing. To my horror, when i got to the 1st floor. I found out that everyone was sleeping like a dead log, except Alex. He was sitting alone on the sofa by himself. I gave him a really fierce stare, however instead of asking me why? He looked away immediately and didn't dare to look me right in my eyes. That's when I realised that everything isn't a dream. I got really scared and I ran back to the room and locked myself in.

I couldn't find the courage to confront him, even if I wanted to...I simply couldn't find any solid evidence.

Even a guy like me can be caught off guard and become a victim of sexual offense, This is why I advised you girls to learn to take care of yourself by knowing your alcohol limits.

Honest opinions guys, do you mind if a girl doesn't shave down there? The feminist side in me feels that girls shouldn't have to conform to the stereotypes of women (cleanly shaven, no hair) perpetuated in porn, yet deep inside I can't help but to feel insecure and unsure about how my boyfriend/husband will perceive of my body.

I have a crush on a hunk in NUS. Met him a few times when in utown. He is definitely a head-turner. Everytime I saw him, he was alone. He always have his wireless sports earphones on. He is quite muscular and always don a white t-shirt with berms. He also has an awesome hairstyle with blond highlights. Really a cutie. Anyone else saw him before or knows him?

Before the end of my last semester in NUS, I would like to make a confession that I have held dear for my whole university life. This always happens to me when I am in Engin, be it attending lectures, tutorials, doing projects, or having group discussions. Despite being warned several times by my friends about its negative effects on my health, my innermost temptation always triumphs. Today, is no exception as well. I succumbed. 

For the umpteen time, I couldn’t resist any longer. The wait was excruciating and I couldn’t control myself. A rush of adrenaline flowed through my veins as I rushed to open the door and saw my long awaited prize. Without hesitation, I unzipped my pants. It always feels so good though it still hurts so badly each time after the job is finished. But, it never prevents me from going back to you. 

Why do you have to be so spicy – my beloved McSpicy at McDonalds?!?!

I have graduated from school a year ago. But today, I took leave from work and went back to school and crashed an exam. Entering the exam hall 10 mins late, it was really exciting. I scanned around for an empty table and quickly plonked down into the seat. 

Throughout the whole paper, I was feeling super mischievous. Thankfully it was an MCQ paper and I randomly selected options in the paper. For some reason, the admin was lousy and they didn't check my matric card (not that I brought one).

Poor student who didn't turn up and kena my mischievousness. He's probably gonna get a bad grade at the end. But better than an F right?

All the doom and gloom over finals and the whatnots, how about something more lighthearted. If you find the crowd slow to disperse after finals, especially for those on the higher levels of MPSH (i.e. MPSH 2), there is an exit door at the end of the hall which leads straight down to the basketball court area. This saves me like a lot of time!!!

I miss Princess the Biz/SoC cat so much. Since Year 1, I have played with it, fed it, and patted it to my heart's content on countless occasions. I even have a 1TB hard disk full of its photos and videos. Now my favorite campus cat is gone. Nobody knows where it has gone to or what its fate is. I am so sad about this. If you have taken the cat, please give it back.

I find myself eyeing the Indian (as in legit from India) students (especially those with facial hair) these few days, whenever we're all gathered outside waiting for exams to start. Sadly I think most of them are in computing or engin so I don't get much of a chance to meet any of them. 

This is not a troll post! If you've figured out who I am,don't tag me though. Or I'll kill you hahaha. Unless you have a cute, single Indian male friend to introduce to me. Then we'll see. 

P.S: I'm Chinese.

Those who know the anime:

"Great beast of the sky, please hear my cry.
Transform thyself from orb of light and bring me victory in this fight.
Envelop the desert with your glow and cast your rage upon my foe.
Unlock your powers from deep within so that together we may win.
Appear in this Shadow Game as I call your name,
Winged Dragon of Ra!"

If only...

I've read so many stories on confessions. Since it's only a few hours before my last paper, I, too, have a confession to make.

I saw you since the first day I came to hall. You were with a girl, and I was drawn to you from that instance. I kept my demeanor for fear others might know. And ever since that day, no matter how hard I tried, I literally couldn't get you out of my head.
I think of you in the midst of revision, during the late nights of last-minute reports and assignments, and even during weekends, when I'm alone in hall. I think of you during class, when I'm on the street, or even at nights before I sleep. You are so popular, almost everyone in hall knows you. I was too insecure of my own body, and I started becoming a health nut--going to gyms, running in the mornings, avoiding suppers...and deliberately staying away from you. Sometimes the temptations to get close to you are too strong, and it was hard for me to fall asleep, but I did anyway.

Tonight is the night that I had the courage to finally approach you. My self-restraining mechanism stopped functioning, I think it had broken down because I've used so much of it during this exam period. I couldn't take it anymore. I need you inside me.

Tonight, at 12.00am, I picked up the phone, dialed the number, and said :

"Hello boss, butter chicken and garlic naan tapao ok?"

I must say, after 2 years of staying in hall and consciously staying away from you, my life is, finally, complete with you, the glorious al-Amaan's butter chicken and garlic naan.

NUS should ban the " Traffic Light" game during orientation camp. What evergreen, green, red , amber nonsense??Firstly, I'm colour blind and I always beat the red light . Secondly im a reckless driver,when I get high...I simply bang down that traffic light =) 

A shout out to all the girls out there! Your colour doesn't  matter at all, I'm still gonna hit on ye . Wink wink ;)

Probably, we were not in the same exam hall coz this happened on Wednesday. I hadn't had lunch before my 1pm exam. My stomach was growling so loud until everybody look at me and giggling for almost 5-10 mins, worst thing the invigilator wrote to me at the end of exam, "Please have your lunch first before exam kay!"

PS: I thought last Friday was Labour day? So no exam rite?

PSS: it is my weapon to distract others MUAHAHAHA. Okay, just kidding.

My girlfriend wants to wait until marriage for sex, what do I do? Its the 21st century man and I don't even have herpes

This is our tragic love story. She appeared in my life, when im a evergreen noob, who is always wondering how it feels to be love by a girl. I appeared in her life, when she is wondering how it feels to be love by a guy. We are like north pole and south pole, I remember the first day of school when we crossed our sight at LT, both of our face turned red like apple. I couldn't forget her after that incident, until one day I garnered enough courage to sit down beside her during lecture and started talking to her. I kneel down in front of her 2 months later and asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. 

Our relationship was a fruitful one, we never have any big quarrel before and we spent many precious moment together. I felt like the happiest man on earth when we went to bed. Getting a Korean girlfriend is like hitting the jackpot for a evergreen guy like me. Yeah, she is a North Korean citizen.

However, all these happiness are short lived. She disappeared from my life completely and till today I don't know if she is dead or alive. There was one night we are cuddling in her residence when her hand phone rang. She went outside to receive the call. She returned minutes later with tears in her eyes. I was worried then because I have never seen her so broken before. I hug her tightly for hours and tried all means to ask her what happened, but she refused to tell me anything. She finally kiss my forehead before telling me she has to return to North Korea immediately.I accompanied her to the airport afterwards, both of us remained silent for the entire journey as she refused to talk to me, I had a really bad feeling then, I never felt so lonely in my life before.

Before she board the flight to North Korea, we hug for a very very long time. She whispered to my ears and thanked me for all the things that I have done for her and told me to look for a better girl. I got furious and I held her hand tightly and refused to let her go. She slapped me and told me to stop being childish, I couldn't hold my manly tears back any longer as I loosen my grip.  She didn't turned back anymore as she walked away, I shouted to her "Will you come back?", but she still didn't turn back and continued walking. The world around me descend into complete darkness, that is the last time I saw her.

2 years have passed, I'm still waiting, day and night, feeling so helpless as there is no way to contact her at all!! I will always wake up in the middle of the night feeling that i have been stabbed in my heart . Whenever I looked into the mirror, I noticed that I have aged quite abit....

Hyon-suk! i really really missed you! I will never ever forget you and I will pray for your safety.

I did the same thing to my room...

referencing back to the cheerleading team at utown, how can it be that the guys dont enjoy catching the girls when they fall? you literally hug them and get thanked for. and do only buff guys get chosen into the team? (time to hit the gym :O)

This happened last Friday during one of my finals.

It was a 1pm paper. Usually, I will bring a couple of mini Mars bars during 1pm or 5pm papers because even though I try to eat something before the paper, I might still get hungry during the exam itself. During the course of this paper, I kept hearing the growling of the stomach of the person sitting in front of me - it was apparent that he didn't eat much before the paper. After sometime, I decided to tap the back of his seat and offer him one of my Mars bars. Unfortunately, one of the invigilators saw me and told me to cut it off and continue my paper. The guy's stomach continue to growl throughout the rest of the duration. Where is the love in NUS? Are you so afraid I can encode messages into a Mars bar? Every human has a right to eat when he's hungry. What if he collapses from hunger? A small act could have prevented this but no. We need more compassion in NUS. We need to think before we act. We need to listen first and understand before we judge. We need to learn to love each other because only then can society progress forward.

#Examwoes

Students are like cups: Some are full of water. Some are half filled with water. Some are empty of water.

And come exam, I like to think that I'm not empty at all. I am filled with fluffy air.

I'm so fluffy I'm gonna dieeeeeeeeeee XD

JY for the rest of the exams ppl =)

You guys are right! I'm the troll that created all the funny and bitchy posts. I'm really happy that you guys are able to use my post as a channel to vent out all your frustrations by swearing or crying or laughing. In either ways, you guys get to relax during the exam period. I'm sorry that I have to keep my identity hidden, and serve you guys behind the mask. Just like Gotham city needs batman, NUSWhispers need a dark knight too. I'm the hero of NUSWhispers, The Troll Knight !

Cya next time! My pink batmobile  can't park here for too long, later kenna summon. Jane is waiting for me inside, she will pms if I'm late =)

It's disheartening to see so many The Ridge magazines being left on the racks. Hundreds, probably thousands of them, remain in their packaging months after they've arrived.

I see a lot of wasted potential there. And when I do open the magazine, it's pretty obvious why. Just look at the content choices and the presentation (design/layout). Once in a while, we find a gem of an article -- but it's rare.

It's time we made The Ridge relevant again.

这学期总算结束了。是挺漫长的一个学期，感觉上难免过于漫长了些。一直存在着的问题却由始至终没被解决。不是不想解决，而是无从下手，心有余而力不足。起初曾想过找你一起好好谈谈，让大家把话说明了，也许能够打破僵局，但却因顾虑丛丛而没有实行：当你心情好时不想破坏气氛，当你心情不好时又不想增加你的困扰。仔细反省一番后也觉得这么做似乎只是为了使自己好过一些的自私行为。

就这样一直静观其变、尝试寻找其他更好的解决方式，度过了整整十九周。算是一种坏习惯吧，自己面对问题时，倘若无法想出可行又有把握的解决方案，就会让它悬挂着，直到迫不得已…或者等待问题的消失。确实，问题现在该算是不存在了—把某种状况归类为问题意味着它需要被解决，并且有机会被化解，而如今，它却已演变成了不争的事实。

虽然先前也大概预料到结局会是如此，但心情中难免还是参杂了丝丝的遗憾、歉意与愁绪。表面上一直尝试着不在乎，也觉得不应该在乎，但又怎么能够不在乎呢？不管怎么样，最终还是想诚恳地为所有的一切向你说声对不起。

Screw you! and your "go dutch" nonsense! You wanna date me out, you jolly well pay the full price. Not only that!  you should be ashamed of yourself, for making me walk under the hot sun by using lame excuse like "petrol bills". Listen up dude, if you cannot afford to even drive me around, you shouldn't ask me out in the first place...  I told this story to my guy friends and they lamented at your lack of sincerity and manliness.

My boyfriend told me the most hilarious story the other day:

When he was a teenager he was hyper-sexual, like many teenage boys (and girls) I suppose. Anyway, he used to get pleasure from unusual tactile sensations, like lying naked in grass and things. One day he was in his family games room, and he decided to explore some of the sensory offerings in there. He took a cushion from the couch and put his dick in it, clearly this felt nice, because he mounted the cushion against the side of the pool table and started to have his way with it. All of a sudden his mother comes in the door which is on the opposite side of the pool table. She asks what he's doing in there, he tells her "nothing" and so she starts to have a deep and meaningful with him about how he's feeling about life and whether or not he's unhappy. The whole time he has to stay there pressed up against the pool table with his cock in the pillow until she finishes the conversation and leaves the room.

I am still shocked after ytd incident. Around 12 noon I was walking from YIH to the MPSH for my paper, crossing the tiny road before the bus stop.  And as I was right in the middle of the road, slowly and with my eyes carefully observing both sides (despite being heavily engrossed by the paper) someone drove past me at full speed with zero hint of slowing down. During that 1 second I could literally feel as if everything paused right there and stunned at the angry, accusing stare from the driver.
I could have been run over.

I saw these really nice ankle boots at a shop and was about to go in and buy them. My mum then stopped me saying that they weren't nice but I really felt they were really beautiful. A few moments of disagreeing became all out screaming from her in the corridor of the shopping centre. 

I was so sad. Why would I 'look like a hooligan' just by wearing ankle boots? I've always admired clothes that other girls have worn to school but when I go out to buy similar ones, I am often met with very threatening remarks back home, saying these are not proper and the threats tend to get much worse, to a point where stuff shatters (not by my doing) and tears are shed. 

That's why I am forever in bland jeans and shirts, even though I don't want to be. I am not any less of a good person if I wear fancy things. I want to look nice and pretty in my own way :(

10 years since NUSWhispers. I walk through the empty streets trying to think of something else but I always end up sitting here, in front of my computer. I stare at the screen for hours and try to summon NUSWhispers. I watch other pages and getting new memes but it is no good. i spam f5 in NUSWhispers and try to resist but it is all meaningless.
The end is near. Then I look on this page and cry myself to sleep.
-
 
Just curious...can you use one word to describe NUS?

Not sure if you are her.
I did say hi to you XX months back, I thought that you had chosen to ignore me completely.
Return a smile when I happen to walk past you next time?

Can people have the decency to put your phone to silent mode when you are in the library (especially when you are in the quiet section)? Every now and then you can hear phones ringing

The first time we looked into each other eyes, I saw my future. I love your curly hair. I remember there was once you let your hair down during ME2135 lecture, it was smoking hot. Can you do it again tomorrow at ME2114 finals? Sorry I can't remember your name but you are pretty tall. Thank you <3

To the girl sitting on the table besides me in sci library level 6 with a doraemon cover iphone, pls off your phone vibration. It is testing my patience with your phone vibrating for a full one hour (or more). I know that it is already turned into silent mood but putting it on vibration is very distracting too especially when it keeps having the "zzz" sound the whole time. Thanks

The event that I'm going to tell you guys certainly defy logic and scientific explanation however I'm not going to start  a debate on ghost, spirits etc. 

So this is my encounter....Ever since the age of seven, I'm able to see ghost. The older generation will call it "Ying yang yan". I will always pretend that I didn't see anything when i come across these spirits. Being in NUS campus for 3 years, i can easily tell you where are the "dirtiest" places in NUS. Im sure everyone know that there is a park beside CLB, otherwise known as the "couple park". Apparently it is also a favorite spot for spirits too.

 The most interesting one would be the women like figure that sits on one of the trees every Wednesday night. She is always staring in the direction of lvl 4 CLB, seems like she is waiting for somebody. Strangely whenever she is there, there will always be this white cat who will rest under the tree. I don't know what's their relationship. At times I really pity this women, ghost can be lonely too i guess....

Dear NUS students, could we appeal to everybody to help spot for a chinese guy of at least 1.80m tall today.

He's meaty (not muscular kind of meaty but the fat kind of meaty), fair, very short hair (3-4cm) and he's wearing a very distinctive polo shirt with the following combination from top down: white, light blue, light red/pink, white and a blue jeans. 

He's also suspected to be a PRC.

He took a upskirt photo of my colleague at the top flight of stair, right beside the Science Canteen, and we chased after him for a short while, at the foyer where the subway @ Science is. He ran towards the new building at the back and subsequently took a u turn back to the main road at science . The incident happened at 1.17pm today (29 April 2015) while we were on the way back to office after lunch. 

He doesn't have any distinctive facial features, and he's not wearing specs.

We have reported the incident to the Police and the Campus Security! We hope that someone would be able to spot him some where so that we can inform the security to check the cctv camera! 

Please help if you spot a shirt like that, it is very distinctive!

It's the exam period and everyone is studying. So my close buddy, my gf and I were having lunch at YIH food junction. We were catching up and all when this douchebag in a black shirt came over to our table and told my close buddy "can you please don't talk so loud."

My big question to him is "If you need peace and quiet, WHY ARE YOU STUDYING IN A PLACE FOR EATING?!?!"

I live in one of the colleges in Utown for the past 2 years and the view is still pretty good! Every once in a while and especially at night (2-3am), I would get visits by a whole bunch of insects and they like to hang around my lights and sometimes on my phone when its dark. These insects can range from lady bugs, moths and at one time, a common spider visited.  I think if I had caught all of them I can form a decent collection. Strangely, I don't feel bothered at all and I'm actually quite fascinated by their behaviours.

Except when mosquitoes visit. Screw them.

I am on SEP now and reading NUSWhispers really made me miss NUS. Feel like the culture in NUS is so much better. The people here are too arrogant and think they know it all but they are quite dumb and i'm pretty sure anyone in NUS can beat them hands down.

On a side note, I'm missing all the food in Singapore too! It's either fast food or overpriced and lousy Asian food here. I'm gonna start appreciating Koufu and Foodclique more. XD
-
  
It is the exam period, so here's a cute kitten photo for all!

P.S. Cat lovers unite!
-
  
Why the NUS internet seems to be frequently down ESPECIALLY at this period. Its not funny to press 'troubleshoot problems' in network settings 10 times an hour in a middle of webcasting.
-
  
My fyp supervisor asked for my name on the day I went to collect my work for corrections (there were none btw). I met him for a total of 6 times over the past 2 semesters for reviews. Should I be worried about my final grade?
-
  
Who else is dead for DSC2008 on Thursday? 
-
  
about computing guys.. we control the computer and we love psychology girls coz they give us something computers can't. not because psychology girls are pretty (most of them are skinny and small, sorry!)
-
  
I like pretending to be blind and getting a friend to escort me up shuttle buses during crowded periods. Thanks everyone for being so kind!
-
  
I am glad that after reading nus whispers I know that I am not the only one addicted to instant noodles. Yum 
-
  
A1 : Arriving... Anyone feeling frustrated ?!
-
  
Farted damn loudly in the study room. Acted like it wasn't me when the source clearly came from my seat. Too embarrassed to turn around. Even typing this is making me paranoid
-
  
So this IS dude started pointing at a bigger sized female in the canteen and laughing about her weight, claiming that she's "fat" and her butt was 10 times the size of his. Luckily she did not hear. Seriously do you soc guys have no EQ/social skills at all? (Making generalizations here, sorry.)
-
  
Can someone please do something about the smell at biz canteen? Seriously, what is that contraption anyway? It's giving such an awful smell that I can't even eat there anymore since its installation. 
-
  
There's this super cute girl in the UTown gym that I see every so often in the morning. I've never talked to her but don't want to feel like a creep and suddenly talk to her after she finishes her last set of squat. Do you girls think it's weird if some guy suddenly approaches you in the gym? I-I-I can squat 30kg but bench 120 kg btw
-
  
To hell with exams, torrent says that in 4 hours time, i'll finally jump on the Game of Thrones bandwagon and watch all 40 episodes back to back.

after experiencing finals for the second time, one advice to all: beware of fake friends who only take advantage of you and try to push you down the bellcurve =)))
-
  
 let me tell you a story i read yesterday: Once there were 2 twins named Lee and Ling. Lee wanted to change her name to Ving and thought her father would not approve. Lee and Ling went to court to change Lee's name, and Ling was holding onto the fee. Suddenly, their dad walked in and said: "DONT! STOP! BE LEE, VING, HOLD ON TO THAT FEE, LING!"
-
  
It always happens; the bulk of the types of question I did in PYPs never comes out in the exam while those I didn't did.
-
  
Know a girl who uses high tech bio-cheating device in exam. Straight As and Dean list. The device is implanted in her heart like Ironman.
-
  
Almost walked into computing male toilet coz I am too engross in memorizing my notes for exam.
-
  
I have seen this Indian girl around in school several times. She looks really pretty and is very kind. I have twice noticed her playing with stray cats and puppies on campus. She almost always carries a box of baked goods. I know nothing about her except that she used to date a boy from business. :/
-
  
I hate invigilator who walk up and down every time when people are taking exam especially male ones. Annoying. If woman, at least got nice 'flowery' smell.  
-
  
Why must the female toilet at COM1 level 1 have those weird cowboy doors? They almost smacked me in the face on numerous occasions as I made my way to the male toilet
-
  
Whenever I step into SOC, I feel like I am in Chinatown.
-
  
i think the way people dress in exam halls has an effect on the bell curve. as a guy i know its my own prob but it really sucks when theres a bunch of crop tops or lowcuts or the likes of it in your proximity. or worse still the invigilator. 
-
  
most of the medicine people that i've met/come in contact with are good-looking and mostly rich... and they have the brains too.. dayum some people just have it all :(
-
  
I have a crush on the instant noodles boy. He's such a good tutor to me for CS1020.
-
  
Good news: I caught a glimpse of my lecture eye-candy for the last time before the exam
Bad news: Now I will probably never see her again :( 
-
  
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because reading some posts on NUSWhispers gave me cancer anyway.
-
  
Watch out for the smoke alarm tomorrow at MSPH1-A, cuz that's where the EG2401 exam is being held.
-
  
Greatest paradox in my life: every freaking cell inside me knows how to code DNA, synthesize proteins, form organic molecules etc. But I don't, so I have to mug them.  
-
  
 Watch Taiwanese drama and copy the most acerbic one. You'll scare the living daylights out of your friend.

To confessions that required to be expanded, could you all try to summarize the content please. Tank queue.

to 

I have no problem giving up my seats to the elderly, or anyone who needs it. BUT, when I see an elderly (or not so elderly aunties) cutting the queue up the bus/train, and pushing everyone away just to get up first, I secretly hope in my heart that they wont get to sit. 
-
  
Disheartening to see some studies leaving rubbish behind in Central Library after mugging through the night. The librarians will be the one going around to clean up the mess on top of the daily routine that keeps that busy. They have long hours from 8am - 10pm. Let's take some initiative to clear our own mess and make their day a little brighter.
-
  
Just told a friend about NUS whispers and she said, "is it you go around NUS and go whisper to people in lectures or toilets?" 
-
  
I am one of the rare few girls studying in Mech engineering. Sometimes i always spot this guy wearing singlet in lecture showing off his tattoo. And to be honest i am quite starstrucked. But too bad i look so ordinary, i don't think he ever notices me.
-
  
Looking at my how my exams went, I think next time I'll settle for a job cleaning mirrors. At least it's something I could really see myself doing. 
-
  
Science canteen is always soooo crowded during meal times, with 5 faculties (whole of science, medicine, dentistry, nursing and pharmacy) plus the research and teaching staff. 

I always end up eating in lectures cos the queues are too long and there's no tables..
-
  
To the kind guy who found my phone on D1 this afternoon & walked all the way to my hall to return it to me, thank you so much!!! :') 
-
  
Always bumping into this buff and cute/handsome dude at fass but I never knew his name or major...... He carries a black jansport backpack, wears black flip flops and has a very cute smile, tag him please...... Just wanna let him know that I got really starstuck whenever I see him omg
-
  
“祝你好运！”简单的一句话，却由始至终没法说出口。只能在你匆匆经过又离去的当儿出示一副冷漠、视而不见的摸样。只因为害怕。深怕任何的轻举妄动只会对你造成更大的困扰。

也许该随它去吧。但随它去又意味着什么呢？难道就是放弃这段友情，持续在这比陌生人更陌生的僵局当中吗？或许是吧。当初是自己不珍惜并且违背了这份友情，至今又有何资格要求重建它呢？倘若站在你的立场，的确，像这种朋友，不要也罢了。这似乎是最好的结局。

虽然这么想、也一直尝试这么说服自己，但内心深处还是自私地希望着能够再次和你成为朋友。

Suddenly Eusoff so popular among girls? I shall join in too. Hey EH guy in braces, who's always in hall with the happening people, you're have big eyes and you're cute. Keep up with your smile.:)  P/S:你喜欢什么样的女孩？
-
  
i made an outward appearance of giving up my seat to the elderly/those who need it more but honestly... i really really don't wanna give up my seat for them,
honestly i feel that it's not compulsory to give up your seat for them, yes you can do so out of kindness in your own heart but i really don't see why it became compulsory to do so. compulsory as in lots of annoying ppl will stare at you until you give up your seat for them :( i have the right to sit down, i have the right to earn that seat by entering the train one stop earlier, i feel the pain of standing just as much as you do because my bag is really heavy and my body is not accustomed to standing for long periods of time, and honestly i really hope that ppl won't judge me for not giving up my seat because it's really an act that you do so out of the kindness in your own heart and not something that's done just because those ppl are entitled to take over your seat
-
  
I have a crush on a Eusoff stud but he's going SEP )':

I wanted to confess something but I forgot what I wanted to say.

"Even the restaurant in the middle of the FOE building is mainly catered to them."

Excuse me, have you tried the food? It's delicious and value-for-money! And you don't need to squeeze with the crowd at the FOE canteen. 
Xenophobia is annoying. I was born and raised in Singapore, in case you're wondering. 
-
  
How many brothers fell victim to the curve?
Rest in peace young muggers, there's a heaven for a U
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought I'd fail
My muggers, we the last ones left
But life goes on
-
  
I really cannot stand it. Everyday I dread myself to go for lectures in FOE.. Its like a mini ChinaTown. Everywhere I go, loud annoying slurs of chinese could be heard. Many PRc couples could also be seen PDA-ing during lectures like getting touchy feely all over and sitting right in front some more. Although I could try ignoring them, but its somehow so distracting and I get really annoyed sometimes. Even the restaurant in the middle of the FOE building is mainly catered to them. Whats this??
-
  
Exam tomorrow and I'm still watching dramas. Hate how I procrastinate.
-
  
I really want to drive to school because it's more convenient than taking public transport. I mean 10 mins versus 45mins by a bus that insists on catching every signal. But the car my father owns is not one that I feel would particularly endear me to my friends. (In other words: $$$$) Really don't want to look like a spoiled brat but I also feel like I could be more productive if I spent less time travelling. Caught in a dilemma. 
-
  
Hue hue hue im back at science library again! Lvl 5 this time round. Wow im surrounded by babes everywhere. Time to find out if any girl is peeping at me =)

-
  
I like the girl in the burgundy jacket sitting next to me, she always pulls weird faces to make me smile :)
-
  
I always knew my brother is into one-night stand but today, I just realised he is into prostitution as well. Some advice on how to get him off that please? I don't want him to bring some STDs home. 
-
  
Computing folks especially the guys are nerdy, skinny/fat, have poor social skills, poor dressing, poor presentation skills, poor writing skills and poor communication skills. I only see them sitting in front of the computer and watch porn. Why do they deserve 4K/month?
-
  
Any tarot card readers in NUS? I need a tarot reading. 
-
  
Everytime I study in CLB there's this high pitched sound on the 6th floor near the lift. As distracting as the sound is, what's even more distracting is I spend the whole day wondering what caused it.
-
  
Sitting in the front sure has it's perks when the examiners wear short skirts and bend over to count :P
-
  
i think the guy who got caught with his girlfriend's hand over his crotch and pants down at the library moved over to YIH to study... yet another good show
-
  
Nowadays before i start studying, i will watch motivational videos to get me through. 

Here's one that works best for me - "Why Do We Fall - Motivational Video by Mateusz M." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgmVOuLgFB0

Hope it works for you guys too! All the best for finals.

To the gal in the white army singlet (and her friend in blue) in the utown gym just now, I think you're really hot (:

When I see group slackers, I blacklist them. And then one day, I will creep into their bedrooms right at dawn, where they are still fast asleep in their guilty pleasures, and tattoo the words on their forehead "You are a life failure", with font size ranging from 9 to 72.
-
  
Why are there so much negativity in all the post that I have just read?

Let me share with you 3 events that will restore your faith in human. 1)Have you heard of the case whereby a man rescue a bird by giving the bird CPR? 2)Have you heard of the malay uncle that gives free hair cut to homeless people in jalan kelong? 3) Tyler the brave dog that stuff his foot into a crack of a damaged dam and save thousands of lives in a nearby village??

When everyone is talking about watching my little pony to de-stress, I would prefer watching Pokemon.

My mother told me that everyone has a beautiful side.

I guess I'm a circle then :(

gonna flunk CS1010E exam, probably will get C for a mod on C. got so many star here star there, my eyes also see star ><

One day I was walking to Techno Edge through the path (engineering drive 2) between E1 and EW1. There's this thing like a pump (outside of one of the workshops) that is enclosed by a cage of sorts. As I was walking past it I heard this little squeaky noise coming from within. I stopped and went closer.
"Could it be a bird that's nested there, chirping away?" 

These poetic thoughts of a little singing bird were then abruptly interrupted by a large gushing noise, right in my ear. 
A great deal of steam had just been expelled.
And that squeaky noise just before the release was most likely from a valve or the vent that the steam came out of. 
I had jumped practically out of my skin in shock.
A good 15-20 people just witnessed this. 
I continued walking like nothing happened, realising that common sense is truly the uncommonest of all senses.

Any advice for how an Indian guy can get a Chinese Girl? Or am I aiming my sights in the wrong place?

Noticed a cockroach in my canteen food but decided to gobble it up, thinking that the protein boost will also boost my brains for the upcoming finals.

I am at YIH study room now and trying to spot the couple HAHAHA
-
  
 I can be free if I don't need to study so that I don't need to work so that I don't need to support you when we get married. Oh and please don't ask me to pick you up from NUS and drive you home at Bukit Batok next time as I stay in bedok so I can have more free time to entertain your text messages without risking my life by using the phone while driving.

I like Indra :(

We have a friend, he is addicted to eating instant noodle.

GG. Night before exam but webcast has no video. Only audio.

, your bf belongs to the dump.

I know that you guys are gonna judge me after reading this post.

I have a ES mod tutor who is around 40 plus year old. Her facial features and complexion does not reflect her true age.
She got really good fashion sense as she always dress up nicely for lessons. I couldn't look at her right in the eyes whenever she ask me question in class, because she is too beautiful and intelligent. I felt inferior to her....

I always look forward to the 4hours ES lesson per week and i will never fail to chop the middle front row seat. As the semester ends I feet depress as these precious 4 hours is reduced to 0 hours. 

I know that she is already married with children, but love is a feeling that cannot be controlled. She's my DIVA, so close...yet so far...
-
  
To the couple in YIH Study room. Please maintain yourself and keep your volume of noise during your "touching" sessions to the minimum. The one who happens to sit next to you can totally see where the girl's hands is going on the guy's legs.

Was watching Teletubbies at PC commons to destress when an Angmoh hi-fived me. Wtf?

Anyone knows an Amanda from Science? Year 1, Life Sciences. Met her at UTown last week and she challenged me to find her on Facebook.
-
  
This place is filled with stories of people having sex in halls. Is NUS too stressful or what?
-
  
The moment I found out my girlfriend was going to the U.S. to do her PhD, I ermmm... celebrated with her with a moment of intimacy... except that the condom tore.

 I'm in the same boat as you. :'(

i was the one who stole one of the snickers from the bag of chocolates during gem2900 lecture muahaha

This one time I saw a couple having sex in the hall cos they left their blinds up. The girl has damn fine body and she swallowed.

Now every time I see her in the hall I can imagine her naked.

Last sem, I was in my hall's communal hall buying supper when a guy pulled down his friend's pants out of the blue. He wasn't wearing anything inside and had his hands full with food.

I am pregnant and my boyfriend doesn't know it yet. There was one night we were doing it in the hall and he didn't wear a condom...

I went to see a gynae and she said I have to decide whether to abort the child before next week or it would be too dangerous. I can't decide on it and I don't want to upset my boyfriend during the exam period....

I hate it when people ask me what I'll be doing in five years time. Come on, man. I don't have 2020 vision.

Not kidding you. We just don't like cats as much as we like dogs and gossip. If you share something juicy, I guarantee you your confession will get more likes ;)

I was studying with my gf and some friends at the library the other day. As studying was really boring, i decided to take a break and moved my gf's hands to my thigh just for some fun. So she started rubbing my inner thigh and that area and i got really excited and hard. Since our table was at a corner of the lib so i just unzipped to get a breather. Just while i was getting some more excitement, the cleaner banged on my table and asked us to get out and some people turned over omg -.- much paiseh and now i dont dare to go back to the same spot 
-
  
To the cute petite girl at science library lvl 6. I know you have been secretly peeping at me for the past 2 hours. When i looked back at you I noticed that your face turn completely red. Today shall be your lucky day, I'm coming over soon to ask for your number =)

Be prepared sweety..... hue hue hue

 None win. Broken parts and oozing wounds.

Hi I have lost my favorite jacket two days ago when I was walking from central lib station to engin in the morning. The jacket is Adidas brand, design similar to the one below. Anyone happened to see it ? I could not get a new one coz the store no longer got this version .... T.T really heart pain

I secretly print out all of my essay submissions, whether they turn out to be good or bad, and store them neatly inside an a4 file.

It's like having children, okay. Some of them were well-planned beforehand, others involved nights of hair-tearing and regret in the morning. Don't mess with my babies hor.

To the girl at the Science library 6th floor, turn right from the after coming up the staircase:

Thank you very much for hogging the ENTIRE table that is meant for 8 people just for the 1 or 2 of your friends. You had just brought table hogging to a whole new level. I was so tempted to ask you whether you are selling the things you 'displayed' on the table.

Is there a scarcity of Milo in the world? If not, then why do almost all the vendors on campus give you more Ice than Milo, when you ask for Iced Milo. And if you request for less ice, most of them get annoyed while some say the'll charge extra for less ice. Lol.

 There used to be a bolt cutter I know. He's making his rounds on NUSWhispers now. ;)

P.S. I am not a bolt cutter. But he is, and is, good. ;)

There's this girl from NUS HSS/Hist that I've liked since years ago. She's small and cute, yet so hardworking. I can never seem to forget your beautiful eyes and blushed face. I think we had a chance, clueless if we still have one now.Miss you

can someone tell me who is the girl who drives a red ferrari in SDE?

I really don't feel the pain of a non-Computing student who is searching for an empty seat in campus. My advice: Find a Computing friend and you'll have access to 24/7 air-conditioned study environment at L1 and Basement. No need to fight for seats, there are plenty around here ;) -- We also have shower facilities nearby, a nice student lounge for you to take a nap, and a lab with printing facilities that is available any time of the day. So what are you waiting for? ^_^

Those complaining about people reserving seats in study areas, please grow some balls and stop being a keyboard warrior. You can dump their stuff to one side, if they ask just point to the no reserving sign. No need for drastic measures like sterilizing.

Dear Miss Librarian hovering at the counter of the Sci Library, I'm terribly sorry for mistaking my ezlink card as my matric card when I left the library and I apologise for troubling you for the immense inconvenience of pushing a button to allow me back in, but you don't need to blackface me and keep reminding me how I ought to know the rules, even instructing me to retrieve my matric card upstairs and return just to show it to you. It's my first criminal offence, can you please chill?
-
  
Grrr no vulgarities allowed... Anyways... This very awesome girl that must have been very desperate moved my belongings away at The Study when I merely went down to PC Comms to get my stuff printed. When confronted, she just kept repeating "no reserving". It hasn't even been 15 mins gal! You thick skinned woman. People around probably heard my raging after that lol (not in her face though). The competition is real guys. She better not be seen going to the toilet or to lunch hahahas, else her stuff when be gone too. I don't even want the seat anymore tsk.
-
  
To , I'm the same guy in . Just wanted to say that this helped me assure myself of what I was trying to do. I stay on campus, and she doesn't. I've been hanging out with my floormates, studying with them and eating with them. It does help, especially around this time, where I can't afford to be distracted.

Thanks :)

NUSWhispers has became NUSComplaints. So many people are stressed up and complaining about not getting a seat in study area.

Stop complaining and if you think you can't get any seat, go somewhere else and study.

During this stressful period, just remember to keep your head up.. An old song to accompany your study period.. :D

To that asshole who choped seats with a packet of tissue papers in CLB, here's 2 numbers for you: 64752512 if you are male, and 62944050 if you are female. Please make an appointment to sterilise yourself. Dont contaminate the gene pool please.

This is ridiculous. Starting next sem can all the single guys and girls in NUS wear a green wristband or something to signal your availability and willingness to be approached? I think everything will be much more simplified. 

Somebody kickstart this campaign pls.
-
  
You know what NUS really needs? A street soccer court/ hard court for soccer. Or maybe even cage style. Handball courts are ok but if there's training then it becomes a problem. And we have way too many tennis courts. Come on man, we need a place to play the beautiful game.

Here is a quiz to warm up ur brains for finals :)

Hmm I'm sorry that you fell sick right before finals, but if you're sick can you just rest at home n don't come to lib? Your running nose n sneezes are really disturbing and the worst part is, it's very easy to pass your flu to others in such enclosed environemnt, be considerate please!
-
  
I can't help but laugh in contempt at the people who came late to study at the study area in utown. You think you can just stroll in at 9am expecting an empty seat waiting for you? If you live in campus, shame on you. Wake your lazy arse up early next time. I had to wake up at 6am to travel to nus from home.

If you are sick of food in NUS, there is a new place to eat near new engin building. It is like upgraded Dillys

I'm not sure what is the response to this confession.

I have a chio gf who is currently staying with me. Exam days are pretty stressful. However, there was one day that I could not take it anymore. I decided that I would go drinking alone, but I didnt expect to do what I have done next. I was quite wasted and high. I brought another girl back to NUS.

It dawned on me that my gf was in my room. But my fucked-up brain did not take that idea to stop what I did next. Somehow, the two of us floated to Central Forum. We chit-chat and got more and more touchy.

If my memory serves me right, I carried her to the staircase. I did something I will regret for the rest of my life.

We frenched heavily and one thing leads to another, we shed all of our clothes. We went intimate. I entered her while standing up facing the isolated staircase. I cheated, big-time. I still regret what I have done that day till now. Worse still,I couldn't even remember what is the name of the girl.

We did it without any rubber condom. And fuck, I dont even know if I pull out or I am waiting for a random call in nine month's time.  

At least, in that delirious moment,my fucked-up brain has the bright idea to call a cab and pay for her taxi ride back. I just stuffed 30 bucks to the driver, begged the confused uncle to send the girl home and walked back

A few days later, which is now, I am overwhelmed by guilt. I can not see my gf eye-to-eye anymore. And also I definitely don't want to pass on any possible STD that I might have gotten to her. I can't answer when she asked me why I am so cold to her these days.

What should I do? My gf is preparing for her last exam in NUS and unlike most ppl, she has a chance to pull her honours level up. I am very scared that if I told her, she'll be so shocked that it will affect her study. But I really want to let go of this guilt. It is really affecting my studies now and I have five more written exam to tackle.

Fml, seriously

I wish that every library has a power socket at each seat like the ones at med lib. Then it wouldn't be so packed all the time around the mugging periods. Come on, its really annoying when I have to borrow a textbook from the med lib and bring it to sci lib just for a seat.

During the health screen before being accepted to NUS (2011), I actually chatted with a girl going into FASS and clicked with her a whole lot. I asked for her number and surprisingly, she gave it to me. However I didn't have the courage to call her. I wonder what would have happened if I did.

In response to ,

Well, its not exactly the best place IMO. Single beds get really boring after a while when you can't move around that much. Add in having to keep the noise down and the walk of shame after "the event".

That being said, its undoubtably the best place for a broke college student

Dear people who take the shuttle bus: If you are sitting down, please, for the love of all that is holy, open the air-con vent ever so slightly so that the cold air can flow out even if your buttocks are freezing themselves off (in the hot afternoon bus, somehow). The cold air in the system isn't going to flow sufficiently out of those tiny little vents in the ceiling. Do your fellow NUSmates standing in the aisle a favour and lower the temperature, and the next time you end up standing in the aisle, you will thank those sitting down too. #PSA

PSA to all those studying on campus... Don't be that irresponsible jerk who leaves your stuff all around the place. I understand that you want to keep a place for yourself but you don't come sauntering in at 1130 when your things are here taking up 3 seats since 7am.

I'm not telling everyone to fool around, but what I'm trying to say is to not judge a lock by the number of scratch marks on it. I feel that all locks were made with a matching key and one day, this key will show up and everything will fit like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

It was already nearly midnight when my bf and I went back to our residence. The mood when we walked into the lounge was intense: all the students present had their brows furrowed, lips curled and eyes staring intently at the screen; as though their expressions of angst would intimidate whatever it was that they were doing to become easier. Fingers mashed away at the keyboards and mice as they furiously worked on whatever godforsaken task that they were damned to complete at this final hour. 

I voiced my thoughts of pity aloud "These guys must have it rough....rushing for a project all the way into the night even when it's already reading week?" 

Only to have my boyfriend correct me right away "Nah, they are just playing dota"

Indeed it is Mee pok.

I almost killed an entire bus of people. 
Here's how my story goes. It was a normal weekday. Like any other. I finished school at 3:30pm and I went to the Science bus stop to take D2 to Utown. When the bus came, I was like "YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME. SO FULL." I managed to squeeze through the front door (thankfully). I was squashed to the bus driver's left hand side. And for those who are observant, there's a small opening and space on the left hand side of the bus driver's seat. More importantly, THERE WASNT ANY HANDLE FOR ME TO HOLD. I struggled to maintain my balance. Obviously. However, when it came to the first roundabout, the bus tilted SO MUCH that my first reaction was to stretch out my hand to grab something that could prevent my fall. Unfortunately, that thing I subconsciously tried to grab was the bus's STEERING WHEEL. FORTUNATELY, I REALISED what the hell I was doing and I withdrew my hand. My whole weight squashed some guy behind me. Well, better than killing everyone in the bus right?

Its been a year of uni life. Being in hall has opened my eyes to many different things that I really didnt expect myself to catch first-handedly. 

Firstly theres the rumor grind. Word has it that gossips and general opinions about a person or actually anything spreads at the speed of wind. Personally, I have a friend who is a victim of bullying and hate. Really detest how things work in hall and how fast impressions are built. The "family" facade builds a certain hall or block "culture" and really, through it all, only accepts some and makes others fade away. The light verbal hazing from people who have no rights to do so, thanks for opening up my eyes. 

Secondly, how the world works. It is a rude awakening and a very fruitful lesson to the outside world, got to admit it.. But I just want to stay in and play before decades of fighting against the "forces" of people, who are above you in the hierarchy. Nothing in halls happen by chance. You are pulled in here, pulled in here. Whether you are liked or disliked, all these affects your hall life (in terms of blocks, levels, rooms, CCAs) ouch. 

Thirdly, the term "rabak". Every hall has its own group of party-goers and this is truly the scandalous and juicy part of hall life. Wednesdays, Fridays and even Saturdays, you can catch groups of well-dressed lads and ladies heading out and possibly coming back wasted or sober with their "catch of the night". The badly sound-proofed walls and doors have made everything much more transparent in the process...erm turnon or turnoff? Your call. 

Thats all Ive got to say. My two cents worth and take it with a pinch of salt because every hall is different. But really, before all of you scramble to get into the more popular halls, do think carefully..
-
  
i love you cutie pie <3

I think NUS students should get discounts for taking public buses to get around NUS. Afterall, sometimes the frequency of A1/A2 is just not sufficient to get be to lessons on time,  especially between lessons.

There is this extremely swagilicious girl who i always see around Utown. She's always decked in indie clothings. I LAV IT. For example, airy baggy long pants made from fine silk with printed elephant patterns  coupled with a casual white t shirt. HOW COOL IS THAT. She also wears sneakers and a snapback which i find pretty cute. She is basically chic. She is a little tan as well. One day, i will find her. And i will marry her.

Now,  if you plot the points of erc, src and the bus stop and link them up, you get a triangle. I looked at my watch and it said "10:00". NUS is 110 this year. 110 divided by 10 is 11. 11 - 1 (utown) is 10. Illuminati has 10 letters.
sometimes, in the shower,  I pretend I'm in an epic rainy finale fight scene in a movie and bath epicly
I'm Cheryl and I forgot my birthday again... can you help me?


I wonder what's the name of that tall (roughly 6 feet tall) and buff freshie from SOC.. Keep seeing him around COM1 and utown bus stop for the past 2 semesters:)
I am Cheryl. I lied about my birthday.
NUS NextBus is really unreliable. Always piss me off -.-

I lost my favourite card-holder pouch ): it's brown and has the word "Boracay" on it. Along with it, I lost my favorite ez-link card of all times, black and white minimalist design. If you've ever picked them up, please let me know, thank you kind souls )':
All the Male Muay Thai seniors and instructors are very  attractive ;)
This guy called kegan lim from yllsom is damn hot
Everyday, I'd ask myself: do I have time for a meal? The answer is no. 

This is the only period that I have to exercise discipline to eat regularly as a responsible act for my health. Aka FYP period.
So annoyed with the people using the study areas in UTown. It really has become RC5, where they just treat the seats that they've choped as their own.. And the stench of the towels at the rooftop study area, it's unbelievable that as university students these people have no shame and proper etiquette. I reached the study area at 8am this morning and there were no seats available, and instead of having students occupy the seats, they were filled with their belongings only. I would say that this is unfair, but then again, life isn't fair to begin with yeah. And I'm saddened to say these doings are by both local and foreign students. Hopefully you guys realize how selfish your acts are and stop such unsightly doings. It certainly does not help that you are university students. Realize the irony that you are gaining knowledge every single day in school, and yet remain ignorant about the simple and basic understanding of what its called to be a normal person that is brought up with proper manners and etiquette.
Is nobody bothered by the beeping sound beside graduate lounge in com1?
Growing fat because of the endless suppers :(
From time to time, Utown will sell these cute plush Sheeps. I wanna hug and buy them but I'm a guy and I'm buff )):
I accidentally got my big toe nail ripped off 2 years ago. I'm still keeping that toe nail.
I immediately develop crushes on almost every girl who talks to me for more than 5 minutes. WTH brain STAHP!!

Happy Sunday, guys and girls. Take some time today to reflect on yourself. What does it mean to be an NUS student? What does it mean to be a Singaporean? What does it mean to be you? What are you? Yes, what are you, exactly? What is that strange thing protruding out of your back, oozing out green slime and beeping every few minutes? WHAT ARE YOU??

More boys in Arts to wear tanks next week please!
It's the time of the semester again, when all of the utown study rooms are filled with a pungent smell. It's as if there were hobos camping in there.
More girls in arts to wear spaghetti strap tops and mini skirts please!
More boys in Arts to wear singlet next week please!
utown green is an excellent place for picnics :D


NUS CONFESSIONS IS BACK! THANK YOU MODERATORS!!!
There's this psych major girl who's like eurasian or angmoh mix or something. She was in my stats lectures in year one and I keep seeing her around. She's like so naturally sexy and she has this amazing brown hair and hazel eyes and I can't stop thinking about her. Sigh. I don't even know her name.
She belongs to a rare breed of girls: she admits she's fat, she even divulged her weight, she's a self-professed gastronomist and she's kinda slow-witted at times. It's these small behavioral quirks that endeared me to her, but I don't even have her number :( I've bumped into her quite a few times in campus already, and I can't help but feel it's fate making those encounters possible. Dear PF, hope you won't be taken aback the next time I see you and ask for your number! Sincerely, your secret admirer <3

I wish that there are more study rooms/discussion rooms. Really hard to find a space to study. :/
Anyone feels that NUSWhispers sound like a sanitary pad brand? Even the design schema feels like one!
The vending machines in CLB cheat your money. It's like some donation drive.
I wish recreational drug like marijuana was legal in Singapore. It would make life in NUS way more easier.

I wanted you to notice me. Sorry for being annoying in the process.
I gotta say it really sucks being an unfit/incompetent member of a sports club. I joined simply because I wanted to enjoy a hobbie but whenever I play badly (which is most of the time) I feel that I'm letting the coach down dragging down the team. My confidence has hit rock bottom and I've become so insecure about myself that I imagine others making fun of me behind my back. I don't feel like I belong in the team and I actually think about quitting every training before I disappoint my coach and captain any more than I already have.
I did not realise that finally doing something for myself would become such a sin.

Chem engin guys are hot!!!
I suddenly recall a girl in Chinese library who sit opposite to me. She was as gorgeous and cool as my ex, but I do not have a chance and courage to talk to her, shame:(
so someone wanted a sexual confession. here goes (;

it was 930pm early october at one of the libs. it wasnt too close to finals so there werent many people in the library. in my quiet corner there was only me and him. he had nice hair a chiseled face and some cute dimples. his tshirt barely hugging his slightly muscular body. i couldnt help but to eye him every few minutes hoping he would glance back. 

minutes later he caught me looking at him omg and i startled nearly fell back and he let out a laugh breaking the silent atmosphere. 

he then walked towards me and asked in his deep voice " hey you alright?" 

"yeah. im fine.... " i stuttered. 

his dark brown eyes looking into mine, i felt the blood rushing to my cheeks. i bit my lip hoping he would get the message. 

"wanna take a walk with me? " he gestured towards the door. 

we exited the library walking out into the night. it was cool windy and I had this really lifting sensation inside me. he was by my side and we walked on. he hadnt even asked for my name. 

we then stopped at a place enjoying the view while holding the railings. i looked at his face, his hair blown back with the wind eye intense as he surveys the external surroundings.

i felt a warmth on my hand. it was his. we locked gazes again more intensely this time. 

"this moment will never come back. lets make the most of it" he said. 

what happened next? dont tell you.

To the tall year 2 senior in sde. I've always wanted to join school activities to know you better and talk to you but I don't have the guts to. You look cuter in contacts than in spectacles too! 

Ps: you made my welfare pack collection better (:

From year 1 girl from sde
What a sad way to end my last semester in school, with my eye candy on exchange. No chance for one last glance.
"I feel all the beautiful girls in SOC are exchanged in this semester....... If not, reply this with your photo!"

Why don't you post your picture first? The beautiful girls in SOC are all very shy, they hide behind laptops after all!
Before I went on exchange, I look at my friends' photos on fb and thought that it will be awesome if at that point of time I could be on exchange too!  

Now that I'm on exchange, I sincerely wish I'm back in NUS. Missing my hall, the food and the place terribly.

This is the story of how my confession went.
MFW:


As i walked down the hallways of NUS Business School, my hair was whipped around my face as a guy dashed past me, probably rushing to a lesson. I let out a gasp of shock as he dashed past me, and I guess he heard it because he turned around and uttered a quick apology. 

Yet, all i could notice was those sublime features on that chiseled face; and that mellifluous voice which sounded as though each of the syllables he uttered were rolled in honey. Never in my life have i been so infatuated by such a guy; yet i could never really muster the courage to say hi even as i see him every now and then

So here's a confession from the deepest depths of my heart: Dear Shui Kun, i really really really like you (more than Carley Rae Jepsen does anyway). 

XOXO ~ your secret lover
Does anyone know how to use the newly installed induction cooker in PGP? The one in my pantry seems not working...
To the group of Indians playing computer games in Residence 3 of PGP: There are people studying in the reading room. Please be considerate about them. Keep the volume low please. Also, one girl who shouts while talking. Exam time coming up. You people should be more considerate. I am too scared to confront you big gigantic guys
Although you are stingy but as this semester comes to an end, it will be three months without you. You are dark, handsome but not tall. Let us work towards a Singapore of boundless love together. 

I will miss seeing you in school, Br**nann P***.
To the guy that doesn't have any hair at CS2102 lecture, i wonder how old are you...
I thought that my FYP is already very thin (30 pages), but still not thin enough to slot under the prof's office door.
Does anyone know if the noodle stall at pgp's open food court is still around?
I found 10 bucks at the deck today. Bought curry ytf with it HAHA whoever lost the 10bucks thanks for making my day lololol
So sad the Asian mini wok guy in pgp has left :(
THERE IS THIS SUPER CUTE GUY.... SAW HIM WEARING A TEMASEK HALL SHIRT THIS MORNING. THINK HIS NAME IS CASPER..... OMG wish I would get a chance to talk to him!!!

Hello people out there in nus! -from YIH level 4. 2.54am
I'm in hall now boiling some Venus navel pasta, and am starting to feel an almost phallic injunction to throw in some of my penne.
There's this guy from Temasek Hall pageant and is in computing! Wonderful to be his classmate.. If only we could grow closer..
Her name sounds very similar to autumn in chinese. To me, she's always a spring, regardless of the seasons, positions of the sun and whatnot. Too bad she's taken ):
Damn it senpai why won't you notice me

- love, your kouhai
I like how you blow a huge bubble with bubble gum and it bursts all over your face, because when you suck it back in it's sure to make your face cleaner because it would have caught onto stuff on your face like food particles or dirt.

(NUS student on SEP in the States!)


Watching bread rise is so therapeutic.. You all should try it sometime. #signsthatimtoostressed
I can't sing well. But recently I've been singing a lot and out loud in my room. The same song, all the time. 
Dear PGP neighbour, I hope you didn't hear me.
I went to a hotel with one of my closest friend in uni. But I gt so drunk I don't know what happened that night. Apparently, I was a terror when drunk. Now, I don't even know if we are still friends. :(
Isn't it Tuesday only? But I already feel so damn tired. :(


I see people grumbling about Hell Week this and Hell Week that. Truth is, every week is Hell Week for Engineering undergrads.
When I first saw you I couldn't keep my eyes off you. Hope to see you again, Yen Ling. :)
I needed a place to vent out my frustrations, my feelings, and my secrets. Thank you for being here once again.


To everyone graduating this semester, let's make a pact and wear costumes for finals! (I'll be joker)


I have this crush on this short-hair handball player. I always see her at the SRC. If I am not wrong , her number is 13. Hopefully I get to talk to her soon :(
I am so sick of the food in NUS. Ayam penyet, shui jiao mian, cai fan... What else can I eat... TT
I am so glad that everything will be over soon.
I found a $2 note at the Deck, near AS4! If it's yours, I will be donating it to some charity organisation. Good karma for finals.

I miss cheap food at NUS canteens after working full-time for two months after graduation
You. The one with glittering eyes and mesmerizing smiles. The sight of you makes me blush and swallow a gulp. God made everybody different but made you special. The day I spend thinking of you and the night dreaming of you. Moments you walked past I stole glances. There were times when you returned the gesture. I know that you know that I feel that this is magical. When circumstances permit I will tell you in person how beautiful you are. Till that day <3
I swear orange is better!


To that long-haired senior whom I first met at the swimming pool, with hair glistening from the splash of pool water under the moonlit night, I hope your hair remains smooth, long and curly even after being called up for reservice.
I lost a sack of coins with a key in it. 

Color: Black;
Size: Size of a tennis;
Location: Sheares Hall;
What’s in it: Quite a number of coins, and a small key to my locker;

Call me at 9346 6595 if you found it. Thanks so much!
