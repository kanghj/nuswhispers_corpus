Computers will never replace human beings because they are stupid.

According to the Chinese media, customers flocked to the Heweilai Restaurant chain in the southern Chinese city when it introduced robots last year, but the chain has stopped using the machines for a number of reasons. A staff member said the robots couldn't effectively handle soup dishes, often malfunctioned, and had to follow a fixed route that sometimes resulted in clashes. A customer also said the robots were unable to do tasks such as topping up water or placing a dish on the table. Another restaurant in Guangzhou's Baiyun District said robots were used only because of a high turnover of waiters and waitresses. "The robots weren't able to carry soup or other food steady and they would frequently break down. The boss has decided never to use them again," said one employee. The limitations of the technology were clear, says another. They added: "They can't take orders or pour hot water for customers."

I was on the bus just now. There was a frail elderly man on a wheelchair with his maid.  He looked at me, smiled and said in English, "Hello! Boy, you are very handsome!" I found it very amusing, so I laughed and thanked him. I really appreciate the complement and it boosted my ego. His maid who was busy using her phone probably didn't hear what he actually said to me. She most likely thought he was disturbing me, so she apologized to me and said, "Uncle here got dementia."  Oh alright, So I guess I am not that handsome after all...

Double standard is real! What most girls perceive as creepy suddenly becomes romantic/funny if she has a crush on you. How do I know? Let me tell you how I got my Girlfriend. I was by myself, drinking coffee at my own table and I stared at this girl's boobs. I must have stared too hard cuz she knew about it and came up to me. She is my course mate btw. She basically asked me why was I staring at her tits and I replied with "uhm...I thought my coffee needed more milk?"...and yea we have been dating for 3 years since then.

Hi pls don't censor this is actually quite a serious issue: 

Recently I've noticed one A2 bus driver being really reckless and ungracious? He never stops at the zebra crossing (I swear I've almost been run over by him twice outside CLB), cuts dangerously in front of other vehicles, and whenever students do really trivial things e.g. flag down the bus several steps in front of the bus stop or run for the bus he swears using the most colourful language ever (usually involving the student's mothers and the word "jibai" thrown in here and there). 

I'm not too sure if other students have had the same experience, but this driver is relatively pudgy, wears white shoes with red stripes, and looks like (to borrow a line from Deadpool) an ape had sex with an older ape. Any thoughts?

If anyone of you have found it, could you kindly contact me at 98237326!! Please help to shared, your kindness will be very appreciated

I know that for many guys, they have this "See boobs and like" mentality but it really annoys me greatly when girls post pictures with captions such as "oh look at my 22 inch waist" but have the focus and 3/4 of the picture is of their boobs or cleavage. Or advertising something when said object only takes up a small portion of your photo and the rest are just your cleavage. Like honestly honey, that is one way to gain likes but really? Have some self respect.

I had a really long day today and tomorrow is an early school day too. So I told myself this afternoon that I should be sleeping early tonight, but it didn't happen cuz my steam acct was online and my friend sent an undeclinable "4缺1" request. Now after several games, I am on my bed regretting it and doubt that I will wake up tomorrow for the morning lecture. And oh wait, didn't the same situation happen last week? The week before? Damn my life is on a replay. The vicious cycle never ends. T.T why do I have so many 损友s? Advice please!

Hey:) I lost my MacBook Pro 13 inch retina which has a marble design plastic casing (in a grey faux leather laptop case) at a female toilet in utown (the one nearest to foodclique) at around 6-620pm on Thursday 17 March. It was gone when I returned for it at 11+pm:( To the person who picked it up, I would really really appreciate if you could return it to the lost and found ASAP thank you!

Not trying to sound evil here but it really just happen. One of this guy in our project group just MIA for all the meet ups and discussion and everyone just forgot that he is in our group. After we submitted our report, we realise that we forgot to add his name and matriculation number. (Of course he wont have notice it and don't even know what is going on in the report). I guess this must have been karma.

I've got a unique habit that's been punching at me like a shard of ice flung at you in a blizzard, and I need to get it off my chest. 

When I'm feeling cold and depressed, I like to take out my sigil-patterned balloon, hide in my homemade white styrofoam ball, collecting things scattered nearby like my shoes and bags, and roll in the ball towards my homemade papier mâché statue of Doraemon, thereafter delivering a swift punch to his flabby belly. After that, all is well and I continue down my lane with newfound zest for victory and life in general.

Is it considered weird to have never gone to clubs before? I'm 25 and I have never stepped foot in a club. My friends keep on asking me to go but I am seriously not intrested.. I come home from work dead tired and all I wanna do is shower, eat and watch movies. I don't have enough energy to party until the A.M. 

Like is it soooo weird that I don't wanna go at all??

Why do people come for lecture just to play game on their tablet or phone for the entire duration and disturb people around them by talking non stop? Just cannot understand them. There are people who wants to listen to the lecture yo. After that, spend the same amount of time watching webcast at home. Doesn't make sense right? Might as well just not come for lecture at all. #commonsense

With respect to the recent furore over Dominique Sarron's death. This might be seen as a rather cold and unfeeling statement.

Honestly, all those males commenting you should know. Touch your heart how many of you followed the TSR to the letter? Just the basic half-water bottle full a lot of people don't fill it full in the first place and then drink down to half, and that's just the start! Armor vehicle on the road bash in at least 10m? Pshhh. Do what you want, just don't get caught eh?

DSL's death was an accident, and there was a breach in the TSR. But... put yourself in the shoes of the officers subject to the witchhunt. It's the end of the day and you overindented extra smoke grenades which you don't want to return to ammo dump(a common enough scenario). You've never even heard of zinc chloride allergy and even know that these men have actually gone through smoke grenade in previous training exercises(as stated in the mothers response letter). Could you have reasonably predicted that this would have happened? Without prior knowledge of this incident, can you really say you would have not done it just to avoid that bit of extra paperwork?

For sensitivities sake no one wants to approach a grieving Mother and say that "I'm sorry, your kid died because they wanted to avoid some extra paperwork, which was a perfectly reasonable decision at that point in time, so we didn't want to ruin another two kid's lives by locking them in DB"
Safety rules are written in blood and predicting every possible accident scenario before it happens would require omniscience or simply not doing anything at all and keeping soldiers in their bunks forever.

Let he who has kept TSR to the letter throw the first stone.

So today is 29th Feb. The day that comes every 4 yrs. Today I have a very... special(?) confession to make. Please bear with me and read it through if you do. This post was made in view of the recent sexual posts such as 'beneficial friends' and 'toying with yourself' . Thank you in advanced.
I just hit 20 today, (yes I warn borne today on 29th Feb) and I am the only child in the family. My dad is American and I have an Singaporean mother. I came back recently to serve my service to the nation and now, I am studying in NUS. (I enlisted early). Long story short, I was surfing facebook today and I saw one of those 'memories' post. It was a private status update addressed to me: "4 years in the future me, look back and recall what happened today. It was a LOAD to digest". And this I shall begin the main reason I wrote this post, my story 4 years ago:
So on my 16th birthday, I celebrated with some Singaporean cousins and friends. I mostly hoped around countries due to my dad's work so while it may sound surprising, I actually have mostly Asian friends. So the gathering was on the night of 28th, we drank (underaged, yes...) at home and got real wasted and a bunch of us started blabbing crap and nonsense. Amongst the spouting of nonsense came jokes such as [being old enough to wank] I recall vividly. Some of the older horny guys started watching porn together and had a challenge to see who climaxed first. I remembered being so drunk and collapsed before I got to this part so i didn't participate. I heard this account of events from another friend.
*DON'T FREAK OUT. THIS IS NOT A DISGUSTING WANKING POST. I WILL NOT SCARE YOU BY GOING INTO DETAILS*
The next day, my parents were out and I was alone at home.  (SINCERELY OUT OF CURIOUSITY], I decided to .....play with myself and..... explore my body for the first time. So I explored my (as the other confessor nicely wrote: Male Reproduction Organ). I vividly recall my thoughts back then now: (So if I rub it, cum will.... come out?)

And I made a mess out of my table.  And computer screen, And Keyboard. And pants, and stationery. And the list goes on.

Of course I freaked out. I recall using an entire box of tissues to cover my mess and I went straight to the showers, washed myself like a dozen times....

And tried to digest this new experience. Went on with my life that day. But this is not where the story ends, it is where it gets interesting.
That night, before bedtime, Dad came to me and wanted to talk to me. Long story short, I was so bad at cleaning up (always have been, even in Army LOL) that mum found evidence of my ...."mess". In my self defense I missed a spot. And Mum speculated. She talked to Dad cus she didn't know how to handle it and Dad came in asking "Did you jerk off today?". My look was a dead giveaway. (Well whatdaya know, it wasn't a long story.) And I shared everything, both thoughts and actions.

Dad spoke to me: Mum wanted me to stop because she doesn't believe it is morally correct (she is buddhist not christain )and that if I were to get used to (playing with myself), I will have some psychological disorder or something. (Don't see how that works out. Women, care to share your unique point of view? Or is it an Asian thing). Back to Dad: Well, basically he told me about how I came to this world, or rather, how I almost didn't.

Mum almost went for an abortion, and it was because they did IT on impulse. I recall what Dad said that night that made me learnt something new, something more about life. "It is not wrong to explore new adventures, so it shouldn't be wrong to learn about sexual experiences. Mum says you should stop doing this but as a guy I know how you feel. I may be a bad parent for you to know so little about sex but I also know that it could have ended up worse. You could have gotten someone pregnant, like I did. And I don't want you to end up like that."

In Dad's words: I don't believe in abstinence, but I believe in safe sex. And frankly, I would rather you wank yourself to death than get someone pregnant.

Now that I reached the end of this post, I am not so sure what this post is for... It ain't a "i had sex and it felt so good" or "i wanked and it rocked''.  It also ain't a 'Listen to me you wild animals who do it in the heat", or a "Since then I have turned into a goody goody two shoes"
But then again, this is a confession page. And I am confessing, while sharing, my experience. I suppose that if reading this posts, can stop at least one abortion, then it's worth my time.  The thought that I could not even exist scares to me hell in words that i can't even describe. Even if not, no harm trying and no harm sharing eh? (i mean, i didn't insult or sexually harass anyone. It is NOT my intention to, so I'm sorry if I accidentally did so)

Also, Happy 29th Feb Birthday to all peeps who share the same birthday as me. :D

Hello ! I am not female but I have had hair loss since Secondary school. Like you, my hair is thin and you can see parts of my scalp. 

First, you should go see a dermatologist. The dermatologist will help identify the causes of hair loss. Hair loss can be due to many reasons, such as genetics, disease, sensitive skin (usually to hair products) or diet. The dermatologist will suggest a treatment plan. 

Second, you need to learn to live with your hair! I know this is difficult. I had schoolmates, friends and dates point out or tease me for my (lack of) hair. But you must accept yourself because, if you don't, who will? But if you feel uncomfortable in the interim, I suggest wearing caps or hats. 

Third, you should stop the use of hair products that cause hair loss. Check with your dermatologist for a list. For me, I can't gel my hair. If I do, my hair will fall. What this means is that you cannot style your hair in certain ways unless, of course, you wear a wig. Also, for females, I understand that tying your hair puts strain on the roots so you may want to avoid that.

Weird fetishes? I claim to have one. It's quite silly, so let me just say this. I wish I was a dungeon master. I wish I had as many contraptions to test the limits of the human body. I wish I had whips, swords and spears to train my martial arts. I wish I had chains that stretch the limits of my imagination.

You see, I have a BDSM fetish. May I have your hand please? ;)

Today I got scammed by NUS COOP. I bought a Wifi adaptor and router for my mac. The router was about 40 and the tiny little adaptor cost 40 dollars. They told me that to make it work with the NUS network I have to pay a setup fee of 50 dollars. So all in all I paid 130 dollars for wireless connectivity.

Then I talked to my friend and I found out the router cost only 20 dollars and the adaptor only 10 dollars had I got it online or at Sim Lim! And the worst part, I did not even need to setup anything in the router. It's literally plug and play, all they had configured for me were my SSID and Security that's all! Got totally conned out of 100 dollars.

NUS COOP is the biggest scammer in NUS and should be investigated for corrupt practices. They are selling items to students, who already broke at exorbitant prices to make ridiculous profits at their expense. I bet even their textbooks are overpriced.

I know this is a long shot, but here goes nothing!
You came in like a day dream, as you walked pass me towards the MRT Signboard. You hit the right chord.  Decked in black trackpants and grey tank top. Your white cap was oh so apt. 
Your tanned skin, made me sin. As you pretended to ignore me, I really wanted to take you out for tea. It’s a pity our paths crossed so briefly.
You are a dream that really made me wanna beam. I really wanna meet you, don’t chu?

Hi guys, i am a lingerie addict. It started when i found a bra at the void deck. Being curious i picked it up and it stirred something in me. I brought it home and masturbated with it and that's how it started. I feel that i must say that while i have thought of being one of those people who steals lingerie from washing lines, i did a cost benefit analysis and decided it was not worth it. So now i just buy it in bulk online from la senza, Victoria's secret and agent provocateur. My addiction has gotten slightly out of hand now, with a huge lingerie collection (2 drawers and a huge duffel bags worth). I guess I am worried how i am going to explain this to my gf next time when we do get married. Maybe some of you will say i need psychological help, but personally i think that I am not hurting anyone, nor am i hurting myself, so is there really a need?

Remember we made a promise to go Budapest for our honeymoon?
I even joked that I will piggyback you all the way from Buda to Pest.

 Sadly, I'm no longer able to fulfill my promise. I used to be a muscular hunk. However, now I'm reduced to nothing but a living skeleton. Even if god is kind enough to extend my lifespan, I could no longer garner enough strength to carry you anymore. Thank you for putting on a brave front, constantly reminding that I will recover and telling me jokes to cheer me up. 

Walls have ears, I knew that you have been crying when I'm not around. However, I have no rights to call you a cry baby, because I'm crying when you are not around too. Whenever, you arrived at the door step of the hospital ward, the friendly nurses will notify me immediately. I will then, wiped off my tears quickly and pretend to be sleeping. I know my own body better then anyone else, it won't last for long. 

笨蛋！I won't let you be the one piggybacking me from Buda to Pest. My body might be fragile but I'm still the same Big Man with a Big pride 大男人! How can I let my little princess piggyback me.

When you read this message (or perhaps you might never even read it), I might no longer be in this world. I wish that a better man will appear in your life and give you happiness that you truly deserve. Even though I’m no longer around, you must continue to study hard because a bright future awaits you. Smile like you always do, be that same cheerful girl who rescued my heart from darkness. Before I close my eyes, I will take every bits and pieces of our memories into my grave. 

Image of you throwing tantrum and messing up my study table, during an argument. 

Image of you stealing away my first kiss

Image of you celebrating my 21st  birthday at esplanade

All the good & bad times, and many more.......................................................................................

Good bye my dear. If reincarnation is real, I will definitely come back to protect you <3<3

The day after Sem 1 results came out, my ex broke up with me. She was my first relationship. Fast forward to today, I'm unable to get over her and it’s affecting me more than it should. I still think about her all the time.

She moved on pretty damn quickly and found herself another boyfriend before the dust settled. Yet, here I am stuck in the past. I thought I might win her back but how wrong I was. She even confessed they have been sleeping together 2 weeks after we broke up.

In the meantime, I've just been bawling my eyes out.

I guess this song pretty much sums up how I feel towards her and her new man:

I've had a pretty bad crush on a member of the FASS PSSOC. I think she's really freaking pretty. She's a Sociology major with a smokin' hot curvaceous figure, lush lashes and lovely curly hair. I probably don't stand a chance with her anyway, but I just wanted to wish her a happy Valentine's day.

I'm a Year 4 Chem Eng student going to graduate soon. There is this girl in my course that I really like and she looks especially good when she wears stripes. I first saw her in Year 2 but I am too shy to approach her. Hopefully this valentine, I will be able to muster the strength to approach her and ask her out for a date. Then maybe we can go Nami Island for our grad trip heh.

When I was young, I often heard voices calling me to "go NUS" while I'm in a deep sleep. After waking up, I would tell my mum excitedly, "Mummy! I got the same dream again!!" and my mum would say, " Then you must get good grades lor" .This motivated me to study hard because I believed that I'm destined to end up in NUS one day. 

Recently, at a family gathering. My aunties asked me why I chose to study in NUS. Therefore I proudly told them about my childhood dreams and how it inspired me to strive for academic excellence in order to come NUS.

But FUCKING HELL! My mum who was sitting at the corner suddenly burst into laughter and told everyone, " Sha bi ! Actually I'm the one whispering beside your ears while you are sleeping."

FML! That's when I realised that my whole life is a lie and my mum is the biggest troll in my life.

I hate my family and this is just one of the many incidents which made me hate them. Last year, my 2nd sis (PL) initiated to bring to my mum to Taiwan for an holiday with my relatives. After some discussions, we agreed to share the cost among us children. The estimated cost was 1000+dollars and I volunteered to pay up to 800dollars and they will pay the rest. When everything was finalised, the total cost of the trip/pax adds up to only about 700dollars. 

Few weeks before the departure date, PL told my 3rd sis (KL) that she didn't want to share the cost because she had to pay for herself and her daughter. She  told KL to divide the cost between the 2 of us. PL told KL an alternative which was to was to let me for the entire thing since I said that I could pay up to 800dollars. PL said, "你们出钱，我出力." KL came to me and told me what PL told her. KL said that it's unfair to share between the two of us only and said that she has her own family commitment and was only willing to pay like 100dollars. To save the squabbles, I told KL that I will pay for the entire trip since it was less than what I  estimated. 

Another few weeks later, I found out that PL went to botox her cb face and KL bought herself a bloody brand new chanel bag. I too have my own commitment, such as the tuition fees for studying part time NUS. Plus, I already don't mind paying more for my mum's holiday. Their behaviours totally disgusted me. I'm not going anywhere this cny because I don't want to see their cb faces.

What is the point to have the "mobile phone chargers" in the campus and no one is checking them constantly and most of the lockers are empty but "in use". Maintenance is required, please.

I have friends telling me that I don't need protein powder to get buff. So everytime I spot a buff or muscular guy, I would always take notes of their water bottles. Most of the time, they are protein shakers.

This puzzling issue has been weighing down on my chest for 2 years and I honestly need to seek brutally honest advice without being seen as a "troll". I'm in Y2S2 of biz school and I feel terribly weird and different from my "normal" peers-- because everyone else says that one thing I can't understand : that they have "no time"; that they are "busy". 

I'm so free and I'm so bored that I have time to do a part time internship and handle 2CCAs but still have an unusual amount of time on my hands. From the bottom of my heart, I want ask, why am I the one and only weirdo with this much time, what is everyone else doing with their time? Is there something mysterious that they are doing, that I'm not?! 

Mon: 
10-12: seminar 
12-1: lunch 
1-4: seminar 
4-6: seminar 
6-7: dinner
7-9: endless mindless scrolling on Twitter and Instagram not because I am "passionate" in any way about it but simply cuz I'm bored out of my skull? 
9-11: watch movie on daily motion 

Tuesday: 
9-6: internship 
6-7: dinner
7-11: hang  out with Friends like ice skate or watch movie 

Wednesday: 
8-10: lesson
10-12: nothing to do so I go back to my old unhealthy ways of scrolling my phone. Gosh why is everyone doing something else far better? 
12-2: lesson 
2-5: lesson
5-8: CCA
8-10: nothing to do so I watch more YouTube videos? 

Thursday: 
9-6: full day internship 
7-11: CCA stuff 

Friday: 
8-11: lesson 
11-2: more lessons 
2-6: late lunch while walking/window shopping around Clementi Mall/ VivoCity 
6-9: CCA
9-11: nothing to do again so I head to any library and read random books. 

Saturday: 
 10-2: CCA
2-7: hang out with friends who aren't "busy"(what r they busy with our time table is so free) 
7-11: continue scrolling Instagram since I've no life 

Sunday: 
10-12: teach tuition near my house 
12-7: Window shop in town not because I actually love shopping but because I've absolutely nothing to do 
7-9: teach another student tuition 
9-11: back to Instagram and Twitter? Like wtf why is everyone else too busy to even look at Instagram I honestly don't get one bit of it. 

Listen, I need help. I need to understand what is the unsaid/unseen activity everyone else is "busy" with such that they sleep so late. Everyone has the same modules, the same time table. Why am I cursed with so much tine I can't get rid of? 

Please don't troll or joke by saying I'm a time machine. I am not one. And I've already clearly listed my schedule for everyone to take a look. What is missing? 

Can one kind soul save me from this depressing and scary darkness? Just someone who'll knock some sense into me?

You know the hairstyle where the sides of your head are shaved while your hair at the top is longer... is it called the undercut or something. Anyway it's been very popular the past few years, and a lot of guys around me have been switching to this hairstyle. 

I think it does look nice on some guys, but honestly, it doesn't really suit a lot of people. It doesn't suit you if your face is round or large, or has a long-ish shape, or your forehead is really high, etc. It fits on people with vertical temples, straight/wavy hair, and if the widest point of your face is at your temples. 

Of course, if you want to have that hairstyle, it is your freedom. Then my message doesn't apply to you. But if your goal is to look presentable and look "good" (whatever that means) with a suitable hairstyle that accentuates the good points of your facial features, please re-consider getting this hairstyle if it doesn't really fit your face shape. 

Guys. You don't have to follow trends to look good! Confidence in being yourself is sexy (-:

  THANK YOU !!! 
Btw it started from November not Dec .

Seriously the repair time is just getting ridiculous. If you're building a new gym then that's ok . But does floorwork repairing takes that long ?? Seriously it just pisses me off . I really like the environment and the equipment there so much that I prefer it more than Gymbox . 

Seriously OSA really needs to sort this out . If your repairmen are incompetent then u need to hire the correct people . The equipments has been outside for 3 months d . 
Gym is one of the basic facility that a uni provides . I'm just pissed that OSA doesn't take this matter seriously .

To the feminists who protest by not wearing bras in the RCs, I salute you. People need to learn that bare breast does not equate to sexual object and we should be able to walk around half naked like the guys too!! - your fellow feminist from SH (:

just some thoughts: those who always say " wa, don't spoil bell curve leh, so hardcore." "wa, good student uh..", " wa, you hardcore sia.." " eh relax la, i haven't even started anything yet" "wa you don't come spoil market". VERY FAMILIAR RIGHT? honestly, I FEEL these are the people who are the real hardcore people or closet mugger. during consultation or really near exam, these people(maybe some) bring the whole textbook, completed. who is the hardcore one? are you saying all those things to provoke people ?or trying very hard to convince or stopping them to work hard so that you can secure your A or something? if you are those who are not hardcore at all or don't work hard at all, you won't even comment on other people. it's absolutely annoying to hear this EVERYDAY. hardworking is a good thing and it became something bad because of all these people. seriously, A for effort (trying to pull people). F for hands-on (to pull people).
another thing, please like.. JUST SIT DOWN IF THERE ARE SEATS ON THE BUS LIKE SERIOUSLY others can't even get up the bus. if you sit, others can take your place. it's so amazing to see empty seats and then i can't even get up the bus. please have the courage to sit ok, we won't stomp you. 
anyway, ya ikr, rip english. k, thats all, bye. #justsaying

In my 4 years of studying here, I have never met a single rude person before. Until I met an aunty from the e-canteen in PGPR.

Once I gave her my order, and she asked having here or to go, and I replied, but she was hard of hearing and asked again extremely angrily, like, bordering on rage. Then she remarked to her colleague in front of me "这个人啊..."

WTF lady!? How was I supposed to know you are half deaf?

Aunty, if you didn't want any customers, you shouldn't have opened a shop where your source of income comes from customers. I don't care for your affordable goods, nobody likes to be insulted while waiting for our order to be served.

I don't understand why some people's idea of getting fit is being buff. Sure, you got the right sets of aesthetic muscles which can allow you to bench a truck or squat a bus. But do these exercise really make you physically fit overall?

I am in a sport where the advantage goes to the leaner person. My bmi has never gone past 19 for as long as I can remember. The most important muscle in your body, is your heart.

I'm wondering. I hardly liked any singers nowadays. Then I was introduced to fantasy music and never left since then. It's albeit a little sad that I cannot go sing karaoke anymore because I hardly keep up with the latest songs. I first learnt that this genre is still alive when I searched for The Hobbit soundtracks after watching The Hobbit movie. Then when steam had sales, I purchased Skyrim and was absorbed into the fantasy. I had also previously played similar RPG games.

Things spiraled upwards. Through Youtube, I found many various artists who still specialize in fantasy music. There, I expanded the genre- exploring celtic music, folklore and the likes. I shall not list the artistes I know because I would be giving myself away to people who know me. I never turned back to mainstream music, hardly listened to radio in search for a new song every time I got bored of my old ones. I could never get bored of almost any fantasy song. In fact, I listen to one of my most favorite song almost everyday but I still love it when it comes on during shuffle. Moreover, they are ideal for studying: they prevent me from singing the lyrics and are uplifting and motivational. When I am feeling down, I loved to listen and imagine to be in the fantasy world as the music depicts. However, it is saddening that not many people do appreciate such genre. 

I hope someone out there has the same interests as me! Comment if you do.

Hey OP of  I once struggled with body image issues, and am still struggling now. I used to have beautiful clear skin on my legs, but after an eczema outbreak, it left me with scars. 

In the past I was always trying to cover the scars up by wearing long pants and jeans, and felt ashamed and embarrassed.  But my aunt shared with me some wise words. She said, those people who had to have their limbs amputated, they aren't trying to hide the fact that they lost their limbs. Neither are they ashamed of their scars. I had a pair of strong, long and able legs, yet I'm ashamed of them. How much they would give, to be able to exchange for a pair of good legs again. And from then I kept reminding myself, to be thankful for what I have. 

Hey girl, keep your head up high. Beauty comes from within, and it radiates out. As long as you are confident, people around you can feel it :) be thankful for what you have, think of those victims of burn injuries, people with congenital illness such that it hurts to even put on clothing for them. I know, it's tough to show your skin to the world, where we have a certain perception of beauty. But listen, you are beautiful. The beauty which comes from within, is the most precious of all :)

Some people are so selfish as to buy the course reading/novel from the co-op for their leisure reading even when they're not doing the module. Now I have to go all over kinokuniya, times and mph to search for the compulsory book because it's out of stock at the co-op. How could anyone be so thoughtless and selfish??

Looking at , I'm glad I'm not the only one looking at Yale-NUS students with distaste. They make noise over us using their library while they get virtually free rein over our facilities, and now they complain about our home as well. This is totally the definition of "ungrateful", and definitely more than slightly unfair to us "regular" NUS students.

Hi... Looking for advice here so I hope it won't get filtered. (Please ;x)
I just recently moved in to NUS and the weather is kinda hot nowadays. Let's just say that my room has poor ventilation and had no a/c. Does anyone has any pro-tips or life hacks to make my room cooler? :(

I'm so afraid of term starting. I'm a Year 2 crippled by social anxiety; in the past few terms I've found myself suffering from minor panic attacks and waves of nausea whenever I'm in a crowd or classroom setting. When I think about having to wade through students excited about getting to class I feel my stomach sink and my head start to spin. I want to attend lessons and learn but I can't be around people or I'll start having delusional thoughts about everyone judging me and end up frozen in a corner covered in cold sweat. I guess this sounds like an exaggeration but it's a reality for me -- I've spent so many days last term all ready to head out the door and get to class only to be plunged into a state of fear. I need professional help, but that means exposing myself to the judgemental gazes of everyone else and the disappointed faces of my parents. I know they'll all eye me with disgust and call me an ingrate. At least my thoughts here are anonymous... :/

I really hates it whenever my mum forces me to adopt her conservative ways. I love cutout shirts and dresses as well as crop tops. While I'm still young, I would like to wear them out which I know I won't if I ever grow fatter in the future. Wanted to get this dress today and when my mum saw it she just straight out reject and gave me a lecture about how I should not show skin. I'm not saying that I'm super skinny, perhaps about average. Really sick and tired of all these. Before you judge me, this is not the only issue present. There are other issues as well such as her complaining that I have been going out way too often. I feel restricted, controlled even though I am already an adult.

Something happened tonight that left me fuming. A friend of mine gave me a box of chocolates as a belated Xmas present. But I hated chocolates, and I told him that and rejected the gift. He then said he would throw the gift if I don't take it as he already have "lots of chocolates" at home. I told him go ahead, and he really threw a perfectly good box of chocolates that could easily be given to other people. It was nicely wrapped too, not just some cheapo chocolates you get for two dollars.

At first, I was just angry that it was such a waste of food. I don't regret not taking it from him because I really hate chocolates. But then I think about it, I wonder if he is doing that purposely right in front of my face for something more sinister. I wonder if he actually want me to pick it up from the rubbish bin, or make sure I 'learned a lesson' to not reject his gift or he would throw it away (like a fucking threat). When I asked him if that was his motive, he actually said "Hmm, idea,", as if that fucking motive was worth considering. I asked him if he regret his actions, and he repeatedly said he didn't like the sociopath he is. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. Fuck, I just need to rant this shit.

Guys please learn the art of French kissing. It doesn't mean shoving your floppy tongue into her mouth when kissing. And gosh. Always start the kiss without tongue. Go slow and gentle with the tongue. Unless you want her reflexes to cause her to throw up in your mouth.

May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself.

6. The Chosen One
#laoniang is back with the final instalment of #datingstoriesbylaoniang! Disclaimer: This is a long post so save it for next time if you’re busy.

After deleting the app (my second story), my uni kakis convinced me to download the app again and therefore I resumed swiping. Talking to people on the app, unmatching with people looking for sex, going on dates. There was a period of time when I had a date per day and it was sibeh overwhelming. Even had two dates scheduled in one day, so I had to shift one of the dates to another day. Who knew that one could be dating saturated? Prior to Tinder, Laoniang’s dating life was sibeh slow moving. It would always be one romantic interest at a time, but online…….my dating life moved at high speed. It was sibeh fun. I could meet people beyond my social circle, at my convenience. I could kill the conversation when the other party was being disrespectful. Power.

In the last phase of my dating life (last November), I had two Tinder matches chasing me at the same time. Let us call them Dan and Ian.

For the benefit of people who have never used Tinder, most girls on Tinder have many matches while the guys tend to have less matches. In Laoniang’s humble opinion, this is because more males are open to the idea of using dating apps whereas if the social circle of a female are not using these apps, said female might not adopt the app for fear of being judged negatively. They do not want to take the risk of being perceived as desperate or loose, since such apps have a sexual connotation in places like Britain, America and Australia. I have swiped on my travels and yes, it is more common to find people looking for hook-ups on Tinder in non-Asian countries as compared to Singapore.

Each time I opened the app, I would have a minimum of three matches waiting for my reply to their messages. Laoniang over here was talking to both Dan and Ian. I had a date with only Dan and Ian that week, as I feeling quite chuan already. 

Dan reminded me of Tom Buchanan from The Great Gatsby. He was of old money, played golf for sport, had a seemingly limitless supply of money to keep up his expensive lifestyle. What I liked about him was his ability to converse well on the app. Therefore I was very excited when he asked me out for drinks. He was dressed simply but looked handsome, in a grey sweater, black jeans and Sperrys.  We went to a bar, had a decent conversation but Laoniang felt that it was a little bit forced. I got a sense that we were rather different as individuals in terms of frequency, lifestyles and interests. Yes, I do enjoy drinking but I like drinking with my closest friends in an intimate setting like a quiet bar. He on the other hand is the party boy, opening bottles at tables in clubs and with a large group of friends. 

After our date, he told me that he would like to see me again. I was unsure as to whether to see him again or not, but decided to give him another date. 

In between our dates, I went on a date with Ian. Now Ian was a fascinating person. I would describe him as quirky, he was so open and honest about his past. Initially, I nearly swiped left to him because his photographs were sibeh narcissistic and I cannot stand narcissists. Think SELFIES! But he was so damn sexy/cute/handsome/hot that I swiped right.

Ian replied my Tinder messages almost immediately. He told me about how in his past relationships, girls treated him poorly, like a disposable person.

“That’s horrible,” I texted. “What kind of people do you mix with? It sounds like some Korean drama. You need new friends.”

Ian and I also had a common interest: Track. I’ve been doing track for the longest time and so has Ian. We exchanged track stories, techniques and decided to make our first date a morning run. It was on a Saturday and it was my first sports online dating date. It was also the very first date where I went bare-faced with no makeup, no done up hair, in a tshirt and shorts. When we met on the running track, I noticed his smile. It was friendly and he looked sibeh cute.

So we introduced ourselves and ran side by side. He ran a lot faster than me. I nearly CMI, trying to keep pace with him. After our run, we washed up and decided to go for lunch, when it started to pour. We shared an umbrella (hee x4) and briskwalked to the nearest shelter, a food court. We chatted about our lives over hot soup in the pouring rain. I really liked him and I think he was alright with me. I told him about Dan and how he wanted to meet up again, but I was rather uncertain about Dan romantically.

“Aya this kind of boys only want to get into your pants. Forget about him! Don’t meet him already, just be harsh with him and tell him no,” Ian told me. 

But I still met up with Dan because Laoniang is a woman of her word. Meet means meet. Our second date’s location was romantic. It was past midnight and Laoniang had the keys to Laoniang’s niang’s car, so on the pretext of supper, Laoniang took the car and brought Dan stargazing. Laoniang and Dan were sitting next to each other on the grass, not touching and I was really enjoying the cold wind biting at my skin as we gazed up into the infinite darkness.

“You know when I was in Canada, I met this bloody hot girl,” Dan said to me. “She had big eyes, dark brown hair and we had such a good time making out. Damn. We even went all the way.”

Laoniang felt sick. There we were, in such a romantic location, but Dan was telling me about his previous conquest. Is that all he had on his mind? Sex? Haiz.

“There’s also this other girl who I haven’t really gotten over. She’s away on exchange now, but she’ll be back next sem. I really liked her a lot and I was heartbroken when she left. Who knows what’ll happen when she gets back?” he went on.

After the date, Dan wanted to keep meeting me. Laoniang believes that he was either looking for FWBs or just a sibeh confused individual who does not know what he wants, so I did not continue anything with Dan. I decided to have a clean break from him and this decision was aided by Ian’s advice.

Then Ian and I went on the second date. It was at my favourite hawker centre as I wanted to bring him to eat my favourite local dish. Sibeh yummy! Now I'm hungry.

“I need to tell you something, Laoniang,” Ian said as I ate.

“Huh, what is it? Are you……..gay?” I asked. I would be so sad………I thought to myself.

“No,” he said with a disapproving frown. “I’ll tell you later.”

“Why can’t you tell me now?” I implored.

“Not in a hawker centre lah,” he replied. “Let’s go to a café for dessert and I’ll tell you there.”

I gobbled down my food at lightning speed. What was he going to tell me? Simi?????????????? Confirm bad news. Cannot be that he likes me what, this is only our second date, that would be weird. Does he have a pregnant girlfriend? Confirm bad news. Sian ji bua.

At the café, he ordered cake.

“Ok here we are, so tell me now,” I said.

“I want to pursue you,” he said.

“I see, can you elaborate……..?” I replied.

He took a napkin, pulled out his black ink pen and started to draw. Two circles. One labelled “Bad girls” and the other “Nice girls.” 

“In the bad girls circle are the girls I’ve dated,” he explained, penning it in the circle. “Here you are Laoniang, in the nice girls circle.”

That was damn cute, I have to admit.

“I understand. So you want to date me exclusively, is that what you’re trying to say?”

“Yes,” he nodded.

“Okay, I’ll go home and think about it okay?” 

And our second date ended.

Fast forward to one year later, we’re happily together in a monogamous relationship. The journey has certainly not been an easy one. Once, Laoniang had too much to drink because I was upset over life and tried to break up with Ian. I tried to give Ian one of his gifts back, wanting to end things with him. But he never let me go. Through all my crazy episodes throughout 2015, he never left. He has been there for me to massage my feet when they hurt so badly. He’s helped me with my assignments when I’m overwhelmed with so many deadlines to meet, despite him also being overloaded this semester. Fearing for my safety, he has rushed over to protect me when there was violence in the family. Ian has been an angel to me in 2015. Most importantly he takes me to each my favourite local dish every month. Win liao lor.

He is not perfect. Laoniang is not perfect. Yes we have disagreements every once in awhile. What makes our pairing perfect is our shared goal to stay monogamous and to show our love through concrete actions. Chemistry. Shared interests. Mutual effort and most importantly – spending time together. It’s been a little over a year since our first date and Laoniang is glad. I am grateful to be able to spend our second Christmas together.

This marks the end of #datingstoriesbylaoniang ……..I wish all of you a meaningful Christmas and a fantastic 2016. Enjoy the last of your holiday before school begins. All the best in your romantic endeavours.

Bye,
LN

I always laugh when I see guys with waxed or gelled hair. Their hair look either like a curry puff or a beret.

When Orchard was first flooded, one of my city harvest friends said it was God's punishment for prosecuting Khong Hee as investigations on him started that year. 

It is strange that there are so many unfortunate things happening this year at Orchard when Khong Hee is found guilty. I bet the city harvest people are making a spin about it privately.

So I visited the natural history museum.

The staff brought us to the aquatic section and asked 

"Who has seen a whale before?"

"meeee", a little boy shouted. 

His mum kneeled down with confusion, "Huh? when did you see a whale?"

"In iPad"  

Welcome to the 21st century boy.

#datingstoriesbylaoniang

3. Mr Physical Touch
#laoniang is back! Today's story is about a guy who could not keep his hands to himself. Let's call him Phil. 

When I first started talking to Phil, what struck me was his occupation. In his mid twenties, he was a trader. His working hours were erratic but a lot of money flowed in. In his Tinder profile, Phil had a photograph showing his face and some group photographs to indicate that he has friends. We decided to meet one night at a bar. I reached first and told Phil I was already here. When he entered the bar, my eyes widened. Yes it was him alright, but he was..... But large sized. Good features but huge. #laoniang is ok with dating larger men but I could not help but feel deceived. His profile was false advertising, carefully done up to hide his body.....nevermind, small matter. I liked how his clothes were put together nicely. Clean and neat are two checkmarks.

It was a quiet bar as it was still early and quite out of the way from the main street. Once we ordered our drinks, we started talking. Whiskey for him, a martini for me. Phil told me all about the life of a trader. The ups and downs. Sounds amazing - so much dough for his skills! I found myself drawn to his knowledge about trading......it was very attractive to listen to a driven individual explain his trade.I know nuts about it but he patiently helped me to understand the gist of his work.

As the night progressed, I think the alcohol started to kick in. Phil was touching my hair, hands, arms. Light contact but it was sleazy to me. I felt uncomfortable as I had just met Phil and he was already trying to make a move. In the dimly lit bar, he leaned in for a kiss and I just stared at him and said "no". Maybe he's moved quickly in his occupation, but moving too quickly on the first date is such a turnoff. Even with a lightbuzz going in #laoniang's body, I did not feel inclined to reciprocate his physical advances.

To my surprise, I wanted to meet Phil again, despite our first date being not so rosy. He did not accede to my request because of his busy work schedule. I also think he was looking for a physical encounter with someone as opposed to finding someone to settle down with. At this midpoint in my dating journey, I hoped to find someone to be with long term. So Phil and I did not see each other again. Overall it was an interesting evening.

Lessons learnt: Every date is a learning opportunity. LN learnt that she does not like physical encounters on the first date. It makes me feel like the date is looking for sex > relationship. I also learnt about the life of a trader, cool.

Till the next story, LN.

I ain't no mugger but don't push me
Dean's list is like the sweetest joy next to getting pu***
Picture cheatsheats unfolded, theorems being quoted
Spotted the question from past years and penned it
Bow down, pray to Curve, hoping that he's listening
Seeing leechers coming for me, after my grades and it's sickening
Now pay attention, bless me please Paper, I'm so lost
In these killing fields. Hail Mary, catch me if I go

I saw quite afew post on abortion and i've decided to share my story after reading 

It was the worst, most traumatising thing i've ever been through. And this is coming from someone with TWO cosmetic nose jobs, liposuction AND orthodontic jaw surgery

My abortion was very different from what 13428 experienced...
Because i was cheapo, i had my abortion done without general anesthesia, so i was awake and fully conscious throughout.

PLEASE ASK FOR GENERAL ANESTHESIAS, DO NOT CUT CORNERS FOR THE SAKE OF $$$

Firstly, IT HURT. I got two injections of local anesthesias into my cervix to numb the pain, THAT WAS IT (the injections didn't hurt though). So when the suction machine went off, I felt everything - it literally feels like your own body is getting sucked out of you - like period cramps on steroids.

Secondly, Its disturbing. The entire room smelt like my own blood, and (maybe because my doctor was incompetent) i got bloodstains on my legs as a souvenir. Plus the tube where the foetus gets sucked out was pressed against my inner thigh the whole time. IT WAS WARM.

Thirdly, my doctor was a psychopath. Halfway through i was crying and begging him for more painkiller, he stopped, came to my face (i was lying down) and said "OK i can stop now. You want that? No? Then stop making noise." Insane.

At the end of it i was pale, crying and shivering in cold sweat

I locked myself in the recovery room and spent a hour bawling. The doctor dismissed it as hysteria. 

I don't feel the "abortion guilt" you see in the media
But really, the procedure has left me traumatised and im seriously considering going to the NUS psychologist 
The only thing thats stopping me is fear of sounding stupid and whiney

Since it's Thursday already, I'm back. Call me "the throw". 90s kids hear hear. 

Chinese new year and festive seasons do you all still remember playing with the fake bombs? Those that you press then they inflate and burst out bubbles? Those were so fun.

Also, remember in primary school, at least for me, handprints were a privilege and not necessity? The discipline mistress would always have impromptu spot checks on us, and we had to hide the phones in the ceiling.

Those days were so fun.

Dear ; 
Hi there. You say you're going for an abortion "in a few weeks"? Please don't. Please get it done a.s.a.p. Change gynae if you have to. I recommend Dr Denas Chandra at Parkway East Hospital. I hope you have enough money for the procesure. Early abortions will set you back about $1k, but depends on procedure too. May be cheaper if you're still in early stages where the pills suffice. Cab home. Spend that extra $10. You'll be too weak to take public tpt. Keep your receipts. Rest well. Most importantly, do not feel. Put your emotions aside. Being strong means sticking to your logical side and braving the wind.

I suggest you also get some form of birth control. 

Why should you listen to me? Because I was in your situation before. Don't try anything stupid. Don't smoke/drink/drugs. Just nurse yourself back to health. Don't fuck. Pray if it makes you feel better. 

Excuse me for breaking the reality to you. Abortions are easy if you let go of the romanticizEd visionof the process being where your boyfriend pays and accompanies you etc. Your biggest barrier is the cops in your head and society telling you its wrong etc. also, possibly the hardest part is the financial price.  Be prepared. Be strong.  All the best.

I'm a straight dude and I consider myself as a liberal person. I've known for awhile now that NUS has many hotspots for sex, but it never occurred to me that I would actually 'bump' into people doing it.

To the two guys whom I saw exiting the same cubicle in a particular toilet at CIT building, and then rushed for the exit, AAAAYYYYYYYY lmao. It's cool, dudes. I really don't care. 

But pick a better spot lah next time. CIT toilet bloody disgusting leh. 
-
 
So, I was doing my business in my own cubicle in clb's toilet when I heard a really loud fart from the cubicle next to me. Next came a smell so bad that I forgot everything I studied for the past few hours. As I picked myself up, whole body trembling from the smell and wiped myself clean, I exited my own cubicle to find the one next to me.... empty.

I don't know what's scarier.. Having a ghostly encounter or someone leaving the toilet without washing hands after taking a dump.

Last Sunday, I stayed overnight in Lvl 6 Central Library to prepare for my exam. Feeling sleepy, I went out and take a short nap on the wood bench in front of CL gate.

Went I woke up, it was about 1.30 AM. I noticed that someone had put a chocolate bar in my table and wrote in my paper: "For You" and a Chinese text. I feel quite surprised because of that cute thing although I did not understand that string. Today, I asked my Singaporean friend what does it mean, she said "Good luck".

To the friend who gave me that little happiness, I would like to say "Thank you" to you :) You remember me, don't you? Don't hesitate to talk to me when you meet me again (If I still sleep that time, just wake me up).

It's been a while since I go to Science library to study. Recently during this exam period, I've been noticing this girl that comes to study at the library from 10am till about 6pm. She's always with her friends.

I think she's very unique, as she is quite tanned. She uses a purple phone cover. Does anyone know her? She uses a black laptop sleeve.

It's Saturday today and I still see her. Hope she comes to the library till exams are over. I feel like going up to say hi, but she's always with her friends. And I'm kinda shy.

If you're reading this, girl, good luck for your remaining papers! Hopefully I might have the courage to go up to say hi.

I recently bought a pair of earphones from bookhaven in utown about a week ago. I passed them on to a friend, who informed me today that when he first used them, they were faulty, with audio only coming out from one side. When I went down to bookhaven to request a refund, I was informed that the exchange policy stated that return's were only accepted up to 3 days from date of purchase. The staff also questioned me, on a) why did I not test the earphones on the spot, and b) why did I wait one week before I used it.

My response to her was that 

1) They were sealed in plastic wrapping, and I was not allowed to open a set to test them before purchase. Also, there were no test sets on display to test the audio quality.
2) I got the earphones as a gift for a friend, and that's why I did not open them to test them, and that's why it took a week for me to find out that they were faulty.

Her response to me was that no, the exchange policy clearly states that exchange was only available 3 days from purchase, and that she was sorry. 

Well of course I got pissed. But besides the earphones being faulty, they also turned out to be poor quality, knock off xiaomi earphones. The only reason why I bought the earphones were because I previously owned a similar pair and the earphones on sale were exactly alike in terms of packaging, to the genuine xiaomi earphones. 

One would only be able to discern the difference in build quality on close inspection, which I was not allowed to do until after purchase.
Should a bookstore in a reputable university like NUS be selling knock off products?

Is there anything I can do to get my refund? By this point in time it's not about the money but about the principle of the matter. And heads-up to anyone interested in the cheap xiaomi earphones on sale in utown bookhaven, save yourself the trouble.

There was this rather cute guy in air force singlet and wearing a grey cap in UT gym on Wed evening that caught my attention. Like duh, who wears a cap indoor right? He is not particularly super muscular but his lean bod and well-toned arms happens to be the type I adore - the 小鲜肉 type. I am so going to use the gym more frequently just hopefully to catch more glimpses of you.

Regarding the recent unfortunate event in Paris, I have so much to say. When I first heard the news, my instant reaction was horror and sadness. The widespread media coverage spread the news very fast around the globe and suddenly I see many of my Facebook friends changing their display pictures to the ones with French flag backgrounds. I see nothing wrong with it at first. It is a way of showing respect for the dead but as I find out about how the media doesn't care to make big deal out of people dying in cases like Baghdad and Beirut. I feel like we are not exactly respecting the loss in other places. I get it. Facebook only offers the option of French flag. Facebook is a western social media platform hence lots of western influence. I feel like by changing a mere dp to French flag, we are promoting this western imperialism and selective grieving over the dead. I just feel it is not right...Okay time to go back to studying for finals.

I always notice this girl sitting at the back of the middle section of the LT during cm2121 lectures... Although she dresses quite casually with slippers, shorts and t shirt sometimes, i still find her very unique and pleasant-looking. I didn't have the courage to at least get eye contact and smile at her (let alone talk to her) and even waited till week 13...... but she didn't come for the last 2 lectures this whole week 13, even when it was the last important lecture :( Lesson learnt: don't wait until the last few weeks of the sem to get to know/smile/talk to the person you're keen in. So the only time i can see her is during the exam, much regrets and also why didnt i take cm2111 this sem T_T

ah girl ah, why every time u meet me you are like a warming sun, so fun and cheerful to talk with, and u light up my gloomy world. I felt that there's sparkzzz between us. However, when I whatapps you, you are like a chilly rain, so cold and reply so short. So my world turn gloomy again. This process has continued on for 10 weeks and it's really a roller coaster ride for me. And since our last cheerful sunny session has ended, is my world gonna be gloomy forever :( -

Just needed to rant. Why are some people so inconsiderate? :/ i was studying at town plaza on friday evening and there was a group of students who were having a gathering, probably a fellowship or smth along that line. The activity was held at seminar room 10 with all the noise kept inside, which was fine. However, after a while, some of the people came out to chit chat and have some food. THEY WERE TALKING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES!? talking as if they own the entire place. Like wow, couldnt you see that there were people who were trying to study? (There were other people there too, not just me) Why did you have to make so much noise? You could have stayed in the room and chit chat all you want (i dont even know what language you all were speaking goodness but that is not the point) but nooo you chose to come out and make so much noise, disturbing the rest of us. I chose to leave because I couldnt take it anymore (plus it was getting late). My music was played at the max volume and I could still hear you all. Sigh, so inconsiderate. And to those people who are going to ask me to stop being a keyboard warrior and confront them instead, save it. Go study or something, those comments are unnecessary.

Looking for a lost laptop. It's a red Lenovo with many stickers such as a Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker chibi saying "Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"; pizza, burger, taco and doughnut stickers. The battery has little part that's chipped off but stuck together with tape. It's also in a black laptop case with red interior.

It may have been left at Science CBLC, Science canteen, Engineering Technoedge, Engineering Classroom E3 06-11 or Arts Room 03-02. I'm an Environmental Studies student, that's why I can travel all around NUS in one day. 

Please comment below if you've found it/or returned it OSA! This laptop holds a lot of sentimental value to me!!

Decided to play a prank on my room mate who at times can be irritating and he for one like to disturb me. So late one night after he has fallen asleep (he is a deep sleeper) and with the help of another partner in crime (3 of us are buddies anyway), we decided to play a prank on him. Heaven is on our side and he didnt use the blanket. We creeped and crawled to his bedside, use a small scissor and trimmed off his pubic hair. We feel like laughing but we control. Mission completed in 5mins, cleared up the mess and we  stopped. I went back to sleep after that. Next morning, when he woke up, first thing he say 'WTF'. I was awaken, act innocent and say 'what?' I looked at him and burst out laughing, laughed because 'our trimming' is awful botak abut there abit here. He seems loss, put on towel and went to wash up. When he is back, i tried to peep and he actually shave off everything. He didnt ask me anything after that. That very night, he covered from head to toes and sleep.

I was 7. Kneeling in front of the altar. Pa had caned and punished me again for stealing money from his coin wallet. I hated him.

I was 11. Pa had just bought me a new 2-wheel bicycle 3 months earlier as it was my birthday. Being the reckless, fearless kid that I was, I cycled around void decks, venturing out to pedestrian sidewalks, car parks, cycling across roads. Pa was mad when he found out, he removed both wheels as punishment. I hated him.

I was 15. My voice had just started to crack. Pa asked me, "Why is your voice like that? Can you stop talking like a sissy?" Pa. My voice had never changed, it's breaking and I can't control it sometimes. I felt so ashamed of myself I always forced my voice into something deep even though it strained me so much. I hated him.

I was 16. I received my O level results and I did well enough to enter most polytechnic courses and most JC's except for the top 4 or 5. Pa insisted that I went to poly, away from my friends who mostly went to JC. He separated us. I hated him.

I was 19. I had done well enough to enter the local Universities. Pa said he never understood what the point of studying so much was, that I should just start working. We were not rich enough to comfortably afford University, but not poor enough to qualify for financial assistance, just like many other families out there. He didn't want to have to take a loan. I didn't want to stop studying just yet. I hated him.

I was 20. I enlisted and worked really hard, eventually getting into OCS. In addition to having weekdays burnt already, sometimes weekends got burnt too. I saw less of Pa, and we never really talked even on Sundays when we met. My aim in entering OCS was clear: To save as much as I could in order to fund my own University education.

I was 22. I hadn't saved enough to fully fund my University fees, but I told myself that I would give tuition to make up the difference. I had applied and got into NUS before I ORD-ed. I felt a small sense of pride in achieving what I had so far. I thought nothing of Pa. I had grown up hating him over issues small and big, and that resentment stayed.

I was 25. I graduated. Pa and Ma attended convocation. They couldn't have been prouder of me. Pa had worn a proper shirt and tie, with pants. It was probably the first time I had seen him in this attire since I was born, from photographs of their wedding.

I am 30. Pa had passed on due to stomach cancer, late detection. In his parting gift to me was a short letter and a sum of money. His English and Chinese wasn't good, growing up with a mixture of dialects and Mandarin, but he wrote it in English anyway.

"_______, all my life I dont know how to be good father. Sometimes I correct, sometimes I wrong. When you younger, I only want you to faster work so I can rest early. When you pass your uni is my best moment of my life. I look at you and I think that 

"真的長大了
翅膀硬了會自己飛
也不是壞事". 

This money I work very hard when you in NS. I want give you to go uni but you go work. This money you keep for you. Sorry I never love you when you younger. 

Love, 爸"

This was attached with around $18,000 in cash. The envelope was passed to me by Ma shortly after Pa died. As I recollect, I was a real asshole.

He punished me for stealing money. Stealing IS wrong.
Cycling around on the roads is dangerous.

I was selfish for wanting to study in University when my family finances were so. If I hadn't entered command school of any sort, I would be struggling so badly.
Despite his crude preference for me to start working early, he had been working hard during my NS period to raise money for me. $18k isn't enough, but that's besides the main pont.... 

Damn it. He was a good father. And I was the asshole son.

Pa I love you. And I'm sorry that I only saw all these so late in my life, only after you're gone that I appreciate what you went through. Rest assured that I will take care of Ma.

There's this senior girl in FASS who's very popular. She stays in one of the halls and never fails to capture my attention. She's so beautiful she's like a train, driving me crazy.

I will never stop until the day I catch up to you, when I can finally say, 

"I love choo."

I found myself liking this guy who's a house captain. He loves Pokemon and always leaves his room door open when he's in. Sometimes I wished I can do my laundry more often so I have an excuse to walk past his room and look at him more. Seeing him around the college just brightens my day. Maybe we might take the same module next semester? ;)

Talking about ghost, I have my fair share of experience during army and in hostel. 

In army, to be frank I slept naked, there was this one night where i feel i was helpless and unable to lift myself out of the bed though I am awake, i could feel 'someone' was playing with my 'little brother'. No joke. Not sure if i am dreaming but it was so real and scary. Back in hostel, I have the same experience a few times initially. Same sleeping habit, i experienced my 'little brother' was being fondled and played with, i couldnt lift myself up nor ask my buddy for assistance. I just couldnt speak. It lasted for quite a while before i actually 'came'. I was  covered with sweat when i am able to move. I dare not move but slept till daylight. Which i confided in my buddy re this. He too experienced it before. 

Eventually, i placed holy figure beside my bed and it stopped and i could sleep in peace. 

Anyone has the same experience back at hostel too? Hope i am not the only one.

Sometimes being too close with your room mate who happened to be your NS buddy can be a pain. 

I recently bought a couple of boxes of new underwear (2xist and renoma) brand. After shower and while preparing to sleep, wanted to put on newly bought undies to sleep, realised that it has gone missing (i might have left it at home i thought). Next morning when i woke up, my dear buddy who returned late night, seem to be wearing the undies I bought.

After shower, my buddy came back to the room and took out another pair of undies from the box. I recognised it was the same as i bought earlier in the week. I waited for him to put on before asking him, 'buddy did u take the underwear on the desk?' He say yup and just laughed. 

I was like wow lao if you want to take at least tell me la... dont just assume u can just take. Anyway i wasnt angry with him over this  (anyway is just underwear), doesnt want to ruin the good relationship between us. 

Anyone has such experience too?

Has anyone gotten dengue fever 3 times or more? I had it twice in quick succession (within a span of a couple of years) when i was in P6 and sec 1 and the second time was pretty bad. I had to be hospitalized and stuff like that. These few weeks there were quite a number of mosquitos in my room and house and i'm damn scared one of them is carrying the dengue virus. If i get it a third time i might die since subsequent ones are more serious than the last

Dear users of canteens and foodcourts (Koufu, Foodclique etc),
please be reminded that the cleaners do not clean the tables after you eat, especially during peak periods. 

Please do not eat and throw your bones or food stuff on the table like you do for hawker centres or back in your home country (where ever you come from). Imagine how the next person will feel finally finding a seat but the table's just disgustingly dirty. Sweeping your bones and stuff into your plate isnt clean enough.

Especially to patrons of the Sichuan stall in Foodclique, I know you guys order big dishes with small bowls of rice and share among your friends. I just hope you understand my humble plea in English.

Please use a tray, or dispose whatever food parts onto your own plate. Let's all keep the tables clean for the next users.

Part 2
 (Continued from the previous post thanks to the great response) to find it search #palemandiaries on Facebook. 

She looked up from her book.

I stood there frozen, maybe I have been too forward. Maybe it is just creepy to walk up to a girl in a bookstore with nothing to say. What did I know ? I was a 21 year old without any real life experience who has never had a proper girlfriend. I had to say something.

"You are Joanna's friend, aren't you ?"

I remember seeing her sitting next to Joanna in Calculus lecture. Joanna, I kinda knew, through a friend. Hardworking girl, I was not that intimidated by her.

"Yes, I am." She replied. 

I stood there, she did not chase me away yet.

"You are from science aren't you ? You have been in my Calculus and Linear Algebra classes."
I could not believe it, she actually noticed me. Out of so many people in the class she had noticed me. Maybe I was thinking too much of it, Or maybe this is it.

We stood there talking. I asked about her classes. I asked her where she lived. we talked about books. She was a lively person, a bubble of life just pouring out of a person. I made some silly jokes she laughed. 

"I need to head back now." 

I realised we have been talking for more than an hour. 

Turns out she lived on the Purple line like I did. We took the train together.

We were talking about canteen food, the $1.8 Wan Tan Mee from the science canteen when she dropped the bomb.

"My boyfriend likes it a lot as well."

I froze. We had just crossed Farrer Park. I remember the moment. 

"You have a bf? Like in NUS?" I said. it felt bad like something inside was crushing me. I could hardly breathe. I finally got to talk to the girl I have admired and she has a bf.

"Yah, he is a Phd student from SoC. He actually was a TA for one of my module."

Her stop was there. She said bye to me and that we should meet for that Wan Tan Mee.

As the MRT doors swooshed closed, I stood there with hunched shoulders, broken inside. 

Why doesn't anything good ever happen to me? I told myself.

This story spans over 10 years. I will eventually marry her and then lose her again. Keep reading and thanks for the encouragement. #palemandiaries

This was my first time attending an Indian event ( Diwali night) and it was a really nice experience. The performances were amazing, the colors, everybody looked so beautiful... But guys could you all maybe try booking a bigger venue and have less disorganization, like I could see everybody queueing for the food but nobody actually obeying the queue? I went without food for the entire event and was quite hungry at the end of it..

My ex broke up with me almost 2 years ago. I was a mess. Today, I found out he actually plays for the other team :(

I was at YIH starbucks from 5.30 to 7pm yesterday. There were performers singing Chinese songs on stage and I believe they were from a CCA (Voice I think). It was my first time at YIH starbucks (I am a freshie), so i didn't know that there was a stage for performances. Now, I see it as a potential study area. Just wanna encourage these performers on as I thought they sang well yesterday. Most importantly,  their voices warmed my heart and lighted up my dull day like how my Starbucks coffee did to me. I am actually really envious of them as my singing sucks and can only be confined to my bedroom. It is really beautiful to light up others' days with your voices. Furthermore, it takes courage to sing in public. Keep up to it, performers! What made it better was that they sang my favourite classics. I couldn't really remember the song names though.

HAHAHAHA! was studying in med discussion room... then suddenly at 2.30pm --- Darth Vader started walking around! (prolly cause it was Halloween, 31/10/15 - yes i know. like so many sad ppl in library on Saturday) then just as he was about to leave, he shouted: "may the force be with you all!" 

- just wanted to say a "thank you" to the guy! made my day, brighten up my mood (just as i was about to doze off)

We started sweating profusely. It's only been a while since we started. She gripped the rod really hard and did a perfect stroke. I joined in the fun. I reacted by grabbing my own rod and swinging it. The cock flew in her direction. 

It was a perfect game of badminton.

Pardon the rant but I just wanted to tell everyone something.

UTown PC Commons and Mac Commons are places where students can study in a conducive and quiet environment. There are notices on the door that even says that. 

Now for those of you who frequently visit and use these facilities, which part of "quiet" do you not understand? It's not a market or a coffeeshop for you and your friends to come in and chat. Some of us are really looking for quiet places to do our work. It is very ignorant and shameful that you do not understand the meaning of "quiet". 

I've seen a bunch of people doing acappella inside a PC Commons meeting room before. Do you honestly think a meeting room is for you to sing inside when others outside are seriously trying to study? Do you guys carry your brains for decoration? Shame on you. You are already in university and you can't differentiate between what to do and what not to do. Meeting rooms are not that sound proof and I think you know that. 

I'm not sure if I'm the only one who feels this way but please. If you want to talk, go outside and do it. Or you can simply shift your study area to Collaborative Commons. You can talk there. 

Finals is coming and everyone is stressed. Do help your peers study in a "quiet" environment. Thank you.

Hey gymrats, need some advice here... When im covered up, i look pretty buff and fit. However once my shirt is off, all i see are 2 manboobs, a huge ass tummy and flabby sides. Sigh

Being a guy, most of the time I would steal a glance at guys with buff bodies and have wild imaginations. I don't know if that's being gay or not. Any ideas?

University hostel is like an underwear parade. Guys shamelessly walk around in their Renoma, 2xist, Levis etc from room to toilet etc. I am even more daring than them, I walked and sleep in birthday suit lol. This is our way to destress I think (",)

I was queuing up for mac at SDE earlier when along came a indian person (not local from slang but anyway not important) behind me. When it was his turn, he pointed to the menu on top and said, "i want one singapore spicy babe". Then, the people in the queue and i looked up, and  realised it's actually the slogan for mcspicy. The auntie armchio and tell him its actually mcspicy. I empathise with him as i think he deeply wished there is a hole in ground beside him to bury himself to avoid embarrassment.

I've had enough of this love and no love confessions. Not everything in the world is about love. A little digression from it. Does anyone think that the dillys auntie in engin is rude? The way she treats customers and asks them for orders is like we owe her. But what to do there is only 1 dillys there and a subway.

Today the A2 uncle tried to shut the door in my face. Rude. So what did I do? I pried it back open with my bare hands.

I am a master student in NUS. I met a handsome boy at the bus station Transview Golf Club near utown on 27 Sep (mid-autumn). His name is Essl, who is in the army now, forgive me for invasion of  privacy cause I really want to meet him again. 

It was quite an amazing experience. On that hazy night,I saw him getting on bus 196, the same bus as me, and getting off at Regent Park as I did. After walking behind me for some time, he came to talk to me. I'd never expected that and he said 'u look so cute'. I was so excited and nervous then and I forgot to exchange our contacts.

Me and my ex girlfriend had broke up for 3 years, and we have never seen each other since then until last Friday where i saw her in Zouk. She was drunk and when she saw me, she hugged and dance with me.  At 4am her friends who know me, asked me to send her home as we both live in the west, whereas her friends all stay in the east. I brought her over to my house instead as i only had a rough idea of where she stayed, and she was speaking gibberish drunk language. Back at my place she suddenly grabbed me and ask me to strip her, but knowing that she had a boyfriend already, i controlled my temptation and put the blanket over her and slept on my study chair. The temptation was so strong that night. Gosh.

There is this medicine guy that is so freaking hunky:o i see him quite a bit in the med library, but recently he seemed to have gone missing for a bit. According to my stalking, he did rag and multiple IFGs but i just cant seem to find where he is... i really want to hanky panky with him but how do i make the first move :( slip a piece of paper with my number in his damn thick textbook next time i see him in the library? And what the hell, how does medicine win rag and IFG? How i wish i was part of that community and get to know you ...

I realized that Koreans are portrayed to have a high susceptibility to amnesia. Whenever I watch dramas with my mother, there will always be someone suffering from memory loss of some sort. 
Perhaps there is some truth to it? Wonder if anyone published a detailed study on this phenomenon? 
Maybe I shall do it for my phd thesis :)

Overheard: 

"We should not give seats to old people. And the reason is very simple. When you buy an air ticket, the cheaper fares get less service than say First Class tickets. So similarly, old people are most likely using concession fares. So they should receive less service than ordinary people." 

Should I laugh...or cry at this...

To engin ppl. Have yall notice the new subway auntie? Her service is quick and she is very serious when working. Let's compliment her together. Cos compared to her predecessors, she is the best.

Hey girl ! I really enjoyed the times we spent together from the bottom of my heart. Only a fool like you will find me attractive ! I'm just a hopeless nerd without any talent, without any goals in life. Truth to be told, you are the only person that will laugh uncontrollably at my lame jokes. Never the less, I'm glad that I can at least bring some light into the heart of a emo and depress freak like you =) . Did anybody tells you that you look like an angel when you are laughing? So you better stop crying like a sissy bitch and smile more okay! This world isn't all dark and hopeless. I wish I can dig my eyes out and transplant it to you. so that you can see all the amazing and miraculous stuffs that I always see. 

Sadly, our carefree days are numbered.... I know our bond has to end sometime, somewhere. We are like two different leafs, brought together by some random wind. The wind will blow once again and set us into two different paths. When that day arrives, promise me that you will fly higher and Soar into the blue skies filled with fluffy clouds! Don't be a burden and fall into the dark cave again, I will not come and save you hehe! 

Muackz ! I will steal a kiss from you before I take off. I want you to hate me forever, remember me as "the greatest jerk".

I picked yet another tome and set it upon the table. All around me are tomes of ancient wisdom, containing all the powers needed to smite my competitors. Dust (and haze) had settled over these books of wisdom. I lifted the cover of one tome. Damn. Written in the tongue of the ancients, a language almost lost through the passage of time. What wisdom, what powers, what secrets can I raise in this hazy room of tomes?

Seriously people, if you guys ever shop at a place that allows you to try on their clothes, do the fitting room staff a favor by returning the clothing in a proper manner (not inside-out or a ball of clothes like laundry). I understand that the staff are paid to handle whatever shit you dish at them but seriously, such actions reflect on your upbringing. 

Like come on, how hard is it to just get the clothes that you took (probably 7pcs or less allowed at a time for most places) back in the correct side out before returning?

It is 12 noon now. I've been awake since 6am. But I have not moved since, just staring at the ceiling. I feel like I can't breathe and the whole weight of the world is on me.

To the girl I met on thursday at UTown at night (who was wearing black shorts and a white t shirt with maroon vanz shoes); I am just bursting with curiousity and am extremely worried right now. 

That night you just randomly came up to me, asking if im spending the night alone, to which i replied that I was heading back to my hall. Subsequently you asked if you could come along with a naughty tinge in your voice. We then went back and you gave me the blowjob (the first blowjob i ever had, but I was too shy to admit it was my first time) before we had a passionate pounding session for the next 40 minutes through the front and back door. 

Little did I care about the fact that you somehow did not want to use protection then, I thought nothing of the excuse you gave that it was troublesome to get any and it was fine.

But now I am getting worried as the number you gave me the next morning was false and I cant find your profile by your 'name' and im beginning to suspect if something is amiss, please respond if that's you because Im spilling my brains thinking about this the whole day. And to the rest could you guys please give possible reasons as to why this had happened?...

Hi, i am the OP of  . A great thank you to those commenters who offered the tips for the guide of weight loss and exercise. However, there are some doubts to be clarified. How long will  it take to diet before i could plan the workout in morning and evening if i were to take meals prior to this? Based on my research, it is advisable to diet around 2-3 hours for this right?

I might not want to be too muscular for my arms but rather like my arms to be slim and just nice. Same goes for my legs. ;( I would like to know how i can shelve the fats away from my upper leg thighs. By the way, is the brown rice considered as in low carbo? Is it advisable to have brown rice taken in morning? Yes, i definitely will be having small meals.  

Thank you again!

To those super buff and strong guys in the gym... How long did it take to achieve what you've got right now? 
When I went to the UTown gym my first time to a gym few weeks ago, I was inspired and aspiring to be like you guys since I'm very skinny and weak and beta and etc and couldn't even bench 10 kg per hand lol. Just want to know what should I expect if I were to go on the path of the iron...

Please don't filter this post I really hope to find her! Shout out to the girl whom I made eye contact with on the train and alighted at buona vista.

I doubt this will reach the recipient but everyone can share the love. To the uncle selling jewellery outside Town Plaza in UTown, thank you for being so friendly and kind!

to all the guys who say that girls should dress "appropriately" because rape blah blah and believe u make so much sense, here's the deal: you're not. 

because if u don't think u have to dress "appropriately" so a gay guy won't come touch or ogle at you, then women don't have to do the same. 

this is not common sense or "crime prevention". this is just u and the patriarchy telling u it's okay to police how women dress but not okay for gay guys to stop u from wearing singlets that show off ur biceps and FBT shorts that show off ur calves. 

(also most sexual assault misty happens with someone the victim knows, so rly, what u wear has little to nothing to do with sexual assault prevention.)

Hi, I have really small boobs, around size 26A (if there is even such a size??) or 28AA. Have been playing sports since i was young and I do not know if it affects chest size but I've always been skinny and wearing sports bra all the time. However, now that I've stopped playing (year 3 and studies and internship and work are getting in the way), I have no more reason to wear sports bras and I find that I do not know where to get bras of such sizes in singapore. Please don't make jokes like "boobs so small wear bra for what" because I am already aware of that fact and very self conscious. I know of online shops overseas that has my size but I feel unsure about not trying on the bra before buying and most of them are quite pricey. Please do advice :<

To the girl that offered me a chair at MacDonald's at around 12pm+ today, I would like to thank you for your simple act of kindness and taking the initiative to offer me an empty chair. I hope you are reading this as it did brighten up my day for a moment. NUS needs more people like you :)

 PGP has bigger but older rooms than UTown. I was at PGP to give my girl a good time and realised it was bigger than the time she went to my Tembusu room.

Having said that, you'll be given a black dongle as your electronic access key. No, it is not a black pearl, and so it doesn't carry that kind of value you think it does. ;) Not valued by pirates.

No aircon, thus sleeping with the hot girl I made out with was harder than in my Tembusu air con room.

But you can try the Takagi Ramen Store if they haven't gone to jail by then. Or maybe the next stall will be called Singapore True Ramen.

How to prof in engineering?

So we dad joke now huh

Hello, would like to know if anyone has found a black Sony Xperia SP phone in LT5 after the CN3135 Lecture today, it's attached to a black Yoobao Powerbank. If anyone has it could you kindly return it to the Security Post in Block E3 in Engineering? I really need it as it's the only way to contact my group members for my labs and other projects, thanks!

To  my favourite website for toys and lubrication is Alice Maple (go Google it and go to the Singapore site). Because delivery in Singapore is very fast with discreet packaging. The stuff there is of good quality. Make sure you read up before you buy. Don't buy shady cheap ones (especially those made in China) because it is going into a sensitive area. 

Try out bullet vibrators first because they are less scary than full length dildos and work just as well.

Since farting is natural, I don't think it'll be such a big issue to discuss. I farted in my bf's room the first time and I just apologetically pinched his nose while I wave the smell away. After that we just started pinching each other's noses whenever one of us farts and it never became a big deal :)

There is a guy in my batch who is part of the Chemical Society. Basically, I realised I like him. He's quite effeminate, but mischievous too. More importantly, he shakes his butt when walking, just like a girl. How???

P.S. Guy here, which makes it even more comfusing than it already is. Not even sure if he's attached, but he seems to be always with another guy or two.

Hi guys i need to get this off my mind, it has plagued me since i returned from exchange.

When i went for exchange, my friends and i couldn't get university provided accommodations. As such, we had to source our own accommodations outside. Together with my friend, we rented a small apartment to save costs. The drawback? rent was expensive and we got an apartment with a queensized bed, for the 2 of us.

In short, I had no choice but to sleep with another guy for 4 months. It was the most awkward experience of my life. It did not help that my roommate was too horny during exchange without his girlfriend. 

There were a few times during the middle of the night when he was jerking off to porn off of his phone. I shifted further away from him on the bed and tried my best to pretend i was asleep. 

Eventually I scolded him about it and he stopped doing it in the bed. I can't view him in the same way again...

Thanks for listening to my story, I just needed to get this off my mind...
-
 
I hope this can be posted soon. Quite important. My friend lost her thumbdrive. It was at COM 1 Mac Lab. Mac terminal 18. If someone has picked it up, please call at this number 97843404. There's an assignment that is to be submitted by tonight on that thumbdrive. Please help! Thank you!

It was a usual Wednesday afternoon and I was having the runs. I am quite ocd about choosing my toilet bowls. The cleanest toilets nearby that came to my mind were those in CLB. Okay let's fast forward the story: apparently it was a good time to shit and there were no vacancies in any of them, so the next best option I had was the Chinese library toilet at the top level. In I went, the toilet was quiet, stale and perfect for my dump? A few minutes in, I suddenly felt "someone" in the adjacent cubicle, but it wasn't right.. I couldn't hear any foot steps coming in despite the defeating silence which enclosed the toilet. Suddenly, I heard the sound of pee, and immediately I put on my pants and dashed out of the toilet. On the way out, I took a glance at the adjacent cubicle, it was apparently empty.

I just found out that this girl on my floor has illegally sublet her room to her friend. What should I do?

Please do not filter. I was in class, as two Chinese boys went up for their presentation. Their boring presentation aside, I could not help but notice how the guy was staring at me the entire time while he spoke about the Little India Riots that took place in 2013. Why were you staring at me like this? It's as if he was 'educating' me about why it happened and how this could be prevented in the future and how these Indians should have behaved. He was getting so upset about it as well. Erm , you are aware that I wasn't involved in the riots right? You think you're doing me a favour? You think I'm going to get into a riot anytime soon? First of all you ignorant fool, just cause these Indian FWs behaved in such an unruly manner does not mean that every Indian is going to behave the same way. Can't believe that NUS has uneducated students like them. Fuck you. You need help.

I saw this really cute guy in uni-y camp. He was in the wolverine og. I personally think fat guys are cute and chubby. I dunno it's my taste. I have been afraid to approach you for a long time.

I wish you would notice me one day and hit me up ;)

Anyone 23 and above, losing hair? Everytime I brush my hand through my hair in the shower, a few strands of hair will sure come out. Most of my fringe is gone, have receding hairline. 
Went to doctor, said male pattern hairloss.

I hope I can find some people going through the same thing T_T

Some people just have evil emanating from their faces. The moment you see their face you just know they will do something bad to you. I have met many people like that. They leech to you for your goodness and kindness. They suck the life out of you and leave you a soulless person. They call themselves your friends and ask for your homework and assignments. At the end of the day, you are just stuck in a abyss of hopelessness of what to do with these people.

Hi I'm the OP of 
Thanks for your feedback but well I'm still lost as to how to go about doing it. Do I smile at the guy, chat him up and then idk..give him those gazes? How would he know that I'm fine with him crossing the proverbial line?
From the comments: App? Hm no kick. Fast food delivery....what...?
And I know some guys who are all high and mighty and wouldn't do "such things" and they're the ones most likely to reject. And you can never identify such guys until you try it out.

I'm worried for my roommate. I think he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. For the longest time he has been using an alternate Facebook account to live an alternate lifestyle. So much so, that his original account has fallen into disuse. 
Nowadays, his posts on the fake account are getting more insensitive and inflammatory. It used to be funny but it's not funny anymore. 
I'm worried that he needs to see a doctor. I also worry for my own safety. Sometimes I see him holding a pair of scissors to his hair cutting off snips here and there.

I dunno what to do.

I have a love-hate relationship with my uni friend. When I get my answers right, I hail to him like a god. But when I don't, I wondered why I ever wanted him to be part of my life. He's the most mysterious shades of grey ever and his master is an escapist of my mind. He's none other than Planck constant, his master, the Schrödinger Equation.

To the OP of . We Science students will do whatever we please. If we feel like taking the bus, we will. Like you said, we paid for it. Anyways, a lot of people do get down at Science most of the time.  So, its only common sense for us to get on right? And its not like the buses weren't already packed when it arrives. Will it kill you to just withstand a packed bus again for just two more stops? Like omg.

I don't get it. Why do people always feed food to those more greedy animal? They eat so much food aldr you still feed them.  Can't you see the more quiet animal behind them waiting for you to feed them. AND YOU KEPT ON FEEDING THE GREEDY ONE. MAKES ME SO ANGRY.

What a accurate depiction of the world. Nobody ever notice the less aggressive being. So cruel. All attention on the gregarious one. Regret not buying food and feeding the more quiet swan yesterday who is waiting expectantly to be fed:(((

What a weekend it has been,
So many things have been seen.
First people went to vote,
Then they came to gloat.

So many posts and comments,
Yet few making any sense,
But then came along a Wong,
And proved everybody wrong.

While wondering these days,
What's happening with the haze,
People asked Prof Ben,
How to hook up with men.

With the mid-terms fast approaching,
I'm getting down to chionging,
But then I keep wondering, while reading my texts,
Where are all the posts here, on relationships and sex?

Sorry I am not a poet, but may be someone can write one better.

@
Gosh it's ppl like you that makes PGP miserable. I too stay in PGP, and while the facilities there can be run down or malfunctioning, it's the terrible behavior that makes it a sad place.

Washing up in the kitchen sink. Are you kidding me, it's a place for ppl to prepare food.

In my time I have seen ppl wash their feet in the toilet sink, seen ppl leave their poop in a perfectly functional toilet bowl, and rubbish everywhere in the kitchen except an empty rubbish bin, which is also right next to the chute.

Can anyone help me understand why some ppl are so messed up?

I don't get why we must always have a need to give up our seats on the train to 'old people'. Sometimes they are so rude and unfriendly that you don't even want to help them. I know how it's good to do so and I give up my seat if I see someone who needs it like a pregnant lady or a frail elderly person. But sometimes I just don't give a fuck.

To the one who take my laptop charger(HP one) in SoC:
Please return it to the same place or send it to the security post beside the ATM near Biz canteen because life is really hard if I can't access to my laptop. I can't submit assignments, can't make applications either. I will really appreciate if you can do so.

There's this new guy in the med library the past two days. I've never seen you here before. I've been wanting to say hi but you have too many friends around. You were in a grey tee yesterday, sitting opposite a girl. Is she your girlfriend? ;( I wish I could muster up my courage to go over and say hi...  Why do you have to be so damn irresistable.

Used to know this dude in JC. Seemed pretty chill, not the highest self-esteem kind of guy, but a pretty ok friend to hang out with. Lost contact and fast-forward 3 years later in uni: he's become pretty much the douchiest guy I know with that rooster style hair and gym-rat lifestyle. Idk if i never knew him that well or what, but srsly wtff it's like he's overcompensating for something.

He comments frequently on this page; whenever the keywords 'gym', 'muscles', 'good-looking' appear on a confession, he's there.

Reading  and the recommendation of using tampons remind me of when I first tried to use one. I was horrified by the idea of putting something inside myself. Don't get me wrong - I have a healthy sexual relationship with my body, but somehow I fainted trying to put it in. I even contemplated getting my boyfriend to help me. Guys, would you help your girlfriend put on a tampon? Am I weird??

People have been complaining about how crowded the shuttle buses are recently. A2 frequency seemed to have increased a lot compared to last semester. However the frequency for D1 has reduced. And last semester used to have a lot of blue UT-CLB direct buses too. I ever waited for 40 mins a few times around 5.40pm as I couldn't get on the bus at all. 

I realized that there are posters encouraging students to walk from Utown to CLB. However the weather is so hot and there's a slope at YIH-CLB. I'm not complaining but I've tried and I perspired like crazy. 

Would it be nice if NUS campus can have a tunnel system like MIT (refer to the map attached)? I believe a lot of people are willing to walk to school. Besides, we can still travel to school even though it rains heavily.  Isn't it an awesome idea?

Do guys expect their girlfriends to have a flat tummy? I'm skinny, but I'm not one who gyms constantly so I have a small tummy pouch. Granted, its not visible even when I wear slightly tighter clothes so I know some of my friends think that I have a completely flat tummy. However, I know I don't and I'm insecure about it, especially when I think about getting attached...

To OP of ,

Unfortunately all you need really is self discipline :( Try and run/skip for 30mins every day to reduce overall body fat percentage, and if there are specific areas you want to slim down, do exercises that target those areas. Food wise eat only till you're 70% full, cut down on carbohydrates and make yourself full by eating more vegetables meat etc. Following the recommended calorie intake is what some do when they diet, but personally I dont think it's really necessary to achieve an average body figure. Eat clean, avoid oily food and sugary drinks (especially canned/packet drinks, bubble tea etc) Whenever you feel like snacking, don't do it.

The first few weeks will probably be the hardest to keep it up, but it'll become a habit after a month or so. Good luck! :)

I've been frustrated with this but have not had the time to write a post here. To those who take shuttle bus around, please do take a seat if there is a seat in front of you. I meant, unless there is somebody else nearby who needs the seat more than you do or somebody who actually wants the seat standing next to you and you don't mind standing, you won't get judged sitting down. To me, it is actually a better act of kindness for you to sit down and allow people to move to the rear instead of standing there and blocking people especially during peak hours. I know all those stories on STOMP about people getting judged by sitting down comfortably on MRT and all but please use your brains...

During my primary school days, I used to be ogled by the same man in my block whenever I walked past him. Back then I did not know that it was called ogling but I know it is not right for a guy to be staring at another guy. (I am straight) I was quite disturbed by it so I can understand how girls will feel being ogled.

I always hear people said the older you go (starting from 20s), the easier it is to get fat. What they meant was when you are younger, you can eat junk food without getting overly fat but from 20s onwards, its very easy for the weight to balloon very fast. How true is this statement? Is it because metabolism starts slowing down at 20s?

The top few things that annoys me most.

1) People looking at phone (facebooking, video etc) and walking too slowly, obstructing the pathway especially when the place is already damn crowded and people are rushing.

2) Youtube ads. Yes i read that YouTube requires more bandwidth because of all the videos and such and the ads help some with the cost. But why last time don't have problems with cost and thus no ads?

3) people leaning against poles on buses (nus ones included) or mrt when other people need to hold too (forgivable if the person is old but not so for young fellows).

4) Walking into a toilet that is just washed. Well it just seems gross and disgusting to be stepping on wet floor...

Like if these 4 things annoys you all to the max.

When I was staying in PGP , I recall an incident in which I walked past the pantry to see my cluster-mate 'drying' his socks in the microwave. I stopped using the microwave from that moment on.
Now, 4 years later, I wonder if that same microwave is still there. I'm not going to say which block it is, because its more fun that way :P

My indonesian maid once work in a factory in her village with friend A and B. One night, my maid and her 3 friends decided to go toilet together as the toilet is pretty far down the road and its getting dark and creepy out there. In the toilet my maid and friend A decided that 3 of them should share the same cubicle since they were scared. However, friend B decided to use her own cubicle so my maid and friend A shared a cubicle. After my maid and friend A were done, they knocked on friend B's cubicle but received no reply. They waited a further 10 mins before deciding that they should return to work. Upon reaching their factory, they were shocked to see friend B already back at the factory! To their horror, friend B even said that she did not follow them to the toilet in the first place! Who could possibly be the one following my maid and friend A to the toilet?

Let's share ghost stories here shall we? Would be very interested to hear true ghost stories from you all instead of made up ones. Muahahaahaha

To the couple at one of the male toilet nearby CLB earlier (19 Aug 2015). We could hear the moans of your girl together with your voice in the locked corner cubicle of the toilet. You were too engrossed with whatever you're doing that you didnt hear us even entering the place.

Just wanna say, dont worry... We were the only ones who entered that toilet during your time there. And if anyone asks, in accordance to The Bro Code Article 14, both your identities will remain a secret. Just find a new place to do it, coz we had to search another toilet to take an urgent dump so as not to interrupt y'all.

I held my breath. My hips went up and down, thrusting my pelvic bone deep in the position, leaving me breathless. I couldn't keep holding the pressure building up in between my legs. The urge to release it was just too great... Sweat started dripping down from my face. And yet I held on as long as I could. A few more thrusts, I thought. A few more until my hands give out, until my legs tire out. 

I was finally relieved when I managed to rep out 10 reps of 225 for my deadlifts :D

I really do not understand why some people love durians to the max, while I hate it the max. A lot of my family and friends like to talk about eating durians and even posting pictures of them online. I do not see people talking and enjoying the other fruits such apples or watermelons to that extent. Ever since a kid, I disliked the smell and taste of durian. It's so yucky! I can't even describe the stench. I remembered being forced to eat it once by my bf and I puked all over his pants. No offense to anyone who likes durian, but to me, I can withstand the smell of the garbage chute, but I cannot do so for this so-called "King of Fruits." Maybe it's because of my taste buds? I don't know. Anyone here dislike it as well?

So for this semester, I've chose to stay in a double room on campus in NUS instead of a single room. It was my positive experience bunking with a room mate in an overseas programme that made me make that decision.

The experience was pretty good so far, room mate was a pretty relax dude, quiet, but easy to hang out with. He was understanding with most matters, doesn't really mind the difference in lifestyle. Here's the problem, throughout the past two weeks, I've learn from our daily interaction that he actually bought over his peers in NUS to our shared room in between breaks. I was uncomfortable, but I understand that both of us paid rent, he has every right to invite friends over.

It was suddenly when I bump into my room mate and his friend around campus, through my conversation with his friend, I've discovered that my room mate promised him that he could always come to our room to sleep over anytime.

My room mate though it wasn't an issue the whole time and never check with me if it was ok or not.

So after the encounter with his friend, I approach my room mate to check with him with regards to this issue. After all, we still have a semester to go as room mates. I've express my concern with his friends coming over to sleep. I wasn't comfortable with people running through my things. I tend to leave my laptops and my wallet on my desk in the room sometimes for short lectures.

I stated an example, where what if cash or valuables are missing from my belongings in our room when his friends are visiting, he told me it was my fault that I am not locking it up in my own room. He told me he trust them completely. If anything is missing, he is just "sway".

But then again, I've only met my room mate for a week, and I don't know his friends at all. The though of my personal space being publicly accessible is nerve wrecking for me.

I don't know what position I should stand now, I was bought up in a family where one should feel safe in one's own home. It was actually shocking for me to meet someone that has a different perspective on this matter.

On 5th August at about 1130pm, I had the unfortunate realisation that my wallet was missing. Tried searching for it at FASS and YIH, as those were the two places I was mostly at, but to no avail. Fortunately, I received an email from Tembusu College yesterday that one of their residents had found my wallet. To that kind soul, I don't know who you are but if you are reading this I just want to say thank you very much for returning my wallet. I really appreciate it!

Hi everyone, I've got a rather random question for you: did anyone redeem the SG50 tote bag designed by Dick Lee (i.e. The bag with handwritten lyrics to "Home" printed on it)?

The thing is, that song means a lot to my girlfriend, and she's really bummed that she didn't get that design... I know it's down to luck and all, but I figured I might as well help her out a little by asking if anyone of you would be so generous and amazing as to exchange SG50 tote bags with me (should you have the Dick Lee design). That'd really mean so, so much to me. So thank you in advance!

So just leave a comment on this post, and I'll get in touch with you shortly! Haha

I was caught red-handed just now. It was mid-afternoon and I was sitting at my desk in the bedroom and jacking off my D. I was not thinking of anyone or anything, as if my muscles are doing it involuntarily. I got the shock of my life when the door suddenly swung open and my father came in. He was stunned for a while and he regained his composure. My mind totally went blank due to the embarrassment and then he told me to go outside (living room) as he wanted to speak to me. 

I was frustrated as I did not get the chance to release my seeds of life into the tissue paper. But l was mostly so ashamed and I just sat in my room and not wanting to go out to hear what he has got to say. I really did not expect him to come home from work so early today and caught me forcing my D to vomit.  It was very very awkward and I feel a little disgusted at myself. After a while, I settled down and went out of my room.

My father was sitting on the couch and then he began his lecture. He first told me what I did is normal for young men and he even said he did the same thing when he was just 15, but he gave that up after meeting my mother. I had goosebumps and didn't say anything.

Then he continued to say it is not very healthy to be fantasizing intimacy with someone else especially when I already have a girlfriend. I told him I was not thinking of anyone while doing it, and he gave me a cynical look. Goodness! 

Then he further elaborated that I should conserve my sexual energy for my future wife after marriage because it is only right to give the best in everything to her. I kept looking down. And he told me if I do it once a day, it is ok. If I do it twice a day, it is unhealthy. If I do it thrice a day, it is an addiction. And I do it more than that, it is a problem. He told me to be responsible and not view women as playthings. I apologized and told him I will definitely control myself next time.

Super unlucky to be caught today. Imagine a 25 year old guy getting lectured by his father on such a sensitive topic.. I am just worried he may tell someone else, especially my girlfriend, for whatsoever reasons. My reputation is on the line.

So I made a commitment to myself, that I will never jack off again. However old habits can be very hard to change since I am typing this post with only one hand.

My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease five years ago. He died of complications from it last year. When he died, I stopped playing the violin because I couldn't without feeling sad. He was a violinist who, in his 20s and early 30s, had played for orchestras in parts of Europe. Later, in his 40s, he retired and taught music, playing occasionally on invitations at private events. Towards the end of his life, when his illness robbed him of his musical abilities, I became his violin; each time I played his favorite piece, Vitali's Chaconne, a piece he taught me but for which I am terrible at, I saw this indescribable joy in his eyes as though he recognized, by ear, the notes his fingers used to play. 

Today a year after his death, I took out his violin. A layer of dust now lightly powders it. I played the same piece and felt not sadness but joy. Joy for the memories he gave our family, for the music he filled our home with, and for the simple life he led. Music was never my passion, it was his, but his passion led me to understand what happiness was especially in difficult circumstances. Though our family was financially poor, we were very much a happy one. I miss my dad, but I'm glad to say that I miss him a little less with each day that passes.

Have been seeing posts by the opposition parties that Singapore's ministers (or MP) have too high salary (or allowance). I think it is justifiable for the work they have done.

I volunteer with several grassroots and constituencies - you really don't know how much they have done until you see it for yourself.

For MPs who are also Ministers, after their 'standard' working hours. They have to rush to their weekly Meet the People session which can last till 1am or 2am (and volunteers would have to stay till then too). On other weekday nights, there are house visits or meetings as a grassroots adviser. And weekends they spend time going for community events (which can last up to a full day). The money they get is never enough to make up for their time sacrificed.

 "I have not see my MP for very long, he is not doing his work ." Given the number of blocks in a constituency, if he is not visiting you , he is doing other work or probably walking another block.

People really need to get a fuller picture of what is going on before shooting their mouth off. If i were to comment from the perspective of a resident, I haven't seen my MP knock on my door for the past five years either - but I know he is somewhere out there doing more important work than talking to me and asking me how am I.

Haha I know one that's very similar to the previous riddle posted :P

A few years ago, my older brother went crazy. He stabbed my sister to death and attacked my parents. The police managed to subdue him before he killed them too. He's been in a mental hospital ever since and we never visit him.
This morning, we got a letter from him in the mail. The postmark was yesterday. I opened it and inside, I found a strange note:
"Tonight the wind blows colder still.
All I know is darkness, never light.
The pain will break strongest hearts.
My dreams still escape my grasp."
I couldn't make sense of it, so I went to the kitchen and gave it to my mother. As soon as she finished reading it, her face went pale and the note slipped from her fingers. She rushed to the front door and started screaming.

As usual, please do not google -_-

Whenever I see a pretty girl I quickly avert my gaze because from generalisation from a certain few, some girls like the visual attention they receive. 

Not that they care. But somehow it probably does bug them. That one pair of eyes or that one head that doesnt turn. 

And when I see a pretty girl I tend to look at the guys around me and laugh inside when I see them staring.

I have a question. In the upcoming LGBT orientation camp, do the males/females sleep together (2 in 1 room) in the same room just like normal camps? Or everyone mass-sleep together in the sports hall, with males one side, females one side?

Part timers cannot make decisions so casually. So when a customer paid for her purchase with Brunei dollars, I was taken aback and didn't know what ti do. I said we don't accept it here. 

Then she said why the kopitiam gave her. I said kopitiam gave her but we are not kopitiam. Then another customer came to her aid and said sg can use Brunei currency. 

What the customer said next really irritates me. She asked whether I'm a Singaporean. I said yes, but I don't use Brunei notes in sg. Now I know we can use Brunei notes also.

Top three things that make Singaporean men turn their heads (from SGAG as I can't upload that picture):

1) Chio Bu
2) Luxury sports car
3) Opening a can of coke during outfield

For the first point, is it really true that a universally very chio girls make ALL guys turn their heads? Actually I thought only those bold guys who can't control themselves do that whenever they see a chio but walk past. In general I observed that for guys who are very shy or very highly educated, they tend to be able to control themselves to only stealing glances but not turn head and stare even if a very pretty girl walk past. 

This is simply from my observations so I am very curious as to what makes some guys able to control their ogling at a chio bu to just stealing glances while some simply lost control and stare like nobody's business? Education level, level of shyness? Levels of testosterone? Anything else?

To  Hi, I just wanted to say that I related to your story very much. I truly believe that you are a good person for thinking of your family first. I'm a NUS alumni who graduated last year. Like a few others I know, I survived on financial assistance for each phase of my academic life. I just wanted to share with you and the other readers my story.

I came from a neighborhood primary school where I was often teased and taunted for having a karang guni father. It started in one of the Chinese lessons. Our teacher made us write an essay about family. I chose to write about my dad's occupation because I was genuinely proud of him. He would always bring back "treasures" from around Singapore and then tell me stories about them. But when they heard my father was a karang guni, they just laughed at me. I remembered walking around in school with my head low and feeling like shit that day.

I was lucky that I got into a good secondary school based on my sports abilities. I wanted to start fresh in secondary school and so decided to keep my family background a secret. Whenever I was asked what my parents do for a living by peers whose parents were bank directors, politicians, CEOs of companies, I always felt ashamed and I told them that my father was an item collector which, if you think about it, is not a complete lie. They made the assumption that my father was a rare item collector. To tell you the truth, I was afraid my classmates would find out the truth and think lowly of me. I was a neighborhood primary school kid in an elite secondary school where the majority of my classmates came from very rich families. There was already a lot of negative stereotypes attached to being a neighborhood primary school kid. I didn't want them to further see me as a "charity case", the token "disadvantaged" student.

I made it through secondary school without anyone finding out about my background... Later in my JC years, I became more upset and frustrated that my family situation was the same as it was years ago. I carried the same bag since secondary school, one of the many "treasures" my father found at work. I had no phone, no MP3 and no other luxuries that many of my peers did. Even small luxuries like a tub of ice cream was hard to convince my dad to get. My father would always say that he didn't had enough money to buy ice cream when we go grocery shopping. I never brought any of my friends back home (a 1-room flat) for project work or revisions because I was ashamed at the state of things. There were always so many stacked "treasures" — random objects, newspapers, old TV sets, old maps — that my father got from people but couldn't find a buyer for. I don't remember a time when our house was not empty. Sometimes it becomes so hard to even move around at home without knocking over some things.

There was so many occasions when I got so angry at my dad that I said some hurtful things to him. Things like: "you damn useless lah!", "why our house like this? i cannot bring my friends home leh!". I remembered saying that I hated him for not trying hard enough to get us out of our situation. I even got mad at him for not being able to buy me a new school bag... He always patched the tears in my bag but being immature and unaware of the struggles my dad had at the time, I didn't want a "patched" bag. Looking back, I truly regret my words and actions.

It was in army that I wised up and realised what a great person my father is. I had a good officer whom I talked to about my situation at home. He made me realise many things that I, as a teenager, overlook. I thought back to the times when I stayed up late at night to study for my A-levels. My father was always seen sleeping in a rocking chair in the the living room (which is also my "study room"). Every now and then, he would wake up, make me coffee or tea and some food even though I didn't ask for him. He would place them on the living room table where I studied, smile at me and then gave me encouraging words.

In uni, I became more comfortable about my family background. It's still something I don't talk too much about especially with strangers or classmates I barely know. The only people in my life who know and have met my dad is two of my best friends from army and my girlfriend whom I met in NUS and who by the way comes from a rich family. Her parents aren't very enthu about our relationship but we are still fighting hard after years for their acceptance. But that's another story altogether. I still live in the same 1-room flat with my dad. A lot of the "treasures" from my teenage years are gone (sold actually), but the remaining ones, I've helped him to organise. He still works as a karang guni but he no longer puts in as many hours as before. I've told him to retire and to let me take care of him since now I'm already a very good income in finance, but he insists on working. Nowadays, our situation is better and often now, I get to enjoy ice cream with my dad in our living room. These are small luxuries in life, but they mean the world to me and others like me. Haha... thanks for taking the time to read. It's nice to read the confessions here (:

 hello there. I'm one of those super skinny girls you mentioned. My BMI is 15. I just wanna say that us skinny girls have our own problems too. Being too thin actually brings about health problems like anemia, low blood pressure, etc. I get tired very easily(cannot concentrate in lessons) and I can feel faint often(I fainted in school before and had a lot of near-faint incidents). I would actually prefer having image problems than health problems...So I guess we both envy each other... I wanna become fatter too but my weight just wont increase no matter how much I eat.

There's nothing wrong with being fat. So cheer up!

Does anyone seems to notice that every time during peak hours, it doesn't matter whether you stand on the left or right side of the escalator, the people on the right hand side who's supposed to walk up didn't do so, resulting in a terrible bottleneck at the bottom of the escalator. This is despite the fact that the platform isn't totally crowded and it's possible for the people to walk up but i don't understand why there is quite a number of inconsiderate people who occupy the right hand side of the escalator and not walk up, which sometimes causes you to miss your train as you have no way of cutting through at all. Even taking the stairs is terrible as there's blockages there too.

Worst, on train, sometimes its so bloody packed that you felt stuffy, hot and sweaty and then by the time you alight, you are stuck in a bottle neck for the escalator again (referring to buona vista as an example here).

The trains for both directions in circle line always arrive simultaneously, resulting in a worse bottleneck. I don't know if they have any economic reasons for making the trains arrive simultaneously or is it merely poor planning, but judging from the fact that this always happen, it appears like its purposely planned this way, though the reasons were unclear.

I told my parents that it would be better that i get a car in the future but they said that another problem would surface, for instance i would be stuck in a traffic jam.

Sorry for rant, just wanna vent out my frustration from having squeezed MRT almost every day when going work..

Hello guys, just want to say that I am 1/8 of a NUS student because I'd been to local exchange in NUS. I must say NUS certainly has the greenest grass because of many reasons. It has many libraries (Central, science, medicine and many more!) with many tables and chairs (many floors which consist of entirely tables and chairs!), there is never a shortage of a place to study even during the exam period! Many buildings in NUS, from whichever faculty, also offer study rooms or labs that students can utilize to study, unlike elsewhere whereby we have to queue very early in the morning to chop seats in the "only" library.

The LTs in NUS are always equipped with power sockets! Especially the UTown auditoriums and LTs, every seat has a socket nearby and everyone will have a chance to use them! Even the older LTs, like LT27, have power sockets that are easily available. Unlike in the other side of the land, power socket are very expensive for reasons unknown. Not only does every LT has power sockets all over the place, every table in the library has power socket too! Whereas in my school, we have to bring extension cables for each long table if we want to share the power socket, or else, beg for the guy sitting nearest to it to let you use it!

NUS has many functioning bookstores, near Central library there is one and not to mention the one at Science. They are absolutely great (and they give discounts to students!)! Unlike in the shitty place on the other side, we are having problem with bookstore and they didn't inform us timely enough about the closure of a certain bookstore. Now, we are left with a tiny Popular located in a not so convenient place ><!

FOOD!!! NUS has so many nice canteens, Deck, TechnoEdge and Science canteen! Omg, noodles stall at Science, YTH at Deck and laksa at TechnoEdge OMG!!! And the prices are definitely way more affordable than the canteens elsewhere which are showing off their teeth at ravaging on poor students' wallets (and in one of the canteens they have a seriously dumb card payment system). NUS management has definitely keep a good promise to make prices affordable for students, unlike elsewhere (again) whereby the management has lots of profit-making will.

UTOWN!!! It is so big, so well-equipped and beautiful! The food at the canteens are a little more pricey though but they taste pretty good still. The accommodation in UTown is very expensive but I can understand the rationale given NUS premium location, it is so convenient to travel to NUS! Especially so after Circle line was utilized!

NUS modules are generally harder to score but I feel the content is much more enriching and prepares the students well for both future work and further academic studies! The lecture and tutorial hours are longer but the content is sufficiently deep and can very well pique students' interest. Unlike elsewhere, the modules are poorly structured and many concepts are not even mentioned before more advanced concepts are introduced. I felt so deeply engaged intellectually in NUS!

Even though I hear frequently that the transport in NUS is not up to standard, to a certain extent I agree. Given NUS has utilized a bigger land space for their undergraduates, students need to travel within the campus almost every hourly. Therefore, I think they need to beef the transport up so that students will have lesser chance of being late in lectures etc. That being said, NUS transport is actually better than elsewhere. In my land, buses are not only filled to the brim, they travel a long route all over the campus and there are only two routes, no buses A B C D but only two colours. Buses filled to the brim is not an issue, the issue is with the drivers. They are F1 drivers and they always try to cut corners by not slowing down near the zebra crossing, in a sense they are playing with the pedestrians' mentality that they will walk fast across the zebra crossing if they see a bus speeding towards them. Not to mention you can see them slacking off at one corner in the school, instead of driving.

NUS also has better recreational facilities, more gyms, more swimming pools and more courts to play games. I am so glad the school has invested so much time, effort and money in making these facilities fully functioning and well-utilized. On the other hand, even though we have a larger grand total of land area, we are using it to provide greenery.

I also feel NUS staff are more approachable, more friendly and generally responsive (although there are always unfriendly staff everyone, because some humans are just not very good at fulfilling their roles). E-mails work very well and very often, things get done and exceptional requests put up are very often acceded or at least, rejected with a proper explanation. Professors and tutors are also generally very approachable, negotiable and talkative (of course there are exceptions everywhere). They love to share insights, ideas and also about their personal experiences which again, contain lots of anecdotes that one can learn things from! They are also more straight-forward and express their opinions more directly! They always put up consultation slots, warmly welcome you and are totally patient with stupid questions.

I really enjoyed my stay in NUS and I am grateful for everyone I met there and spent time with. It is indeed worthy of its ranking and reputation!

TL;DR, NUS rocks!

I have an embarrassing problem, a bit NSFW, so ladies don't read it if you can't view it scientifically. 

In the middle of the night or in the mornings, I find myself erect and humping my bed unconsciously. And this can continue subconsciously for some time until I finally gain control of myself and either wake up or go back to sleep. It almost never results in ejaculation and it affects my sleep a lot. Googling this problem doesn't help because a lot of results are about dogs humping things. I just want to know, is there a name for this? Does anyone else have this problem?

 eh siaoeh u wanna act garang, sign on lah eh! Outside camp, I dun give a shit ABT ur NS, cos it is pathetic to boast of earning peanuts each month. I'm from a specialized force which most PPL probably NV heard of but I dun dare to boast ABT it. Everytime I just tell PPL my general vocation. Tell u what, although my unit is super garang when u know it, we all sleep in bunk most of the time, that is not cool. So, the next time someone boast ABT their NS garang experience, you can safely doubt that. Most of the time, like 90%, its sleep, slack, late night movies, Xbox PSP, maggi and wayang!

In reply to , I believe the best way to train your core and abs is to start doing hanging leg raises. If you are a beginner, I would suggest that you start with hanging knee raises. And depending on what your aim is, for example if it is for definition and aesthetics, dun forget to train your obliques and serratus anterior as well. Add in some twisting motion and resistance to your normal sit-ups and crunches, and you will soon see the results. 
As for the diet, if you want your abs to show, keep your body fat percentage low, all standard stuff eat less fatty or oily stuff. Remember to add in some cardio to burn off any additional fat. 

That's all for my advice :) All the best in your fitness journey.

Why is it that the libraries in NUS are not open to the public whereas NTU libraries are open to the public? i understand if I can't borrow books from the library since I'm not a student of NUS but why can't they just allow us to read them in the library instead? I know a few school that allow the public to have assess to their libraries just that they can't use the facilities.

I am decent looking guy. Sometimes while walking towards a girl I noticed her looking down at my groin area. It's not like I forgot to zip up or anything.

She probably wants the D but it makes me feel 'eye raped' and dirty after that. All I want to do next is to take 10 showers to cleanse myself.

Free giveaway! I'm one of those kids you see around NUS with very brightly coloured long hair and I've run a full range of colours in my 4 years here. But now that I'm graduating, I've to go back to black, so I'm thinking of giving away my dyes to any juniors who want it. Just drop a comment here letting me know what colour you want, I'll add you and then message to arrange a time to meet and deliver. Note that you'll have to bleach your hair, usually quite light (2-3 times) for the lighter colours, I'll give you advice for that and/or recommend my usual hairdresser who has pretty good rates. These are semipermanent so the colour fades over a few weeks. Available colours:
Jars, left to right then top to bottom:
- 1/3 jar white toner (neutralizes the ahbeng orange/yellow after bleaching to a nicer blonde)
- Small amount of black (closer to very dark blue, fades to rich blue then teal and green)
- two different kinds of dark red, one half jar and one just a bit left. Fades to light cottoncandy pink eventually.
- Dark reddish-purple, half jar. Fades to a tulip colour.

Tubes:
- Small amount of electric blue, this one needs lots of bleaching, fades to green.
- half tube neon pink, this Japanese brand is great. Very intense colour that fades to cottoncandy pink.

I'm not the luckiest guy with the opposite gender, but this is just a shoutout to a girl whom I got to know recently (embarrassment embarrassment but might as well cause confessions woohoooo)

I think her name's Elaine (spelling?), and iirc she's a freshie from FoS. She's impressionable, lively, gives an effervescent disposition and feels like a caring person:) shame I didn't manage to know her really better cause I was running all over the shop!!:/

So just wanna say that I would like to know you better! Though very unlikely our paths would cross again but....who knows?

From the guy who thinks you stand out more than your red hair :D

Hi I am responding to the gay guy from chem engineering. 

I am around 180cm, sporty but do not pump heavy iron in the gym. I pump something else.. anyway I am from the biz faculty, also going into year 3 next year and also looking for a guy to love me. 

But I am afraid to identify myself here so maybe we could work out a way to bring us both together?

Hi guys! It's troll knight once again. But I'm not gonna share a troll post today. I will share a story of guilt instead.

I was meeting my friend for dinner at a coffee shop tonight ,when a middle age Indian man came to beg for $2 from me to buy food. I judged his appearance immediately and concluded that he must be those kind of people who exploit the kindness of others and use their money to gamble, drink etc...therefore I told him to go away, but he still stood there. I gave him a pissed off look and passed him a $2 bill. After awhile, I saw him walking towards the mixed-vegetable rice stall and brought a packet of food with that $2 bill and went off.

My friend came shortly and i asked him, " what kind of ingredients can you buy from the mixed vegetable store with just $2 only?".

He replied, " $2 dollars, you are kidding me?? A rice with 2 kinds of vegetable (excluding meat) already cost $2.30".

His words struck my conscience like a hammer and made me realised my mistakes. I looked at my bowl of fish soup which cost $4.80 and I felt my ashamed of myself. After my dinner, I went around to look for the man in order to give him more money. Sadly he was no where to be found. I couldn't forget this incident until now...... I'm guilty for being so arrogant and judgmental to a person who threw away his pride to beg me for a simple meal, so that he can survive for one more day. 

I wished I could do more for him, but it's already too late. I learnt a valuable lesson today and I hope you people don't repeat my mistakes. Even in Singapore, there are a lot of unfortunate people out there ,who are struggling to survive on a day by day basis. We are fortunate enough to have lots of meat,rice and vegetable on our table for every single meal. These food may look mundane to us, however these are what these poor people dream and wish for ,everyday. No one has ever gone poor by sharing and giving, always lend them a helping hand.

So here's the story. I met a lady around her mid 30s at Starbucks. Her whole table was flooded with bills and medicine. She suddenly approached me and asked how old I am, and saying that she needed a guardian. She is homeless, orphaned and her husband is abusive. 

She then approached the starbucks staff to see if they can bring her XXX Hospital. The staff was merely 17/18 y/o and look distressed and helpless so I offered my help. This lady showed me all her hospital bills, passport, birth certificates etc. To my surprise, the bill states that she has mental illness (not sure what), been abused before and has been to the hospital several times. She was just discharged from Hospital A today. So I called Hospital A to ask about her medical history and what not, and if they can if possible come pick her up? I called a total of 3 hospitals. Here's what they said. All 3 hospitals have her medical records btw.

Hospital A: I'm sorry I can't pick her up as she is not unwell until she needs to be hospitalised. Please send her to hospital B or C if possible. 

Hospital B: Mam, I can't send an ambulance as if would cost $100. If she is well enough (CLEARLY SHE IS NOT? DUH), she may come to the hospital by her self and a doctor will attend to her. If you wish, you can come with her but the wait is 3h long. (It was 10pm and I have work the next day)

Hospital C: Hi thank you for your call. We are unable to send an ambulance. You can get her to hospital B if need, or our hospital if need. 

TO MY DISMAY, the 3 hospitals actually hesitated and unwilling to take her in. Yes I know, she is not bleeding, do not need immediate medical attention, but is she not worth that concern? Left with no choice, I approached my neighbourhood police. GUESS WHAT. The dear police officer claimed that she has been around for months and she is "like that de la". And I was like, "so you're just gonna leave her on the streets like that?" 

3 hospitals, 1 police station. All disregarded her just because she is "usually like that", "cannot be helped". And we claim to have the best medical services. I was then reprimanded by my parents for being nosey and what not. Yes perhaps she is faking her illnesses (well I did see medical proofs and social worker notes to her), but does that mean we shouldn't help her? 

What kind of society are we in? How can a hospital demand that she is not sick enough to be hospitalised? THEN WHAT IS THE HOSPITAL FOR. C'MON MAN 

I hope those in social work major could help improve this situation and assist those with mental illness. They need our help as well.

They are born, put in a box; they go home to live in a box; they study by ticking boxes; they go to what is called “work” in a box, where they sit in their cubicle box; they drive to the grocery store in a box to buy food in a box; they talk about thinking “outside the box”; and when they die they are put in a box.

As the distractions of the world fade away in the darkness of night, and you wait silently, fearfully in bed for sleep to take you, the weight returns. It slowly sits down on your chest, weighing it down, and seizes your mind. It reminds you of the feelings of helplessness in your life, the loneliness, the sidelong glances, the slow laughter and biting fists. You wrap your blankets around you, and tighter still, but the cold persists, lingering. The fear freezes your blood, and you dread the morning, the light, the people, the routine. the emptiness in abundance, the agonising pointlessness of it... It is tiring.

And yet when the dawn arrives, you decide to fight. You see time for what it is - the potential for hurt, but also the potential for change. You dig deep and recall, the dreams of a life that you once saw you would have, the joys you would know when you step into that world. You push, inch by inch against the weight of despair, and roar in fierce indignation, defiant against the judging eyes, against fate. You would not settle for this. This will not be the end. You would write your own story, not others, not anyone but you. The weight disappears in a flash. It paces silently, out of reach, but never really gone. And you know that you would have to fight again.

I met this guy today while walking towards medicine after lunching at kopitiam. He was quite good looking and most importantly, he was kind. I dropped my notes and they started to fly all over. But he was the only one who stopped and helped me to pick them up even though he was carrying bubble tea. I dint ask for his name cause he seemed to be rushing for time. The only thing I remember about him was that he was carrying a brown bag and was wearing a nerdy glasses. Thank you kind soul! Hopefully I can still see you around again!

I have a question for the ladies here, what would your response be if a guy inform you about your wardrobe malfunction? There was once where the back of the girl's skirt was up and i wanted to inform her (we were near the corridors of the toilet) but hesitated for a few moments - thought i might be called a pervert and of course she realized and adjusted. Thoughts? (I understand that I need to inform her to prevent her any further embarrassment)

Sorry this may not be relevant, but none of my friends are really interested in Pokemon or have played any of the games as far as I know, so short of me annoying everyone to death, I'd have nobody to tell this to.

I miss Pokemon so much, it's like a really big part of my childhood.. Though the only game I ever played was Pokemon Ruby, and I still remember the day I first got it and all the excitement I felt. (Thank you parents for buying it for me!!) 

I recently listened to the soundtrack again, it has really lovely music :') For anyone who feels the same way, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVrb7X134Hk here's the ending scene and credits. The (beautifully sad) ending song starts from 1:52. I feel like my heart breaks a little every time I defeat the Champion and watch the credits roll and Brendan/May cycling along the grass by the seaside, and all my Pokemon appearing onscreen one at a time as if to say goodbye...it just reminds me that a beautiful journey has come to an end :'( (although I never officially completed the Pokedex or anywhere close)

I still vaguely remember planting berries in the 'loamy soil' and forgetting about them after awhile.. and getting funny items for my Secret Base. and hopping around on the Acro Bike; pacing around Lavaridge Town trying to collect enough volcano ash for a Poke Flute; having my heart skip a beat whenever 'Oh! A bite!' appears while fishing..
It probably wouldn't feel the same way if I play it again now, I suppose. And I doubt my GBA is up for it either. It really was fascinating back then :')

Sorry if I've been silly/melodramatic, hehe. Sadly I doubt I'll ever outgrow Pokemon. I miss you, Blaziken.

As a pol science major, you hardly make friends and everyone fends for himself/herself. No matter how much you study, you can never pull above a B. Just feel like I cannot form opinions in class, or digest any of the readings. Fuck me. Fuck life. Just quit school flip burgers sua.

Honest opinions guys, do you mind if a girl doesn't shave down there? The feminist side in me feels that girls shouldn't have to conform to the stereotypes of women (cleanly shaven, no hair) perpetuated in porn, yet deep inside I can't help but to feel insecure and unsure about how my boyfriend/husband will perceive of my body.

All the doom and gloom over finals and the whatnots, how about something more lighthearted. If you find the crowd slow to disperse after finals, especially for those on the higher levels of MPSH (i.e. MPSH 2), there is an exit door at the end of the hall which leads straight down to the basketball court area. This saves me like a lot of time!!!

I find myself eyeing the Indian (as in legit from India) students (especially those with facial hair) these few days, whenever we're all gathered outside waiting for exams to start. Sadly I think most of them are in computing or engin so I don't get much of a chance to meet any of them. 

This is not a troll post! If you've figured out who I am,don't tag me though. Or I'll kill you hahaha. Unless you have a cute, single Indian male friend to introduce to me. Then we'll see. 

P.S: I'm Chinese.

I've read so many stories on confessions. Since it's only a few hours before my last paper, I, too, have a confession to make.

I saw you since the first day I came to hall. You were with a girl, and I was drawn to you from that instance. I kept my demeanor for fear others might know. And ever since that day, no matter how hard I tried, I literally couldn't get you out of my head.
I think of you in the midst of revision, during the late nights of last-minute reports and assignments, and even during weekends, when I'm alone in hall. I think of you during class, when I'm on the street, or even at nights before I sleep. You are so popular, almost everyone in hall knows you. I was too insecure of my own body, and I started becoming a health nut--going to gyms, running in the mornings, avoiding suppers...and deliberately staying away from you. Sometimes the temptations to get close to you are too strong, and it was hard for me to fall asleep, but I did anyway.

Tonight is the night that I had the courage to finally approach you. My self-restraining mechanism stopped functioning, I think it had broken down because I've used so much of it during this exam period. I couldn't take it anymore. I need you inside me.

Tonight, at 12.00am, I picked up the phone, dialed the number, and said :

"Hello boss, butter chicken and garlic naan tapao ok?"

I must say, after 2 years of staying in hall and consciously staying away from you, my life is, finally, complete with you, the glorious al-Amaan's butter chicken and garlic naan.

This is our tragic love story. She appeared in my life, when im a evergreen noob, who is always wondering how it feels to be love by a girl. I appeared in her life, when she is wondering how it feels to be love by a guy. We are like north pole and south pole, I remember the first day of school when we crossed our sight at LT, both of our face turned red like apple. I couldn't forget her after that incident, until one day I garnered enough courage to sit down beside her during lecture and started talking to her. I kneel down in front of her 2 months later and asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. 

Our relationship was a fruitful one, we never have any big quarrel before and we spent many precious moment together. I felt like the happiest man on earth when we went to bed. Getting a Korean girlfriend is like hitting the jackpot for a evergreen guy like me. Yeah, she is a North Korean citizen.

However, all these happiness are short lived. She disappeared from my life completely and till today I don't know if she is dead or alive. There was one night we are cuddling in her residence when her hand phone rang. She went outside to receive the call. She returned minutes later with tears in her eyes. I was worried then because I have never seen her so broken before. I hug her tightly for hours and tried all means to ask her what happened, but she refused to tell me anything. She finally kiss my forehead before telling me she has to return to North Korea immediately.I accompanied her to the airport afterwards, both of us remained silent for the entire journey as she refused to talk to me, I had a really bad feeling then, I never felt so lonely in my life before.

Before she board the flight to North Korea, we hug for a very very long time. She whispered to my ears and thanked me for all the things that I have done for her and told me to look for a better girl. I got furious and I held her hand tightly and refused to let her go. She slapped me and told me to stop being childish, I couldn't hold my manly tears back any longer as I loosen my grip.  She didn't turned back anymore as she walked away, I shouted to her "Will you come back?", but she still didn't turn back and continued walking. The world around me descend into complete darkness, that is the last time I saw her.

2 years have passed, I'm still waiting, day and night, feeling so helpless as there is no way to contact her at all!! I will always wake up in the middle of the night feeling that i have been stabbed in my heart . Whenever I looked into the mirror, I noticed that I have aged quite abit....

Hyon-suk! i really really missed you! I will never ever forget you and I will pray for your safety.

#Examwoes

Students are like cups: Some are full of water. Some are half filled with water. Some are empty of water.

And come exam, I like to think that I'm not empty at all. I am filled with fluffy air.

I'm so fluffy I'm gonna dieeeeeeeeeee XD

JY for the rest of the exams ppl =)

I actually hate going to mpsh for exams. Like ugh it's so old and the toilets... seriously -.- 
-
 
I don't like the fact that I'm the only girl in the whole gym when guys strip off to work out. Not sure if that's how they do it, or just to show off??? someone please explain
-
 
@ OMG! I thought I'm the only creepy one in science that has a crush on professor! I find this professor really handsome and sweet. He smiles like a sunshine and dazzled me in every lecture. But he is married.
Just glad I'm not the only weird one out there. 
-
 
 Are we not allowed to hold on to our phones? I thought the only instructions they read out is that you're not allowed to bring your phone to the toilet.
-
 
I saw this guy with his phone when the examiners are collecting the script. I'm not sure what I should do but I decided to keep quiet since I only see him taking it out after the exams. Am I wrong? 
-
 
I am a nus student who work part time at a fast food outlet and on this certain day i was cleaning this table when this lady told her child that he should study hard and not be like this khor khor
-
 
The first time we looked into each other eyes, I saw my future. I love your curly hair. I remember there was once you let your hair down during ME2135 lecture, it was smoking hot. Can you do it again tomorrow at ME2114 finals? Sorry I can't remember your name but you are pretty tall. Thank you <3

"Hey, do you hear that noise?" 
"Yea! It's coming from this hole right here. Adele tells me it comes from even deeper down."
"Oh right! She did say they've been doing that awhile already, saying they're the best and all. NATO... no clue when they're gonna actually come to the surface." 
SMU, still nowhere in sight huh.

I have been noticing a Year 4 medical female student who looks super young like a sec 4 girl. If that girl is seeing this, I just like to say you look cute and pretty !
-
  
It's the exam period and everyone is studying. So my close buddy, my gf and I were having lunch at YIH food junction. We were catching up and all when this douchebag in a black shirt came over to our table and told my close buddy "can you please don't talk so loud."

My big question to him is "If you need peace and quiet, WHY ARE YOU STUDYING IN A PLACE FOR EATING?!?!"
-
  
I am on SEP now and reading NUSWhispers really made me miss NUS. Feel like the culture in NUS is so much better. The people here are too arrogant and think they know it all but they are quite dumb and i'm pretty sure anyone in NUS can beat them hands down.

On a side note, I'm missing all the food in Singapore too! It's either fast food or overpriced and lousy Asian food here. I'm gonna start appreciating Koufu and Foodclique more. XD

about computing guys.. we control the computer and we love psychology girls coz they give us something computers can't. not because psychology girls are pretty (most of them are skinny and small, sorry!)
-
  
So this IS dude started pointing at a bigger sized female in the canteen and laughing about her weight, claiming that she's "fat" and her butt was 10 times the size of his. Luckily she did not hear. Seriously do you soc guys have no EQ/social skills at all? (Making generalizations here, sorry.)
-
  
after experiencing finals for the second time, one advice to all: beware of fake friends who only take advantage of you and try to push you down the bellcurve =)))

I have seen this Indian girl around in school several times. She looks really pretty and is very kind. I have twice noticed her playing with stray cats and puppies on campus. She almost always carries a box of baked goods. I know nothing about her except that she used to date a boy from business. :/

most of the medicine people that i've met/come in contact with are good-looking and mostly rich... and they have the brains too.. dayum some people just have it all :(

Greatest paradox in my life: every freaking cell inside me knows how to code DNA, synthesize proteins, form organic molecules etc. But I don't, so I have to mug them.

Just told a friend about NUS whispers and she said, "is it you go around NUS and go whisper to people in lectures or toilets?"

Exam tomorrow and I'm still watching dramas. Hate how I procrastinate.

Computing folks especially the guys are nerdy, skinny/fat, have poor social skills, poor dressing, poor presentation skills, poor writing skills and poor communication skills. I only see them sitting in front of the computer and watch porn. Why do they deserve 4K/month?
-
  
Nowadays before i start studying, i will watch motivational videos to get me through. 

Here's one that works best for me - "Why Do We Fall - Motivational Video by Mateusz M." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgmVOuLgFB0

Hope it works for you guys too! All the best for finals.

Dear Miss Librarian hovering at the counter of the Sci Library, I'm terribly sorry for mistaking my ezlink card as my matric card when I left the library and I apologise for troubling you for the immense inconvenience of pushing a button to allow me back in, but you don't need to blackface me and keep reminding me how I ought to know the rules, even instructing me to retrieve my matric card upstairs and return just to show it to you. It's my first criminal offence, can you please chill?

My boyfriend keeps singing "un un un un unbelievable" during reading week.

Who knows this song:

This city is for strangers like the sky is for the stars

I think it's very dangerous if we do not take what is ours ~~~

Someone someone? My favorite <33

Here is a quiz to warm up ur brains for finals :)
-
  
I'm a loner. I go to lectures alone. I go to tutorials and labs alone. I go for lunch and dinner alone. Cause I'm just tired of mingling around.  
-
  
So sian of studying. If only there isn't exam.
-
  
Found a piece of Frutips on my shoe sole. It wasn't blackcurrent flavour, so I threw it away.

My name is maggi, guess who am I?
-
  
PSA to all those studying on campus... Don't be that irresponsible jerk who leaves your stuff all around the place. I understand that you want to keep a place for yourself but you don't come sauntering in at 1130 when your things are here taking up 3 seats since 7am.

Med student in Med Library are like animals in zoo. They go in there just to chill between classes and chat loudly.

To the owner of a lost black wallet: I found it along the staircase in CLB. I returned it to the information counter at level 5.

It was already nearly midnight when my bf and I went back to our residence. The mood when we walked into the lounge was intense: all the students present had their brows furrowed, lips curled and eyes staring intently at the screen; as though their expressions of angst would intimidate whatever it was that they were doing to become easier. Fingers mashed away at the keyboards and mice as they furiously worked on whatever godforsaken task that they were damned to complete at this final hour. 

I voiced my thoughts of pity aloud "These guys must have it rough....rushing for a project all the way into the night even when it's already reading week?" 

Only to have my boyfriend correct me right away "Nah, they are just playing dota"

-
  
My first paper is this Friday and I haven't even downloaded the lecture notes yet. 
-
  
To all the ppl seeking places to mug over NUS, public study tables are not for hogged. You have the right to put (or clear) all the leftovers and use the table as you see fit and nobody gonna say a word about it (and they know they shouldnt)
-
  
Those people who talk in library, can you pls talk softly? You really disturbed my.....SLEEP :PPP (#fellasleepwhilestudying)
-
  
Camping at medicine library everyday for reading week makes me so happy. So many pretty girls and lots of freebies. 
Thank you NUS! I will definitely miss you in this last semester.

There is this extremely swagilicious girl who i always see around Utown. She's always decked in indie clothings. I LAV IT. For example, airy baggy long pants made from fine silk with printed elephant patterns  coupled with a casual white t shirt. HOW COOL IS THAT. She also wears sneakers and a snapback which i find pretty cute. She is basically chic. She is a little tan as well. One day, i will find her. And i will marry her. 
-
  
Has anyone watched the anime called Death Note? I sometimes wish that I can be like Misa with the special eyes, but instead of seeing how much lifetime you have, I can see what your current CAP is. That way I know who is lying when they say they are not closet muggers.

Never study communications - those waves will prolly kill your Y chromosomes, reducing your chance to get a son.

Dear Cheryl,

Forget the questions. Come over on your birthday, I'll bake you a cake. 

Sincerely,

I wonder what happened to the legendary hobo of S16 level 3
-
  
Cheryl why you liddat
I want to like, smuggle a chicken into hall and keep it as pet.
I wonder what's the name of that tall (roughly 6 feet tall) and buff freshie from SOC.. Keep seeing him around COM1 and utown bus stop for the past 2 semesters:)
This guy called kegan lim from yllsom is damn hot
From time to time, Utown will sell these cute plush Sheeps. I wanna hug and buy them but I'm a guy and I'm buff )):
It's the time of the semester again, when all of the utown study rooms are filled with a pungent smell. It's as if there were hobos camping in there.
There's this psych major girl who's like eurasian or angmoh mix or something. She was in my stats lectures in year one and I keep seeing her around. She's like so naturally sexy and she has this amazing brown hair and hazel eyes and I can't stop thinking about her. Sigh. I don't even know her name.
I wish recreational drug like marijuana was legal in Singapore. It would make life in NUS way more easier. 
#legalize420

Submit your own confessions at: http://nuswhispers.com
so someone wanted a sexual confession. here goes (;

it was 930pm early october at one of the libs. it wasnt too close to finals so there werent many people in the library. in my quiet corner there was only me and him. he had nice hair a chiseled face and some cute dimples. his tshirt barely hugging his slightly muscular body. i couldnt help but to eye him every few minutes hoping he would glance back. 

minutes later he caught me looking at him omg and i startled nearly fell back and he let out a laugh breaking the silent atmosphere. 

he then walked towards me and asked in his deep voice " hey you alright?" 

"yeah. im fine.... " i stuttered. 

his dark brown eyes looking into mine, i felt the blood rushing to my cheeks. i bit my lip hoping he would get the message. 

"wanna take a walk with me? " he gestured towards the door. 

we exited the library walking out into the night. it was cool windy and I had this really lifting sensation inside me. he was by my side and we walked on. he hadnt even asked for my name. 

we then stopped at a place enjoying the view while holding the railings. i looked at his face, his hair blown back with the wind eye intense as he surveys the external surroundings.

i felt a warmth on my hand. it was his. we locked gazes again more intensely this time. 

"this moment will never come back. lets make the most of it" he said. 

what happened next? dont tell you.

When a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a big thing in your face... you get sprung. Girl, I wanna get witcha.
Although you are stingy but as this semester comes to an end, it will be three months without you. You are dark, handsome but not tall. Let us work towards a Singapore of boundless love together. 

I will miss seeing you in school, Br**nann P***.
So sad the Asian mini wok guy in pgp has left :(
Hello people out there in nus! -from YIH level 4. 2.54am
I like how you blow a huge bubble with bubble gum and it bursts all over your face, because when you suck it back in it's sure to make your face cleaner because it would have caught onto stuff on your face like food particles or dirt.

(NUS student on SEP in the States!)


I see people grumbling about Hell Week this and Hell Week that. Truth is, every week is Hell Week for Engineering undergrads.
I am so sick of the food in NUS. Ayam penyet, shui jiao mian, cai fan... What else can I eat... TT
I swear orange is better!
