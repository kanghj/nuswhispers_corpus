So I was looking through talentconnect for a list of jobs aaaand.... Most of them need some knowledge on coding. A tad bit difficult for machinists such as myself, who don't know how to code at all. Like, at all. 

Welp, time to pick up something new~

Pardon the bad grammar, because this was written at 3am with a vengeful spirit:

"Hold on to your horses here, because I'm going to give you the -- rant of 3000 characters about why this module should be thrown into Satan's bottom and left there to rot like this piece of devilish shit it is. First and foremost, to have Quantitative Reasoning as a compulsory module for the general student population in the name of holistic-f*cking-education is a totally absurd idea and a crazy one to implement. Kudos to whoever who had the courage to even suggest a form of punishment like this, and pity to those who had to organise this failed education outreach. I had wasted 4 Modular Credits on trying to grasp concepts my -- friends found was a "free A for the taking". The sort of academic imbalance that you may have observed over the time of teaching this module might give you a slight hint as to what the problems some of us are facing in learning the module, but you guys don't take advice really seriously do you? I bet you, as the poor soul trying to go through all the comments for this module must have given up reading this piece of prose right now. You know what? THIS IS THE SAME FEELING I GET WHEN I'M FORCED TO STUDY FOR A MODULE I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE. Bloody f*cking hell. Secondly, let us just take note of some of the finer details in this module which you all may do well take notice. For one, GENDER IS NOT BINARY. The convenient separation of the human race into "male" and "female" may be useful for this module BUT THAT'S NOT HOW THE WORLD WORKS. Take a module in -- and you'll know why, but oh, you won't want to put yourself through that sort of torture, do you? Also, ETHNIC GROUPS ARE NOT AS CLEARLY DEFINED like the CMIO that you like to conveniently cite as an example. What the f*ck is an "OTHER" race anyway? Seriously, if you cannot check these sort of facts clearly for your studies, how do you expect us to take your module seriously and submit ourselves to your statistics and logic? If you want to attempt at an holistic education, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD PLEASE AT LEAST MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IT'S A GENERAL EDUCATION MODULE AND NOT A STATISTICS MODULE THAT EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE. If you're going to attempt at a "General Education" module please make it either equally easy for everyone, in which case I believe you may feel that there is no f*cking point anyway, or make it equally difficult for everyone, in which case I don't think you'd want to face the consequences anyway. For my conclusion of this rant that I feel sorry for the reader who has to be forced to read this, if this rant has touched your life, amused you, made you feel angry in any sort of way, please bring this up to the higher academics in the ivory tower, because this sort of badly planned, badly organised, poorly thought out, clearly uninspired, extremely forced and half-baked idea has no place in a first class academic institution we all hope the National University of Singapore is. Thank you for reading this. I really hate this mod"

regarding the CA marks being the same as average mark, what if there is no final exam for the module? :( the CA takes up 60% of the mod, along with an essay assignment taking up 30%. tbh i think that given that it is a non-FASS module, the prof wouldn't really know how to differentiate the standard of the essays :\

 First year CS student here just like you. I don't think "hard" is a good reason for you to give up. You should ask yourself whether your passion for CS no longer motivates you to get past the hurdle. If it's true that the spark is no longer there and you don't wish to rekindle it, then yes I think you should find another path instead. Give a chance to those who'd like to accept the challenge. There's no right or wrong here, stay true to yourself!

In fact I'm also struggling with my assignments, having trouble understanding the lectures and often need to revisit the webcast over and over again. Sometimes I spent a whole day just to figure out the answer for a single question. It can be depressing yes, but hey what's the point of learning if everything looks dumb and easy?

I suggest that you should sign up for Summer Orbital Programme to have a taste in how CS would be like? The answer you're looking for is not from others but yourself. You have one whole semester break to think about it :)

Graduation is looming. Can I say that I don't wanna adult just yet. GRADUATION ANXIETY IS REAL.

Replying to 
ISE grads are able to find jobs, just that you need to sell yourself well. To get through the first stage, you require a good resume. Get help from the career centre. It works wonders. 
After getting through the first stage, talk abt systems thinking, big picture, data analysis, statistics, coding & HFE in your interview. You can impress the interviewers if you can link the concepts well tgt. We provide a completely different type of skill sets as compared to biz/typical engineers. Many of my friends are able to find jobs in typical banks/engineering/consulting firms. Good luck! :)

While everyone is thinking about the finals, here I am thinking about Captain America Civil War. Seriously, the movie gives me more anxiety and excitement than the exams :X

Given how the topic of plagiarism was in the news over the weekend, I wonder how many students know what plagiarism means. I read one confession where a student said that copying your seniors work is not plagiarism.

Should I Give Up Computer Science If I Find It Hard? I'm on the end of my first year in Comp Sci and I feel like I need to do a lot more work than others to achieve the same goals (don't know how true this is, but I have asked some people I've gotten to know during studies, that how much time they use for weekly assignments and they don't use nearly as much as I do). Because of that, I am starting to question if this field of study is wrong for me. I would like to know if that you guys ever struggle with programming during your studies, or was it always just easy and logical?
-
 
Admins please don't filter this. Do TAs (PhD students) assigned to our practical groups know who we are? Can they access they IVLE photos of students, just like the profs?

Reason why I am asking this is because there is this TA who sent a linkin friend request twice (I don't have linkin btw) to my email account. I do not know if it's some virus causing this because my other group mates said they didn't get this request....

I am thinking that the TA do not know who I am, that's why I kept suspecting that a virus on his account must have caused his linkin to send a friend request to my email. So am I right to think that TA really don't know us?

Advice from a senior: If you are going to form a project team, do it like how you forming a DotA team; all "carries" or all "supports" team wont cut it, you need a good mix.

As for situation when the professor forces an "all-random" team without giving the students a chance to pick their team, then be smart and sacrifice yourself if there is a lack of "supports".

Now that CLB is open 24/7, I can cry over finals in a conducive environment. Thanks NUS.

One of the few rare moments that I will take time off my readings to do this nuswhisper thing - i just enjoy the reading.

Anyway i'm a law student and I am suffering from depression too. But hey, the grass is always greener on the other side - I always tell people that I envy doctors - at least they are useful in times of emergency and wars, lawyers are really useless if the world/society decides to be barbaric or in a chaos, disorder etc.

Anw, I hope this instills in your some encouragement that you are privileged to render assistance to people in a meaningful way. Even though I'm a law student, I do read up on medical textbooks on conditions to help people around me - hey why waste the resources for the fees i'm paying right? Haha.

Anw, do seek medical help. I am seeking medical help but stopped due to financial issues. But hey, at least it did help me to get where I am right now - mugging for finals. You should too. On days where I'm sane, i'm glad i sought help, else I can't imagine how my family would get through the many problems I have helped them with.

Try and see the positivity your job may bring to others' life and hopefully that can motivate you to persevere in the course and what not. It seems from your med senior, your anxiety issues are not uncommon so fret not, you're not alone.

Like what your senior said, practicing medicine is secondary. i do think since you are in your second year, you should persevere till the end of the course.

All the best!

"I like taking time to understand complex science/math stuff."

Please cherish that; not many people have the ability to understand true maths. Don't destroy that to gain some short sighted means.

Also, why not go for further studies? You will have a higher chance of getting your lucky break. 

From someone who is in the same position as you.

Recently, I was allocated to this group for a camp that i signed up for and I was quite disappointed at the allocation of the counselors. I wonder why the PD group all the fun and popular people together while leaving me with the not so fun people?  The freshmen camp directors should note that allocation of seniors should be done with greater care so that the freshies do enjoy the camp at the end. Maybe I should join another camp instead on the pretext that I am busy.

Just a suggestion: Perhaps the NUSWhispers team can expand its app/website to reflect the newly available Facebook emojis on the posts apart from just the "likes"? 

And would it also be possible to reflect likes on comments and replies to comments as well? 

I think it would make the app/website a lot more comprehensive. Keep up the great work so far!

Prof: So which precinct or new town in Singapore have the most number of poor people?

Senior here. To me it seems like you're just taking a little more time to get used to the transition from preclinical to clinical. Unfortunately, certain examinations (such as the upcoming second year clinical examinations) do have a showmanship angle to it, and being nervous does affect your performance, especially as a second year student starting out on clinicals. Many seniors, even 4th year students, will tell you that many of them are still overwhelmed by anxiety prior to their OSCEs.

I would suggest that you form a tight study group, preferably with positive people who can motivate you. Doesn't matter where they stand academically. Practice together, study together. Ask each other questions you're too embarrassed to ask your clinical tutors/supervisors. Get familiar with your materials so it rolls off your tongue without you needing to fish it out from your memory through all your anxiety. As time goes by and you build your confidence, you'll start a positive cycle of reinforcement that helps you keep improving!

And don't forget the helpful seniors around! NUS medicine is a heartwarming place with a strong network of support from seniors who don't have a moment's hesitation in taking time off to help juniors, all without any ulterior motive. I'm sure you would've witnessed it yourself from the numerous student led revision sessions conducted by seniors volunteering in all these programmes.

For your psych conditions, I would advise you to seek help from professionals. Hurting yourself is not going to do anyone any good.

As for your career, that is a decision you'll need to make yourself. Perhaps consider consulting people who know you best and will have your welfare at heart. But in the event that you choose to stay on, there are less stressful fields you can consider. After HO year that is.

In any case, take care! No matter where you end up, minimum retirement age is still 62 (and possibly rising). Everyone on this site still has a long way to go, and the only things that enable you to keep going are your physical and psychological well-being.

On a side note, I am extremely disappointed by the comment on the reply post . It serves nothing more than to add fuel to the flame. We can all get further with more encouragement. Yet you chose to focus on your assumptions of others' intentions, of which you have no means of confirming. Is that bitterness? Or an attempt to take the moral high ground? Maybe just trying to make a snide comment? Well, whatever the case, I wish you (commenter) luck in your career. Because no one likes a smart mouth.

I'm new to NUS but why I see that welfare pack differs from faculties? Aren't the items all from NUSSU? I only have one but my friends in Science gotten two bags instead. Why is NUSSU being bias here?

Alright I need some advice here too!
I'm a member for quite a large scale project (worth 8MC since it is 2 modules combined together). I noticed that 2 of the members in my group are not contributing at all to this project. They did not even bother to ask or try and play their part in writing the project documentation which was due recently. Peer evaluation is coming...

Remember Bill? Bill just checked his school email for the first time this semester and saw that he missed 3 tests, 5 group meetings and 6 deadlines. He also saw all the spams from Engineering. Stress and disappointment pushed Bill off the edge.

Also, this might not have happened if Bill had more friends on Mooder to steer him away from such recklessness. View Bill's last words on www.mooder.com/bill_nus

This is a genuine call for help, admin please dun filter this as I am despo for help. 

My project involves making an animation that will bring across the main idea of a research paper. I chose a topic on Molecular Biotechnology, thinking research paper is not very different lecture notes. Hell no… 

So is there any kind souls from Life Science willing to help out in the interpretation of the research paper? I promise you pizzas and movie ticket to ‘The divergent series: allegiant’ or any other movie of your choice.

I dislike modules which require ask us to study the topics ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ when only the topics P, O, R and N came out as questions during the exams. Some FASS mods are like that. Then the hardworking students who put in all their effort into every topic except P, O, R and N, will not perform as well as the lucky person who focused just on these few topics. As time and our cognitive load are limiting factors, it is impossible for us to focus on every topic. So stop reminding us students to avoid spotting the topic/questions especially when you set the papers this way. If you want us to study topics A to Z, then you should test all topics from A to Z. Or at least let us choose the questions we want to do from A to Z.

My groupmates think I'm freeloading, for sure. I wish I could explain it to them in some way, or justify myself, but it will just sound like an excuse.  

The truth is, I've been insanely busy this past few weeks because I'm taking extra mods in Year 4 (but they won't care, nor will they understand. One is an exchange student, the rest are year 2s), AND I work best based on time pressure, which means I usually leave things till a little later, but at the end of the day, I WILL still get work done, and done with decent quality. 

But even now as I will do my part and contribute it to the group project, it's too late - their impression of me is sealed. But yes, while I acknowledge that I'm terrible at keeping to internal timelines and I should be faulted for it, I just feel frustrated because I really don't know how to prove that I'm not trying to freeload, I'm just slow. 

They'll probably think I'm contributing out of fear that I'll get marked down now, but I'm not. Fu- (T__T)

Why is the application for financial aid so early this time round? I was anticipating to apply for it only around May and I got a rude shock when i realized that it has already closed on 1st April. Was looking to email them when i realized they had removed their email, and directed all questions to their faq and this stupid "ask a question" thing. Why make things so difficult for students? So quick to collect money from students and yet so stingy/slow when it come to financial aid matters. Hell, even my junior college provides more subsidies and aid in one year than what NUS gives me in two. Bullshit.

life science year 1 here, i just want to ask if the splitting of the cohort for the allocated mods in year 2 will be the same as year 1 because i really dont know anyone from the other half of the cohort, if they were to mix us up again, i will be so lost.

In my imagination, I could approach my groupmates and shout at them for dumping the work on me. Then they will cower and beg for forgiveness. But I will go straight and complain to the prof, and the prof totally emphatises with me and tells me, "I knew you were doing all the work for them. I was waiting for you to finally come report them." Then he fails all my groupmates and they cry as I smirk and walk off. Serves them right.

But of course, that is just my imagination.

CS is probably one of the best degrees around. Being a physics graduate student myself, here is my take. I read a couple posts talking about the overrated CS degree when they suddenly became AAA/A, the "easily-outsourced" CS jobs, and that CS can be easily self-taught. I'm afraid you got CS mixed up with simply computer programming or IT work. CS is more than that. It is a way of thinking, and probably a way of life. 

CS is basically about algorithms, and algorithm is an invaluable tool in fundamentally understanding how the world and ourselves work. If you think about it, everything in life is about processes, for example, what actually led to the day you were born, or what is the cause of some people being luckier than others. It is very complicated and there are so much possible causes for certain events in life, but because it is very much intellectually and emotionally easier to create simple models for ourselves to understand, we tend to treat a lot of information as extraneous material.

However, if you have in depth understanding in CS, you will be trained on how to see a problem, think of a formula which will solve the problem, and then test this formula to see if it works. A good formula is one which has a high percentage of solving the problem, regardless of the scenario. A hypothetical example, you are a business owner, and you are always losing out to your rival. If you are a layman, you may think maybe it's because your rival is simply more lucky with the 财神 statue in his shop. However, if you are slightly more inquisitive, you will know there must be reasons why he is succeeding and you are not. That is the problem at hand. So next comes the formula. Because in today's complex economic, political or business environment, it is almost impossible for you to keep track all the possible factors affecting your business, even though you might actually know what they are. However, thanks to computing technology, it accelerates the process of gathering information based on your specific instructions, and it may even help you predict what you should do to improve your "luck" to a good extent. Therefore CS teaches you how to look beneath the surface and think if there is a step-by-step logic for something which may appear to be empirical or miraculous.

CS is something that's easy to learn but very difficult to master, just like Fappy Bird. (Yea FYI I am still playing that game :-P) And mastery of CS is actually what distinguishes between the person whose job can easily get outsourced, and the person whose job cannot be replaced by cheaper alternatives. In fact, I think even a lifetime isn't enough to master CS. This is because the applications are seemingly boundless, unless it can be proven mathematically that a particular problem cannot be solved via computation, and then someone will try to prove that it can be solved and so on. Therefore those who think CS is trivial or easy just because they can write a few lines of code shouldn't smug. You simply don't know that you don't know. 

Nonetheless, every degree has its strengths and weaknesses. Maybe the employers may beg to differ,  but I strongly believe every degree is a good degree as long as you actually learn something from it. There is no point just barely passing through university and at the end of day, you learn nothing and your thinking and communication skills doesn't make you behave like an educated graduate. I suggest you guys should choose a major based on your interest, rather than which industry is growing or how much is the earning potential. And I hope to hear more of you guys of different faculties exchanging what they have learnt instead of demeaning the degrees of others. And on a final note, treasures can be found in dumping grounds, because no one expects to find it. Thanks for reading my geeky post. All the best, guys!

Due to all the talks about what degree is "best", what job is the most stable, I'll chip in.

First, things come in cycles. In the early early days of video games, there were an explosion of consoles, games, and companies. The result was a torrential stream of shitty games made at low budget and care. The result? the 1984 North America gaming industry crash. Most console manufacturers went out of business, as were most companies. PC stayed afloat due to its role or "solving all the world's problem", Then it revitalized with the dominance of Japanese company: Nintendo and Sony. And later Microsoft. Of course we all know about the dot com burst. Right now, we are experiencing the pre 1984 boom, but in the mobile sector. Streams of lazy copy cat games made with low effort or talents. Or the digital equivalent of crack heroin, ala Candy Crush and Clash of Clans. I'm just dying to see a crash any days down. The console in also in its way to doom town with all games being more and more expensive to make; and profit less guaranteed.

Same thing with the investment sector, banking, real estate, etc ... If you look hard enough, you see that it's in cycles.

Anyway, my point is: there's always a cycle to things. The engine for growth has always been "creative destruction". Things that are inefficient are destroyed to pave way for more efficient ways. Of course people, relationships, communities, bonds are trampled in the process. Steel workers, welders, factory workers' children had to learn how to become software makers, lawyers, or for that matter shop attendant. Their pay and economic security are not exactly better than their parents, if not worse. They have to move more frequently, change company more oftenly, etc ...

The difference with this generation is the pace of change is much faster than before. It used to be a generation thing; now it changes twice per generation or so. People just can not adapt. Failure and frustration abound. Which coincidentally gave rise to the likes of Donald Trump, Marie Le Pen, the UK Independent Party. They promise economic security, revival of the middle class, and traditional values. Sound familiar?

I had a Science degree and since then worked in various research institutes. We were hit hard by the cut in public funding; but so far, we were stil going strong (partially thanks to various collaborations with industry). We are less basic research and more on the applied side so we were not hit as hard. Yeah we are among the ivory tower few. Personally, the field that fascinates me the most is history, politics, and military. I love creative writings. I spent a lot of time in FASS. But I realized early in my life is those things aren't gonna pay my bills. So that's a hobby for me. My degree, a slightly more practical one did pay my bills. 

Some of my favourite authors are from the social science field: Edward Luttwak, and David M. Glantz (the number one authority on WWII, Eastern Front, and Red Army). I admire the top researchers in history. They are people who can speak, read, and write several languages and slave over piles of records. These are some of examples of self-published studies by Glantz.
http://www.glantzbooks.com/
They are hundred pages books, also in the hundred. You can imaging how many volumes of orders, staff briefings, maps, after-action reports he had to go through to compile all those.

But you know what? He's also not an ivory tower academic type. He's a retired Colonel of the US Military. Colonel being the highest officer rank before you have "General" in your title. Typically, once you get to generals, you are a professional soldiers. Most military academics hold Col. and below. Coincidentally so does coup leaders. 

And Edward Luttwak, some of the most fascinating writer ever. He influenced my writing styles. He a self-styled military strategist, writer, advisor to various governments and militaries, cattle rancher, military contractor (aka: mercenary). He did have a PhD. In Mathematics. 

These are people whose hobby paid them well. But before that point, they had a very technical career.

Should I study Chemical Engineering? Everyone seems to find the major difficult but at the same time rewarding (in terms of job prospects). I also hear that it is a very dry course. Any advice from those in Chem Eng? Also, why is it that the Chem Eng cohort is much larger than the cohort in other Engineering departments? 
-
 
 I am from FASS. You painted a very rosy picture. Here I am going to be brutally honest. It's very rare for a person to admit this. My major is impractical and does not make bread and butter. They are useful only for the ivory towers academics. In fact, I disagree with how the whole subject is carried out in the university. There are indeed useless subjects in FASS. I don't want people to be deceived by the university. And I am sure that there are other subjects in other faculties which are useless as well. Just that no one is brutally honest to admit it.

To the OP of , I'm from a major that requires a lot of lab work and lab report writing weekly and I gotta tell you that I have really had no proper weekends since my freshman year. People can guess I either read chemistry or pharmacy. My friends and I used to compare our course to arts and humanities which only have one lecture once a week per module and tutorial in the alternate weeks (based on our small sample size of a few arts mod that we took before). We don't see them do readings and write essays at home so we can't feel it. Pardon me because comparing is just a human nature of responding to why we are different in terms of sex, race, skin colour, religion, gender and culture. I know it's bad but I didn't change until I am in my honours years. I start to know some arts friends who are first-class students and they usually camp at...the science library daily from 7 am to 930 pm. They work as insanely hard as any first-class folks from other majors and their theses are as thick as textbooks. So the learning point is that we have studious and slacking people everywhere. Every major is unique in its own and the challenges are different. There isn't a standard way that can measure the toughness that one has to go through in every single major and most importantly, all the different majors make the society.

To me, the ultimate purpose of education is tolerance.

To the op of 18602:

 Lol what a troll. Skill sets are cyclical; we only see Computer Science making a comeback after a decade in the doldrums. What you study probably doesn't matter in your jobs, but it does give you the mindset to tackle problems and frame issues. Hence many PSC scholars are permitted to study "useless" subjects such as Literature or History; it's the disciplinary training which counts that later help them to run the government. Gahmen not stupid hor, being so practical, u think they allow their top scholars to study "useless" degrees?

Engineering is a sunset industry in Singapore. Read the news about the increasing retrenchment in manufacturing industry. Computer Science is the best degree right now. As always, FASS and FOS (excluding stats) are dumping grounds and useless to the new economy.

I was just googling my profs (procrastinating i know) and I am really really impressed by how they are so knowledgeable!! Its quite sad to see that most of them are not able to fully impart their knowledge during lectures due to their strong accents/poor teaching/not-so-good notes. Also, quite sad that students are not giving them enough respect. I mean, if you are not interested in learning then at least keep quiet and let them teach other students who are interested!!

I'm a year 3 student and i think that my professors have been doing a good job teaching and guiding us all these while. However this sem i met a prof who has not behaved like all the other good profs that i've met. He has literally been sitting and doing nothing while students learn nothing new from his lectures and tutorials. The worst part is that the projects that he gives are way above what we have learnt and the help that he provides are nothing but copy and paste. This prof is over qualified in terms of his academic qualifications but his teaching methods are way below anything i've seen. I think the whole course is really pissed with him but no one has yet to officially complain including me cause i think the school will support such a qualified prof.

I need to get some advice from you guys :) There's always this part of me that wants to do comedy in Singapore. I always find joy in bringing laughter and also I dont mind making myself a joke. Afterall, that brings laughter to people too right! 
But then again, I'm not talking about the Kumar level. More of the Conan O'Brien or Ellen Degeneres etc kind of stuff. I'm not too sure whether Singapore's 'comedy industry' has great potential? Do you think I should venture into it? Thanks :)

I feel like I got cheated. I applied internship to a company that said "No prior experience, does not matter which major you are studying, just need the willingness to learn. On the job training provided." So I submitted my resume and cover letter and I got rejected promptly. Not even an interview chance or anything. Eh, you have high standards then just state them omg! I met all your requirements!

One step closer to working at Mcdonalds.

Hi hi! I'm currently in year 2 pursuing a DDP in BBA and Economics, but I personally feel that I am not learning much from Biz school (it's not about the school or the course, but more like my compatibility). I'm really enjoying my Economics modules thus far. 

I'm considering dropping my DDP to single degree and take up a second major (either in Engineering or Science), because I think I will learn more as compared to my BBA. 

My concerns are my ASEAN scholarship, MOE tuition grant (any restriction they have?) and whether it is advisable to switch from such DDP to such double major (my senior says it's actually a good DDP to keep). I don't mind overloading (i'm used to it really). Does anyone have any advice on this or have done something similar before? :/

I got dumped because studying at NUS is apparently so time consuming that he couldn't manage being a relationship anymore. It's been weeks, and another two to reading week.

 There will be a DOTA course offered in Semester 1, AY16/17, by the Department of Mathematics, Department of Statistics and Applied Probability as well as the School of Computing.

MA3265/ST3265/CS3265: Gaming Using Mathematical Thinking

Sypnosis:
This is a first course in gaming. Gaming is interdisciplinary and fun. However, good gamings often have good fundamentals and understanding of complex situations before being able to make decisions. Unlike chess, bridge or poker, the real-time nature of the game often requires practice to maintain skill levels.

This course is designed for someone who is new to gaming. In the first four weeks, skills required for real-time games are introduced. These include manipulation of equipment, muscle memory, making use of communication channels and understanding how teams operate.

In the next five weeks, the course takes on a more mathematical slant, where the course focuses on problem-solving in a wide variety of gaming situations. These include optimisation problems, solutions to coupled systems, weakly and strongly interacting systems, understanding force-plays, tactics and strategy.

The course takes a breather for one week where competitive gaming psychology is introduced as perturbative techniques in competitive gaming.

The last three weeks are application-based. The game of DOTA is formally introduced at this point with an analytical approach.

It is hoped that the student will acquire skills consumerate with that of an analytical thinker, allowing him or her to easily pick up games.

Topics:
Week 1: Computer and Clicking Techniques
Week 2: Reflex Conditioning
Week 3: Communication for Gaming
Week 4: Team Dynamics, Teamwork, Coupled Systems
Week 5: Solving Multi-variable Optimisation Problems
Week 6: Mathematical Modelling in Gaming Problems
Weeks 7 and 8: Approximate Solutions to Non-Analytic Problems
Week 9: Decision Trees and Game Theory
Week 10: Psychological Methods in Gaming
Week 11: Application to Simple DOTA Fundamentals: Character Choice, SWOT, Real-Time Gaming Calculations
Week 12: Application to Simple DOTA Problems: Optimisation in Laning, Skill Trees, Meta and Anti-Meta Tactics
Week 13: Special Topics in DOTA: Competitive Gaming Strategies

Assessment:
10 x weekly assignments (2% each) -- best 10 of 12. Starts in Week 2. The weekly assignments can be in the form of solving puzzles, answering problems or playing certain game aspects.
1 x Project (20%): analysis of a competitive game (e.g. in the Shanghai Major).
2 x Written Mid-Terms (10% each) -- Week 7 (first half of module) and Week 13 (second half of module)
1 x Competitive Game (20%) -- proposed to be the first Sunday of the examination week.
There is no final examination for this module.

Lessons:
2 weekly lectures
SL1: Monday and Thursday, in S17-03-04 (Math Department, Computer Lab 1), from 0800 to 1000.
SL2: Tuesday and Friday, in S17-03-04 (Math Department, Computer Lab 1), from 1600 to 1800.
Weekly tutorials, 1 hour each, starts in Week 2.

Time allocation:
3 hours/week for lectures.
1 hour/week for tutorial.
2 hours/week for project.
4 hours/week for self-study of the module.

Pre-requisities:
None, but a good mathematical background is welcome for the complex in-head calculations required in gaming.

Ideally the student should also have a CAP of 4.0 and above prior to reading this module.

There is no prior need to know DOTA before reading this module; this module is self-contained. There are good tutorials to read for knowing DOTA as a game in the general sense.

Just submitted my application for NUS accountancy! Can't wait to start school, participate in sexually-themed orientation games, meet tons of superficial friends, murder each other over CAP, lose countless hours of sleep, get my degree and work in an accountancy firm so that I can work my ass off to pay my student loans, car debts, house debts and eventually make plenty of kids to set them off on the same route as me :) life is exciting!!

How do you deal with people with huge ego? I have this group member he always thinks that the work he contributed is the most inportant & yes he actually did say it out in front of the team. But the thing is other members are able to do his work too just that we have split the work such that he is in charge of that part...

Choice 2 if you know what you want and are able to get it. 

Choice 1 is very risky if you are really not doing anything real and have limited skills transferability. I assume you are in one of the banks headquartered in Europe since there are allegations of ML-TF. Lolol although I think all banks are probably involved in some ML-TF unknowingly or knowingly

Anyway foreign banks are currently in a structural reform state (tough to make money with high cost of funding and increasing regulations). I think most banks have bonus cut across fmb office this year.

Plus outsourcing risks are real. Take a look at the B & S if you are not in them.

This is more for graduates - Bank MA programs are/were considered to be good options. But I will now advise people to explore more and chiong for other opportunities first. And even within MA programmes, I think it is good to plan ahead and consult those who are in it for at least 3 years to get a sense of your actual daily job scope. Hahah you all should ask career services to kope the alumnis back for advice.

To 

TLDR: Move when we are still young so as not to get stuck when we have more commitments. 

I would totally agree with you on the inflation of hiring requirements. From what I hear from recruitment talks on why most banks hire grads is for the ability to problem solve, question the status quo and propose feasible suggestions. However, if the job/team does not require such a quality, I would think proficiency in English would be sufficient.

If your job is what you say it is, have you asked your hiring manager why is there such a difference in job scope? Have you spoken to your supervisor on your personal development and how you could participate in strategy planning/implementation projects/testing?

To add on to , have you considered why your job still exists? Is it because it is cheaper to hire a local instead of a team in a low-cost country due to a higher proficiency in language/faster speed to the market? Or is it because the company thinks such requirements are short-term and is not willing to invest in technology? Also, what value have you added to your team such that other firms/teams would be willing hire you? Is it because you are faster, better and has implemented this strategy which has reduced the cost to your firm by $x? It would be the same for negotiating salaries right? If a salesperson can bring in $200million worth of revenue, the firm would gladly pay this guy, lets say, $1million + $x bonuses.

Outsourcing is very real and it not only affects the more senior staff. Also to , my management has shared stories whereby they have asked teams to look for new jobs as their functions have been relocated to lower-cost country or replaced by technology.

Given that you are still young and have less financial-burden, I’m assuming, I would think Option 2 would be a better choice. Even though there will likely be a pay cut (your pay is very high btw, as compared to current MA programs at banks), maybe you would find a sufficiently challenging role where you will able to solve the problems at hand and add value to the team and in turn gain the transferrable skills for future employment and move up the corporate ladder. Sort of like collecting trophies to show, hey I did this there and I can do this here!

So the next question is: How do you find something that you think you would enjoy and be good at? I was always advised to talk to many different people, get to know what they are doing, what skills they require for their jobs. And I guess that would be a good start. 

On the relevancy of your degree to a job: I would say that most people are currently doing something which is totally unrelated to their degrees and would rarely see the topics in course content appear in their day-to-day work. And yes, I do agree that post-grads are doing something really specific related to their post-grad degree. Is it because companies only hire post-grad holders specific to those roles? Or is it because their jobs require the knowledge that they have decided to further their studies to aid them in their daily work? 

Other than post-grad degrees, if you are staying within banking, there are many other certifications that you can take which are less costly which may help you make your next move. CPA for audit/operational controls, CFA for corporate finance, CFMAS for sales & trading, ICA for compliance, CAMS for anti money laundering.

I wish you all the best ☺

Dear 18496, and here I am with a 2nd class engineering degree working my ass off with OT everu week for slightly over 3k. 

Wanna exchange job?
-
 
I graduated from NUS from Faculty of Science. Now I am a "professional" letter opener and admin raking in about S$5K to 6K per month working for a non-local bank, although I am given the job title "Executive". My work doesn't require me to do much thinking or apply anything I've learnt from university. I get to go home at about 5pm everyday and my girlfriend always end about two to three hours later. It may feel pretty awesome considering the minuscule workload with a relatively good paycheck. I feel very comfortable. But I am not sure if this comfort zone is merely illusory.

This seems to an economic problem. When I applied for this job, the job scope listed include planning strategies and those business related stuff. But in reality after 3 years at work, I did not get to do these stuff at all. The prerequisites include a good degree of any major from an accredited university (e.g. NUS). And this is where I found it really stupid. The entry requirements for so many jobs has been raised, and giving exclusive access of jobs to those with higher education, while reducing opportunities for non-graduates. However, I feel that there are simply not enough jobs to match the uni level training since it is unrealistic for our economic system to provide them. So basically I am a degree holder doing a job which I could have easily done with an 'O' level certification. But if I am doing the same task with an 'O' level cert, I will definitely be paid less than half of what I am receiving now. Weird ain't it?

It's really funny how educational achievement has become a primary way to sift job applicants, even if the job requires other skills and not academic ones. By restricting the labor market in such a superficial way, we are excluding potentially talented workers whose only weakness is not being good at exams. Then there is possibility that we won't get the best people into important jobs.

So whenever I voice out this concern to my friends, they told me to stop complaining. They said I am privileged enough to be an NUS graduate with a good paying job and that's how reality works; the guy with the degree always gets more benefits. However, I feel this is unjustified as unlike true professionals such as doctors, lawyers or engineers, most folks like me from FOS and FASS particularly won't get a job which require the full extent of our training. Three to four years of heavy content just for the sake of an irrelevant yet necessary degree seems foolish.  Of course it's a different story for those with postgrad education since they will most likely work in a related field. However, it is clear that only a smaller proportion of students can pursue postgrad studies. And the fees I had to pay by applying for a loan made me feel cheated.

Therefore I am faced with two choices:

Choice 1: The Pragmatic One
I stay comfortable in my current job of getting paid well by doing almost nothing... ahem!.... significant.

Risk of Choice 1: 
There might be a risk of getting retrenched if the management feels like getting rid of redundant employees during a recession. However, this may be unlikely as this bank has allegations of money laundering activities by foreign entities... thus providing us jobs is way to make themselves appear above the radar, whilst trying to stay under the radar. It has went through a couple of recessions without a massive layoff, unlike the more legitimate banks. Heehee...  

Choice 2: The Idealistic One 
I be bold now and take the risk by leaving the current job to seek for something which may not pay me equally well at first, but in good faith, it will allow me to learn and develop and hopefully, open doors to better prospects in the future.

Danger of Choice 2:
I may actually suck at work and I cannot achieve what I imagined I could, thus losing the well paying job at the bank and being disgruntled for being a smart alec. 

Please advise me if you can. I appreciate it!

I'm getting quite depressed as I'm graduating soon and yet I still don't really know what I want to do in life. I am thinking of undergoing a year of internships to find my passion but my friend thinks that I should just get a full-time job using my major. However I find that I am losing interest in studying it and I really cannot wait to graduate and burn my notes. Is it really advisable to do internships after graduation?
Another thing I am depressed about is how I have to take the MRT all the time. When the MRT came today I almost cried because I was imagining that was the way the two SMRT workers who recently got killed had to leave the world. Quite an unrelated confession but at least now I know I don't want to work for SMRT. However it also makes me guilty because my mother works for SMRT. Life is complex.

Just want to ask. How many hours do NUS students sleep? I heard 7 to 9 hours is optimal for 20 year olds but I only manage to sleep for 4 to 5 hours on weekdays and then 6 to 7 hours on weekends. I want to sleep more but I feel there's always work or activities to do. Should I factor in more time to sleep or learn how to cope with less hours of sleep?  Thanks.

To 

It's not a good thing for students that NUS has compulsory internships for FOE. Compulsory internships does not mean guaranteed will get. NTU has had this practice of compulsory internship for their engin students for a long time now. I notice that the difference is that for them, they are responsible for getting their own internships although it is a school requirement. And yes, some companies take longer than others to go through the applications. So it's also quite difficult for the students as they cant renege on an internship offer of a better one comes along. But it's also unreasonable to ask companies to sync their offers for interns. We want to intern at their companies, it's unlikely that they want us just as much.

What if they cant get an internship? Don't  graduate. That's why most of them are forced to accept the first offer they get because of the fear that they might not get any offer at all. I've met NTU grads who had to delay graduation just because they couldn't secure an IA. I hope this doesn't happen to us here at NUS.

All the best to the other FOE students!

I dont get it. Throughout my university life, I have always looked forward to SEP. I applied round 1 but was rejected. I got the devastating news that I was rejected again in round 2. And yet I see my friend rejecting the university that he was offered in round 1 and contemplating whether to accept his university in round 2. WHY?!?!

would it be more beneficial to go for SEP/UROPS or NOC? I'm a life science student and not one of those planning to be an entrepreneur type. I heard that NOC is more for those who plans to start their own business or those from the more techy courses like CS or engineering. Is any of that true?

In response to , yes sss1207 is still open book and mcq. Sadly, i am the type that cannot seems to remember small details, but tends to do better if concepts are tested, such as those in written papers. Haiz seems like it will not be an easy task for me to go beyond a B+ for this module (given that i take no interest in plant biodiversity even though both plant and animal biodiversity are just as important in this module). Took this module only because of strong interest in animals and no essay type qns like those in arts ss.
-
 

Hi, i took sss1207 2 years back. just to confirm, the format is still open book right? or did they change it?  i am not from life science and i got an unexpected a for the module. 
For me, i did not read beyond the textbook and lecture notes as i did not have enough time. I think it is important to listen extra carefully to Dr Amy (if i rmb correctly) as she did talk about extra stuff that wasn't in the notes and they were tested. As it is important to be very  familiarized with the textbook and notes, it is good that you are tagging your notes. Also, the tiny details in long paragraphs may come out, so when you are reading make sure you read every single word and not just the gist of it. 

ps: i had the feeling that some things tested weren't in the notes too at that time, but when i went back home and slowly read, i realized i missed them out. 

all the best studying and hope you get the grade u want for finals :)

Who else thinks FOE has handled this whole upcoming compulsory internship in a really really bad way?
Zero communication and clarity about what students should be doing when.
As someone who hasn't been personally contacted by any companies I have had no indication all semester if I am in the right position or if I've made a mistake somehow. 
Today is the supposed results day. And absolutely no word about the status. Even if it is rejection, there should be some communication on the part of FOE. 
And today they decide to break the news to us that they've decided to do away with the grading system after all! Then why did they bother explaining it all to us in such detail if they were going to scrap it so easily??
If NUS expects us to be professional individuals in the working environment then they're really not setting a very good example.

Hello there, any seniors who took sss1207 before? 

After taking the mid terms for sss1207, i realised that the MCQ qns weren't very easy, even for me as a year 3 life science major who had taken a bit of environmental modules. The qns there in fact reminds me of LSM1103 biodiversity finals. What i found to my horror during the test was that there were some qns which tested stuff which i really don't remember seeing inside the textbook or the lecture notes despite studying very consistently for this module and tagging the important details. I mean by studying consistently, i did manage to get a decent score (but only slightly above the average) so am i right to suspect that to do really well in this module, you have to read beyond the textbook and lecture notes? Many seniors i spoke to who had taken this module told me they got B+ so i think it will be difficult to go beyond that for most people unless you are so passionate to read up more on biodiversity? 

Btw i think Dr Amy Choong's qns is the harder of the 2 lecturers as she tend to give scientific names without giving the common names and she seems to be the one that like to test "outside stuff". Like this post if you agree this is the case.

If any seniors had done well for sss1207 (beyond B+), could you all kindly share some advice on how to tackle their MCQ qns? Thanks.

Dear all, I am a year 1 chemical engineering student and I will like to rant about the toxic environmental in my course. My result is quite decent(2nd upper kind)but when my friends know about my score, they will be like "don't so smart leh", "I need to use S/U already" etc etc so I got quite irritated when I know they merely lose me by 1 mark or so. Personally for me, I am contented with 2nd upper but it gets quite stressful and annoying at times when people pull the long face and commented that they did not do very well when they still score above average in the cohort. Anyway just a 5minutes rant to get away from studying CM1502(omg it sucks) and to get the prospective freshies ready for what is coming

I am supposed to study for exams. But I found something else really interesting to study outside school. Instead of revising, I have spent days researching about the topic. The feeling is so great.

I have been this evergreen guy that has been "chasing" girls for the past one year, thinking that I will break my evergreen spell. I know I sound very immature for that. However, this really come at a huge cost. My grades suffer so badly that my CAP drop by 1.5 within one semester (My grades are already very bad at the start) and I did not manage to secure any internships due to my extremely poor results. After seeing the failing grades that I get for all the modules in my recent mid-terms, I have come to realise that I have been delusion by love all these while and set my priorities wrong. (I place greater priority over getting attached rather than on my studies). The girls that I have a crush on don't love me back. I have been wasting all my time and effort on stuff that are not progressing. I have enough and tired of doing all these chasing that are not yielding any results.

This is getting really irritating. Last night, someone sent a Trojan virus (which was fortunately blocked by NUS IT Care) to the entire cohort for my major via the cohort email (which I will not mention to avoid getting more spams). But after that, so many people started replying to the cohort emails to say 'stop sending me trojans' or 'stop sending me emails abt stopping sending trojans to you' or 'pls remove me from this spammy list'. I've received at least 14 emails from that email chain. Can't everyone tell that hitting reply spams the entire cohort?? Just stop replying! Stop spamming everyone to stop spamming you. It just adds on to the spam! Everyone just stop replying to that email chain okay? Kthxbye.

Computer Centre does not have a reputation of discharging its duties in an efficient manner.

Is it necessary to have references in my essay? While I do look at materials to write my essay, I don't really consciously look for them- it happens when I read stuff in general and I don't have a problem generating enough ideas for my essays when I get to write it. My essay grades are generally ok (sometimes it depends on the lecturer). I get grades of A- mostly and sometimes a B/B+ if it wasn't good or for little or no referencing (I've gotten a couple of As too). I've seen thesis and working papers and have noted the extensive use of references. Nowadays I've tried to "reference" stuff; like I'll search for stuff just to chuck something inside. All my essays have <1% plagarism check, but I'm not very sure if it's very important. Any ideas?

Hi, someone enlighten me with an answer to my curious question haha

During application to university, does the people from the office of admission select which students to offer the course? Or it's the faculty that they are applying to choosing the students? 

What about discretionary admission? How does it make a difference? 

Maybe a prof here can answer this? I notice Prof Ben surf NUSWhispers often. (P.S he seems like a popular person here! I hope to meet you this year as I'm matriculating to SOC CS :) )

I'm the OP of .

My dilemma is not just taking the first step. I've her number. We are(were) group mates for presentations that were required for every tutorial. Our personal conversations (mobile) are just content discussions for the presentations.

Do people nowadays still start of with a message of "How's your day?"
I'm afraid of people who's replying just because they're friendly.

op please don't filter this out. please! 

So I've been really stressed about securing an internship for this summer. I recently got an internship offer from a reputable non-profit organization but i turned down their offer because they couldn't wait any longer for my confirmation of acceptance. I was holding out in the hopes that the public agencies would reply me under the internships@gov program. Guess you could call it bad timing because i had applied for the internship at the non-profit organization some time mid feb but the invite for internships@gov came only during recess week and the public service division only sent me the details to access their portal about 2 weeks ago. Applied for their internship projects last week and am still waiting for a reply. Has anyone here gotten a reply from internships@gov yet? Really need some info on how long they take to reply! thanks

I am not sure if this is true, but in NUS, the profs seldom want to fail students as long as they put in effort, and they would gladly fail you if you have attitude issues. I did a mod which final exam is only a small percentage. Tests, quizzes and course work takes up the bulk of the total grades. So I did well for the CA portion and based my calculation even if I score zero for my final exam, I will still pass. Maybe the bellcurve came into effect but my CA portion is marginally better than most students in class. So I skipped the final exam because I got complacent and felt lazy. And guess what? I was given a final grade F. The prof never gave us back the results of the final exam just like some other mods. So I hypothesize that the prof probably feel I deserve to fail due to an attitude issue since I did not even inform him why I was absent. 

Hence, even if you are not doing well for your CAs, Don't give up for the finals and don't do something stupid like not going for the exams because you thought you cannot make it. You may not get an A grade, but at least I am sure your prof will try his best to pass you. Afterall, the reputation and ranking of NUS depends on this, so use it to your advantage!

Design project is possibly the worst nightmare during the 4 years in Chemical Engineering. Having to reach the lab as early as 7 am to ensure a computer with HYSYS to even staying overnight just to converge, optimise and size the damn column. 

Juniors! BEWARE of this nightmare that awaits you in year 4 sem 2

I took CS 1101S last sem. I put in a lot of work for the module, but owing to some mess ups in the exams I scored a meager A-. I really want to TA this module next sem. Do I have a chance? Looking for opinions from profs and seniors.

How do you deal with FYP supervisors who get angry at you for no discernable reason? Today, after submitting my draft and asking about some comments my supervisor made, my supervisor instead sent back a reply saying that "You can take my advice, your choice" and "I've spent as much time as I want to on this project".

Like... what the hell? I can't even say anything in reply for fear of angering my supervisor even more - replying back will only get a retort back saying that I'm "arguing". Urgh.

Hi I will be matriculating into CS soon, and has no prior computing background since I was from JC taking PCME..

Should I read up on some cs knowledge before entering uni? Any recommendations? And does the poly students with computing background has a huge advantage over those without? Thanks

, 

Warning: even longer post than the referenced posts ahead.

I feel it's my responsibility to reply to you (both), albeit anonymously, because I believe I came from a similar place(*), and have effectively graduated(**).

From young I've been praised for being smart as well. Academically I've been performing the best in my generation (at least up to O level; I've graduated, and I'm pretty sure and also hoping that my cousin gets a better honours degree, and my other cousin scores better than me in the A Levels). However I was not lazy (my mum will beg to differ) or arrogant (my classmates may beg to differ). In fact I was fearful all the time. I was afraid of not making it to University despite being in EM1 (via appeal due to lacking Chinese grades), that I kept an NUS exercise book from an Uncle for years, perhaps as a lucky charm, a reminder to work hard, or more likely, as a memento of a place I might not be able to make it to.

In Sec 1, there was a unofficial Chinese test in the first week: it was a test to gauge our Chinese standard, and not being able to remember most of the characters, it dawned upon me that this might be the first academic test that I'm going to fail! I was so anxious and afraid and I felt like urinating (now you know why I want to post this anonymously!) less than midway into the test until after submission. Now that I think about it, perhaps this is why I try to avoid stressful situations.

Fast forward a few years, I actually did very well for my O Levels. So I got into a stream class for JC, where the students were expected to top their subject combo, and clinch scholarships. And... I didn't do too well especially for Chemistry. I remember I had a common test where I got a borderline pass, and my teacher wrote on the cover "<My name>, why?". I can only imagine his disappointment and bewilderment. Me too, I actually topped my level in Chemistry in secondary school, and even have a plaque for it. I still have the plaque... and the cover.

Eventually I got my A levels. Not so bad a grade, but especially bad when compared to my classmates. Probably pulled down the KPI of my FM and Chem teachers (I'm really sorry!). I could get the course I wanted easily, as I wasn't into medicine, law, dentistry, or chemical engineering, and computer science was still pre-Zuckerberg (heng ah!).

One might have thought that this mediocre horror tale has come to an end. In fact, it has only begun.

If my A Levels weren't perfect due to some as-yet unexplainable reason, this is the perfect clean slate to achieve my academic potential! Or so I thought. But it was not to be. Procrastination got the better of me. Certain higher-level abstractions and concepts couldn't be retained. I watched webcasts two weeks before the exams. For many modules, I studied 2 and sometimes even 1 day before the exams, and sometimes not sleeping before the paper lest I forget some things. It became a vicious cycle: the more I got frustrated at not achieving my academic potential, the more I didn't feel like doing the right things to steer me in the direction I wanted to go. Eventually I graduated with a second lower.

(*) But I've no similarity with this loser senpai, you protest. Ok I admit we're not so similar. It's a ploy to get you to read these:

You are perfect just the way you are. You don't need to believe me, but you need to believe yourself. You should not measure your self-worth by your academic success, by your NS posting, by the friends you have, by the benchmarks set by other people. If you need to have some measure, just ask yourself, "Have I been kind (to oneself, to others) today?" At the end of the day, that's what really matters.

The past is over, there no need to relive it and feel the same negative emotions. An appropriate use of the past though, is to learn from mistakes what to avoid, and from successes what to cultivate.

More often than not, we get disappointed when things don't turn out the way we want it to be. This is especially so for external things, but we really have little control over them (e.g. the hot weather these two weeks). For what you can control, do it (turn on the fan, air-con). If you can't, just let it go. We cannot even control the internal things, which is our bodies and mind. For body, we will fall sick, grow old (unless you die young) and die. For mind (mental health), our mental bandwidth, creativity, skill and memory can diminish. You can do taichi, qigong, yoga, meditation, play mahjong, brain games like lumosity, take omega-3 supplements. But if it happens, it happens. I hope you grow old with good health and mental faculties and die peacefully.

The future is always arriving, but we never really reach it (it becomes the present). So there's no need to worry or fear it. It's okay though, to make plans.

So there you have it. What was wrong with you, is believing that there's something wrong with you. Just try your best, have enough rest, don't be hard on yourself, be kind to others (and yourself), don't live in the past, don't fear the future, live in the present. All the best to you!

(**) Oops, did I mention that I kept the tab of your post opened for three whole days on my phone browser, wanting to reply to you, before typing this on a computer. It's part procrastination, part busy at work, part fear of not being able to convey in full the correct message and make it worse instead of helping you. It can get frustrating at times not fulfilling the best potential I can reach, whether professionally at work, as a 'regular' non-procrastinating human etc... But it's ok.

So, last sem I didn't do particularly well because free SUs. However, I told myself to not screw up this sem. Honestly, I have been putting in so much more effort than the previous sem but my results are showing otherwise... Maybe I'm just not cut out for university.

Thank you student loans for getting me through university, I don't think I can ever repay you

As a senior in the science faculty, one thing I feel about the faculty (and perhaps other faculties too) is that there can and should be more academic support available to students. When faced with difficulties, the only "sort of reliable" avenues of help available is either the lecturer or the TAs which i feel some students do not find appealing because 

1) students are shy to approach/bother them (the teacher-student gap)
2) lecturers/TAs may not come across as approachable
3) students perceive them as "cannot teach"

and this is saddening because in such cases students will just feel helpless and stressed. 

when i was on exchange my partner university had this tutoring programme where seniors (both undergrad and grad) could sign up as peer tutors. Depending on qualifications $ renumeration may or may not be available. To sign up as a tutor one will have to go through interviews and submit recommendations to ensure the quality of the programme. Even when i was in JC there was peer tutoring programmes.

what i'm trying to encourage is a similar programme that can serve as an alternative avenue for academic help where the tutor-tutee gap is perhaps not as large. Peer tutors would also be able to relate better to tutees' difficulties as both should have undergone similar trainings/experiences and provide more relevant advice. Appreciation could be done in the form of certificates/testimonials/recommendations instead of money.

Win-win situation, why not? and it improves the quality of education and make NUS a better learning environment for everyone :)

Silicon Valley used to be my dream place to work in. It's not because of the prestige. It's the hacker spirit. Nowadays, the companies are slowly become like the big corporations (resembling those in New York). The new generation of tech workers care about their salaries and bonuses. They are seldom risk-takers. They studied Computer Science because there are money in it. Very rare to see a pure hacker person anymore.

I think Singapore, in the future, will have greater potential for hackers than Silicon Valley if we have less students concentrating on getting good grades and stop all these kiasu mentality.

Hi i really need help for this... to anyone who had been to King College London, could you all offer some insights on the credit conversion to NUS MCs? There is a module named forensic science which i wish to take but it was worth 7.5 ETCS/3-4 US credits as written in their description. When i use this NUS website (http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/intl/special_prog/mcratio.html) to calculate how many NUS MCs is that equivalent to, it seems to suggest the module is only worth 2 MCs at NUS so i am unsure if i calculated it correctly.... i wonder how is it possible that within the 3 weeks with total 45h of lecture time, the module is worth only 2 MCs in nus...

I already tried calling IRO multiple times to ask about this but no one is picking up and i am sooooo confused regarding the ETCS and stuff like that :(

If anyone had been to king college london or any london university for summer exchange, please do let me know what is number of credits there which is equivalent to 4 MCs (in other words 1 module) in NUS. Thanks.

I'm a year 2 CS student. Would just like to ask seniors/profs whether it will be a disadvantage if i don't know many programming languages. I see many of my friends' CV contains  a long list of languages they are proficient at like HTML, JS, Ruby etc. For me i'm only proficient with Java. I've seen a couple of posts previously that CS students shouldn't have difficulty picking up a new language if they're strong in CS since the main issue is how you think computationally. But my question is will future employers see that this guy only knows 1 or 2 languages and be less inclined to employ him/her?

After studying my major for a few years, I realised that I like what I'm studying, but I cannot envision myself doing this as a career. I have other interests and I hope to have a career based on those interests, but my interests are too different from my major. I am actively seeking for internships along with my friends now. While my friends are looking for internships based on our major, I am looking for those of my interest. Unfortunately, I find that I don't qualify for them as I lack the university education in those areas. Every few days, a strong desire to change my major pops up in my mind, but I can't do it as I don't have enough tuition grant to help me. My parents will also not support the changing of my major.

How likely is it to get an internship which is not related to your major? Should I go for the lower level internships (those that A level graduates can also get) and waste my education? Or should I follow my peers and go for internships based on my major even though I will probably not enjoy them?

Please help! Thanks!

Hey seniors and people who have their life slightly more together than I do:

I'm going to graduate with a eng literature degree. Third class, no Honours. Don't really know what my options/ chances are. I'm good with my words and social skills are slightly higher than average. Would like to be a published writer/poet someday. Don't really have friends in the literary/ publishing scene. No internship, just creative projects that I have done over the years. Nothing too fancy. 
My questions are:
1) What type of jobs should I go for? 2) How do I get past the brutal initial screening phase with my mediocre grades?  

Please be nice, I'm really worried here. 
-
 
 I don't know is it my fault or what that I choose an Arts degree. I struggle to find any jobs. And the job market seems to be doing badly for this year. But the stock markets seem to be doing well. I am relying on some capital gains from my stocks for survival. It's like quite easy to trade since everyone thinks it's a bull market now.

Just a rant about FYP. Sian ttm. I really hate FYP. Why is it compulsory for science students to do FYP in honours year when other faculties can use modules to fulfil the honours requirement? FYP due soon and my data is so screwed. I don't even have time to redo the whole thing. Spent a year working on it, so much time and effort put in and now I can only submit a sub-standard report. Yea. I want to cry now. But i have no more tears left.

Why do Singaporeans care so much about their grades and "1st higher honors" and all of that? In the US and other parts of the world nobody and I mean NOBODY cares about your grades after you graduate(Unless you're going to med school or lawyer)... Do companies here actually care?
-
 
I graduated in 2015, and still can't find a job. Mine is a general degree, 2nd lower honours, so my friends keep telling me to become a teacher, if really no choice. Now I understand the phrase "those who can (find jobs), do; those who can't (find jobs), teach" zzz.

Out of the 4 computing courses, which has the least programming? Advice!
-
 
I really want to thank  for his/her advice. It has made me feel much better in knowing I'm not alone. I have been feeling very down and unmotivated lately, due to a recent series of mid terms that I haven't performed well in. I wholeheartedly agree with his/her 3rd point on getting out of the house, when I found out that staying at home the entire weekend studying for my tests ultimately proved futile.

The 4th point is also very valid too, as I have been very fortunate to have some close friends who have continued to support me (emotionally, as well as academically) throughout the past semester. Luckily for me, I don't have any relationship woes.

I think the key is not to worry so much about one's CAP, something that cost me many sleepless nights past finals last semester. This is still something I'm working on--when times are good, it is easy to believe that things will always work out for the better, but the most important (and most difficult) part of course is to think the same in bad times.

Good luck to everyone out there who is in the same boat. To paraphrase Dumbledore, I'm sure help (from friends or lecturers) is always available to those who ask for it.

Hello  I am the OP of . I... didn't expect this, but I think it'd be interesting to get to know a new person just for fun. I prefer to remain anonymous for now, for personal reasons, so perhaps we can communicate by email? (I'll make a new account). Can you make one too?

I got into a course with a high IGP by discretionary admission. I'm still in my 1st year but doing badly in modules related to my major with a B- last sem. For my mid terms recently i got below median by almost 30 marks. my problem is that I can do tutorial questions with some thinking but I guess I'm too slow for the exams which were quite tough imo. i'm not writing this because I want to quit but it's very discouraging. I like my major and I want to do well but I sometimes feel like i'm not meant for it. thanks for hearing me out and do share your own inspirational story if any.

Hey everyone, I need some advice from seniors or industry players. I have interest in urban planning due to my love for human geog but I am not too sure which course would provide me with higher chance of getting into my “dream” job. What do you guys think? NUS real estate, geography or architecture? FYI, I did well for my Geog and Art. 

Looking into their curriculum, real estate seems to provide a progressive route to advanced level in urban planning as for geography, many of their human geog does not require pre-requisite, so I can take it as electives? Architecture seems tough. Help!

 Alright. How do we improve? By staying status quo about how 'scholarship' works? Our system is in stasis because there are not enough people creating more 'trouble' for these university bureauracts-scholars.

I'm from Science and was interested in doing a few Arts modules during special sem. However no breath modules were available for bidding. Has anyone experienced this before? No pre-requisites/preclusions were present either. I've contacted my home faculty about this but was just wondering if there have been similar situations.

Looking at the IGP for Computer Science in recent years in the news, I want to shout, "HENG AH!" (for non-Singaporeans: 'heng' means lucky)

I didn't get all As for my A levels, but did well enough to secure a place in computing as my first choice. I'll probably be quite sad if I couldn't do computing.

Feels weird though that my kouhais are all smarter than me, at least academically.

Should the way that scholarships are given be changed? Recently I've seen and heard of a lot of people that are doing very well ( >4.5) but have no scholarship because of their A-level/Poly results. On the other hand, some are on scholarships because of stellar pre-university but are barely maintaining a 3.5 (some scholarships only need recipients to hold a 3.5 and above). It seems both weird and unfair. If we reward based on merit, shouldn't a person who does better be rewarded? A possible solution could be to only give yearly scholarships. So if you've done well for A-levels, you will get a scholarship lasting for 1 year. At the end of year 1 in uni, you have to re-apply for a scholarship in the next year. If you get overtaken by non-scholars, then those non-scholars should rightfully deserve a scholarship instead. Of course, the applications should still assess both grades and CCA achievements made in that year.

 Sorry for the super late reply but during the week, I got more important things to attend to like anime and video games so I can't write a proper answer. Also your post is burried and I need attention so I'll post in NUSWhishpers instead of replying.

Rather than asking you to take CS1231 and then read "Category theory for programmer" which is already  hand-wavy and dumbed down, I'll just explain why I keep posting that.

TL;DR: It's the CS version of "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell". It's a meme that CS people ("computer scientist" sounds weird because it's not even a real science and "IT people" is too derogatory) can relate to. I figured that it's the best way to get likes in this page.

Long version: where do I even begin? First, I usually post it when some people mentions SoC and equates it with programming. It's a statement that's pretty theoretical and has a bit of academic masturbatory feel to it. I wanted to state that CS is as much about programming (or computer) as astronomy is about telescope in a pretentious way. Second, I post it whenever people talk about learning practical skills, finding jobs, which faculty is the best, outdated syllabus... At least from my personal experience, I think going to uni just to learn skills and then find a job is kind of a waste of time. I won't get into details but from day one in uni, I took NUS president's words to heart. Something something about "pursuing the useless". I wrote compilers, interactive stories and took a random 3K mod from engin in my first year that I later S/U (U to be exact). Now my job is kind of about websites. I think the point of uni is to learn how to learn and how to unlearn so it may sound cliché but just study for the sake of pursuing knowledge. Lastly, I want to appear smart so I make statements which are totally correct but also useless. I think this particular sentence originated from the Haskell community (a weird programming language). It doesn't help anyone understand monad or at least how to use it and why it's important in this language. Btw, burrito analogies are also stupid.

I don't think I could fully explain it in layman terms without starting from World War 2 and Alan Turing but at least I explained why I keep posting that. If you are still interested, take CS1231, CS1101S and which ever mod that is about category theory or read that yourself. If I managed to offend anyone with this post, sorry, not sorry.

 Actually, since you're mentioning CAD, I assume that you're coming into Mech Eng. 

Well, unless you're doing a lot of CAD work (like draftsman work, etc.), you won't really use the CAD software on a laptop, much less really spoil it. Even still, you have the PC Clusters to use that have such software already installed. Ideally, try not to use SW on a laptop because it will crash. A lot.

If you're considering (or already considered) something, get something that can handle Solidworks at least (check the website for specs), and something that has a lot of memory. 

Get the Dell. Acer computers spoil too damned easily.

Hi all, I am looking to get a laptop during the IT show. Will be entering NUS this year as an engineering student, more specifically mechanical engineering. Any considerations/advice? From what I heard, they do 3D modelling and CAD. I do some gaming occasionally but my main consideration would be one that can last for 4 years throughout my course of study. Should I get a moderate gaming laptop? Aftershock seems like a good deal

PGP has so many study rooms. But we cannot use it because there is always things (laptop, personal calendar, food and modem? I can't even) on tables. They made an office out of these study rooms and reserve seats for their friends, alienating others from using the tables. Thing is I have a thesis to write, so I would really want a place where I can concentrate and not be tempted to sleep. I paid school fees and accommodation fees that are similar to others, so it does not make sense that they enjoy the additional benefits of having personal offices out of study rooms in PGP for one whole semester. 

If law allows, I would totally go on a rampage and destroy all of their things. Unfortunately, it doesn't. So here's a nice PSA for all of you folks: get your things off the table. Please be considerate.

With reference to . I am recently in a project group for a module and I like my groupmates a lot. We can click quite well on a personal level and they are really nice and easy going people. I feel that we can potentially be good frends should we step out of the boundary of being simply project groupmates... But it is such a pity that we met under circumstances that don't warrant the formation of friendship. It makes me sad that once the project is over, this nice group experience we had will be over too.

As a fellow stats major, I cant help but agree with you. Not sure which mod you are taking. But I'm currently taking a particular level 3k mod. The prof has a heavy accent. And to make the matter worse, he does not even bother writing down the derivations of the equations which makes it really hard to learn. SO it's really not just his accent but his lack of ability as a lecturer. Like he doesn't teach the content such that it is digestible to students. And to the commenters, pls stop the hate towards the OP because you have NOT gone through what the OP is going thru. And I see some stats majors commenting but they probably have not taken a mod as bad as the mod the OP is referring to or my module. It is indeed frustrating learning a core module where you basically learn NOTHING AT ALL. And the only thing you do is to blindly apply the formula during exams. And no I'm not the OP but a fellow stats major who just encountered the shittiest stats lecturer of my life. While it is undeniable that the lecturers are mainly paid to do research, it still is part of their job scope to teach. And having a pretty decent pay check, shouldnt professors, as professionals do a good job teaching? Like it's not like the OP isnt putting in effort to study the module right? And due to the bureaucratic system of NUS it is not easy to complain abt the lectuerer (i.e. complaining to the Deans)bcos nothing gets done.  And Op made a good point. Assuming that you pay about 4k per semester, 1 module is about $800. So why should we pay $800 to self-study right? Shouldnt we expect a decent quality of education. I dont mean to be rude to the commenters but STFU if you dont understand the OP's POV. And yes some commenters will probably feel that the OP and I are self entitled blah blah, we got a place in a local uni that is subsidised blah blah. But to pay $800 with our/our parent's hard earned money, surely we expect something more decent right?

Any of you have gone through this experience whereby hr calls you down for an interview , then turns out that it's for the wrong position because she used her " Hr expertise " that you'll be suitable for a totally different job from what u applied and then u never hear from the company again ?

The Nus financial aid/payment offices suck. Always chasing for payment but they don't provide needs-based aid quick enough. I submitted my documents twice and they said they didn't receive and didn't end up processing my application for FA. What can I do? Do I have to prove that I submitted before to ask them to review my application? 
-
 
Responding to   Yes I am wondering about that too. Does anyone know how the tuition grant will be affected too if one changes course/faculty? The website seemed quite vague when I went to search for it.

 Bonding games, yes. Hazing, none. (Before you use this word, I hope you know what hazing means.) Guys trying to take advantage of females - probably happened in really large faculty camps and during social night. About that, learn to stay with a group of friends and be aware. Honestly I dont see it happening to anyone except for people who are dumb enough to get insanely drunk during social night. I've been through FASS major camps both as a freshie and the committee, there was no worst experience to talk about. I've met a huge bunch of great people and had great fun. Guys I've met are also the kind of guys who watches out for you. 

You're entering university, the people you meet are mostly decent. There isn't much to worry about. On a sidenote, if you really dislike it, you can join camps catering for each major. Those are on a much smaller scale, and no social night.

FASS has many girls and few guys, so the number of girls is likely double or more than double the number of guys. That's for the faculty camp. For major camps it really depends, could be pretty even for some. 

An advice though, if you're interested in any camp, sign up early. Especially faculty camps when you have to go down personally to register. Never arrive at the time registration starts because you'll most likely end up on the waiting list if you're a girl.

Hello, I am going for exchange (in Europe) next semester and I am thinking about buying airticket etc from STA travel. 

Anyone has any experience using them? Even though they do claim to be offering cheap prices to students, I am worried that their prices will still be too expensive, afterall they are still a business which aims to make profit. 

Any tips are greatly appreciated!

This is regarding the applications for the compulsory engineering IAP next semester. 
Posting here since am a bit shy to ask around personally. 
Application period is over and a lot of time has passed since.
Seeing people in the LT wearing formals 
Overhearing a small number of folks talking about interviews. 
No company I applied to has contact me yet. 
Starting to get a bit worried since not even one of the 5 companies have said anything.
Interview period for first round is ending on 23 March. 
My CAP is 4.1x but my a levels were really good. No ccas since uni. :/
Can't have been that shitty an application I hope. 
Any advice or analysis of the situation? 
And fellow Engin students applying and in the same situation / in a better situation than me- could you please comment or post confession sharing your experience? 
Thank you  to everyone who bothered reading this.

I enter uni purely for knowledge gaining and not for the sake of getting a degree. I chose a course I genuinely wanted to know more.
Sure I can learn the stuff myself, but uni provides a better environment.

I urge everyone to choose the course u really have interest in, and study for the knowledge and not for the pathetic piece of paper upon graduation.

This is in response to confession 17600. I apologize in advance if I offend anybody with my rant. I tend to have no filter. I also a value investor. To those that view investing as gambling, I can tell u that ur not exactly right. Investment is a science. To the confessor, I started with 2k and managed to grow it into a 6figure portfolio today. I'm not even 22 and will definitely hit my first million before 30. My point is, there's no point bragging abt it. You're not alone, ur also not special. Also, u should know that investing is not for everyone. So I think its unfair to slam the education system. Also, the fact that we, have the initial capital to start investing shows how lucky we are. I made many mistakes n lost lots of money but always had the capital to bounce back as my family is quite comfortable financially. So before you slam the education system here, please remember that not everyone is as lucky as us. And now that ur quite well to do for a person I assume in ur 20's, think of ways to help people and pull people up. If u don't wanna pull them up its fine. Just don't put them down.

I am a environmental engineering year 1 student and I am appalled at how the most of chemical engineering students behaved during CM1502 lectures, especially after the test on Monday. Simply speaking, you guys behaved like uncontrollable monkeys rather than university undergraduates and I am not even generalizing. You guys are smart, cream of the crop but please, there are some of us who are really interested in studying but are unable to concentrate with your incessant buzzing.

 I borrowed the capital from DBS. My family is not rich unlike yours. And your stocks have been inflated by QE from US and Europe for the last 5-8 years. So don't brag about turning $2000 to six figures. I am not an value investor like Warren Buffett. I am more interested in taking risks like George Soros. So since we are in different categories, you are making a category mistake with your comparisons. 

Schools cannot teach you about:
(i) Experience of losing real cash
(ii) Making decisions to take profit (I was disciplined enough to exit before the market crashed today)
(iii) Coming out with your ideas and take risks to execute it
(iv) Taking contrarian position (In schools, if you take contrarian position from your professors, you get penalized).
(v) Knowing how to identify the charlatans (Journalists, Business school professors who teach value-at-risk and Markowitz portfolio theory; Economics professors who teach Macroeconomics with no skin-in-the-game)

Most importantly, I have skin in the game. I am hurt if I am wrong. When a politician makes a mistake, he/she can just say sorry without being hurt. Similarly, academics don't have to worry about whether they are teaching wrong things. No one will penalize them. And most undergrads are not experienced enough to know whether their professors are fraud.
-
 
 Please read carefully. I said I learned more in taking risk than lectures. This does not mean that I learned nothing from lectures. School does not teach one to stand up for his or her beliefs. What I have done is contrarian to conventional thinking. Two months ago, people said that the market is doomed. I traded opposite.

One learned well when there is skin-in-the-game. I learned how to be patient and waited for opportunities. The profit came after two months of waiting.

I am staying in university because I like to socialize and make friends with people. And also reading interesting books.

I'm an A level graduate and I'm intending to apply to FASS to pursue my interest in the humanities and social sciences. However, my rank points fall short of what is indicated by the IGP by 3.75 points. Do I still stand a chance to get in with my A in GP? I would appreciate helpful comments and any instances of similar cases which were successful in getting into the faculty
-
 
Hi all! I'm from FASS Yr 1. I participated in an event to raise awareness for the Deaf in Singapore that was conducted by a NTU volunteer group yesterday, and had so much fun. The clique communication phenomenon so often seen in camps was gone, as everyone made an effort to know each other.

Just wondering if there is a community of volunteers in NUS who are involved in communicating with the hearing impaired? Tried to search amongst the community groups but there seems to be no specific groups involved in this. I finished the basic course for SEE2 from SADEAF, and would like to volunteer for such events in future. Anyone who could point me to the right direction would be greatly appreciated! :) Also, just leave a comment if you want me to pm you.

Admins please let this get through?

A helpless individual here who yearns to transfer to nus medicine from another faculty due to a variety of reasons but is worried that one will not be covered by tuition grant in the last year of study if one's transfer is successful. The full non-subsidized fees for med is something which one cannot afford for it is a whooping 6 digits sum. What should one do? Really appreciate any advice or suggestions! Thanks!

Correlation DOES NOT imply causation! 

You can go on with the argument about the correlation with your counter examples or whatever but don't forget that there are always outliers in the data set. And come on, you are not applying for a job, you think NUS is so free to interview every single applicant (except for certain faculties)? So IGP is one of the quantitative ways to enrol students. 
-
 
To  using the igp to gauge the level of students in engineering is making use of bad evidence. You could use that comparison for courses like business without a problem. But the fact is engineering/science has lots of foreign students that do not take the A-levels nor have a poly diploma. This is unlike other courses like biz/fass where Singaporeans are an overwhelming majority. 

Since the quality of foreign students are not reflected on the igp, we can't make the conclusion that the bellcurve in either university engineering course is easier/harder. We can't ignore such a statistically significant population of these courses.
-
 
In response to   I am actually a PRC foreigner in NUS. Did a local exchange with NTU. I have to say that even the PRC foreigners i met within the engineering course have to conclude that the NTU engineering population is generally not as competitive as NUS (note I said generally). This is the same sentiments I shared with them as I felt that the locals at NTU (no offense) do not share the same level of intellect (due to their IGPs) and right attitude to engineering. I think most of them think that doing PYP is the right way to go. Memorizing PYP solution is the right way to go. In terms of examination standards, NTU have it good. At least during a close book exam, you are given some credit regurgitate theorems. Most of my exams in NUS are open book. I mean what I am saying in unpolitical. But no schools are constructed with the same population strata. Unless you think that MIT and NUS have the same academic rigour? 
-
 
I see a few post about getting in to NUS or asking for opinions in choosing between the universities. For me, this is my final semester and I really really do not want it to end. I think I am not ready for the workforce yet. Or maybe I just want to enjoy the freedom and the few responsibilities. 7 more weeks to end of university life :(

I am applying for university this year, deciding between NUS and NTU. Can anyone share with me their experiences in uni. I will really appreciate your personal opinions on how the two schools compare in terms of equivalent science/engineering courses and scholarships. Thanks in advance!
-
 
Kind of have to disagree with what Prof Ben said about A level grades having correlation to Uni results. I myself didn't do too well in my A-levels. Got into a course that I was really interested in and was even below the 10th percentile for my year. But I graduated with a first class. Whereas many of my Uni peers that had way better A level results did much worse than me. Is NUS too liberal with their first class such that someone from the bottom 10th percentile ended up with one? I doubt so. 

The caveat here is that it may have correlation for the science/engin courses. Considering that performing well at A levels science subjects provide a strong science foundation for uni. But for courses such as biz and some majors in fass, everybody starts on a clean slate since there are no strongly relevant A-level subject. Your A-level grades are worth as much as praying to the bellcurve God.
-
 
 The bell curve is related to the quality of student that each courses take in. Let take NUS and NTU engineering for example, it is clear that in general the competition is stiffer in NUS than NTU (purely on the basis of IGP of course). The exam questions (I compared with my friends from the same course) for similar module is so much easier. 
-
 
Hi NUS peep. I need your help here. Please advice.

I would like to persue my part time degree in NUS/NTU in a science course.
I only see there are courses for full time. Does NTU and NUS provide courses for part time? If yes - what are the requirements (eg: age minimum, duration details) will be great if there is any link.
Thanks
-
 
In response to 17510 and 17501. NTU and NUS have exactly the same type of grade calculations insofar as we get the same points for the same letter grades. It's only SMU's system that is different. Going from 3.2 to 4 in one sem is entirely possible in your first two years. Of course it's much harder in your final years. If it's mathematically possible in Ntu it should also be so in NUS. Also, it must be really difficult what with all the grade-less first semester and being able to S/U after results are revealed. Neither SMU nor NTU has these. 
-
 
Thinking of pursuing a double degree... is a 2nd upper honours degree better than a double degree if you get 2nd lower class hons + bachelor with merit? 
-
 
 

Job search wise, I think SMU is arguably the best, as the school will set you on fighting mode and make your search horizon a bit more expansive. Not that NTU/NUS suck, but I realize a fair bit of NTU accountancy graduates will easily accept audit as the single path in life, even after 1-2 years of working. 

On overall school experience, I think it is really a hit/miss case for each individual. There are people who get good jobs in all three schools, or people who feel the lack of support from their school career services. There are people who have an enjoyable school life, and people who feel alone. There are good professors, and also bad professors. There are some stereotypes of NTU/SMU's culture (SMU more competitive, NTU very cheena, and etc) but I think it is more about how you make the best of your environment, since you will be dealing with people different from your predecessors. If stereotypes matter to you, you might want to google a bit more for these anecdotes. Given that NTU has the larger cohort, perhaps it is easier for you to find kindred spirits and to move on from the initial clique you found yourself in, if you can't click with them. 

That being said, I had a good time in NUS. 
1. I like our biz school career services, our school administrators, and most of our professors. There might be some people who complain about the CS or believe that it is CAP biased, but I think it is a case of whether you are willing to approach them for help. They will have limitations which make them look biased (demand of employers vs. supply of students), but I know of instances of them helping weaker students. 
2. Most professors are fine. There are a couple of professors which can be absolutely BS, but I only met them in 2 modules out of 32 modules I took in NUS. CCK is an awesome professor if he is not too busy with his non academic duties currently.
3. Accountancy cohort is fairly small. Our business school cohort for each specialization (Finance/Marketing/Operations/Human resource) is not very big too. It is fairly easy to know the whole batch and build decent friendships without forming cliques, as our seminars will overlap most of the time. Just say hi and be helpful and friendly, and it can go a long way. 

For NUS system - On which specialization to choose.

If you are not choosing accountancy, you will have a fair bit of time to decide if you want to specialize in finance, marketing, operations or human resource since the first two semesters are filled with foundation modules. I think SMU (and maybe NTU) has a wider choice of options to select, like information systems, and actuarial science. 

On accountancy
-If you are into investments, I think it is a good skill set to have. Pure finance graduates will do just fine too. However, accountancy will build up your knowledge of accounting principles and standards, which are useful for making adjustments when doing financial statement analysis. NUS uses a system, which you can do a second specialization in finance, which has no restrictions on choice of specialization. I think SMU is similar to NUS, and allows you to do a major/minor in another module.  NTU requires you to take a double degree in accounting and finance, so you will need prior approval first. Content covered in all three systems are essentially not too different.
-If you are looking to secure a stable job with stable progression and certainty in pay, looks no further from audit. In return, you trade long hours for this stability. The nature of the job can be fairly dry, especially for the first 1-3 years.  Most people move on to other roles such as internal audit, anti money laundering, product control, accounting.
-If you are unsure of what you want, and do not think doing audit is a potential path, don't pick accountancy. Choose the general pool instead. 
 
Finally, you just need to take a leap of faith after doing some research, attending open houses, and analyzing of your own strengths, personalities, risk appetite and preferences. 

All roads lead to Rome. Que sera sera.

I am an A-Level graduate and i am really concerned about where i should move on. I'm looking at Business and/or Accountancy, and i have no idea which one to choose, and more importantly, which uni to choose. I am not a person into hall activities, I just want a pleasant school life with nice professors and classmates and graduate with a degree for a good job. My grades will allow me to enter NUS/NTU/SMU for both Accountancy and Business, what should i choose? Please give me your honest opinions.. :(

PS, i stay in Woodlands and will not be living in halls.

In response to the comments under 

Yes it is much harder for NUS in terms of overall scoring as compared to NTU. I dont know much about SMU, but if we look at overall GPA in NTU compared to overall CAP in NUS, it is crazy hard to try and pull it up in NUS. I have a friend in NTU whose GPA went from 3.2 to 4.0 in a single semester. It wasn't even a straight As semester. Is that possible in NUS? Nope nope nope nope.

 It's very interesting to read about your journey into Philosophy. You have shown a sense of wonder to find out more about things. I am not a marketer. So you will not find any marketing materials here. Personally, I dislike people like Kishore Mahbubani trying to market Philosophy inaccurately. What I intend to do is to portray a path that I took.

Philosophy is challenging because you are entering another realm of thought. I am not going to sugarcoat this path. What you are doing is something dangerous to the society. If you continue to learn and ask questions, you can discover new terrains. This process can be isolating sometimes, because where you are going, most people in the society will not follow.

Minor in Philosophy is not enough. You will be dissatisfied. Philosophy is not a dessert where you can eat it once a while. Do it for real or major in something else. Maybe Economics or Psychology. And don't touch Philosophy ever again. What's the point of taking a few Philosophy modules and then stop doing it? If you are going to sell-out, at least be honest and do it properly. Go do some 'science' in Economics or Psychology.

If you choose to major in it, then you better hope that anti-realist is wrong.

To philsophy majors in nus~
I'm a year 1 who is taking a level 2000 philo mod for the first time. I'm finding it very challenging, but I'm enjoying it so far and it's the only mod which makes me go to the CLB to read up more about it. Should I major in philosophy? I think the interest and desire to learn will last, but doing well in it is another matter><

Hi fellow NUS freshies if you like to have a challenging time at NUS to prepare yourself for the future, please seriously consider engineering. In NUS engineering, you will be assured that you will have no time, no girlfriend and no job once you graduate. BUT in return, you will be awarded the prestigious engineering degree from the TOP university in Asia in recognition for your hard work.

Been working for almost two years, lost count (20? 30?) of how many colleagues (include interns) left. Today just found out a few other colleagues are leaving too. Feel sad even though I never really talk to them much. It's as if I feel sad that they're leaving before I get a chance to get to know them better (not romantically, but friendship). It's as if these people, who sometimes you say hello, bye, thank you or give an affirming nod to and vice versa, have become a fixture of your life. When one leaves, it's like a part of you is taken away. Nonetheless, I wish them all the best in their new jobs and whatever good they wish to do.

Meanwhile, I have to do some code in PHP/JS without tests and I feel dirty like I'm having unprotected sex even though I'm still a virgin. Any idea how to break out of this loop? The language is seemingly non-negotiable as my boss dictates it, while the deadlines and lack of existing infrastructure and practices perpetuates the lack of even unit tests (I'm not even remotely dreaming of CI). Any idea how to break out of this loop short of getting another job? I have a lack of confidence, and looking for new jobs and interviews are daunting to me.

Thanks.

I've had several tutorial classes where my classmates have made racist remarks in their responses/presentation of answers, making me feel really awkward and uncomfortable for the rest of the class. Besides myself there's usually only 1 or 2 other students from an ethnic minority in the class. Does anyone have any advice on how I can deal with this? I don't feel comfortable raising this issue to the tutors themselves of these classes since they seem to be fine with it, but it would be nice if there was someone I could speak to about this.

To  I'm not so sure how much your mentor can help with the transferring process. Sorry :( From what I know they need you to be at least at CAP 3.5 ish before they consider your transfer. Do you mind restarting from year 1 though? Then you get to restart your cap too. 
Believe in yourself alright? Engineering is tough!  Don't worry you are not alone. Just believe that at the end of the day, everything will fall into places. Jiayou for midterms and finals too. :) 
-
 
to the OP of  thanks for replying! 

Sorry to hear about your situation too.  I'm already under probation hence was pretty lost. I applied again in feb for a transfer and hopefully my major improvement in results will allow me for one. It's hard but I really need to prove myself. They probably think I'm lazy. But having no interest in what you're pursuing can really make it depressing. It's all my fault for choosing engineering. But, do you think mentors would be able to help out with the transfer process if you are able to pull up your grades? I know the admission officers are speaking from experience, but not everyone's the same...   I feel so stupid in my course and honestly I have no idea where my life is heading. But all this negativity aside, all the best for finals! 
-
 
To , have you gone to UHC and asked a psychiatrist? You can get special consideration - if you fail, the grades will not factor into your CAP, and you won't have to resume school until you're ready. Basically the same thing as taking the rest of the semester off really. 
-
 
I did unexpectedly badly in one UE module I read out of interest last sem, so I was very disheartened but since I'm on scholarship, I thought, "well at least I didn't pay for that module!" 
It would have been worse to pay money for something and still do badly for it.

Seniors who have applied for SEP/ Summer programmes, does the school inform those who have failed to be admitted as well? Or do they only inform those successful applicants?
-
 
to . How were you even deceived to begin with? I mean you came in knowing full well we had 3 modules to take. Also, to you the vouchers make no sense and stuff, but some people will just love to get more of such vouchers. I mean, you can always sell them right?
Lastly, please entitle others to their own opinion on RVRC just like we entitle you to your own opinion on going to hall or PGP, because RVRC is a unique college of its own that some will love to stay in, study in and even work for.

Are there existing students who reapply to NUS because they are not performing well in the current faculty? I applied to change course and got rejected. I'm from engin and I want to move to science. The thing is my results are very bad. But if I am not allowed to transfer then what am I suppose to do? I made the mistake of choosing engineering. But they said my results are too bad to even consider for transfer. Why transfer someone that is already doing well in the course then? I don't even know what I should do anymore. I'm honestly depressed. I know I'll be able to excel in science... 
-
 
CS Student here, how do I find an FYP ah????? Especially when I don't even know what I like?? AHH help..
-
 
this is in response to  

Dear deceived RVRC student,

After reading your post, I do agree with some points you have brought up. This includes the questionable mandatory meal plans. I feel that as a student from a middle income family, spending $5 per meal just to use the vouchers may not be the most financially sound. I can get much better deals from the canteens around school. Secondly, the location's great! I walk to all my classes.

However, I am deeply abhorred by your lack of objectivity and outright selfishness. I feel that you've forgotten that you voluntarily signed up for this programme. After reading your post, I'm just left with this question: What do/did you want to get out of joining this RC? Your objective of being here doesn't seem very appropriate then. I'm extremely curious what you said in your application and interview...the likes which will cure cancer?

Furthermore, you mentioned that you found the compulsory college modules "VERY BORING". I concur that they may seem tedious and a burden at times, but what module in NUS isn't? What faculty are you in which made you feel so cheated? By the way, if you didn't already know, sustainability is one of the core themes of this RC, and the title of GEM1917 is Understanding and Critiquing Sustainability. Why would you have signed up for this if you weren't even mildly interested in learning more? It is a pity because you've just wasted a year of your time here then. I urge you to spare a thought for your GEM group members because even if you have already decided to exercise your S/U option on this module, they may not. You could at least still be a teamplayer no?

What I'm hearing is how you were short-changed and didn't seem to have benefited in any way whatsoever. Say even if you made one friend from here, I'd say that's better than sulking in your room correct? Have you considered how you could have contributed back to the programme? It's not very nice to just receive and not give.

Honestly, you should heed your own advice too! Why not join hall or PGP next year :D I wish you all the best for your midterms and the rest of the semester.

Cheers
Your fellow RVRC mate

So I heard from a senior from my major that if my CAP is below a certain level, I have to do FYP with a group. He's doing really well so he is able to do his FYP solo, I can't ask him stuff.

Anyone did FYP before in a group? I would like to ask if you can choose your own groupmates. Also, how is it like working in a group for FYP? What if my group members slack off?

Hi  

You might want to reconsider your application again. As far as I know, MOE now is reducing student-teachers intake, means you probably won't be getting what you want to teach irregardless of how well you have scored. I have got friend who applied to teach science but end up majoring in Physical Education. 

So my advice is: if you don't mind being given any major so long as you get to teach, then go ahead.

I just wrote my essays. But I felt like an intellectual fraud because I am writing based on what the professors like to hear in order to get A.

I'm really worried that I'll be kicked out of school because I've been having this fear that somehow I'll fail all my modules even though I do study and revise. My question is what is the chance of a student being kicked out, assume that that student is an average student? And what is the possibility of failing a module in NUS? Thanks!

To all NUS students matriculating later this year, 

Pls do not choose RVRC as your choice for a residential college programme. Sure the location is amazing, with u-town, yih, etc nearby but the modules are VERY BORING unless you're into sustainability and what not. Even so, the assessment is a chore and you will not like it. They also force you to pay for a lousy "meal" plan and give you meal vouchers. What's the point of vouchers? Just let me choose my own damn food. 

Everything advertised on their websites may seem intriguing and lovely but it's all a sham and no more than a desperate ploy to ensnare you into their college programme. 

I can go on and on about the cons of RVRC but I'll hold back. Just pick the UTOWN programme else just go to a hall or even PGP

Love, 
Frm a deceived RVRC student

Hi, need advice from people who have gone for MOE Teaching Internship before. I was shortlisted to teach primary school but I did not even include primary school in any of my choices. The schools I listed in preferences were secondary followed by one JC school. Furthermore, my major is a science major but they assigned my first teaching subject to be a language. I'm quite concenered about this, would it be possible for me to bring this up during the interview to request for a change? I have no idea why I was assigned to teach a language. My results for my sciences are pretty good in Os As and currently in uni, so I don't think it is a matter of aptitude:/ Will asking for a change affect my chances of getting the internship?

I found this post  using the search function. 

I am a FASS humanities student who is graduating soon. I am interested in becoming a humanities teacher. My major focuses on thinking. But the subject is not offered by MOE. So what's the closest subject that I should teach? I also prefer dialectic teaching style rather than training robots.

I would like to seek some advice from seniors, post grad students and professors, regarding pursuing a PHD.

Ive graduated 2 years ago with a 1st Class after slogging it out against the bell curve. Every mod felt like a drag and was such a pain in the ass, with the exception of FYP, i really enjoyed the research process, i enjoyed reading academic articles at my own time, applying the knowledge in the lab, exploring new ideas, it wasnt done to fight the bell curve but out of pure interest. I only got an average score for FYP but it made me decide that i would like to continue in future.

Now im in the industry and it sucks, society looks down on engineers and im paid much less than my peers in finance/banks, and the market is terrible right now. I would like to undertake PHD but my parents and friends advise against it, salary/allowance is low and upon completion, any increment is not worth the 4 year investment of lost income.

Im struggling to decide and even if i go ahead with it, whether to do it overseas or in NUS. Looking at our professors and lecturers, few or close to none have PHDs from NUS, it seems to be seen as a 2nd tier degree in the academic world. NUS phd grads only seem to get research/teaching positions in lower ranked universities. In this sense, an overseas stint seem to have better prospects. However NUS provides more financial aid and sponsorships to singaporeans to encourage us to do it here.

Any advice? Legit ones please.

I'm sitting here listening to a web lecture. Instead of listening to her, I'm just counting the number of times she says 'right'. Why can't lecturers speak without the needs for terms such as 'like' and 'right'? Very distracting

to the op of 
I share the same sentiment with you. I was in a dilemma whether to take up a PhD. I took about 1 year before deciding to do a PhD. So what is my main reason for taking a plunge and enrol myself to this programme? I felt that we should explore our interest, stepping out of our comfort zone and taking calculated risk in things that we wanted to try when we are young and energetic. I probably will be too lazy and prefer to stay in my comfort zone when I have a stable career and a happy family. Despite my painful research experience during my undergraduate years (I did research for some period of time), I don't really hate research itself. I felt so lively when I get to try out many ideas, testing these hypothesis and rigorously defend them when I discuss my research ideas with my peers. What you have to prepare yourself is the tons of disappointment and tremendous pressure to deliver results. Most of the time, you have to handle these emotions by yourself.  For me, probably I push myself too hard that at times I really question myself whether I should take up PhD in future and to a point where my health deteriorates. 

Considering the practical side, definitely doing a PhD is not practical if you see in terms of monetary value. Your peers in finance/banking industry probably receiving fat pay checks while you are struggling to run experiments all day all night with that stipend equivalent to a fresh graduate pay. But to look at it in an another way, you are doing what you like isn't it? Unless you have some heavy financial commitments, I think in exchange for lower income, you are enjoying the work that you sign up for yourself. On top of it, I think with your FCH and your work experience, you stand a chance for better scholarships. For all scholarships, there is now CPF contribution which in my personal opinion is a very good deal. At least you have some CPF savings for your future planning in buying HDB etc. If you want the good benefits that local scholarship can offer and an overseas exposure, you can try the hybrid scholarship where you can work in both NUS and overseas university (e.g imperial). These scholarship only applicable to applicants with FCH

If your intend to secure a professorship in local university, then it is best to take your PhD in overseas. For me, at this point of time, I decided to venture into industry after my PhD. That's why local universities is good enough for me. The increment for a PhD holder might be little when you first enter the industry, but why worry that your pay will not increase after that if your work performance is outstanding?

So friend, if you are thinking of doing PhD, why not look through the profile of the professors and narrow down to the research topics that you are keen to do? There is NUS, NTU and SUTD for you to consider. Once you narrow down, email the professor and let them know that you are interested in doing a PhD programme and would like to set up a meeting with them to know more about their projects and the profs itself. You may want to send them your CV prior your meet up with them. After talking to them, you probably have an idea which projects you are interested and which profs you can work with. If you are worry about the job prospects after PhD, set up a meeting with your career counsellor. They are happy to help you out even if you have graduated .
Good luck!

While tanking projects now on a sunday, I realised the importance of friends. For those potential freshies out there, my advice to you is to go for your faculty camp and get some friends.

Hello! Here's a little shameless plug from NUS Psychology Society that we think NUSWhisperers (can we call you guys that? :D) will be interested in! 

As part of our new Inspire.Psych series, one of the topics this semester will be How to Attract the Love of your Life! It'll be on 17 March, at AS1 02-05. For those interested, please sign up at http://tinyurl.com/Inspire-Psyche as there are limited slots. We will send you a confirmation email as well. 

Here's a summary of the talk: You have studied, or are going to study, social psychology. Why do we like some people and not others? What is love and what makes people fall in love with each other? Those are a few questions you will probably explore in the course. In this talk, learn how to link lectures with life and answer this particular question “How do I attract the love of my life?"

Hope to see you there! :D <3

Sometimes when I think that my fass essays are very fluff, I mentally translate them into mother tongue and realise it's quite formidable.

As the admission officer points out, for standard admission, it is really based on grades. Some form of quota is allocated for each category of students (JC, poly, International, etc). For DA, it is up to the individual faculties on who they want to recruit. 

I used to handle admissions for one of the faculty and heard from my boss to comb the bottom 10% + 10% for potential candidates. That means if the number of offers given is 1000, I would comb from 901st to 1100th candidate. Note here, number of offers given out is not intake size as more offers are usually given out to account for attrition.

As you can see, for this faculty as least, you still have to meet certain 'cut-off' to even be considered for DA. The way I see it, it is more of a practical reason than anything else as the school receives roughly 10 times more applicants than offers given.

For DA, I was told to screen for leadership, CCA, community service...the standard stuff. Interestingly, I did not come across a DA citing disability, and there was no specific guidelines on how to review such cases. Even so, I can imagine I would need some form of certificate/diagnoses from a doctor/medical officer/psychologist to accept it as a valid factor to take into account.

Your best chance probably lies in your community service records. Try to cite it as concretely as possible, like number of hours, which organisation/s, any awards, recommendation letters, etc. Remember you need to be able to back up whatever you say. 

Best of luck out there!

I wished that Profs in NUS would have their salary amount decided by the ratings giving by their students . So that for once they would learn to take their students seriously . 

Appointing TA who can't teach . Give lecture like reading from dictionary non-stop like that . Anyhow set assignment questions , then don't reply when students ask . " Sir can I ask why --- " " I taught liao u never listen " " Apparently my mouth can only open during lecture time unfortunately no more time for your questions now excuse me while I drive my BMW to utown to have a cup of kopi peng " 

Cause ? Because they get paid regardless of how they teach . And also some of them are too old to try to go all tiko on young students . Bloody hell your age can tell them how you survive WW2 liao , still try to add them on fb . 

Not going to pinpoint but I think most of the profs has at least one of the traits mentioned . One of them fits all the descriptions above not going to mention any name - cough poh cough cough cough -

Hi seniors, 

I am a polytechnic hopeful who wishes very much to join you guys at NUS (or the other big 2 universities) as I have always wanted to pursue an arts-related degree, namely in the fields of political science and sociology. Three years ago, I chose the polytechnic route for me as there was a course that is made for my passion and I am very sure I would return to the industry after my general degree. Why not choose to continue pursuing the same field in university then? My current course is extremely industry-specific and there are no Singapore universities currently offering a bachelor course of my diploma and my lecturers have also advised to pursue a general degree at the local universities instead to keep our horizons wide, just in case our industry doesn't do well one day. With that, I hope I have explained in detail why I want, and have to enter the local big 3 universities and why universities such as SIT/SUTD are out of my league. 

The problem: Currently at the end of my second year, I am not optimistic for my four-semester GPA to allow myself to qualify for the big 3. I have to apply with 4 sem results as my year 3 results (sem 5/6) are released together at the end of year 3 and applications would have closed by then. (Side track: Why is it that university open houses are AFTER poly applications closes and be catered so tightly for the JC kids? D':) 

Should you guys wonder that if I am unable to qualify for NUS, and think that I probably would not be able to survive life here, I hope you would not take my following reason as an excuse - I have a learning disability which greatly affects my numeracy skills. In short, I have screwed up, beyond my ability to control, my Math modules and other modules that are heavy with calculation and numbers (e.g.: Econs). I have managed to mitigate it as much as possible by attempting for a B or B+ in my non-Math but calculation-heavy modules, and have gotten a C+ in my two Math modules. For the other non-Math modules, I have always expected nothing less than an A from myself. 

The questions: 

1) Poly seniors: Would it be possible to pull up my GPA significantly by doing well in my remaining semesters? I got a GPA of 3.4 in Semester 1.2 and 3.7 in Semester 2.1 (the miracle of no Math modules), but my cGPA was pulled only from a 3.3 to 3.45. Would this continue to be the case or would it change significantly (e.g.:+0.2 each time) if I continue to do well (e.g.: 3.8 and above for remaining semesters)? 

2) Poly seniors: What happens when we can only submit our 4-semester results? Would we be similarly judged against those with 5-semester results or would the admissions office hold our application and process only with our 5/6 semester results? 

3) To all: I recently met an admissions officer by chance and she shared that NUS would not be taking into consideration my learning disability when processing my application. In short, there will be support in NUS if I ever matriculate, but processing of my application would solely be on my GPA. Are there avenues I can appeal to and have my GPA considered without my Math modules? I did bring up to my polytechnic if it was possible to calculate my GPA without my math modules, but their main concern was that universities would not accept such a GPA. (Its just like, I S/U away my Math modules, which I believe would significantly change things.) 

4) To all: How stringent are the DA criteria? I am looking to DA into NUS via community service as I have done quite a fair bit of community work. In fact, way beyond anyone I know around me and no, its not just for this purpose but because I truly enjoy it. Could anyone quantify the number of hours needed to be considered for DA or is it even remotely possible for someone to be entered through DA via community service as the places are given to national athletes/Olympiad winners instead? 

I sincerely thank you if you have made it through my entire long post and thank you very very much in advance if you leave an equally sincere reply. :)

 It depends on where you want to go. For instance, if you are going to Osaka (KIX), the landing fees are significantly higher. Of course, if you say the United States, going to John F. Kennedy (JFK) is certainly more expensive than say... Washington-Dulles (IAD). Right now oil is bad, and so going to Houston: George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) is cheap, but going to Los Angeles (LAX) is of course expensive.

Well, I could advise you to go to Barcelona (BCN) and stop-over before heading to Sao Paulo (GRU) for an exciting, exotic grad trip. On your way back, you could stop by Dubai (DXB).

Poor boy with no scholarship here. Came into NUS just barely with poor A-level grades (CCC). But will be graduating with a first class this year. It sucks that our university performance is judged by our A-level results. It sucks to see academically weaker students on scholarship with a second lower/upper while here I am thrashing them at the bell curve. I honesty feel it's unfair. So much for meritocracy. Every time I see a person lose a scholarship because his grades fall below 3.5 I smile inside. That will teach scholarship departments to brush up on their selection process and hopefully consider future students who do well in Uni instead of at A-levels.

Hi Friends,

I am currently an SG-PR, y1 biz student. Being a non citizen, I have been excluded from a number of pre-matriculation scholarships (ie: Kent Ride Scholarship and Dean's Scholarship ). While I did secure financial aid, I was unfortunately unable to secure any scholarship before matriculation. 

As times are tougher now, I would like to seek advice from my fellow peers on what scholarships may I apply to? Most of the scholarships seem to require you to not have entered university yet.

Thanks ! :)))

 actually, there are many foreign doctors in Singapore. Not GPs, but the ones working in hospitals. There are many foreign trained lawyers in Singapore and the glut is causing many students to fear for their chances in obtaining training contracts. As for bankers, many expatriates occupy positions in foreign banks. Also, not all finance majors end up as hotshot bankers.

The main difference is the perception of prestige.

After Arts Open today, I am now ashamed to tell ppl that I am a lit major. From screaming tactics to hurling vulgarities during the games, how pathetic can you guys get? People were actually bitching that we have no brains and only know how to write storybooks. Thank you lit soc for destroying the image of lit majors. No wonder many other lit majors cannot be bothered about lit soc stuff. Because you guys simply make the soc into some exclusive club, creating an elitist sphere that excludes the lit population. So much so for claiming to be inclusive. There will never be any lit pride so long as you all continue to live in your dreamy little world under that pathetic leadership.

 in response to your question on job hunting the answer is both yes and no. I graduated in December too with a job offer for july next year because on one hand, it's advantageous. You will start applying in sem 1, which is when all the big firms in finance and tech do grad recruitment, while your peers graduating in May are less bothered with applying in Sem 1 so you have slightly less competition when applying to these popular firms. But, it's really annoying cos there's no way to accelerate the start date of your job as its catered to those who grad in May, so you have to deal with the awkward gap in between. Also, you will be missing out on jobs that are only offered in sem 2 if you had gotten and accepted an offer before you grad.

HI i am really keen to take a double degree. Not only because I wanna differentiate myself in the job market in the future, but also because i have interest in both Economics and Mathematics.

I understand it is hard. But how hard is it? I believe: With a will there is a way. Am i too naive?

Any others who trotted down this path care to share their views? Disadvantages, advantages of a double degree? And maybe some regrets (like you should have read up in advance even before starting uni? even a bit? I am taking a gap year now. [mainly cos I am real sick and also cos of other reasons, but that is another story for another time])
(I can still study though. Just have to make many trips to the hospital)

I wanna reduce my chances of flunking/repeating or wasting any unneeded time in university cos the school fees will take a financial toll on me :(

THANKS IN ADVANCE.
YOUR SINCERE GUIDANCE AND ADVICE WILL REALLY BE MUCH APPRECIATED.

Leadership skills? I have never been in a leadership position before. Yet most internships or even overseas programmes emphasise leadership skills to be a criteria.

Where can I showcase my leadership qualities? Any advice please? ( Is leadership even a word? Semantic Satiation)

Hi, I'm currently a year 2 student in Economics and I'm thinking of taking part in some research work during year 3 as I really want to learn how it is like to do research, the methodology, tools and all (I don't think what I am currently learning in class gives a good representation of research work). I've taken some level 3000 and one 4000 module so I hope I'm ready for the challenge (and I'm willing to learn more too!). 

I tried searching about UROP for FASS but the link they have was on topics for AY14/15. I thought of maybe starting my own mini research project or something, but I'm not sure if I will learn much without a mentor. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about it? Thanks a lot!

7 Reasons Why No One Wants to be an Engineer in Singapore

No one wants to be an engineer anymore. Here are the reasons:

1. Low pay.

2. Low prestige.

3. Engineering faculties/departments are dumping grounds. (What’s the cut off point now?) This is the death spiral.

4. Study so hard for what? The skills needed to get high pay are just: ability to speak well, present fluff well, dress well, socialize well, PowerPoint, Excel (the basics) and Google.

5. If things go wrong, it’s the engineer’s fault. Think software bugs, train breakdowns, etc. Doing sales, marketing, communications, coordination and general admin (aka “management”) seems so much easier.

6. Business owners and clients don’t expect to pay a lot for engineering solutions and talent. They always say, “Let’s outsource to overseas. Let’s hire the cheaper foreign talent.” But they don’t say the same thing when they’re looking for lawyers, doctors and bankers.

7. Retired bankers play golf and drive expensive cars. Retrenched engineers drive taxis.

Like the dude who plays for national team ranting on the mediocre humility of his varsity teammates. I too play for national team since young, having drafted into youth, followed by the national team and naturally poached to play for varsity in NUS. 

I train with league/national team outside and naturally attend varsity training lesser. This is heads up to the so called 'Varsity' cream of the crop. Like what the previously OP mentioned, most of you just became the 'best' because many left or simply chose not to play anymore. I too observed many training sessions that were simply not serious and minimal effort was put in. And it is always the handful who really just talks too much.

As much as I respect these athletes, I humbly believe much more humility and effort should be shown. Donning the blue varsity shirt dont mean S***. And especially to the mediocre noisy ones, you might wanna keep it down, the whole school knows you're on the NUS team, they get it.

I think there is a distinction between a scholarship and financial aid. 

A scholarship is to encourage students who are doing well to work for a certain organisation after graduation or to study in a specific school. The scholarship acts as an incentive because the institution, be it a school or a government organisation, feels that the scholar can contribute by being part of the institution.

Financial aid is to help those who cannot afford the same opportunities as everyone else. The student on financial aid is not expected to work or contribute to an institution later on, just pay back his/her loans. 

As a scholar myself, I go for all my interviews with the mindset that the scholarship/ work application/ internship board knows best. I tell them honestly who I am, how I think, and let them make the decision as to whether or not I am suitable for a position. I trust their decision. If they say no then alright, at least I know something isn't suited for me. 

I feel that rejection is a blessing because I certainly wouldn't want to end up somewhere where my personality doesn't suit the performance criteria I have to meet. 

Maybe you just haven't found your niche, maybe the way you think is not really what the scholarship board is looking out for. No point being envious/ angry, make yourself a better person instead :)

 herein lies the failure of this suggestion: the rich will never have the heart to help a poor out at the expense of their own money. Quote bill gates, mark zuckerberg, etc but just ask yourselves scholars, how many of you who can comfortably afford uni education, if given a choice to donate the monetary part of your scholarship to a fellow needy student would agree?

I went for a scholarship interview once.

The first question they asked, "Tell us why you think we should give you this scholarship."

"Because I'm poor," I replied.

The interview panel immediately cancelled all further interviews for the day and awarded me the scholarship.

Then I woke up.

Actually I don't get it. If scholarship holders who are financially able are after scholarships for the non-monetary benefits, why don't we give out scholarships with assured career development and training and prestige but give the monetary benefit (payment of fees, etc) to another student who is financially needy but does not meet the mark for the scholarship? Best of both worlds.  Yes that's financial aid! So what I really am advocating is giving scholarships without monetary benefits to those who by means testing are financially able! The same prestige and career path is accorded. Of course, if a scholarship holder also happen to be financially needy (by means testing) will be able to get its monetary sponsorship as well. But then of course, will the rich scholarship holders agree to such an arrangement?

3rd, he is always "busy" and has to leave early or available on very little days. 
Lastly, his biggest contribution to date is... *drum roll* volunteering to write minutes for our 2nd meeting. AND The 2nd minutes looks exactly like the 1st minutes (which i wrote) with the date changed. KNNBCCB! I know the minutes is no big deal and has no weightage at all, but can't he show us some effort?

Hi OP , 

I understand how u feel . I agree . Some of the kids ( your cousin for example ) defends themselves by saying " I worked hard for this without using my parent's money " . Now these people missed the whole point of a scholarship . It's to help people who are capable but cannot afford education , not meant to be used as a tool to show off your achievements . 

A simple process would be to give a test for everyone who qualifies , e.g : an above average result from a low income family . A quick logic thinking test and a short interview would give the result very easily then only u go for a second round . But the people in charge of these are simply enjoying too much of sg city life to comprehend what lower income lives are . 

Do they ever think twice before they wanted to order a teh peng at a coffee shop ? 

Had they ever tried rushing to work right after school to earn that few dollars because u know there are people back at home depending on you ? 

Is it my fault that I was born into a lower class family ? So why do I deserve this ?

I'm not saying that scholars who come from wealthy families didn't work hard for this , I'm saying that there are those who need it much more than them . For example , you woke up in a desert with a person who is dehydrated , there is a bottle of mineral water 500m away . Both of you tried to run towards it , while you are well equiped definitely you will get to the water first , but do u think that u need it more or the person who is dehydrated need it more ? Of course this is not the best example to use but you get the point .

Those who are in studying overseas , I meant no disrespect to anyone nor is the intention of this post to insult anyone so I appreciate if you don't comment unnecessary stuff on this post . 

To OP ,  I think that you should keep trying your best , graduate and get a stable job and tend to your family . At least you made it to uni , I'm working full time and studying part time here , not because of my results ( slightly below 3.9 ) or my cca's ( full ) , but simply because my family cannot afford it . The money I make also goes to my brother's allowance . Because of this I also had to give up my passion in CS because Nus only offers full time CS course .

I'm surviving this OP, I believe you can do it too .

When I was in secondary days, I used to be part of the combined schools team as well as the junior national team. As I progressed to JC, I got my breakthrough and was drafted to the national team in J2. I have since been a regular of the national team and have represented Singapore in several major regional and international tournaments, something I am extremely proud of and humbled the same time. 

Being a NUS student, I am also proud to don the school colours and fight for honours alongside my teammates at the annual SuNIG and IVP. However, there has been something I have been putting up with for a long time which I felt the need to address and put out to my fellow sportsmen here. 

My NUS teammates( not the national team) consists of many people who were from opposing school teams during our JC days. Most of them only started with the sport during JC, therefore their standard is quite far from what I'm used to playing with. Nevertheless, I still don't mind being part of the team as long as it helps the school. I don't mean to be arrogant here, but I was in the national set-up for such a long time that I barely knew anyone outside of it(except my school team of course).  Well, that was before NS came along and took away the careers of many of my talented mates. Then when it came to Uni, the remaining guys who were still actively taking part in the sport were those who were not exactly good before, but just continued with the sport because, well, the best already quit so why not become the new "best" ? Or so they thought. 

Now here's the thing. Firstly, I have to say that I fully respect my NUS teammates for sticking to the sport despite not being able to attain the highest level. But....the issue I have with them is with their overwhelming ego. On one of the occasions when I popped by their training ( I train elsewhere with the national team), I observed very negative behaviour from them such as arrogance, being inconsiderate etc. Of course I won't go into detail lest I reveal myself. I felt very upset that some university athletes still must behave in such a manner.  

Besides my teammates. I've overheard some team NUS athletes talking their mouth off to others, boasting of their achievements and skills( wearing the blue varsity shirt makes it so easy to identify you guys ). 
If any of my fellow NUS athlete are reading this , please, let's remind each other that as athletes, we should first carry ourselves with humility and behave just  like a normal NUS student. Us representing the school does not mean we are superior to those who don't (my NUS teammates love to think they are). 
So to whoever thinks that he/she is superior to others just because he/she is represents the school for competitions: Just remember that there are many people who were better than you but quit due to other commitments, so please not make yourself an idiot by walking around wearing that blue varsity shirt and running your mouth off and embarrassing the rest of us Athletes. I know most of us don't do such things, but I've seen and witnessed several incidents with my own eyes that I feel the need to voice this out. 

If I, a national athlete, can behave like a normal NUS student ( most of my Uni friends don't even know what sport I play) anyone else can do the same. Pls ah, guys, maintain. 

P.S: I don't wear the NUS Varsity shirt or any shirt that indicates that I belong to the national team in school either

I read about many scholarships online and almost all of them have bonds. Thats understandable as they pay for your fees and even give you allowance, surely they have to benefit from you too.

But then theres the NUS bond-free scholarship. Man it seems too good to be true, paying you allowance on top of giving you free education, whilst expecting nth in return (ok maybe some cip or whatnot, but not bond yea)

Why is there such good stuff available? Does NUS gives out a lot of such undergraduate scholarship?
Thanks for reading.

Hi I'm planning to apply for nus pharmacy. However, I am a quiet person with low self-confidence and sometimes stammer when I talk, especially when I'm nervous, speaking to a large group or encounter a new problematic situation. I know that all pharmacy students have to take SP1203 (Foundation in Effective Communication) and I'm already dreading it.. Will I be suited to take pharmacy/ become a pharmacist? Really need some advice here...

Do you guys think there are better ways around this system? I dislike going to school unnecessarily.

Hi just wondering, does anyone feels that IRO is a little slow this time in updating the summer programmes for the various universities? Some of them are updated for this year but clicking on the link leads nowhere (page cannot be displayed) :(

Usually by when will they finalise the updates about the courses available? I need to decide fast as i am trying to decide between doing special term here or to go on summer exchange, because deadline for special term registration is mid march and i am worried that by the time i apply for summer and get my interview results, i am gonna miss my registration for special term. If i apply for special term, only to realise i get a place for summer exchange and then drop my special term registration, i heard that there's no refund available. But if i dont apply for special term first,there's no guarantee that i can pass my interview stage (given that i can't speak well) and i might end up with nothing (special term part 1 had more modules available on STRS). Its urgent that i must do 2 modules this special term as i do not want to do too many modules during my FYP year next academic year..

Please advise if i should just apply for special term straight or wait to apply summer programmes...thanks..

Whenever I see a rich kid studies on a scholarship, I feel sad. I always believe people who can afford essential things like education should use their own money to pay for it, instead of depriving the resources from someone who needs it more. One example would be my maternal cousin. Ever since we were young, his parents are very successful. He can afford many things and was probably given the best private tutors money can buy. In addition, his mind is free from any financial burden, thus he can better focus on his studies. My parents are poor on the other hand. This is probably because my mother who is the elder sibling, gave up her education for my aunt as my grandparents couldn't afford to send both to school in the 1970s. Hence, being uneducated, my mother met my equally uneducated father and the both of them struggle to make ends meet as low skilled workers after marriage. Whereas my aunt received a good uni education, met a high income lawyer in her work, gave birth to my cousin and stopped working.

The stress caused by financial troubles usually affects my family, thus affecting me as well. Closer to exams, while others are intensively studying, I cannot give up my part time work because I may lose the job. Despite all these, I did well in my school, however not well enough to get a scholarship for uni. I was rejected countless of times when I applied for numerous scholarships. I wasn't even called for an interview. Many of these scholarships expect me to be almost perfect in both academics and co-curricular activities. However, I was never active in any CCAs as I needed to work, and my grades are only good at best, not excellent.

So basically my cousin had a perfect score and outstanding CCAs. Naturally, he gets numerous offers of prestigious scholarships, with good jobs reserved for him and to choose from in the future. And he gets to go on numerous student exchanges to gain more experience. My aunt is the tai tai sort of the person who spends lavishly on material goods. And since she doesn't need to pay for my cousin's education, she is buying even more expensive things to indulge herself and bringing her whole family for exotic trips frequently. I remembered my mother asking my aunt to loan me money to pay some of my fees so I can work less and focus more on school. However, I remember the way she looked at us in disgust, gave a superficial smile then told us her money is controlled by her husband (my uncle). Since we do not know my uncle very well, my mother requested my aunt if she can ask him to help me. My aunt reluctantly said okay. However, we didn't received any news from her regarding this. Soon, I dropped the idea and find other means.

Luckily, I got financial aid and some loan, which is really a great help for me, but I am troubled by not being able to find a good job or have enough savings next time. Getting a scholarship would really have helped me a lot more.

I am really very saddened by all this. The scholarship selection process is disappointing. It is very lazy and unnecessarily played by the book. Although it has to be fair to all students as long as they are outstanding, they should be more aware of the opportunity cost involved for some students if they do not have a scholarship. But I suppose most of these people who hands out scholarships don't really care whether they are actually helping society (although they claim to be doing philanthropy work), all they want is to give themselves societal recognition or find suitable future employees to profit themselves. I don't blame them for this, since they doing something which makes economic sense for themselves.

I don't expect charity from anyone, but I want people to be more empathetic. A bad student or poor person doesn't mean he is less deserving to be given a chance, even for an interview. Thus I keep telling myself everyday I will help people who are less fortunate than I am. If we don't start shaping society in the image we want it to be, society will shape us into the image it wants us to be, into overly competitive and selfish machines living a cold and meaningless society.

Can someone enlighten me on how to find an internship? I am a year 1 FASS student and I have send out quite a number of applications in early Feb but there is still zero reply. I have tried websites like career@gov and also applied directly through some company websites but I am not sure if I am doing it right(judging from the response)? Also, is there a big difference between doing a temp admin job(which I basically learn nothing from) and doing an internship? Since I heard that some internship pay very lowly, I am wondering if doing a temp job would be a better deal. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I went to Micron yesterday for interview for PIE position. The logic test was damn lengthy and I had no enough time to solve them thoroughly, but I guess I could have got around 20 questions correct. Then the interview was about 45 minutes long, the interviewer asked me some technical questions and I manage to answer most of them. I expected second and even third round of interview but I was told to go back and wait. 
Anyone who went for interview at Micron yesterday can tell me does this mean I was be rejected? I heard that people usually get offer on the spot at Micron.

I'm lost.  I took a very very unpopular major in the FASS . I really like it but I am not intellectual. I do not really speak up in class. I am a bit slow , I need time to process all the information. My cap is around 4.4. I want to be in academia. But I am scared that I am not smart enough. My professors do not know me much . I do not think they have very high opinions on me as well. Is it going to be very diffuclt for me to pursue my inerest?

Just wanna procrastinate and rant.
Year 1 FASS student. Never thought that having a social clout/circle was important. Spent my time working rather than attending camps. Bidded for the modules I'm interested in. Going to all my classes alone. Having my meals at odd timings to avoid the crowd. I was contented living in my own world.

And then it hit me. (figuratively) All those friendships act as walls around us, for us to lean on whenever we are swayed by the wind. Took this lvl 2000 module where we have a 3k words assignment. We were allowed to do it individually or find a group. Either way the word requirement is the same. Now I feel so crappy. The content's confusing enough already. My TA acknowledged my email (11/02) during tutorial on 16/02 and has yet to reply even now. It's a few questions and interpretations on course content I want to clarify with.
 
I'm can't even conceptualize on a topic I can expand on yet. I've no clue what's considered relevant to that field and what's not. It's hard to "ask the prof" when I don't even know what to ask. Sometimes I don't even understand the questions I'm asking. I try to visualize them, but just can't. I don't even wanna wake up when I've no lessons. Who doesn't wanna get his sh*t together? 

What's scary's that it's not merely the reality that's hit me, but also this smiling façade I've on. Guess we're only as strong as the faces we see frequently.   
I'm scared I can't produce anything for my assignment. It feels like the queue for the cashier's getting shorter, and I might approach empty-handed.

To 

I'm to-be NUS CS student, matriculating in 2016. I read your post with great interest and decided to reply. This is my 1st 'confession' so to speak haha.

In my opinion, if you realise, innovation comes with a skillset. The ones you mention have a website design skillset. If you are talking about taking social sciences/arts modules as to broaden our knowledge, then yes, definitely I agree with you that our government should encourage more of such students. Lifelong learning is the needed attitude for innovation. 

However, if you are talking about taking a full degree in arts, then I disagree. An arts/social science degree student must learn an additional skill (for instance programming) to have a startup like those you mention. So why not take a CS degree and learn social science modules and not vice versa :).

Right now, engineers are already in shortage, that's why they are promoting. It will have success only to a certain extent as the culture of risk-taking ain't there, which is necessary for entreprenaurship. 

Thank you for reading :)

(P.S I'm excited to start my uni life this year and planned to take up CCAs (Or I heard they call this interest groups?). Lifelong learning :)

Singapore have been trying very hard to mimick Silicon Valley. But their plans have failed to take-off. Then recently, we hear our ministers making dumb comments about how Singapore should learn from Silicon Valley. They should reflect on why these previous plans have failed to flourish. Because they think that training more engineers will result in more innovations.

What people don't realize is that in Silicon Valley, there are combinations of CS founders with non-CS founders. For e.g. Peter Thiel (Paypal / Palantir), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), Stewart Butterfield (Flickr/ Slack), Ben Silbermann (Pinterest) are not trained in Computer Science. The government needs to broaden their horizon of thinking. Encourage students to study in Arts and Social Sciences as well. Change the perception of an Arts degree.

"Many students from engineering school doesn't see much hope of finding a girlfriend. This is because the girls to boys ratio are very low in engineering school. After graduation, it will be hard to find a girlfriend in workplace due to workplace politics."

There is indeed no need to worry, but I have a completely different reason: why is not having a girlfriend something to worry about? Seriously, having a girlfriend is SERIOUSLY OVERRATED.

I was reading this:
Google acquires messaging start-up Pie to kick-start Singapore engineering push

I was thinking, wah, Google really gives LHL face, LHL just said wanna attract Singaporeans in US to come back to work, then Google have this project, to set up new Engineering team here in Singapore, and asking the Singaporeans in their US HQ if they wanna come back. They acquired a Singapore start-up company to do so some more. Really give face.

Then, I Google the news and saw this:
Google acquires Singapore-based workplace chat app Pie, its first in the region

Then this:
Google building a new engineering team in Singapore, plans to train 100,000 developers in Indonesia as it refocusses on southeast Asia

Quote:
Google today announced a couple of new significant moves as it plans to refocus on development in southeast Asia. It will build its first engineering team dedicated to the area, in Singapore, and has promised to help train up to 100,000 developers in Indonesia within 4 years, in a bid to get more content out in the country, using its own national language(s).

Quote:
Adding to this engineering team in Singapore, Google has also committed to help train developers. Indonesian President Joko Widodo is visiting the company in Mountain View today, and Google has offered support in helping to train up a generation of software developers. The target is 100,000 Indonesian developers by 2020.

Google notes that its target will be reached using a three-prong approach.

First off, it will partner with universities to reach senior year computer science students, offering them a full semester curriculum focussed on creating Android apps.

Secondly, Google’s Udacity courses will be translated into Bahasa Indonesia. These courses are free and can be taken anywhere, from any device. Translating these courses in to a local language will make it easier for the country’s aspiring developers to get going with building their app ideas. Or, at least, that’s Google’s hope.

Lastly, Google plans to hold Developer Study Jams. They’ll host these intensive study groups across five cities; Bandung, Jakarta, Semarang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta.

Indonesia gains the most!

I will like to share a story about my entrepreneurial journey. It's not going to be an inspirational rag-to-riches story, but it is going to be a reality check for those who are planning to make it big by starting their own company in the future. As I wish to stay anonymous, I will not reveal any specific information about who and what is involved.

I started off being interested about starting out on my own after reading books about successful entrepreneurs in uni. So after I became disgruntled with my job, I took the leap of faith and used my customer base from the job to seek my first customers. I started earning money as a sole proprietor, then began to hire people. The first few people I hired became invaluable to my business, so when I registered to form a company, I gave them shares, I got 40% and five of them have 60%. The intention was to make them have a stake in our company so that they will do their best. All the directors are also shareholders.

However, soon I realized that was the biggest mistake in my life. I misjudged them. When they were empowered to have a bigger say, they became selfish. During our meeting they unanimously make decisions to reward themselves more but I proposed more money to be kept for the bad times, or offer better benefits to attract talent. But as a rule of law, they are the majority and their will prevails.

When I considered speaking to a lawyer if there are any remedies available for minority shareholder protection in my case, my attention was drawn to the falling performance of our business. Then, I realized our business isn't going to go far.

First, we do not have a strong competitive advantage, we were just lucky to have a good start due to my initial customer base. However as new competition flooded in, we do not have talented employees or excess resources to develop something better.

Second, the market in Singapore is too small. This is a very huge disadvantage for most local businesses. Even if a company is doing well, sales will plateau out if we depend on the domestic market.  And it's also very difficult to go international. Because unless we have something unique, our business will be oust by other global or foreign companies. And our network and understanding on how things are managed abroad is lacking. That's why it's always good to have connections with people in other countries.

Third, we lack strong control over our suppliers. We have multiple foreign suppliers on the same input just in case one of them fails, we'll still have other channels. Unfortunately, what if all of them fail due to unforeseen circumstances? It was time-consuming and costly for me to go abroad to the factories to check and remind them to deliver our order on time. Perhaps it would have been a lot easier if these inputs are easily available in Singapore. But as our market is too small as above-mentioned, the local suppliers tend to be more expensive and smaller companies like ours won't be able to afford them without eroding our profits. It also makes trying new ideas or prototypes harder and more expensive.

It seems in Singapore, if you want your business to grow big, you need government support. Notice the government's hand in a lot of big businesses in Singapore, even though these are considered "private companies". It's because our government is influential and wealthy, and can help give these businesses a boost. However, I always hope the government will build a better foundation for local businesses to thrive, and then let them compete against each other without having a stake in either one of the companies.  

So we dissolved the company and went our separate ways when I refused to buy back the other shares when they wanted out. As much as I love preserving the company I started, I wanted to let them know I will no longer give in to their demands. Most of what we liquidated were used to pay off our debts. It took me almost 8 years to build it and it's gone within a year. Do I think it was worth it? No and yes.

No because it was very time consuming. I worked from 8am to about 2am almost everyday. Most people who live on paychecks in 9am to 5pm jobs usually have the evenings and weekends off. They get to spend time with their boyfriends. And my salary is probably the same as theirs, about 4 to 5K. The dividends and director fees I received are not worth the time loss as well. I wouldn't mind sacrificing everything if I am working towards something which I will reap the rewards later. However, the people running the company with me do not share the same enthusiasm. They look out for their own immediate wants instead of the long-term success of the company. Once they got too used to me, they always gave the impression as to why they must listen to me. Thinking about this makes me blood boil! Ugh!

But yes. I don't regret it because the events made me a stronger person. It taught me not to be so gullible and thinking that the world and everyone is kind and ideal. It also made me appreciate people more for their personality rather than ability. It is not because of lack of ability our management crumbled, since we were all excellent students with good managerial experience. However, it's the attitude. It is easy for one to do a job as long as they are reasonably intelligent when there is already a proper protocol and stable structure for them to follow. Yet when things are chaotic and uncertain in the case of a startup, it is the attitude that counts, the good attitude of persevering and to be able to settle with lower individual gains for the common benefit. 
 
So I went back working as an employee again, met a nice man and got married. So here's my final advice for those who are serious about starting your own venture in the future: Always hold a bargaining chip. It's to give both parties a reason why they still need each other for mutual benefit if the relationship turns sour. It may sound scheming, but you must know how to protect yourself. Not many care about the injustice of the winner using unfair tactics to triumph over the others. What most people care is whether they are on the winning side. Good luck!

The fact is SV is a lot more attractive because of a culture of acceptance, of risk taking, of all-around liberalism and good taste that's lacking here. The culture not just within startup or tech folk, but in the West Coast and American Metro areas in general. This culture which is sorely lacking anywhere outside liberal America, so much so that even the EU or CAN based startups that succeeded have had to relocate to be closer to their target market. 

The problem is culture. 

Look at famous, successful SV hackers / founders and you'll see, without a shadow of a doubt, a consistent parade of intelligent, tasteful people. These people aren't just engineers or business people, but modern Renaissance men and women with knowledge of art, culture, the things that make us human. They're curious, hungry, creative.

Very often, the curious, hungry, creative erudites I meet in Singapore aren't in tech. They're arts students, graphic designers, cafe owners, magazine editors, filmmakers, musicians, and so forth.

That's very disappointing, given that startups are the defining creative vehicle of our time. 

The tech folk could be more inclined to cultural activities, but sadly, what I've only discovered is, beyond the usual trend-spotting of new technologies like React, node.js, Tensor Flow, etc, there’s close to nothing else. To hacker and founder types in SG, the craft is the culture and the medium is the message.

Besides the lack of taste among hacker / founder types here, the other problem is the lack of designers who want to start zero to one style startups. Who else is better positioned than The Designer, being at the intersection between the old school "creative arts" and the new school of tech?

In response to  If we're talking about learning expectations, I imagined that there would be less rote learning in engineering, more practical applications and student engagement. However, the traditional approach to teaching is still prevalent in our curriculum. Still, it is in my view that the teaching and learning standards in university can be improved with asynchronous learning, where students are compelled to sieve knowledge on their own via more open-topic group projects, and constant communication with the professor.

Students don't read books anymore? Nowadays when the professor mentioned some classics, then everyone look damn blur. Lol.

Hi guys, need a little advice here. I am stuck with a bunch of randomly assigned groupmates this sem and they aren't doing work! We have graded stuff to hand in every tutorial and every single week, I will always do the work by myself and ask on the group chat if anyone has done so we can discuss, but there is no response at all. Seriously, they don't even reply to my message! At least reply a "I haven't done it yet" or something! So I keep asking them and get no replies, until the due date draws near and I just submit my answer for the whole group since they are freaking unresponsive. And after I told the group I submitted the work, they replied "Thanks!" and that's it!

This has been going on since the start of the semester and I absolutely hate it. I am considering reporting them to the lecturer this week, but I am also afraid that my groupmates will start harbouring negative feelings towards me, since there are still many more tutorials after the recess week. Help! What should I do?

 I've had amazing PRC and Indian lecturers and tutors in multiple faculties who illustrate concepts well with examples and diagrams. Some try to connect with their class with varying success, but I appreciate their effort.

Nothing will save you if you choose to drone off slides or suggested solutions. Accent is insignificant compared to attitude. My experience may be out of the norm, but we should critique teaching on more reasonable grounds.

 omg you totally wrote what I feel! Even though we shouldn't be spoonfed at uni level~ I feel that at least our few thousand dollars school fees should be worth at least some good quality and conprehensible lectures/tutorials. Seriously, the PRCs teaching us..... make my head swell from trying to understand their accent. In my tutorials, at least half of the class gave up trying to decipher wth the PRC was talking. Sometimes I feel that NUS should change its name to NUC. National University of China. I think more people will understand if they teach in Chinese instead of English.

Saw this in a math book.

This method is, to define as the number of a class the class of all classes similar to the given class. Membership of this class of classes (considered as a predicate) is a common property of all the similar classes and of no others; moreover every class of the set of similar classes has to the set of a relation which it has to nothing else, and which every class has to its own set. Thus the conditions are completely fulfilled by this class of classes, and it has the merit of being determinate when a class is given, and of being different for two classes which are not similar. This, then, is an irreproachable definition of the number of a class in purely logical terms.

This morning was the only time I cannot get to IVLE because website is down or some loop error stuff. Then I missed the quiz announced because I skipped the lecture I had never skipped before.
Should I blame myself that I did not check IVLE earlier?
Or should I blame myself for skipping that lecture?
I really want to blame IVLE but maybe it's my fault.
I'm just sad now.
Damn you IVLE.

To all engineering students, what are some of your expectations of university education that were mismatched with reality? For me, before matriculating, I thought that the university community would be rather close or tight-knit, but it wasn't so for my case. Share some of your learning expectations in your course vs the actual situation.

I think we should have a TV club that hosts viewing parties/marathons of popular shows, just for fans to get together and talk about their favorite shows, or just chill in general.

It can't be an official club affiliated with the school though, since the methods used to obtain those episodes will not be approved...

p.s. dat new GOT teaser tho

I'm 24 this year and my parents are still very overprotective of me, just because I'm a girl???? Everytime I want to go overseas alone/with my friends, they will say no. Always citing safety as the main issue. I really really want to travel overseas but they just won't let me, but I'm already an adult????? I didn't go on exchange because of that as well. 

No it's not because of financial issues, we are financially stable, have decent amount of savings and I'm NOT asking to travel to Europe or America every half a year. My family travels together every year/ every other year, but we always get a driver/tour. I just want to experience the local's lives and cultures or do a trip by myself or with my friends.

Sorry for the incoherence, I'm just damn pissed right now.

I’m an exchange student from Europe, as are almost all of my good friends. With other exchangers I have lots of starters for when conversation dies down - where they are from originally, where they are going during recess week, impressions on various parts of Singaporean society, what other languages they speak, whether they would consider living here long term etc. What are some good topics for small talk with Singaporeans? I’m  slightly nervous about bringing up political views/ questions about ethnicity? Is this something to avoid?

TL;DR what topics can an exchange student use for small talk with Singaporeans?
-
 
I've heard that many political science majors in FASS are satisfied with their majors, but I was just wondering -- How many actually do change their majors from political science to something else?

 The problem with the engineering industry is that we're treated as costs and liability, not as productive and long-term return assets. In the past, engineers were valued for building up S'pore's infrastructure. Now, it's a race to the bottom for lowest costs. Most engineers in the civil service are just project managers who manage private companies, which in turn hire lower-wage engineers from overseas.

It's a rare sight on a typical Sunday (I come every day) to see so many students still in school. 

It's even a rarer sight,supposedly, to see so many students still in school. On Valentine's Day.

I am guessing... mid terms are coming up? Haha, in that case, jia you, good luck!!!!

People say that when one door closes, another one opens... As an engineer, I tell you it's actually due to indoor air-flow.

I tried reading this book called 'Are you smart enough to work at Google?'. Completely nonsense to ask people such thought-experiment questions that have nothing to do with Computer Science. Maybe bullshiters can do well.

Killing the Vday vibe. But I'm so annoyed at having to self-study ALL my mods due to lecturers who are extremely bad at teaching. Personally, I feel that local lecturers are really clear with their explanation. As for China lecturers(no offense to PRCs) a large majority of them really cannot teach. I understand that they do research for NUS and stuff, but how can NUS call itself a university that provides world-class education when they have poor teaching staff that cannot even get their point across properly. So I spend $7k a year just to get the NUS cert and to self-study??? What a waste of my time and money. And those shity lecturers get paid a lot when their lectures are incomprehensible....great

You can't just tell us to focus on engineering. Do nothing to make it attractive for 10 years. Then tell us to focus on engineering again.

Funny how LKY can say high salary is need to attract good people into politics.

But when it comes to engineering jobs the same high salary does not apply anymore......suddenly interesting/attractive job satisfaction is more important!

 The best part time job is F&B(KFC , BK, McD, Popeyes)  or Retail Industry(7/11, Cheers, Fair price etc). You get paid around 6-7$ an hour and the timings are flexible. 
You can work 3-4 hours a day during your classes and work 8-9 hours on weekends. Any combination is possible. Totally depends on your manager but most managers are flexible. You can totally skip work during your exams or when you feel you have too much of workload of assignments.

I know people who have been working in F&B for many years and guess what, they do not come to work for months and when they have vacation they work everyday. Thats how it goes.

Most F&B and retail outlets work in such a way that the manager asks for your "availability" for the next week or next 2 weeks. You get to decide which day u wanna work and your shift.  Simple.

Another difference between F&B and Retail is F&B you get a meal for free where as in Retail, you must bring your own food. You save the money for a meal and you also get to eat their food( McD or KFC meal etc) 

Also F&B and retail 99% are always and always and always short of staff. So you can just choose which one you want to work for and go for a walk in and talk to them. Even if they dont have a vacancy, they will surely direct you to a branch which has a vacancy.

All the best.

 hello there, sorry to hear about your plight. There's no harm trying to apply to give tuition. If you're afraid, you can try giving for lower primary, you should be fine! You can check out WhizzKidz too. They are always looking for part-time instructors to carry out after school activities with pri sch kids. No need alot of experience ithink. And the pay is really good :) Jiayou!

What happens if I don't attend tutorial sessions with attendance taking and an active discussion/presentation session? Do I just lose out on the grades (tutorial participation is graded) or will there be other troubles? Anyone missed any tutorials too?
Also is changing majors at the start of the 2nd year recommended at all? What is there to expect after changing majors?

Hi I'm taking CS1010E this sem. Does anyone have any tips on how to do well? I don't have any programming knowledge and the people around me are all very pro at it and I'm still a newbie :(
-
 
Hi. I want to ask if anyone here know of any part-time jobs I can do while studying? Jobs which timings are flexible and doesn't require any specialized knowledge or experience. I hope it's not selling insurance, property, financial plans etc. but rather, one that pays a fixed hourly wage. When I look for most part-time jobs, what they meant by part-time is temporary jobs where they expect full-time commitment for over a few months then it's goodbye. That's not what I want. I want one which I can study and work at the same time for over a longer period to pay my expenses and school fees. 

Also, I am considering giving tuition, but my 'A' level and 'O' level grades are mediocre. Will that make me lose credibility, especially when parents want those straight 'A's geniuses to teach their child?

And if I want to be a freelance programmer, how do I find work to do, what are the rates, and do they need me to finish my CS degree to even give me the job?

Anyone please advise me? My parents got into accident recently and my family is in turmoil, so I need some extra income for their medical bills as well. Despite government subsidy, it's still a hefty amount.

P.S. NUS should offer more part-time degrees for working people. Not everyone has the privilege and money (in terms of opportunity cost) for a full-time degree :''(

I need some genuine advice please. No one really gets how stressful uni life can be. Or how i make it out to be? I'm from life science and theres so much to memorise! And those chem modules are a killer! How do i get through this? I am already on probation and I cant get kicked out of school! Please help! Im going crazy. I need to get all Bs for my mods. Do you think I can make it?   
-
 
I'm a biz student taking a few CS mods as breadth modules. I don't understand why CS students want to be managers/consultants right out of graduation. I think CS is cool and interesting, and you are equipped with hard skills to build cool shit to solve real problems. In the long-run, sure management makes sense because you have accrued the experience/expertise. But even i as a business student don't expect to play a management role. Even in consultant/IB, you're a lowly analyst doing shit work.

I have been working in a startup with a friend during each semester break for nearly 4 years. Recently, the company is starting to make some profit. Because of the commitment, my CV is quite weak as I have ZERO internships. Although NOC looks fun, I do not have the time to commit to it as I am busy thinking of how to make the company survive.

NUS career centre often advises students to find internship. So I wonder if it is important for me to find any internships......Any opinions?
-
 
I remember that when I was back in my first year, I couldn't do half the questions for a CS module in its final exam and I expected my grade to be F or C+ or something. So I cried and had nightmares for half a month.

And then the results were released and my grade was A+!!!!!

So many years have passed and I'm still so proud of myself LOLOL

I am currently in Year1 and would like to know if i can apply for any internship for this winter break. From my limited knowledge, i undestand that companies would not be keen to accept a year1 student who does not have a good cv (aka yours truly) However, i would really like to start building my cv now and also to network+explore different industries. Anybody can shed some light regarding intership for year1? Oh, and would my CAP play a really big role? Would appreciate any form of advice/tips. Thank you in advance! :)

 If you wanna be a process engineer, do a computational FYP that involves simulation + programming (i.e. CFD based; Aspen based and etc)...You will learn much more than just doing TEs. 

On top of this, take the following TE:

1. CN4205R (You get to learn heat integration through pinch analysis, process integration and DVR. I managed to use them in the plant while I was interning)
2. CN5111 (Optimization of Chemical processes. You learn how to model and solve problems in forms of MINLP and stuff like that)
3. CN4238R (A pure modelling and simulation module)
4. CN4227R (Advance Process Control)
5. Take an applied TE based on your preference

These TEs have a big project to be submitted at the end of the day.  (Honestly, the exam is the last thing you worried about. Don't expect to last minute these projects. The problem statement are usually quite challenging and requires passion and knowledge to solve them in groups.) 

On average, you can spend up to 40 hours a week to work on one project (assuming you start once the project statement is released.) Meaning the time left to study for your core modules will be greatly decreased. However, if your engineering fundamentals (i.e. mass/energy/momentum balance) are strong, you can easily still ace these open book exams.  So since there is nothing to study, you shouldn't fear investing time into project works. 

If you can do that and learn from this technical electives, you have little to fear for design project. 

Last but not least, use your UE to take more TE. During the technical interview for my full time job, they will grill you on your FYP and the stuff you learn in school.

 You can't converge precisely because you are keying random values without an engineering basis.

I'm in my 3rd year in NUS and was so sure that I would go into honours year. I do qualify for honours, but I'm starting to question whether it's necessary. To give a bit more background info, I'm in FASS and I have no interest to work in the civil service. I'd love to hear some pros and cons to get my decision changed or reinforced.
-
 
jit pai siao liao. Every time I see posts complaining of converges and not having enough time for CNY/V-Day I freak out. Looks like Chbe's gonna get tougher. Y2 here, and even the overseas exchange places are competitive (out of a cohort of 300, 98 places available, and 198 people applied). zzz FML

Anyway, seniors, apart from the infamous S/U privileges, we are also given another chance to choose whether we want to do FYP or 3 Technical Electives. Which one will you choose and why? #ChBe

Hi guys, can i ask for some advice? :) Should I choose CS or IS in school of computing if i'm interested in mobile gaming? I saw that IS has more mobile-related modules but it isn't that focused on programming right? I feel like CS would be more useful if you want to program stuff.

Are we allowed to take level-4000 UE modules that are outside our major/faculty? Can we bid for them in the first place?

I am graduating from Chemical Engineering this semester and I just want to thank the department for the last four years.

Thank you for bell curving us like any other course. I came in with straight As, just like anyone else in the course. I ended up with a second lower because it shouldn’t matter that we were competing amongst the best, and we should be bell curved within our own competition.

Thank you for making the course so vigorous. I had to spend so much time during December for my FYP, to make sure I could even produce results, without any management of expectations of both mentor and supervisor. Luckily, so much of my other course mates were doing the same, I know that at least I am not suffering alone.

Thank you for the wonder teaching team of Professors you have. Honestly, some of them are really good. Prof. Farooq, thank you especially for your wonderful advice in all the modules I took with you, you are so memorable.  

Lastly, the biggest thank you goes to Design Project. Thank you for making this final semester most beneficial for us. I cannot image spending my time elsewhere other than making my systems converge. CNY is not as important, job seeking can take a back seat, and coming to computer labs at odd hours so that my team can find a seat is my top priority. 

Thank you ChBe. No other experiences can come close to you.

Do employers really look at your appearance when you go for job interviews? Not the clothes part, I do dress appropriately. For some interviews, I wear my contacts and for others, I wore my specs. For some reason, the interviews I went for, wearing specs, had a higher rate of getting 2nd interviews, while I heard absolutely nothing from those which I wore contacts for. I was told by many friends that I look much better with contacts, and I read somewhere that while better looking people are often more well-liked, they are often underestimated during job interviews, like just because you look good means you can't do work well. How true is this? If so, I'll put a hold on looking nicer and get a job.

I think I am like the SQ in my group. A pretty damn good airline with solid service and hard product, but others just don't like how I spoil market and fight for my interests through fifth-freedoms that others don't serve, but once I do, they say I steal market share.

But I am SQ, I am just damn good at what I do and I will stick this way.

Any aspiring pilots here who went to the Singapore Airlines or Scoot booth at the NUS career fair can share their experiences or information obtained from the respective company representatives which will aid other aspiring pilots like myself who were not able to attend the fair in our application for the cadet pilot program. Or is it possible for you to share general details about the training program? 

Thanks much.

Hey there!Me being a final year student doing FYP, I think what you ought to do is to really stick through it and at least show to your supervisor that you have tried and put in effort in it. I think it is too late to switch now. You can try to just get sufficient result for the paper and let it be done!

I am currently doing data analysis and this is supposedly a really simple and easy project to some people. I realized that I'm really not fit for this project until it's too late, but it's just an FYP..i think the professor would understand and acknowledge your hardwork at the end of the whole process. Preservere through, my friend! All you need is a little encouragement:).

In response to   
Hey there, I am the one who was depressed about my lack of programming skill in my computational FYP. I am really thankful to this kind soul who posted a very sweet and encouraging message in response of my post. It really makes my day and I will try my best to finish my FYP. No matter how tough my FYP gets, I will remind myself of your post and keep going on. Thanks so much and I really hope you get to see this message. Admin, please post it. I am really thankful to the person who encourages me and light up my hope. All the best to you too! :)

Everyone  has that one friend .

That ONE friend who :

- mugging every night like siao 

- finishing the assignment 2 days after the prof releases it 

- finishes the tutorial question and finding extra practice questions to do

- make sure that the group project title isn't too " simple " or " common " so that he can get an A+ , doesnt give a f*** about what others think

- chop the lecture hall best seats by arriving one hour early , just to wait outside the lecture hall to ensure he can get in right after the previous lecture ends

- had to go the toilet , then came back and asks at least 3 people " eh what did prof teach ah just now "

- saying " no la I also don't understand how to do leh " while furiously writing long-ass equation for the class quiz

- saying " I never study leh how ah " while handing up 10 pages of answer sheets

This ONE friend's personal quote ? 

" No lah I don't care about CGPA one "

Don't be that one friend .

Hi guys, I have been feeling depressed lately due to FYP. I have chosen a computational FYP when my programming skill is really bad. I have talked to my prof about it but he doesn't allow me to change it to an experimental FYP. I really feel so depressed and aimless now. What should I do now? I am desperate for advice! Thanks to those who reply

Examination knockin at your door
You're fed up, you wont take it no more
Your mind is sharp and your will is tough
They're coming again but you've had enough
One module screw and your entire GPA is screw

The time has come to make a stand
With all the knowledge in your brain
You are smart and you will see a good result
Never fear you're the best
Standing here for the rest
Never fear, you're the best of the best, of the best...

Adrenaline runnin through your veins
You're are coming in with sweat on your face
The game is on and the future arrives
They see the fear when they look in your eyes
Students studied hard for examination
Students gonna take the examination today
One module screw and your entire GPA is screw
Never stop studying until you score

Never fear you're the best
Standing here for the rest
Never fear, you're the best of the best, of the best...

 Stop being a loser. Those who can boast of their Dean's List, first class honours, A for FYP etc worked their fucking ass off. U might think u work hard, if not harder, but have u considered that u used the wrong strategies? Or did not find the right mentor? NUS gives plenty of opportunities for diligent and hungry young men and women, if u don't grab them, it's yr own fault.

7 semesters have passed and I'm in my final semester. For each semester, I will pray hard before entering my tutorial classroom.  I've always believed in good karma and hence I am always kind to the people around me, offering them rides to MRT or take away food for them. However, up to my last semester, I am always greatly disappointed. THERE ARE ALWAYS NO CHIO BU IN MY CLASS!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! MY FRIENDS ALWAYS HAO LIAN TO ME THAT THEIR CLASS GOT CHIO BU! WHAT ABT ME?!?!?! ZERO FOR FOUR YEARS IN MY UNI LIFE!!!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYY

Not sure if this is the right platform to ask but I'm sure someone might know an answer. I'm from CS and I've recently picked up C#, with a focus area in software engineering. I was really impressed with the possibilities of building apps using the UWP for Windows 10. Granted, it isn't the most popular platform for development (maybe even the least popular) but I was truly blown away when I saw that HoloLens demo during Microsoft's press release last October. Is it worth the time and effort to continue my efforts into developing for Windows? Or should I focus on a improving my skills for different more popular stack e.g. iOS or the web? 

I'm interested to see what are the general sentiments around the current state of Windows so comment away!

Many people have written post about the importance of looks in a relationship. Here's my two-cents worth:

Being good looking helps, it opens doors and gets people to notice you. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a saint or a liar. That being said, good looks alone will not help you build endearing relationships.

Being good looking when looking for a relationship is similar to having First-class Honours from Cambridge when applying for a job. Just as with good looks, the first class from Cambridge will definitely open doors. However, being someone who is only "book-smart" and not "street-smart" will cause you to be unsuccessful in your career despite your outstanding degree, just as being an asshole will cause you to find yourself in many failed relationships even if you are extremely good looking. 

Of course, there will be some snobbish and elitist companies out there who hire staff solely based on the quality of their degree. They don't bother to consider the skills you have, or the value you can add to the company, if you have a lousy degree. In similar vein, there are guys and girls out there who are unwillingly to be in a relationship with anyone who is not good looking.

Can we do anything about that? Probably not. Perhaps it is just something that everyone who does not have a First-class from Cambridge, or who are average (and below average) looking have to live with. 

Nonetheless, we should remember that there are many people who, despite not having First-class Honours from Cambridge and not getting a high-paying job in a snobbish and elitist company, go on to build meaningful and fulfilling careers. Being average (or below average) looking might prevent us from getting into a relationship with some people, however, it does not preclude us from building endearing relationships that make us happy.

I can't get 2nd upper so I give up scoring for 2nd upper.

I also give up chasing after my crush because she doesn't seems interested in me. She keep making excuse whenever i tried to date her.

I also a give up trying to join a clique because it have been more than a semester and i haven't found one.

I also give up anticipating for X Men Apocalypse and Captain America Civil War because it is still too far ahead.

I will bw matriculating into NUS next year and I already secured a placing for FASS, intending to major in economics. However, I am also keen on chemical and mech engineering, chemistry, business and mathematics. I am also unsure of the prospects of an econs major and if it is even good.

I really need advice on what course to go for and I don't think cliche lines like "go to whichever that suits your interest" would be helpful since I am interested in so many courses. Plus, we are living in Singapore, we nust be practical on the courses we choose too.

Sometimes I wish you can study them all.

dear , 
of course we feel insecure. we feel that since we are friends we should be similar in many things (intelligence, humor,eq etc) then all of a sudden one of my friend taken by an engine guy, we start to compare to her, are we uglier? are we too boring? or what is so special about her?
if only she not so selfish, then she can introduce her bf friends to us then we can all go on double, triple dates.

It's so sad and irritating that so many of the faculty that come into Unis these days are only focusing on their research. Unis care only about making their profile look good in terms of rankings and take in profs who are overly research oriented but terrible in terms of teaching. Profs work to fulfil research and neglect teaching. Teaching standards deteriorate. Students suffer. But rankings and fees skyrocket. Wow.

Seriously, this is getting ridiculous. The extension for the repair work in the Utown Gym is endless, from reopening on 23 Dec to 14 Feb (Recently changed again) almost 2 months differences . Come on la in total the gym will be close for 3 months, floor got so much repair to be done??

I am sure there will be some people like me. Those who are graduating in this sem, you will have to File For Graduation in CORS beginning of the sem. If you have forgotten to do so, email your respective department saying you really really forget and get it done.

It's amazing how people can be so passive for group projects that they need to be notified and informed of what's going on. I guess this is project life in uni. People with too many commitments like to outdo themselves.

Sorry but I just want to rant on the module CFG1010. We are busy enough with the current curriculum and by having a lecture for staring at raisins won't improve our lives for goodness sake. And the thing doesn't just end with staring at raisins, but it goes on by sending you email every week to remind you of videos, quizzes. I thought it was bad that they made GER compulsory, but at least it comes with 4 MCs. Now this is worse. I am doing all these for nothing.

I want to make a point on the learning attitudes of some NUS students. 

To a particular final year female undergraduate at a particular EN final year film seminar on Thursday afternoon, your learning attitude has to improve. Your classmates are sick of you interrupting the professor -- if you really want to speak up, please please please raise up your hand (at the very least). The prof might not say anything about your multiple interruptions throughout the seminar, but this is BASIC COURTESY. 

And yes, please STOP sleeping in class. Your snores were loud and distracting. People could hear you for goodness sake! And yes the prof noticed. Making up for it by being *really* enthusiastic in class for a few moments only made you come across as a hypocrite. 

You are very intelligent but your attitude sucks. Yeah perhaps the prof's teaching isn't all that effective and efficient (we all know that) but he is our teacher after all and that alone should require some form of basic respect from us, the STUDENTS. 

You have absolutely no idea how many people you had pissed off during class yesterday. 
-
 
I encountered an incident with a prof/tutor (not from my department) that made uncalled for remarks and insensitive behavior, especially coming from an educator.

Is there a portal or channel where we can feedback this. And should I do this? I'm currently a student and I know this may affect myself negatively but I strongly believe in standing up for your own rights.

Would the folks up there even take such feedback seriously or simply brush it off.

Thank you for reading and have a great day.

The general advice to Uni students who are worried about not knowing what they want to do in the future is: "Don't worry now! So many end up not doing what they majored in. Use the time to discover the world and yourself." Sometimes I wish I had the chance to do that. 

But in a faculty where 95-99% of all graduates end up doing what we're studying (at least for the first few years. We've a pretty high attrition rate), no one seems to be exploring other options or are keen to "discover themselves". Our modules are fixed for 2 years. We get max 12MCs to do non-faculty modules in year 3 and 4, that's all.

There's no such thing as S/U, every single grade counts and from day 1 it seems like it's just a race to get a training contract. I'm surrounded by really bright kids, and after a few semesters of putting in my best, my results just don't reflect my efforts at all. I keep trying to be positive, and telling myself that just because I am not doing well academically, it doesn't mean I'm not smart. Maybe my strengths lie elsewhere, or maybe I haven't learnt how to learn yet. I've just got to try harder. I'm afraid to share my results with my friends, not because they'll be any less of a friend, but I'm just slightly ashamed/embarrassed..

Now some of my peers are starting to apply for a training contract and I'm lost. I don't know how to proceed - should I get accreditation if I might never be outstanding in my job? If I don't think I'll like my job (but I don't know for sure I guess?) Should I be brave/stupid and go into something completely different? But I don't know what that something different is.

 Because Logic is used for studying of arguments and not practical stuffs. Because Philosophy of Science is not about doing Science. You are not used to Philosophy. You are used to be given theorems and methods of doing things by your engineering professors. That's why you find it boring.

 We're one of the top universities in Asia because of our research, not educational quality. The profs' professional knowledge, their genius typically come in if you ask after them, or if you're down to your FYP (really, it shows a lot at the FYP).

The professional knowledge, etc., do not make sense, until you see it in action - try creating some woodwork (I like doing that) or something by yourself, using the knowledge available to you. 

Find something to do, and think of different approaches, ways, and gadgets to create, to do that some thing.

The thing about engineering, it is how we go about doing things flexibly with the knowledge given to us, using it to our advantage, and when shit happens, to be clearer than anyone else of what is going on, and execute the appropriate remedies.

It just seems dry at the first few years (seriously man, it really made me wonder if I was being trained to be a pencil pusher), but all that theoretical, pencil-pushing bullshit, if you bother to remember it at all, are substantiations for your design. 

Trust me on this, it sucks to know that you know nothing to back up your design, to know if it will work or not, much less improve on our creation. It just does not make sense early on.

Though unfortunately, hands-on people like me do terribly at theoretical stuff, especially when all we see is paper, more paper, and even more paper...

 Btw Engin is spelt without the last "e". If you spell it as Engine, you should be around the faculty more.
-
 
I am an engineering student who is quite disappointed with the quality of teaching in the faculty, which by no measure lives up to the standards one would expect from "Asia's best university". I do agree that the lecturers and professors are leading professionals in their respective fields and that they have great knowledge and experience. But all that means little to us students, who would really prefer someone who can convey ideas clearly and effectively.

Hello, I would like to ask the differences between Computer Science in NUS and NTU.

I saw the 10th percentile igp of NUS is AAA/A while NTU is BBC/D. I understand the grades are a reflection of the demand for the course. But I would like to know what makes prospective CS students choose NUS over NTU as reflected in the igp.

Hi everyone. I’ll be matriculating into NUS Computer Science this year and I’ve been offered to take up modules during the special term which spans from May to July.  So here are my questions:
1) What are the pros and cons of taking up the modules during special term?
2) Will the dates for special term clash with orientation dates?
3) How are my grades affected if take up the modules?
Please advise. Thank you so much in advance!

Hey guys! I could really use some help - I lost my matric card somewhere in FASS (most likely CLB) on Week 2 Thursday. It's A0xxx937B, if you happen to find it could I trouble you to drop it with the kind folks at the CLB counter? They'll key it in and I'll get an email from the school system. And then your lunch at Deck is on me.
Thanks!!

Thanks admins!

This semester I did something new by taking Philosophy classes. It has been only three weeks, but I felt the effects of asking questions and thinking harder about my own positions. Coming from STEM background, none of the lecturers and tutors have provided this 'philosophical' experience. For the first time as a student, I have real open discussions with other students about important things. And the philosophy students ask genuine questions unlike Business students (e.g. SMU students) who ask questions for participation marks.

Nowadays many people like to treat everything as relativistic or subjective. But I am changing my mind now.

A small suggestion for NUSMods: what about also putting up the textbook information for the modules? This is for those of us who wish to study the modules ourselves.

 I am in a similar situation or even worse because I am planning to study Philosophy.

My parents actually encourage me to study it. My mum works in a local Bank. My dad works in software industry. From their observations about the new grads in their offices, there are alot of technical experts but not many thinkers. 

Every week in our family gathering, we discuss all sort of ideas from humanities and science. So you can see how ideas are emphasized.

Hi admin please post this up ):

I'm looking for someone whose matriculation number starts with A0115xxx. It's a long shot, i know, but there's about 1000 people to narrow down from so it can't be that bad.

Dear A0115,
You know me but you don't know me. You replied to some of my journal entries on a website which shall not be named. Would love to connect with you, in a non-stalkerish manner.

To whoever said you can't juggle studies, job and cca. You are not alone. Teaching tuition is hard. You need to know the syllabus. Plan the lesson. Review assessment books. Get stressed when students exams approach. Many people do it for the sake of money without even considering how the students progress. Cca wise, I'm also only a member, and let me tell you, from what I see, exco isn't really hard work. They book the venue. They inform the members. They plan gatherings. Some of them don't even come for cca. I suggest you focus on studies first and do some school related activities like urop or volunteering to beef up your holistic side. During the sem break, find a job that pays well and adds credit. Don't do for the sake of money. Do for the sake of your future.

Not a nus student but just gotta rant. I scored well enough for o levels to enter one of the top jc in sg (either hcjc or rjc. Not gg say which.) But during my A levels years, life kicked me in the guts and I faced many problems ranging frm parents divorce, best friend dying etc. It affected my A levels badly and now I cant enter uni. I orded alr and these past three years has been filled with rejection letters frm all 3 unis. As I read some childish confessions such as studies too tough, dun like grp members, bad professors, I can't help but feel angry n jealous. I mean guys pls, be more mature and appreciate ur places in uni, dont just complain. Yall have no idea wad others like me would do just to have a shot in getting into uni

I'm a guy who will be matriculating this year. I will be joining the Faculty of Science and aim to teach in the near future. With the recent news of MOE reaching its quota for teachers, I began to worry about the teaching path. 
I am considering to teach Math and here comes the problem: 
Applied Math and Stats 
1) Which one will be more relevant if i wanna teach sec sch/jc level
2) In the event that I do not enter the teaching industry, which one will have more job opportunities?

Really appreciate your comments :) Thanks a bunch! 
-
 
 I don't understand why MOE is not offering Philosophy as a O'lvl humanities subject. I am sorry to say but most English teachers cannot teach thinking skills well because they don't understand the nature of thinking. 

The current closest subject is knowledge and inquiry which focuses on Epistemology.

I'm the confessor of  and . I think what I want to specialise in biomed is probably dealing with medicine devices(like inventing new devices to aid the medical industry) and dabbing into life sciences as well? Like eg, inventing a cardiac medical device which probably involves life sciences as well? I think I need a good amount of depth in biomed knowledge, however I need engineering knowledge too. In the future, I hope to be involved in the biotech industry and inventing biomedical products to help the medical field.In this case, is it still life sciences or engineering(materials science/biomed engineering)?

I'm already considering doing masters as well, but what am I furthering in in YLL if I do go there?Thanks seniors! :)

Hello everyone. I am in a great dilemma right now and I would be so grateful if you guys could provide me with some input. 
Basically, my sibling and I have long wanted to pursue our own postgraduate degrees overseas (as they are unavailable in Singapore). However, our family's finances can only provide for one of us to study abroad. Unfortunately, no scholarships (except for the really prestigious ones like the President's scholarship) are available. 
It has been such a dear dream of mine since I was young to take up the course. However, my sibling is much more academically able than me and I am sure that my sibling would do much better overseas. I was thinking if I should give up on this dream and have my parents send my sibling instead...

I am not a martial arts expert, and I don't follow MMA or other competitions. I did a bit of TKD and Karate before university, and have zero exposure to Wushu. Hopefully, there is someone who can share more on it.

I think you are not wrong to say that Chinese martial arts can be substituted by other fighting arts, but the same can be said for the other arts and different styles within the same arts. Karate vs. TKD, are they really that unique? However, just because they are "substitutable", it does not make one form irrelevant, as different arts and styles will have different emphasis, and different variations in technique and training. 

Both of my instructors (TKD and Karate) did some form of Chinese martial arts. My dad is more into martial arts than me, and apparently, there are quite a no. of practitioners of 南北少林 kungfu in the past. If you are into martial arts, I think it will be good to get some exposure, and see what you can learn from that, and use it to complement your own training. Understand that currently some forms of martial arts are more popular, especially due to the influence of MMA competition. However, I really don't believe that there is one Art that makes an individual more superior than the others. Just don't be like my reservist mate, who does krav maga training and thinks he is the man. -Shakes head-

On usefulness of the Chinese martial arts in practical fighting. Haha unless you are looking into turning professional or starting up a new gang in Singapore, I think training up your body, and practise basic punches, kicks, and grappling techniques is good enough for self defense.

Not a Nus student but there is a greater targeted audience here and Im in need for advice. 

I'm a nursing student who is very close to graduration (may 2016) and I'm now doing my attachment at a hospital. There have being things and experiences that I have encountered which makes me doubt my ability as a nurse. I'm not sure if nursing is the right path for me. Half of the time, I have no bloody idea what I am doing an am afraid that something bad will happen. I also happen to have an anxiety issue and currently undergoing medical treatment. However because of the demand of my job and the side effect of the medications, I have stop taking them because I dun wan to rely to much on the medication and thought that maybe it would be better if I find other ways of coping. I freak out very easily though and have very bad tremors. Whenever I have to do a procedure be it a simple one like serving medication or having to assist a doctor in a procedure my hands will get sweaty and clamy and it will start shaking. In short, I'm terrible in fine motor skills. Sometimes I get so bad that I can barely draw out medication because my hands are shaking so badly or I can't remove caps from newly open needle/cannula because of my sweaty palms. Due to my nervousness and anxiety I tend to lose a lot of confidence  in myself and am slow in doing procedure. 

I'm a few more weeks shy of finishing my attachment. For the past few week I having been thinking if nursing is the route for me or if I should find another job after I gradurate. However with my shitty o level results, it would be hard for me to find a job let alone take up another course. Getting a private diploma/degree isn't an option since my parents will disapprove of it and I can't afford to pay for it. 

I have talk to my lecturers and some suggested working in clinics since it has a less hectic environment and slower pace as compared to hospital. However I am afraid that if I were to decide to go back to the ward once I feel more confident, I will have a hard time adapting to the ward pace and may even forget some of my bedside nursing skills. I will not be able to learn/ do much in clinics too as the skills are pretty much standardize. 

One of the reason why I choose nursing is because I wan to help others. I was a rebellious kid when I was younger and once I withness a teacher attending to a injured victim and the person was bleeding everywhere. There incident was what inspired me to want to do nursing and make a difference especially to adolescence. 

I'm a few weeks away from my holidays before I gradurate and I was planning to go on a oversea medical mission trip alone to help out and gain experience. It will be my first solo trip but I'm afraid that I will be more of a rinderance than help. Especially with my anxiety, I get afraid that I will do the wrong things and having to mingle with people. I really want to get out of my comfort zone yet there are all the fear that I won't fit in or that Something bad will happen during the trip. I am not a very street smart person and have been very protected since young. 

To those people who deal with saving life how do you get the confidence of knowing what to do and move on from traumatizing experience especially in stressful situation. Even though the drive to wan to help treat people is there, I dun have the confidence to do it.

I just had to drop a module (which is perhaps not very well known) because its tutorial clashed with another lecture of mine. 
I requested the department admin to help waive the timetable so that I could register for the tutorial. But I was denied this request since there was no webcast. 
There has been webcast for this module for previous years. And some people anyhow don't show up to class of their own volition. So I don't really understand this rule.
I am disappointed in the system and feel that students who don't follow the beaten path are not supported. :(

I'm the confessor of . What I meant by bio-based was more of the biomedical stuff, meaning "stuff like cardiology", as suggested in a comment, and human health and diseases etc. If I'm more interested in the biomedical area, which course shall I look at instead of life sciences? And, the concurrent degree is the Concurrent Degree Programme (CDP) in
NUS B.Sc. (Hons.) in Life Sciences and KCL M.Res. in Molecular Biophysics as mentioned on the NUS website. It does involve studying for a few semesters overseas. Which is more budget friendly: exchange, or concurrent degree (without the expense of the overseas experience)? Thanks seniors! :)

Hello seniors! I'm a prospective NUS student hoping to become a biotech engineer/be involved in the biotech industry and inventing biomedical products to help the medical field. Which faculty and course should I be looking at?

If yes, which course should I look at now? Thanks seniors!

I am prospective NUS student hoping to study life sciences. Is biomed specialisation more bio-based than molecular and cell biology specialisation? I'm choosing between both, or considering a concurrent degree, hoping to go overseas. But will a concurrent degree be incredibly expensive? If yes, will an overseas exchange be better? I'm interested in trying to study abroad for a short time period, due to limited finances. I have no idea what I really want to do in the future and both options seems really attractive. I seek your opinions my seniors, thanks!

Am I the only one irk by the comment made by Ben Leong when he said CS is more painful than most of the other Engineering disciplines? With all due respect, I don't think he should make such a sweeping statement. I would be more convinced by a double degree student from CS and Engineering.

For CS5228 final, we happen to know about some exam questions a few hours before the actual paper. Scored well for the paper with the tip but I feel bad that one person in my group project. He did the most work but got an average grade as he was not told about the tips.
I felt worst when I just realized he does not even know that the entire same course material can be found online and taught with a better presentation.

Recently, my NUSNET Password expired unknowingly (without any notice of the 180-day period).

TLDR: The changing password process is too complicated for its own good. There is a need to review the process and even the company/staff managing NUSNET.

As such, I was forced to reset my password for security purposes. However, there are several problems which make this process exceptionally onerous and I would dare say unnecessarily difficult. Here are the reasons:

(1) The mobile system sends you a text that is complicated; "append the last four digits with a (series of complicated numbers and alphabets) for a temporary password. 

(2) The change a "new password" is pegged to this "temporary password". As such, compounding on the complex process in (1), it is extremely difficult to pinpoint specifically the exact mistake (whether is there a problem with the temporary password or the new password). The browser simply brings you to a page where it states: "error changing password without telling you what is wrong".

(3) The step-by-step guide to change your password actually requires you TO LOG IN WITH YOUR NUSNET ID. How did someone even come up with this logic? I've obviously lost my password and you need me to log in to my account before I can view the guide to changing my password?

(4) The "password complexity test" is a good initiative. But the link to the page doesn't even work. How am I supposed to know if my "new password qualifies or not". This is further complicated by the ambiguous process which refuses to tell us what the fault is. 

(5) I need my password now to log in. Yet, there's no one at the hotline. This is probably my "least reasonable pointer" - for a 24 hour request. 

Surely "one of the best universities in the world" can afford to improve the basic process (1) to (4) of changing its passwords right?

Hi admin please do not filter this.

I am interested in cs and is currently doing abit of self study while waiting for enlistment. Not feeling too optimistic for my grades and I am afraid that it might not be sufficient to meet the requirements for nus cs. 

Should my results be inadequate, is computer engineering in nus, cs courses in sim, sit, rtis in digipen be a better option? If so, what are the pros and cons among the courses for these institutes. Don't really want to enter a course that I have no interest in. 

Please help me make an informed decision!

So this is just a year 1 student writing about something she observed in her school. 
After coming back from holidays I heard from many of my uni friends that quite a few of my batchmates are "dropping out", to put it in a nice way. Among the many reasons are, mainly, loss of passion for the course and loss of confidence in themselves. And , I'm so sorry, but I just cannot resist the urges of calling them losers. 

If you drop out for the first reason, then the only plausible implication is that you do not even have real passion for the course to start with. So don't go all fancy and say, "oh, I chose to follow my heart instead and corrected a mistake just in time", because admit it, most of us are just ordinary people who are not particularly passionate about anything and only trying to make the best out of life. Those who have real passion for what they do do not simply drop out in the face of trivial obstacles (this is only first sem). 

If you drop out for the second reason, you are just pointlessly demeaning yourself or you are simply hypersensitive and cannot take failures. The fact that you got into the school (with not only requirements for a level grades but also interviews and written tests) shows that the school staff had faith in your ability for the course. It is hardly possible that they know less than you about what makes a good practitioner in the field. Life is always difficult and that simply does not change with a swap in schools. 

Anyway, all that was just my personal (perhaps overly so) opinion. It's ultimately your own life and it's up to you how you want to deal with it. But I think sooner or later one will come to learn how to be responsible for your own life choices. 
All the best everyone!

There might be reports on the internet that tall people get the best in the career.. but I would say this is not true... from a personal experience from this 1.93m tall guy here.

When I was still an undergrad in NUS, I was in this small clique of people, mostly were tall with the exception of one guy... who was rather short. Like the rest of the ppl, I made fun of him, called him gahteh... but he always replied with this "thank you" look, somehow not bothered.

Fast forward years later, we both graduated with Honours degree and coincidentally entered the same industry.

He was hardworking but the amount of effort I put in is no less than his. However, one thing I didnt fully comprehend was that  boss favoured him over me. Over time, he had a number of promotions and eventually, his position in the company was much higher than mine, till the point that he became my superior...

Sian... now I have to look at his 脸色 and become his 公报私仇tool... Sometimes, when I screw things up... I dare not even look at his face...when he "K" us for bad performance. I felt as though he was the giant.

Bottomline: A guy may be short but never ostracize him and think that he may not succeed in life. You might get facefalmed like me. Indeed, "Success is the best form of revenge".

Time to get back to work... before he fires me.phew...

Question: According to the module workload, we should spend 50 hours per week on school work (assuming you are taking 5 modules). Why do people study during the weekends since it will exceed the recommended working hours?

I need some advice!!!

Im in year 1 Mech Eng. Currently i face quite big problems in my timetable scheduling. 
I am supposed to take ES2331 and GET1021 this sem, but the department allocated a timeslot for me which is different from my assigned timetable, which in turns clashes with my EG1108 tutorial and lab. 

I tried appealing through CORS to change my ES2331 and GET1021 to another group, but i was rejected 3-4 times just because there were no more vacancies left. 
In the end, i was allocated another time slot for my EG1108 tutorial and lab. End up, I got no where else to put my ME2103 tutorial as its internal grouping. (ME2103 tutorial slots are not through CORS, but we choose our own grouping through IVLE).

Any seniors can advice me on what to do?
CELC persistently not helping, and just saying "no vacancies left, please attend the original class".

Bill likes a girl he knows in school.

Bill is not desperate.

Bill decides to just study and see how things go.

Bill is sensible.

What is the point of lowering the honours requirement actually? So those with "3rd class" CAPs can pursue honours and under a different title this time? However won't employers look up the new honours classification and its respective CAP ranges? I have often heard that 3rd class honours is even worse than pass with merit as it just looks bad on you. Even 2nd-lower is debatable. Moreover even with honours and judging from the graduate employment survey, there exists at least 10% of graduates who are unable to find full-time employment and I'm guessing they are probably those with 3rd class or 2nd-lower. I know this is a sensitive thing but I just really want to know why more people want to pursue honours now if its not really helpful. I don't want to waste tuition fees!

Hi, this isn't a confession. I'm a singaporean currently studying overseas; just wanted to know if NUS SoC offers any summer courses, and if so, what courses. Checked their website but couldn't get much information. Thanks!

 Honors sound nicer than 3rd class degree. But not everyone study honors for credential. Some of the students really want to learn more. Why deny them?

Hey everyone! Hope I can get some advice here :)

I'm preparing for grad school applications (early, I know, but it doesn't hurt to start planning). Basically every school I'm looking to apply to requires a minimum of two references, and obviously I'd want a reference from someone who knows me and my working style well (and preferably has a favourable opinion of me).

I really like a particular class I'm taking and I daresay that I am on very good terms with the lecturer. However, the lecturer isn't a professor or even a PhD holder, but rather a person who has a great deal of experience in the industry. I would really like to get a reference from this lecturer, but will grad schools raise eyebrows/not lend as much weight to my lecturer's reference since my lecturer isn't exactly a heavyweight in academia? Hoping that someone who may have been in my position before can offer some insight!

Thanks in advance! :-)

Option 2: uhhh. hire someone to pretend.
Option 3: cook up some genius excuse.

Now so, anyone willing to help me with any of those options? :P

I realise that someone whom I have an awkward relationship with is taking the same module as me and there are very little tutorial slots to choose from that module.

Someone, who is graduating soon, asked how's working life like. Below is some ramblings of what I see and feel (which you may see soon too). 

1. It can be repetitive. But the repetition does not necessarily equate boredom, as there may be different issues or problems at hand. The repetition comes from applying similar skills, kick starting the entire process, and doing a bunch of administrative stuff. 

2. It can be really repetitive in which you just do the same stuff again, you do not feel challenged, you do not feel like you are learning anything tangible, or you do not feel like you are value-adding. "Do what you love". "Dream big". However, sometimes work is just work, and you may need to derive satisfaction from other things in life. Build relationships, cultivate new hobbies. 

3. Sometimes you realize life is really more than work regardless of how much of a workaholic and career oriented person you are. Keep yourself healthy, maintain good relationship with your family and friends. I believe in working hard, but some work life balance is still important.  

4. It can be interesting. However, it depends on what is your motivation. Nurturing environment, good bosses, good social life, good pay, feeling useful, challenging nature of the job, and etc. I have seen people who have left "slave driving" industries and come back because they miss the intensity and hate doing too little in a 8-5 jobs.

5. It can be a dream come true for some. Some people have ideal jobs or specific goals which they want to achieve, and they do manage to strive for it and achieve it. 

6. Sometimes ideal is not ideal. "I'm in the ideal industry, but I work like a dog, and I do grunt work like making 999x ppt slides, sending 999x emails, formatting 999x word files and ppt".

7. A lot of people do not know what they want. Usually I recommend people to go try out, talk to people, go to interviews to find out more if they are unsure of what they want. Applying jobs, talking to people, going for interviews do not equate to committing your future, plus there is no guarantee you will get what you apply.

8. Retrenchment. Job hopping. Stay old and rot. Office politics. Carrying balls. Nasty bosses. Silly clients. Incompetent juniors. They are real. The good things are real too. Great office buddies, good bosses and etc. 

9. Sometimes work is more than work. You might be in a technical role, but you end up being a part-time salesman, a secretary, a deliveryman, a typist, a clown while doing your full time job. Deal with it. 

10. It is the best time to fall and learn. Start from scratch if you need to. Be honest about your inadequacies, and learn from your mistakes. Build up your skill sets, your reputation, and your network. If you are not, please be genuinely friendly, polite and helpful to anyone, including pantry aunties you come across (My client's secretary saved my ass when I got accidentally locked out of their office at late night. And let's build a friendlier society). Brush up your soft skills (you are more of a klutz than you think you are). Re-assess periodically, and see if you are going where you want, how to go, or there should be a change in plans and expectations. 

Best Regards,
BSG

How I wrote an app with no experience...Part 1

So I am from fourth year, lets say one of the science streams. I always want to make a big dent in the world and I think the lectures as well as the professors do not have the big vision to do great stuff like Stanford and Silicon Valley.
I always wanted to make a social media where things would automatically go and spread to everyone around me, even without knowing them. Right now even if I say something smart, it is always dependent on my sucky friends to actually share it and it hardly reaches anyone.
So I started looking around how to make an Android app. So I thought after all I am a scientist, how hard can this be. I started looking around online courses to write this app. Downloaded android studio. Had taken a Java module in my first year so was familiar with the syntax.
So it turns out it is not even close to how easy I thought.
Java and XML are used to make the app work on your phone. But the app needs to get and store the data somewhere else. I have heard of Amazon cloud, but I kept shopping around for easier solutions. Then I landed upon Google App engine. With Google App Engine, you could make APIs which join basically your app to the database in the background and read and write data into it.
Ok so I basically had the tools lined up. Now came the even important part, what would the features be, what would the app look like and what would even people post in it.
Since I do not want to make this post too long. I will continue in the next part about making the app over weekends and how it was breaking and fixing it. Let me know if you want to know more and follow the hashtag.  #buildingurbn

I really need genuine help here!! Hope admin doesn't filter this post!! 
I am currently a year 2 and for this upcoming summer holidays, I really want to do a research attachment program. However, all of the research attachment program, especially those that are related to my major, require 1-2 recommendation letters from your professors. However, I am only year 2 and have yet to really know my profs yet cause I just started taking my core modules last semester. Is it ok to contact your professor for a letter of recommendation even if you don't really know him/her? Really hope someone could answer this!! :(

 Believe that you are a exchange student, since you are comparing NUS to your university? Welcome to Singapore.

I had spent an semester with an UK university in Year 2 Sem 1, and I found the curriculum lacking and less robust. The content and materials covered in advanced modules were manageable even though I was still a "freshie", I overloaded, I skipped more than half the lessons, and I was covering both the pre-requisite (basic) module and advanced modules together. So if your home university curriculum was not intensive enough, you might have trouble coping. 

Just one thing to nitpick about it, people who rely on their high academic ram or rote learning, could have great passion and understanding about their subjects too. Not too sure how you will describe your own studying approach, and how you come to the conclusion that your method is the more "passionate" approach. In addition, complexity of quizzes should not be an issue if you are able to explain and apply in details. So get off your passionate high horse.  

If you don't possess either (High ram or conscientious effort), and find the curriculum too packed, then it is likely that you are a slow learner, a poor planner, or not studying smart enough. Try changing your studying method, or it is time to switch up your gears.

I didn't do rote learning/tutorials/practice questions, and only run through school materials once. Not a fun of being a cow. However, I always try to understand what I am reading thoroughly, and the high academic ram did the remaining work. Some of the concepts would still be retained and I could apply them when I was studying for advanced modules or doing my work. Different people would have a different best approach, and a different optimal mix of study/life balance. Good luck finding yours.

Best Regards,
Biz School Graduate

Would the admin for nusmods update the tutorial and lecture timings? The info on nusmods is not in sync with CORS.

Ahhh, I'm close to graduation, and I'm quite scared to enter the working world. What is working life like? Is it like repetitive, and you get to do similar work everyday, mundane or otherwise? T_T

In recent stock market crash, I lost some of the money borrowed from DBS for my school fees. Should I cut loss now or wait for the bull market?
-
 
Am I just a slow learner or a terrible planner? Or perhaps is the curriculum in NUS cramming too much content into our brains within a short period compared to my university? This appears to be advantageous for the students with a high academic RAM; they can retain a sizable amount of information within a short period of time till the exams, then delete it after that to learn new concepts for the next semester, then delete it again and so on. And also the complexity of questions asked during the exams and quizzes, given with its relatively unrealistic time constraint, may actually benefit the cognitive misers who rely on "mental shortcuts" through rote learning, rather than a student who deeply loves, understands the subject and who will be able explain and apply it in detail. Everything seems to be done in haste. Although the university is nothing short of world-class standard, the quantity of its workload per semester is compromising its quality. Yikes!

Anyone dropped out of chemical engineering? Most of the stuff i am learning goes over my head, and I don't seem to have the interest in continuing this major. But I have no idea what else I can take up as a degree as well.  I am only in my first year, but I am beginning to feel afraid of all this uncertainty. Has anyone transferred out of chem engin, and if you have what major did you pick? Also, any Chem engin graduates out there to share your views on the working world?

Can any senior advise on the difficulty in doing a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics? Is the workload manageable especially when I am planning to enrol in USP?  How was your experience doing it and what is your motivation behind this choice? 

Also, how strong does one need to be mathematically to do well in a math major? I ask this because while I believe myself to have slightly above average intelligence and willing to work hard, I certainly lack any "talent" in Mathematics.

As for my rationale, I think having a strong Mathematical background will help in doing Computer Science and I think Math is a cool and mindblowing subject. :)

If school fees in Germany are close to negligible, why do we still have to pay NUS' school fees when we to Germany for SEP?

Currently a year one chemical engineering freshie, coming from a not so prestigious junior college, and was not really outstanding in JC. Before entering the course, I often heard seniors commenting on how competitive the course is, and that even the top students would struggle. However, for my first semester, I still manage to attain a CAP 5.0 without the use of any S/U in addition to 2A+ grades despite not really working hard throughout the semester. I was truly shocked when I viewed my grades on results day. I has been wondering why is that so ever since. Is it because Chbe is not as prestigious a course as it used to be? Is it due to the department awarding more A grades these days? Is it because females like me has an advantage because we do not have to serve NS and that there are a high proportion of guys in the course? Is it the department making it easy to get A during the first year and it will be much harder to score in subsequent years? Or is it simply that there is the marking of my exam scripts?

I feel like face-palming myself when people use NUSwhispers to ask for help on administrative stuff related to school (CORS, SEP, modules, degree related queries).

Although there is a very nice professor here answering students' queries, the correct and fastest channel to ask for help is the school. Drop the relevant department an email/call to get your queries answered and things settled. Bug them and beg them to get your way through. If the department you contacted is not the correct one, I bet they are more than willing to direct you to the correct one. 

I had troubled the school for mapping of modules (CORS and SEP), audit of modules, clash of timetable, internship application and degree requirement and every other random stuff, and our non teaching and teaching staff are always more than helpful.

I think it is unethical that Carousell spams NUS students and mailing lists with impunity. Even if you're an alumnus and wish to promote your project.
-
 
How does manual tutorial registration work? Do you go to the department office or the prof's office? Do they usually increase the quota if all non-clashing slots are already fully filled? It's for a core mod (which is a prerequisite of other core mods) so I hope I don't have to drop it and delay my graduation :/

TRUE STORY  BUY 4D

please don't filter because i really need help.
i'm a Y2S2 senior who don't have enough points at all to bid for a core module, and this module is a prerequisite for two modules that i'll be taking in year 3 sem 1. I tried to appeal but they said "please bid for the module" but the truth is i don't even have half of the points of the min. bid for that module. can someone give me an idea of what i should do?
-
 
 Hearing your story, I recommend you to read a book called "Fooled by Randomness". Most of the successes in life is ruled by randomness. For e.g. we study the life of two graduates. One has a FCH. The other has Pass degree. The FCH found a job in a bank in 2003. The Pass degree guy decided to trade options on his own because he did not has the qualification. Then 5 years later, the FCH guy found himself retrenched after the Financial Crisis. The Pass degree guy made some decent gains in the 2008 crisis even though he had been losing money before 2008. 

Moral of the story: Smartness is not sufficient. Sometimes you need balls to hold your position when everyone is saying you are wrong.

Hi my friend was talking about auditing a module, but i'm not very sure what it means. Does it mean that we just go for lessons? I know there's no exam, so will the module be reflected in our transcript? I heard we just need to approach the lecturer, any other admin matters involved? Thanks in advance! Please dont filter btw, thanks admins!

How do we achieve work life balance? I've always envied people who can go out in weekends to cafes and sightseeing. I really want to enjoy myself while studying. Yet being in engineering, the workload doesn't allow many to do so.

My post got filtered.. :( please post this

I just want to ask whether seniors and freshies will be graded on same bell curve since module codes are different for us.. anyone knows? 
-
 
Hey  / , OP for  here. I'm fine taking the exams, and the thing is I actually do well for them. But that's why it's also frustrating, because everyone discounts the actual anxiety by saying "wtf man, why are you complaining? you did well". I was on prozac a while back, and i think atarax for sleeping issues. Currently i'm off meds. But I certainly agree that anxiety related issues probably plague a good number of students, and there is a stigma of sorts attached to it.

I really hope this doesn't get filtered please! I am entering Y2S2 today and I realise that this course isn't for me. Not only do I want to change major but I want to change faculty. Does anyone think this is too late? To be starting again when you're supposed to be in Y3!! Plus how to some people only manage to stay on an extra year when they change major? Don't they have to pass all the core modules of that specific major? Does this mean they take up more than 5 modules plus special term? omg.. I really want this transfer though as it affects my career path. Any advice?( MUCH APPRECIATED!!)  Kinda upset that I am delaying my entrance into the workforce too...(I'm a girl btw if it matters)

 and  

I'm also another one of those kids with social anxiety. I'm in a faculty that requires you to be confident, and strong, so I usually fake it until I make it. I have like weird stomach cramps/aches everytime i'm required to go anywhere, I entered into the faculty with a doctor's report saying I should be fine to study. I will freak out during exams, blank for like a good 5-10 minutes, and my heartrate just goes up, up, up. I still hold my ground in my studies though. I'm currently doing mindfulness practices to help cope, but I am considering seeing the NUHC soon to get some meds to cope perhaps? But my school timetable is so tight I don't even have time to eat properly... let alone see a doctor and get a bunch of referrals. :( Stay strong yea? you are not alone!

What is the point of coming to university if you cannot take the module that you like to study? Might as well study using Coursera instead......
-
 
 Hey there. I'm a year 2 who has the same problem as you. A fairly major panic attack occurred to me in Year 1 Sem 2 (during a tutorial) and for that semester, after speaking to various people at UHC and my faculty's Dean Office, I was given tutorial exemption for the whole semester. Most lecturers that semester were very nice, they offered personal consults and conducted alternative assessments for me. For example, if there was 10% class part, I would present it privately, instead of to the class.

A possible option is for you to try this. However, this is only a temporary solution, as the people I'm spoken to told me. They were concerned that "by running away" I would learn to avoid them. There is hence the need to show that you are working on these problems, by visiting a counsellor and maybe the psychiatrist. I do believe that "temporarily running away" benefits me, in terms of my grades. I'm not a A person, but even without going for tutorials I managed a string of Bs, so it was at least decent. 

Do note that such things can be quite hard, I cannot guarantee that you can get it, even you did, it can be a long wait for it to happen cause it's not something 'legal'. But I'm grateful that they accepted it and allowed me to handle my issues. I'm much better now. 
-
 
That WTFKNN feeling when the number of vacancies in the GEM module which you're planning to take can be counted by just one hand; yet the same module in a different code has three-digit vacancies. Eh CORS admin, share a bit leh.
-
 
Can some profs be more efficient next time and release the tutorial slots earlier?!?! I have a core module which I know has tutorials, but there were no slots posted. So I just went ahead and planned my timetable. Now the tutorial slots are released. AFTER the bidding is over. And of course, the pathetic few slots clash with my timetable. Now, I'm forced to drop my elective and find some other module to bid in round 3A, when the bidding points are likely to be higher. So frustrated now.
-
 
It's my first time appealing for a module this semester because I was outbidded and failed to get the module that I wanted. So is it advisable that I appeal now? Or try my luck in round 3 first and then appeal later if I still can't get it? I'm not confident that I can get it in round 3 either since round 3 is famous for having extremely high bidding points
-
 
How many people here cannot bid for enough mods this sem? kee chiu please. Thanks! Me so sad now.
-
 
Got allocated a level 3000 language mod and I thought that there would be less competition for this mod as compared to the level 1000/2000 mod

I guess I was wrong since more seniors would be taking a higher level mod and they have more bidding points

Are we allowed to take GE modules that are offered under our own major? Understand there used to be some restriction which would be specified under the preclusions eg. UTU not allowed for physics majors, and I wonder if this still holds under the new system.

Hi! First time poster, please be kind :) Anyone thinking of taking flexi time jobs and living in JB? Between severe demands of high-octane jobs and ever climbing living costs, I see this as a way to enjoy a vastly higher standard of living while having the time to enjoy it too. House and car within 2 years of graduation, anyone?
-
 
To those who are lamenting about the bidding system and about not getting your modules. advice from a fresh graduate : take a chill pill. If u are unable to take this module this time, just wait till next sem or find a replacement module. It's not the end of the world. Yea the system is not perfect but I went through my four years and managed to secure most of my modules that I wanted/needed to take. Things will work itself out in the end, not this sem but the next or even a year after. 

Seriously in the larger scheme of things this isn't all that important anyway.

So now look at the pathetic number of GEM/GEK available for seniors in round 2B, while all the GEMs available for freshies with numerous vacancies. So, as a Year 3 I hope to clear my last GEM requirement before moving to honours year. What to do now when NUS system suddenly turns against us? 

PS// I think Lee Kuan Yew's grandson or some white horse just enrolled into NUS as a freshie. This kind of shitty planning, the mere idea of allocating more slots to freshies, I'm surprised NUS would let it be implemented. Top university in Asia indeed, perhaps the ranking graders' kids are freshies this year.
-
 
Since and MOE recently just announced that they have been considering charging teaching staff in national schools and junior colleges parking fees if they drive to school since the start of last year, I bet many in NUS who have friends, seniors, former teachers, or even family members who teach and drive to work asking themselves now "am I part of the 70% that voted for this?" 
-
 
This CORS system is making everyone in the school divided. For the seniors, please don't put the blame on the freshies, the system was decided by the school. I'm equally frustrated because I'm a Y2 student, I am in the cohort that suffers the most in this system, but it's not right to blame the freshies for this unfair new system that the school has created.

I have read through the whispers and realised that some people have written/called to complain to the faculty dean or the CORS helpdesk. I know that CORS helpdesk is ran by students, so no point complaining to them. I'm not sure about emailing the faculty dean though, but I don't think the dean cares. Anyone tried giving feedback to NUSSU?

I doubt the school will make changes because the freshies are finishing their first year in this new system, but I really hope the school can AT LEAST do something about the quota allocation BY THE NEXT SEM LATEST.
-
 
one of my faculty module is very popular so it's fully filled in round 1a. it appears again in round 2b but is only meant for g-account users. so i can only bid for that module in round 3. what nonsense.
-
 
I remember walking into the FASS talk during the NUS Open Day years ago. The lecturer talked about the interesting modules that FASS has to offer, such as the language modules. I ain't a FASS student but I have always wanted to learn some languages.

Well, looking at the situation now, my savings of the G points are almost finished before I even start bidding for the language. Thank you new system.
-
 
Hi, does anyone knows for sure whether the unused quota under the new GEM module codes be released to the seniors in the coming Round 3? I was intending to do 2 GEMs this sem but seems like it is super impossible now...
-
 
Nobody "up there" will admit it, but we all know that every year, NUS admits far more undergraduate students than it has resources to provide quality education to.

As a result, it feels like graduates are "mass produced". Some core modules are taught at a 1:600+ lecturer to student ratio because the department has no choice. This is just one of many examples where instructors are overstretched and the quality of the student experience compromised. In essence, demand far outstrips supply.

And now it seems like CORS is just a brilliant means of shifting the blame from the university administration to the student. Didn't get your modules? Too bad, it's your fault because you squandered all your points last semester! Nothing to do with us letting too many of you in. ;)

May the odds ever be in your favour!

Think that you are safe because you have a Computer Science degree? I just met some software developers from India and China in an international event. They told me that there are tons of CS majors graduating from their universities and the number is increasing. If you are pure CS, it is very difficult to differentiate yourself.

As a Year 2, I feel the most disadvantaged by the new general education module system. The university allocates so little slots for the seniors, and we are the most "junior" out of all the seniors, so we have the least points to spare. Meanwhile, there are extra slots for the Year 1 students and they only need to pay 1 point. And to my fellow mates who are suffering too, don't forget that we are competing with the Year 1 students for other modules too, such as the Unrestricted Electives. They will end up having more G account points than us, especially the poor Year 2 students who have it the worst. I feel that it is so unfair, I saved up my points to take a module I like, but the inflated bidding points cause me to lose the module. I could have gotten it based on past statistics. Plus, now I probably have less G account points as compared to the Year 1 students. How irritating.

To the Year 1 freshies, we don't blame you, it is not your fault. We blame the university. But I hope you can be thankful for all your 1-point gems due to the new system, which also give you extra points to bid for your other modules.

There must be quite a number of rich af, white horse freshies this year to have enough power to make nus change its system to allocate so much slots for year 1. We should just start getting those in freshman 2015 shirts as friends instead of fighting over limited, very limited slots. Lose the mods, gain power allies in the outside world instead.

I am a final year student working on the FYP but I am actually more interested in studying about the correlation between residual faecal material and sheets of toilet paper used. In general, we do see that both factors are negatively correlated, in that the more sheets of toilet paper you use, the less faecal material gets left behind in your anus. However, it has always been intriguing to me that the relationship between the two resembles that of an exponential decay(sheets of toilet paper used on the x axis, amount of residual faecal material on the y axis) , in that in most situations, an infinite amount of toilet paper is needed to completely clean your bottom. Then through the process, you would feel that it would be such a waste of toilet paper and you leave the residual waste at a certain threshold level. In certain cases, you may even end up getting an uncomfortable abrasion between the legs. So the question: Is there a new material we can use in the production of toilet paper to increase the waste absorption rate, or maybe even come up with a novel method to handle the complete removal of waste down under?
-
 
I totally agree with all those complaining about the current bidding system. It is totally unfair for them to allocate more slots to the freshies. Take for example, GEK1900, only 140 slots in total for the seniors while 230 slots for the freshies? I had to fork out 1000 points, while some of the freshies get the module for just 1 point.
-
 
I have a question. Why are different faculties given different amount of general account points? As a freshie, where there is only competition among fellow freshies in GE mods, I was outbidded even when I dumped in all my points into this GE, and I didnt even spend more than 5 points since I enrolled :(
-
 
To everyone butthurt about GE modules:

isn't everyone in your cohort basically in the same boat? If every y2+ student now has to fork out 700+ or 1000+ points for GE modules, which are compulsory, then... aren't you all still on a level playing field? I really don't get what the big deal is.

Sure, not everybody will derive exactly the same value from every single bidding point spent, but did you really expect anything in life to be perfectly fair?
-
 
Why are more slots allocated for the freshies' new GEM module code, than the old GEM module code? Look at modules like nation-building, einstein and quantum weirdness, darwin and evolution and national heritage of Singapore. There are like 300+ slots allocated for the freshies, who make up 1/4 of NUS cohort, while 200 slots or even 100+ slots for the rest of NUS who make up 3/4 of NUS cohort. Look at the successful bid points, freshies got them for 1 point while the seniors had to fork out 700-1000+ points for the same module. Moreover, there are still 100+ vacancies in the reserved slot for freshies, which NUS admin had not merged for the seniors to bid. 

I mean who even thought of the idea of allocating more slots for the freshies than the rest of NUS. Who approved of this idea? Was there nobody in the higher-up to even review this allocation of slots? You don't need MA1100 to comprehend how ridiculous this allocation of slots is. 

I am not angry that I lost out in the bidding round and did not get the mods that I wanted. I am angry that NUS rigged the system in such a way that freshies benefit at the expense of year 2s to year 4s. So in round 2B and probably 3, the seniors are going to have another death-battle over the scarce slots while the freshies just cruise through with their 1 point. 
-
 
So many seniors complaining about bidding. It's always give-and-take. Each batch is always different. I'm a freshie and I'd rather be in the old system (was it 2 breadth, 1 SS, 2 GE) than to have this shitty five pillar system.

Hi guys, before I begin, I gotta warn yall peeps - wall of text ahead. But if you don't mind hearing the rants of a disgruntled student, then welcome aboard. If you're interested but put off by the text wall, TLDR verison below. So yep, I'm currently a Year 3 student, and I'm really -bleep-ing angry about how the bidding situation is so unfair to students of our year now. I am sorry but no matter how much I try to be a "rational, thinking adult", I still can't find the legendary silver lining that is supposed to exist.

So firstly, you roll out this new set of GEs with different module codes in which students of the cohort 2014 and before cannot bid for. Well, ok, fine, I thought, it's still not gonna be a problem if the quota is distributed fairly. And then comes bidding, and I realised what the -bleep-, the then year 1s have been given so much more spaces than the rest of the cohorts, meaning the others (Y2 - Y4) effectively fight amongst ourselves for those limited slots despite our combined population being so much more. And for those whose timetables can only accept certain variations due to inherent errr... difficulties, planning becomes so much more of a nightmare as the only mods that can fit your timetable might be too expensive to bid for (I'm a Chem student and our labs already render 1 full day more or less UNUSABLE). Please la, it doesn't take a math major to figure out how to split the spots proportionally. Do you even common sense?

And so now this brings me to my next point. Within this group of Y2 - Y4 students fighting for the limited slots, who has the highest probability of getting the mods they want? Bingo, the Y4 students who have been saving up for the longest and are probably loaded. Granted yes, not all, but still most. And so we see mods that used to be so cheap skyrocket by at least x2 to x3 their normal prices. I used to take nation building (SSA2204) for only 200+ points. And now? 700++ seems to be the norm. Even popular modules such as Science of Music, whose PC coded variation, which is usually cheaper than the GEK code, has shot up to GEK coded prices and beyond. Not blaming the Y4s as all is fair in love and war (well in this case bidding), but what this new system has done is to invalidate much of the advantage more senior students have due to their ability to save points. Originally, the Y2s might have an advantage over the Y1s regarding to module bidding solely on the basis that they have more points saved up. But now, with the Y1s excluded, the status of Y2s might as well be Y1s (in terms of bid points), and Y3s might as well be Y2s. No matter how much we have saved previously, we will probably be unable to outbid our seniors, and it simply becomes the same game, albeit with more expensive prices. Sounds great huh.

So anyway once again, to recap, and for those who want the short version,
TLDR: 1) New module codes quota rabak. Should be more proportional.
2) Bid prices inflate. New coding annulled the advantage seniors had from saving.

Me thinks actually the problem can be easily fixed by readjusting the quota. But then school do this, we also LLST what. So how? Like what one of the other posts said, for the Y3s who are gonna graduate soon, just try to bid if possible, and if it doesn't work out, just appeal, say cannot take then you cannot grad already. Those going on to honors, bobian la, you will probably need to take other mods due to priority allocation even if you appeal, but yall so clever confirm can make it one regardless of the mod taken. As for the Y2s, I'm sorry but you gotta tahan for another 2 more years. Unless the school system decides to make some change within your remaining matriculating duration. But then that one macam sisyphean task, or if you would prefer it, 比登天还难 (for my non chinese friends, that meas "harder than climbing the sky"). Ok, rant over.

I think the people who allocate slots for general education modules need to wake up their bloody ideas.Why allocate an excessive amount of slots to freshies? The freshies' quota is more than the rest of the population's quota. Thar's just ridiculous. As a year 2, i only have 800 general a'c pts. How the hell am i supposed to get 2 modules when the  bid points are so inflated?
-
 


these are all teething problems that should be expected of an awkward transition to the new GE structure. Give the admin staff some time to learn and adapt. If freshman vacancies are really as excessive as you say they are, the unused ones will be released to general bidding in later rounds.

In case not getting those two GE modules will crush your hopes and dreams, try providing (less emotionally-charged) feedback through more effective channels. But.. you are likely to receive a response somewhat similar to the above.

Hello! I'm a freshie and I'm really confused about the CORS bidding. Do freshies bid together with seniors for language mods or are we still protected and considered new students? I'm looking through the past bidding points and I think I don't have enough if we're bidding together with seniors.... :-(
-
 
Is there anyone who had bid for modules with lectures that clash at the same timing? Is it "illegal" or is it just "at your own risk"?

Tl;dr Graduating students, appeal for the module. Non-graduating students, bid alternative modules now before everything gets expensive in round 3.

With the recent posts on GEK/GEM/SS for senior students, I think some people may need some advice. 

For graduating students, if you need to clear ULR(especially to clear SS requirement) in order to graduate but don't have enough points, just appeal for the module after round 3B. Most likely they will have to give it to you and you should have the priority. Unless there are like 100+ graduating students appealing for modules like SSS1207, then I do not know how FOS is gonna deal with it. Given that there are at least 1000 year 1s fighting for that GES1021 355 slots, don't bang on the thought that the left over year 1 slots would be given to seniors who are appealing for it. 

For non-graduating students, just bid for alternative modules and don't try to appeal for it as graduating students can appeal under "Unable to secure module for graduation this semester '' which means they will have priority. Maybe it is time for you to explore modules out of your comfort zone. End of the day, you may gain an interest in that area and you can also SU it. 

-
 
A burning question: Will a module be cancelled if too few people bid for it? like not enough people to make a class?

I need advice from Prof Ben regarding a goof up I made while asking recommendation letter for seeking employment in Singapore.

I had emailed a professor probably six months ago for a recommendation letter with all my details. She said she will be able to give me only after 3 weeks and not before that. I replied to the email and I said that timeline is fine with me. Period. 

Nothing happened after that.

Initially I was expecting her to reply with the next steps but the prof didn't. 
Or May be she was expecting me to send another email but I didn't as I thought some professors may try to dodge to avoid giving recommendation letters. 

I have been a good student but surely not the best and I am also a foreigner.

I want to maintain good relations with the professor as I also intend to do Phd later and  work with her. How do I get myself out of this and approach the professor?

For all students (especially if you are pulling your hair over CORS), here's how to use CORS!
Sorry guys, I just had to rant and get over it.. The archive for GEK/GEM/SSA is no longer valid. It is so hard to predict how much the lowest successful bid points would inflate to for this semester. Looking at how the lowest successful bid had inflated to thousand over points for the previous semester, I guess I would have to accumulate more points and clear my university level requirement on my final year. Can't help but feel a little disappointed that after 2 years of points accumulation, my efforts are somehow futile due to a change in the university level requirement. Envious of the Year 1 that could get whatever modules they want to fulfill their university level requirement.. 
-
 
 you can prolly monitor the bidding situation in subsequent rounds. new slots might be offered at round 3. if you fail to get it, appeal and you better have a good reason why you are so desperate for the mods. good luck for the hungry games with the old birds
-
 
To people who have done special terms before, i do not have to bid for any modules and I only simply need to register for it through the special term registration system right? I'm worried about bidding again as I suspect I may not have enough points to bid anymore...
-
 
I sincerely hope the admin does not filter this. Even though this is a boring post with nothing to do with love and relationships. I hope the admin does not filter this for the sake of the NUS population. Does a different module code mean that there is a different bell curve? For instance if a module is double coded as a gem mod and a core mod, will there be a seperate bell curve? Secondly, is there a seperate bell curve for the ges module code and the ssa module code? Or does it work with the same bell curve. Lastly, if the module code has both a HY and EU module code or a ST and MA module code, will the bell curve be the same of different for the different module code?
Thanks.
-
 
I kind of agree with  and would like to rant too :( I feel that it really doesn't make sense to have so many slots allocated to the new module codes which only year 1s can bid for. As a result of this module code split, most of the elective modules have less than half the usual number of vacancies available for seniors to bid. Many of the mods which usually require lesser bid points also require much more bid points now because of the no. of bidders exceeding the no. of vacancies by a much greater extent :( and as a result I'm being outbid for all the 3 elective modules choices that I've wanted..sigh... :/

I'm a failure. Not a typical failure by the SG definition of the word, but one nonetheless. 

As a student with a future career in healthcare, I should know how to take care of myself, to have compassion for others, and to study hard so I can help patients. Instead, 80% of my time is spent on my eating disorder. The thing is, I appear physically healthy to everyone, chubby even. No one would guess that I compare myself with all the skinny perfect girls (and boys) in my batch, even my closer friends. That when I express concern for my friends who are eating healthy, skipping meals or losing weight, inside I am berating myself for lacking that discipline. That the reason why I don't join my friends at mealtimes is that I am ashamed to display my gluttony by eating in front of anyone. That I have social anxiety and withdrawn from people because I perceive myself as an unworthy, negative and boring person. That I "eat healthy" in the day, and binge on almost a thousand calories every night. That I binge eat every time I should be studying, and failed several of my exams as a result. That I have self-harmed and tried overdosing on Panadol, and run away from home and had violent quarrels with my family and no longer talk to my sister and no longer can accomplish basic tasks and no longer am the driven gentle kid with a future I once was. I have become a monster, a curse and a failure, with a seething anger and self-hatred in me that cannot be quenched.

The moral of all this (if there is even a moral to this inane rant) is: Be Kind, you never know what people are struggling with under the surface. Be Kind and reach out especially to those who are different and those who are sad and struggling. 

PS the school knows and I am being "monitored", so don't go reporting to NUS abt an incompetent and mentally- unstable nursing/medical/pharmacy student you read abt on NUSWhispers; I will probably never graduate anyway.

I'm not sure why there are people like  that think just because they do well in JC/poly, it sort of "defies logic" that they are not doing well in university. University is an entire different ballgame. I'm not trying to be mean, but I've met people like this before, and maybe the confessor of  is not one of them. Their attitude sometimes is really bad, especially those in business, no offence. They say things like "I got 4As for A-levels, you didn't get a single A, how come your GPA can be higher than mine"? And then they make excuses like how their course has more smart students/foreign scholars/LKY descendants etc. that's why their bellcurve more difficult bla bla. 

Come on la, just face it. You are just not good as you think you are. IMO, university is the first time people actually get to choose what they want to study. From primary all the way to JC, most of us have been pushed to do science without choice by parents. So naturally, those who are not interested won't do very well while those muggers will excel. Now that we are old enough to have some choice, we take the path we are interested and passionate about and excel, while those muggers just choose a course that they think is "elite" and just cmi.

Honestly, I'm sick and tired of hearing these stories. "I was a top student last time, why am I not one now?". Last time policeman wear shorts. That is last time. Now is not the same as last time. Please don't have such high expectations of yourself. 

Live with the fact that you are mediocre, there's really no shame in that, its just statistical probabilities. 
-
 
It's a stupid rant but, well done NUS, or I should say most of the lecturers for GEK, GEM and SSS etc. I don't know whether this has already been mentioned/ posted in semester 1, but I only realised it now in semester 2. Did you know the lecturers allocate more than half of the vacancies for the module in the new year 1 module code? Makes so much sense right? Since there are 3 other years worth of students fighting for the old module code. Well done Lecturers, who have such a great sense of proportionality. 
-
 
Its a start of a new semester. And this semester, like every other semester before I always tell myself that the next semester will be different. I will attend all lectures, tutorials and participate in discussions. Study every day. And it always ends with me giving up half-way through the semester. But this semester its going to be different, because this semester, I am not even going to bother

I always thought that I am an above average student. Receiving Edusave Scholarship every year in my secondary school days and being placed as one of the top 10 students in my polytechnic course. In NUS, I started to have difficulty understanding the course materials. This snowballed as numerous weeks goes by. I started to lose confidence in myself and began to question my intelligence. This never happen to me in the past. Sometimes, I even felt depressed. Any people out there can give me any sort of advice? Appreciated for your comments and leave out those nasty ones!

Three years after completing the modules in question, I realised that my lab reports are still being circulated amongst undergrads whom I've never even seen before.

It may not seem like a big deal or cost me anything, but wow, some respect for intellectual property please?

And some self-respect and pride in your "own" work? *facepalm*

 I would like to modify this question a little. I am also a science student aiming for the top US universities, however I only have a (upper range) 2LH CAP. Ordinarily, I know I stand no chance if I apply directly. Which is why I have decided to stay for a masters by research for an additional year or two. I believe I have awesome recommendations all written by profs who have known me for at least a year and a half. I also have a clear and forthcoming statement of purpose as determined by my prof, and a touching and well written personal history statement (i asked around). With a publication forecasted with the next few months pending a few further experiments, have my chances improved?

Hi need some advice please! When is it safest to have unprotected sex? My bf and I did it the day after my period ended without protection and now I'm worried sick. All google searches say different things some say after period is safest some say is most dangerous, some say sperm can live in the uterus for 5 days some say 1 day. 

I am on a regular monthly cycle plus minus afew days. Can anyone with some medical/fertility knowledge provide some advice? As well any knowledge abt options to take in the worst case scenario:/

 From social sciences instead of natural sciences, but also looking at PhD in top US universities. I'd say you need strong letters of recommendation and start getting some research experience. A PhD is ultimately about research, not coursework.

Also, start turning to your profs for advice.

 There are times where I learned very little even though I scored A. And there are times where I learned a lot of new things even though I scored C. If you want to be successful in life, you need to take the risk of getting C. But you will learn alot of new things. I remember my C and failures more than the good grades.

For me, evey social situation have to be preplanned and execute like an algorithm. If not, then I will feel awkward. When I socialize, I learned that I just need to go through the routine and end at the right step. I created conditions to determine what I need to do.

I'm a third year undergraduate student, studying science. My current CAP is around 4.9, and I don't have any prior research experience. I'm aiming for PhD studies in top US universities, i.e. MIT, Stanford, UCB, etc. Will I have any chance of getting into one? Specifically, do they look more at academic grades, or more at research experience, or a combination of both? Any suggestion on how I can optimize my remaining time in university to achieve such goals is welcomed. Thanks.

-
 
There had been posts in the past few days about what goes on behind the scenes regarding our computation of grades and it's good that Prof Ben Leong commented on this issue. I never knew it was possible to moderate down a particular student's score if the prof see fit, which results in another student having a higher score overall and a subsequent improvement in grade. Now that I know, I actually thought it's not totally impossible let's say, what if a prof likes a student for whatever reason (I'm not referring to students who curry favour because I felt that some, if not most profs, would dislike students who behaved this way), then perhaps the prof can secretly moderate another student's score to help his favoured student improve his/her grade a bit eg from A to A+ or A- to A. Even when such things happen, nobody would know right? Especially if a module is taught by only one prof alone? Do you all agree that there is a small chance things like this could happen, even while nobody, not even the favoured student, could have known about it?

I didn't take history or geog in jc. Would GEK1022 (geopolitics of war and peace offered under geog dept) be too difficult for me to handle? no reviews were available on nusmods, could anyone who has taken this before share about it please?
-
 
I read a couple of posts about module reviews and i too, was unable to find reviews for many modules i am interested in. How i wish the module review webpage that OP of  can be restored to its former glory. Around one year ago, i remembered being able to find plenty of reviews about any modules. Oh well, its kinda sad that this useful webpage was abandoned like that and i wish something could be done to bring it back to what it once was:( 
-
 
I don't understand why people bother to put their grades in module reviews. Is it a form of humblebrag? At the end of the day, each module will have approximately the same percentages of A's, B's and C's, so it is not like it is possible to deduce the ease of getting a good grade based on the feedback of a few reviews.
-
 
I am the OP of . How does Nusmods module review works? It appeared like there is only some reviews for selected modules so am I on the right track? Basically I searched a module under the search box, scroll down, but most modules I wish to know more about doesn't have comments (assuming your reviews are referring to the comments):/ Is it because many people had yet to contribute reviews as this app is relatively new? I somehow ended up on DISQUS which have quite number of discussion about certain modules but even then I still could not find the modules I wanted... 

Please do let me know if there are other ways to get to the reviews, thanks:)

Looking at the following link, SoC SEP pre-approved mapping list, makes me question the ability of some SoC admin. Why so careless?

https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/sep-public.html

There are two "University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill", two "University of California, Riverside", one "University of Hong Kong" and another "the University of Hong Kong". Honestly could you please check for duplicate information, or merge the two lists into one, before the list is published publicly on the internet?

  Currently a year 3 chemical engineering student going for IA next month. Want to get specialization in biomolecular engineering, so the only choices I have will be CN5173 and CN4223R, which are the ONLY 2 evening modules next semester for this specialization. I don't have a lot of bid points, and yet I have to compete with crazy seniors with loads of bid points in their account to fight for these TEs (the highest bid for one module is currently 5000+). They have completed their IA, and yet we have to compete with them in securing these evening modules (haven't mention about competing with them for grades.) We have no choice but to chose these modules as they are the only few available as evening modules. And the department allows this to happen. THIS IS UNFAIR!!
However, I am going to get my PhD anyway. So if I really can't get the specialization, it is not going to affect me too much. I can also focus on my IA and get a work-life balance without having to study for evening mods. Pity those with poor grades and want a specialization to "beautify" their graduation cert.
Calling people from the Chemical Engineering Department - LOOK AT THE BIDDING STATS IN CORS FOR THESE EVENING MODULES! OPEN UP MORE SLOTS OR EVEN MORE TEs!!!!!!!!!! To those seniors who put in so much bid points, better pray hard that you will do equally well in the modules. Don't cry if you get poor grades and drop CAP!

-
 
I'm the OP of . Thanks Prof Ben Leong for confirming so. How should I go about appealing? Like should I just go into CORS and appeal for the module (it doesn't show up in CORS) or drop an email to the professor teaching that module? Really hoping I get to read this module

Is it possible to appeal to read a level 4000 module despite not having the prerequisites of 80MCs read? I believe that the module isn't popular so the class won't be full. Wanted to read for interest.

Teach you guys how women think, because I am one... Lol. 

If man cannot provide good lifestyle, woman will nag, wah... Long time no eat restaurant, other friends of mine all go holidays overseas twice a year, we stucked in Singapore for three years already. 

Then when man worked hard to earn lots of money to provide the said restaurant meals and overseas holidays, woman will realise one day... Actually, har, I quite sianz of eating restaurant meals so often. What we want is for you, hubby and father to be by our side, spend more time with me (wife) and coach your kid in homework. Ya, maid helps with housework but she is not the kid's father. 

The man basically facepalm. 

Either way you also wrong. Lol. 

Get use to it, we are like that.

I used to think Economics was interesting and wanted to major in it. But now after looking through the overview of the higher level mods, i'm beginning to wonder if I should major in it. Most people i know are encouraging me to take it as a major since this subject offers me good job prospects in the future. Some have also told me 'most people tend to work in places irrelevant to their degrees after graduation', so even if i were to end up working in another field and fail in there, I'd always have this degree as a backup plan. 

But i'm really unsure. I find interest in CNM among the other subjects offered in FASS, but as a shy introvert, I'm really unsure if i could step out of my comfort zone to do well in this field. Also, what kind of jobs could i do with a CNM degree?

How long does an examination result review usually take? I believe many receive their results the day after closing deadline.

2014 is a year of ups and downs. 

I entered into a relationship and I thought she would be the one. However, it didn't last due to chemistry and time commitment. 

I received good appraisals in the 1st half of the year, and continued to work hard in the 2nd half of the year. Working during a break up was made easier with good and supportive colleagues. I also went for a few interviews to explore my career options but they didn't become something more.

2015 is a year of more ups than downs. 

A couple of my good friends have gotten engaged or BTO. They are either doing well with their current firms or have jumped to another firm and are doing well. Most recently, another of my colleagues had secured a new job after looking for some time.

Dating wise, I spent quite a bit of time to re-collect myself, and have not been active in the dating life. Recently I got to get acquainted with someone at work, who is bubbly and intelligent sounding. She is from another department. I asked for her number with a logical and non work related reason that is an obvious lie. I think I will ask her out for a date in 2016. 

I continued to receive good appraisals and built a decent reputation (both juniors, peers and superiors) in the department. I am still required to work as hard but there was slightly more choices and freedom. Having some IQ and EQ, and fair bit of luck, allowed me to manage or avoid nasty or incompetent  clients and managers. However, I turned more active in job searching as I become affirmed that the nature of the industry may not be for me in the long run. I continued to apply for roles which I used to pursue in university. Thankfully, I managed to sell my 'transferrable experience' and secured an opportunity with an silo unit which is part of a tier 1 firm. I am feeling very psyched to commence my work.

2016 is a year of possibilities. 

It may have more downs than ups and vice versa. Hopefully, we have the strength to weather through both the good and bad. Happy New Year!

I heard that level 4000 elective mods for econs and sociology won't be graded on a bell curve due to small class size. (Still more than 25 though?) Is that true?

I have graduated from Chemical Engineering last year (2015). After searching for jobs for a long time, I realized I have little interest joining in the chemical engineering industry, especially working in chemical plants. In fact, my interests waned greatly during my years in university when I am slowly exposed to the job nature of majority of chemical engineers in Singapore.

I still regret over the decision joining Chemical Engineering because it was seen as a "more prestige" form of engineering by many. 4As for the entry requirement. Truth to be told, I am probably more confident writing all sorts of algorithms for various platforms than using the equations taught in my course. My endless dabble in many disciplines have led me to realize that my ultimate interest lies in Computing Science. There is no other technical discipline more beautiful than one that attempts to connect all others, and more perfect than one that attempts to predict the future of science and Mankind.

While I have been spending my last six months exposing myself to lots of algorithms, libraries, languages and different fields of computing such as machine learning (my favorite) while looking for a fulfilling full time job with my irrelevant degree part-time, many questions began to accumulate in my mind. Unfortunately, while Google has been my best teacher so far, it is inadequate. I really wish to go back to school....., to start taking up a course I really really really love (I cannot emphasize this enough)......, to really study for my interests and not the exams........, and to have in-depth discussions with people who knows stuff.............but I cannot afford the school fees nor can I apply for a scholarship because I have a Third Class honors in Chemical Engineering.

Sometimes I wonder, if living too long in a small, pragmatic society which struggles to survive in an ever constricted world everyday has drained the souls out of many of us. People make decisions based on pragmatism, and in the process, they lose a little bit of themselves. Eventually an empty shell is all that remains.

I am gradually turning into that empty, soulless shell, and sooner, if I let my Degree and the society decide my future. Hence, I beseech the readers here, do not make the same mistake as I did, and please do live a life without regrets. Meanwhile, I shall let my dilemma smoother my soul into oblivion....

Dear Op ,

In one single confession u have expressed exactly how I felt . Only difference is I'm at a diploma level . My passion was in programming . I know C and I continued to learn Python n VB entirely on my own . I even applied my passion in programming to come up with programs to automate a lot of stuff at my work using only VB . I'm from mechanical engineering ( many years ago ) , sadly I don't come from a well off family to go for a degree , my parents are old and I try not to spend their money . I still have a brother to take care of . Hence I had to work first while doing my part time studies .

Now there were two choices , Ntu or Nus for part time studies . Ntu had a part time Computer Science course , but they don't take engineering students from my poly ( guess they really do select students based on the poly's rank huh ) . Nus doesn't . So I'm now stocked in Nus , still in engineering . 

To my knowledge Nus does not offer part time CS course . So I took the course that is the closest to my interest . It has one module related to programming . One . 
The module is bad , as in really bad , throughout the whole module , not once did the lecturer comment nor see our code . The assignments were submitted in a report format with screenshots of your results . Noone bothers to look at how efficient your program is or how you manage to reduce the size of your program to achieve the same results or added codes to control the output so that program doesn't crash when user enters gibberish .

Sadly I'm already in my third year . I know , it's too late to do anything . What I want to say is , I can relate to what happened to u , if u have another offer, just take it, like Shia said, don't let your dreams be dreams . For me , I can't quit work as I have people to support , but if u still have a choice , just go for it , while you're still young . 
All the best bro .

Hi does anyone know the syllabus difference between CS1010S and CS1010X? Can a non-science student take CS1010S? Any advice as in which to take?

Just out of curiosity, does the prof have access to the CAP of students enrolled in their module?

One year ago I was in an European country on SEP. Like most people who go to Europe for exchange, I too travelled extensively to many cities. While I'm regularly nostalgic about that semester abroad, I don't feel the #wanderlust that everyone clamours about. I'm not "thinking about my next trip", and although I'm graduating come May, I have zero grad trip plans in mind (partly because I don't have a squad, but that's another story). All my peers are talking about grad trips to all corners of the globe; is it okay that I just wanna laze at home?
-
 
 My suggestion is to master a few general topics like Data Structures and Algorithms, TDD, Design Patterns and Clean coding. Learn how to apply them. You don't have to know everything that a CS student knows. Honestly speaking, I think most students don't remember what they have learned after finals are over.

Regarding the hooplah about how Comp Science having straight A's is useless as you can learn it outside....From an outside point of view, doesn't that apply for everything else as well? If you wanted to, you can learn engineering, philosophy,  nearly everything from MIT open courseware, google, and youtube. It's all there for every subject, not just computer science. So why arent more people doing it? Perhaps this is something we should think about instead of merely vilifiying without grounds..

Hey NUS. I'm trying to decide on which courses to apply to next year and I'm looking for some advice. I'm pretty much split between Engineering and FASS. Growing up watching mythbusters has made me fascinated with engineering. But at the same time, having been a science student since young has made me want to try something new and different. I've only gotten advice from my cousins in NTU. I hear that for NTU HSS its impossible to fail modules (unless you're in econs), but it is also difficult to score As as well. Whereas for NTU engineering, failing and MC-ing papers is normal. Getting an A however, is just as difficult as it is in HSS. 

But the catch is that even if you graduate with third class or even no honours from engineering, you will still be able to get a job related to your discipline because engineers are in demand. However for HSS, jobs are scarce (according to the GES), and only those who get first-class or second upper are able to find jobs close to their field. Is NUS similar in these aspects? 

If I were to choose engineering, I would want to be able to create more efficient systems? Something that would help the environment, or at least reduce human wastage. As for FASS, I'm really interested in political theory or political philosophy so I'd study either political science or philosophy or both.

 I am a self-taught web developer (never taken a CS class). It is important to be humble and begin with a beginner mind. Every single day, I will study some theories that a Computer Science student must know. I read papers and books from ACM and IEEE every week. I switched to Linux and started learning how to use the terminal properly rather than relying on GUI. I practiced problems from competitive programming websites. I started to read Knuth recently. I learn UI/UX stuffs from Smashing magazine etc. But I admit that the Computer Science students probably know more than me. I have no Computer Science degree to fall back. That is why I need to learn more everyday. Tsuyoku naritai !!!

Really tired of the competitiveness in Chemical Engineering. As if being around a bunch of no-lifers during the regular semester is not enough, now you have to camp and watch as the min bid points go up every 5 mins for TE CORS bidding. Sigh.

Hi, I would like to clarify a bit on prof Ben Leong's comment that the definition of A+ means "prof is impressed", does it means the following 2 scenarios for instance: 

1) Student X got say 95% overall while student Y got say 92% overall. However, student Y was able to tackle a super challenging question in the exam paper (which many others can't) while student X only managed to answer that challenging question in a half correct manner. Thus prof is more impressed with student Y even if his overall is still lower than that of student X and student Y got awarded with A+ while student X got an A. 

2) Student Y may not have done better in terms of raw scores compared to student X. However, student Y is extremely well-read, show genuine interest in the module and have very good potential to excel in both the theoretical and practical aspects (can relate the module very well to the real world) of the module and thus prof is impressed. Therefore prof decides to award student Y an A+ instead of student X.

Are these 2 scenarios possible?

The A+ guide for dummies

Have you ever wondered why people are getting Aplus and yet you are only getting at most As？Here is a small guide to success

1.Ask questions after lecture.(Rapport?)

2.Sit in the front row. (If you 
get my point)

3.Wayang in tutorial wherever possible eg throwing in high level knowledge.

Hi, i am a year3 student from NP(graduating in april) studying Mechanical Engineering. My cGPA is 3.89 I have an interest in Business and have little interest in ME. I believed I could score well in ME but i might not do well in BZ(albeit i like it). I believed from my peers that BZ for poly is very competitive. Should i say that i might be lucky indirectly for achieving low O level results which denies me a chance to study BZ. In addition, i might not be scoring well in BZ due to the competitive nature

Results will affect starting salary indefinitely, so folks, what should i do?

Hi. I have to say that I have been a really average student in NUS. I did not participate in any CCAs neither do I have fantastic CAP. It really isn't good because I probably won't be doing my honours and it's not that I slacked very much, I really did my best. I am also not specifically talented in anything. At times I wonder if I'm just too lousy for this society (also considering what the society deems as "success") but I believe there is more than this in life. More than a good record of achievements and academic results, there is just more. Almost every week I help children or younger students either taking care of them or giving them tuition and these are not things part of official organizations that I can really include in my resume or record. One thing that I know is that I am happy, happy that while being a student pursuing knowledge, I can learn new things both in and out of school. My interest for knowledge is not about how well I can score for my exams but rather just my curiosity about this world and I also love sharing this knowledge. I am also aware that my lack of good results would possibly make others question if I can really be the one sharing knowledge. It's sad to look at how people are judged because of their results. Perhaps I am too naive in this competitive society but I think we shouldn't paper chase for the sake of it. Is it wrong to learn and not being able to master (yet)?

I would like to encourage those out there who may not think of yourselves as fantastic in terms of your achievements in NUS or in life so far, yes the world will judge you in one way or another but try to find joy in what you do. Do something that you've always wanted to do but haven't had the chance to. Life is not about gaining all these things just to make your life look better. You are awesome in your own way, maybe they are not written on paper but I'm sure they are clear to people around you. 

I am going to graduate next semester and I believe I will come back here again to share my story after entering the working world. :)

Don't make a living, but live... to the fullest.

Have a great semester ahead! 

Sincerely, 
Year 3 Science student

There's a get module I'd like to take and according to all the nus sites it's available in sem 2. however when I search for it under module mgmt it doesn't turn up :( does this mean that it's actually not offered this sem?? will it appear later on?

My father always think that "smart people" should be getting executive and office jobs, and that service-oriented jobs are rubbish. It's very depressing because I actually aim to work my way up from a fashion sales associate to a more senior position, and I have to start with a (what my father says: lowly) sales associate, because my degree is not arts/biz/fashion (I'm from Science btw). Contrary to popular beliefs that fresh graduates think that they deserve a much higher starting pay, I think for some cases, it's the parents instilling that thought in them. I'm hoping that I won't be swayed by my father's constant elitist put-downs and I can actually make fashion into a career.

My CAP qualifies me to take a honors degree in FASS. But I don't feel like taking it. Instead I got fascinated by statistics and probability theory since year 2 after completing a statistics minor. Is it irrational to spend my last year taking only statistics classes (stochastic processes and non-parametric stats etc.) and then graduate with Pass with Merit? I am not interested to work in Civil service. My major is in the Humanities. 

Feel free to add in any constructive points. Thank you.

 You can study Computer Science on your own. Most of the foundations are done years ago by geniuses like Turing and Von Neumann. Current knowledge is a footnote to them. Knowledge is now commoditized. Don't need a degree for that. You can even go to lectures without being a NUS student. University is just a place for people to socialize and make friends with the exceptions of aspies.

I am a straight As student and will be ording soon.
I have decided to take Computer Science in NUS, and have already secured the NUS bond free scholarship. However, my parents adviced me that it would be better to study in the top ivy league schools since they have a better reputation. I could try to apply for the overseas scholarship too, but I would be bound to a 6 years bond.

I believe I do have a high chance to  succeed in the overseas scholarship application since my results, ccas, and cips are decent enough. However, my main concern would be studying locally wihout a bond, or oversea Ivy league with a 6years bond. I would definitely not be able to afford an overseas education without a scholarship. Many factors come into consideration for the overseas education, such as being the minority there, adapting to a different culture, not able to spend quality times with parents and such.

The reason I favour NUS is that I feel I am more comfortable locally, and without a bond to tie down 6years of my life. But not taking a 'free' overseas ivy league education seem like a waste.

Any advice for me?

i was doing a bit of spring cleaning and i found a post it note i wrote in 2013. apparently i only had 2 life goals at that time. one is to get a scholarship and the other one is to get him. i got my scholarship but i haven't gotten him. it is ironic how my friends can switch from bf to bf and failed to get the scholarship yet i can get the scholarship but i couldn't get him after sooo many years. i feel like such a loser whenever i see my previously unattached friends suddenly get attached, so easily and effortlessly, without having to experience the internal struggle i have experienced. i just feel so mistreated in life... maybe i should just cast my net wider like them but i really cant get over him. i just wish he knows...

FASS is NOT a dumping ground. It was a conscious choice that I have made - I was not dumped into it.

I discovered my inclination towards the humanities as early as when I was 13. Upon streaming and choosing of subject combinations for secondary 3, I was eligible for the typical, seemingly prestigious option of the triple science combination (was top 40 in the cohort). I did not choose that. Instead, I made do with double sciences in order to accommodate Literature and Combined Humanities. For me then, it was passion over pragmatism. Till today I never once regretted my choice.

During my debacle with Physics, I was invited to have a chat with the VP on my unorthodox decision to drop the subject. As I explained myself on how complex I found the subject to be, and how I was already set on entering the Arts stream in JC, and how my subject combination was flexible enough for me to survive the L1R5 requirements, I was slammed with a sneer, and a ‘wicked’ exclamation: “Complex? You do not know what is complex yet! What are you going to do with your life if you have no background in Physics?” The verdict was clear. If you do not arm yourself with the sciences, your path in life would be sealed. How terrible indeed.

At that point of time, I was struggling with Chemistry as well. Upon receiving my prelim results, my Chemistry teacher then shrieked “You failed Physics, now you fail Chemistry, then what? Are you going to fail Biology too?” I snapped, “I do not take Biology”. She blushed, and simply retorted, “What are you going to do with your life?”

I knew what I wanted to pursue in my life. And so I did not turn up for my Physics O-levels, did all I could to clear Chemistry in order to be at least proficient with one of the sciences. For a neighbourhood school kid, my net aggregate of 7 points was arguably a valiant attempt. No one spoke a word on results day.

Happily I went on to JC to pursue the humanities. The A-level road was excruciatingly rough and uncertain. It was like a one-way road where you either make it or break it. My training in the humanities in JC was an extremely rigorous one, and finally I made it into NUS FASS.

I never believed in the existence of inferior subjects. It is just a matter of one’s natural inclination towards each discipline. Sure we can always make up for our shortfall with diligence in order to be proficient in the subjects that we are weak in. But my point is, I always know what I wanted. I do not need unnecessary obstacles that may impede my overall performance and progress in the pursuit of my goal.

In light of the recent slamming that FASS is the way to mediocrity, compounded with my experience with myopic people who has tried to put me down back then, together with an implicit elitist family culture (extended family actually) that arts is lousy, let me just be spiteful and say that I have never felt so alive and free in the arts than I was with the other seemingly ‘useful’ disciplines.

I do not have to work so damn hard for my A-levels if FASS is a dumping ground. Face it, not everyone are meant for the sciences. Likewise, not everyone are meant for the humanities. Everyone have their own forte. Respect that.

If you abhor durians, it is likely that you will avoid it as much as possible. As such, it is a choice based on your natural preference. It is innate.

There is no mediocrity in the arts. Instead, I assert that there is nobility. I have learnt so much about people and the human condition in my journey with the humanities, so fulfilling that I am committed to pursue it at an undergraduate level.

Career prospects? If government bodies like SPF, MHA and MFA poaches History majors of FASS, what makes you think we have no future? There is no dead-end with whatever specialisation you choose. The future is (literally) in your hands.

So I am a Literature major. What can I be? Writer? (Why not?) Teacher? (Why not?) Playwright? (Why not?) It confounds me on why those questions are always asked with a sceptical expression and tone. What is wrong with all these career choices? Not realistic? Not lucrative enough in terms of remuneration?

If I have to conform to such constructed social conventions in order to be perceived as normal and successful, I will be an extremely miserable person.

I would rather have a wealthy soul that has potential in creating physical wealth in its own time and pace than to have physical wealth with a depraved and bereft soul.

Really, this sick and perverted mind-set that the arts is inferior needs to stop. It just shows how short-sighted and materialistic people are, and how flawed our education system has turned out to be.

To  
Reading your confession has hit a nerve for me. Like you, I struggled with Physics/Chemistry in secondary school, and in JC I naturally gravitated towards a full Arts combi. I loved what I studied, and I was pretty damn good in them. In the end, I graduated with, to everyone's surprise, straight As for my A-levels.

After results day came the confusing process of which university/degree to go for. My initial plan was to pursue what I had grown to love, and had proven that I can do well in - either Literature or Geography at NUS FASS. But everyone around me was telling me what a waste that was. "Do Law!", "Do Business!", "Why go FASS and waste your straight As?". I was 18 and I was thoroughly confused as to what was the 'right' choice. I was spooked by all these tales of not being able to find a 'good' job with an Arts degree when I graduate. When SMU approached me with their prestigious scholarship, I then caved and went ahead with what I thought was a good balance of what is practical and what I can possibly grow to like - Business and Social Sciences. 

I am now in my last year of undergrad studies. I have made peace with the fact that my degrees are not where my true passion lie. Yes, I can still do decently well in them, but I no longer love what I study. I used to pour over my notes day and night, read my books cover to cover, be inspired by the insights I could draw from the texts. This has never happened in my four years of undergrad studies. 

Reading your entry made me think about what I should have done back then, and I wish someone could have sat me down and told me how stupid it was to boycott the Arts and FASS because of what a bunch of other people thought of it. 
-
 
 &  My story is similar to yours. I'm slightly more fortunate, because my parents and secondary school teachers have never given me pressure that I should pursue sciences or engineering over humanities.

There are a few misperceptions towards FASS as a "dumping ground". While these might be accurate several years ago, these simply do not reflect reality now. 

Misperception 1: FASS is a dumping ground because it accepts students with the poorest A-level or poly results - those who are barely scrapping into university places.

Is that accurate in the present? We can look at the 10th percentile grades and GPA from the 2015 Indicative Grade Profile - which is publicly available information (http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html).

FASS: BBB/B, 3.74

Other disciplines with comparable or lower 10th percentile scores:
Nursing: CCC/B, 3.45
Industrial Design: BBB/B, 3.59
Project & Facilities Management: BBC/C, 3.74
Real Estate: BBC/C, 3.71
Engineering: BBC/B, -
Biomedical Engineering: BBB/C, 3.82
Civil Engineering: BBC/B, 3.72
Electrical Engineering: BBB/C, 3.70
Envt Engineering: BBC/B, 3.69
Engineering Science: BBB/C, 3.92
Material Sciences & Engineering: BBC/B, 3.94
Mechanical Engineering: BBB/B, 3.83
Computer Engineering: BBB/B, -
Science: BBB/C, (for various subjects - 3.74, 3.75, 3.77)

It is extremely interesting to note that the 10th percentile for FASS and Science are identical for the 3 H2 grades. For the 10th percentile of poly students who are in FASS and Science, their GPAs are comparable - only 0.03 difference.

So is FoS going to be the next "dumping ground"? Or the path to "mediocrity", as one post in NUSWhispers puts it? 

Personally, I don't like to put labels. Everyone has his reasons for choosing a particular university major, be it passion, employment prospects, or even forced circumstances. Hence, I find it odd that there are people who continue to see FASS as a "dumping ground", despite the changing realities.

Misperception 2: FASS graduates have it harder to find jobs; their pay is lower.

We can look at the latest Graduate Employment Survey to see if it's true (http://digitalsenior.sg/graduate-employment-survey-ges-nus-ntu-smu/). Although there are certain limitations of the survey, this is the best publicly available information we can obtain.

Employment rate and median gross salary:

Arts (Hons & non-Hons): 83 and 82; 3300 and 2800
Social Sciences: 89 and 3250
Nursing: 100 and 3500 
Industrial Design: 77 and 2565
Project & Facilities Management: 95 and 3000
Real Estate: 93 and 3000
Biomedical Engineering: 88 and 3000
Civil Engineering: 97 and 3208
Electrical Engineering: 91 and 3300
Envt Engineering: 95 and 3230
Engineering Science: 81 and 3400
Material Sciences & Engineering: 79 and 3300
Mechanical Engineering: 90 and 3200
Science (Hons & non-Hons): 87 and 77; 3210 and 3000

Arts graduates (like History, Philosophy, Literature) have lower employment rates than that of other disciplines which we previously compared. However, Social Sciences graduates (like Economics, Political Science, Psychology) have higher employment rates than that of Science.

Arts graduates' median salaries are comparable or even higher than that of others. 

Hence, we can conclude that FASS graduates have lower employment rates than that of other faculties, but the median salary of their first employment is comparable to other graduates'. 

More importantly, I suspect that FASS graduates who have secured their employment within 6 months of their graduation are probably those 1) who are on scholarships, especially from MOE; 2) who possess 2nd-upper class and above; 3) who found an employment which matches their interest and salary requirements; 4) who possessed good connections, because of internships or networking. 

This is of course not much different from other faculties. But if you're a FASS student, your chances of employment increase if you meet any of the 4 criteria, especially because there is a more narrow range of employment choices for FASS graduates. FASS graduates can't go into engineering jobs, while engineers can choose between marketing and engineering companies, for instance.

So, to FASS juniors - start to find internships and network now!

I hope the "dumping ground" misperception is demolished!

Is it better if I submit an appeal through CORS or email the prof directly if I really want to take a module but do not meet the prerequisite? :( 
-
 
I wonder if it is good to release the Indicative Grade Profile (IGP) in the public domain. Or perhaps even the starting salary range of the different majors. I'm certain the intention was to allow students to have a rough gauge of which major they're eligible to apply to and to give them an estimate of their future prospects, unfortunately I think this will lead to a great misallocation of resources in the workforce of the economy, and further unhappiness and dissatisfaction with their careers.

The IGP falsely labels the illusory prestige of certain majors. The majors with a 10th percentile of AAA/A are seen as more important to society than those with BCC/C. This probably led to most prospective students choosing majors which they think are on par with their grades, regardless of how good or bad, instead of choosing one which they truly are passionate about. You have probably heard that the majors with a lower admission criteria are called a "dumping ground" (FASS students I feel you) by that particular acquaintance of yours. What's saddening is that a person who may excel and interested at a particular profession, may end up choosing the not-so-interested “atas” courses since his grades are perfect. Also, the other way around when a student’s grades couldn’t make the cut for the courses they genuinely interested in. I'm not implying that this may be the case for everyone, but a lot of my friends said they would have applied for another major if their grade permits them to. And they didn’t even have the chance to choose the course they want, as the IGP puts them down from the start.

To add fuel to this situation is the projected starting salary range published. In fact, the monthly paycheck of the different courses is a driving factor for choosing a course to study. This is so evident from the sudden jump to AAA/A for computer science as the money and prestige is recently rolling in to the IT sector. Although it is impossible for everyone's salary to be the same as this depends on economic situation or governmental policies, however to influence students' decisions based on monetary rewards is a problem as they end up doing everything for money. Some may do their jobs well, however when money becomes the reason why they do things, they tend to cut corners, and only doing whichever task rewards them with the immediate dollars and cents. This is an attitude in a lot of young graduates. They must see the big picture where money is only the by-product of their work, the real product is to add value to the lives of the people they deal with such as their family, colleagues and customers.

I think it will be better not to publish the IGP or starting salary range of the universities and their respective courses. The rationale behind this is to give students a chance to apply for what they are passionate about. While it is fair for the university’s committee to use grades as a deciding factor for the admission, however it is just as important as well to look at what the student had been doing before his/her application. If a student is applying for computing, has he tried programming, done an internship or work in a related field? Does he still wish to study computing after having an idea on what he’ll be doing? His grades may not be stellar and meet the cut, but he should be given a chance to apply and to be considered on the basis of his interest, supplemented with his prior experience. On the contrary, even if a student gets perfect grades, if he made absolutely no attempt to seek experience on what it is like working in the related field, the university’s committee should consider him as an unlikely candidate. This will drive the A Levels or Poly students to take their own initiative to find opportunities, experiences and to know more about what their true passion lies with before making the decision, instead of solely going wherever their grade allows them to, or how much they expect to earn from it. 

It is very upsetting when some of my friends want a job unrelated to what they have studied. What’s the point of wasting 3 to 4 years of time and resources for the training provided, and end up doing work which doesn’t require it? The opportunity could be better given to someone who actually deserves the place, but was not given due to limited spaces. There must be something to be improved in the system. And NUS should make an effort to constantly improve their selection and education process and ask themselves, “Are we creating quality graduates with high moral standards, enthusiasm and creativity who can make a positive impact in society? Or are we simply churning out a breed of academically brilliant but passive labor for the economy?”

Thank you for reading my long rant. As I’ll be graduating soon next year, the least I can do is to give suggestions on how improve my university, and possibly the future of Singapore. But talk is cheap. Only the actions and coordinations taken by the universities and organizations can set the direction. Happy New Year!!! xoxo

Hi! Apparently we need 36 MCs to get 'promoted' to year 2 right? What if I dont hit 36 MCs by the end of sem 2 and reach it during special sem? Will I still be considered a year 2 when term starts?

Need some advice from senior please!
Have anyone tried going SEP alone before? And is there any way to find people going for the same exchange university before going?

 Your "minimum effort, maximize CAP" strategy sounded like mine, so I'll share with others too. 

Step 1: Study like hell when I was P6. Instead of going to the playground or playing ridiculous games like catching, I did all the assessment books available in Popular. Got PSLE T-score above 270, became an ambassador for a certain brand of chicken essence, and entered one of the top boys' schools in S'pore. 

Step 2: With my good grades, I got a cash scholarship with no bond. Used my pocket money and brand sponsorship cash to invest in rare Pokemon cards. Sold them off at marked-up price of 200 percent.

Step 3: Due to my good grades at PSLE, I didn't have to take O levels as I entered an IP school. While the majority of 16-year-olds were busy studying for their O levels, I did an attachment at a local institution, took up investing courses and also went for an overseas programme. 

Step 4: Did well for A-levels, and also secured advanced placement credits. So my honours programme was 3 instead of 4 years as I could skip some modules. Got a bond-free scholarship too. I also did a 1-year exchange programme. Did a local exchange too, and at the same time begun my FYP. Hence I only had 3 graded semesters.

Step 5: Liquidated my investments (by then I had invested in Rolex watches, not Pokemon cards anymore) With loads of overseas exposure and stellar grades, I applied for a job.

Results:
- 1st class honours, 3 graded semesters only
- good job, thanks to previous experience as a 13-year-old brand ambassador
- $30,000 in the bank, thanks to savings from scholarships and investments

When I was 12, people keep telling me that I think too much. But sometimes I wonder, maybe they are not thinking enough. They should just grow up.

In response to the discussion on maximizing CAP with minimum effort, here's what I did...and more (I'm a biz student):

Step 1: Study like hell. Gave tuition instead of spending time on CCA. Got CAP >4.5 and dean's list for the first year.

Step 2: With the good grades, I got a cash scholarship with no bond. Maximized all possible school loans at 0% interest rate, and invested the cash in blue chips with enough cash buffer.

Step 3: Also with good grades, applied for local exchange. Freeze CAP for one sem. While on local exchange, did part-time internship at a startup and join a entrepreneurship-related NUS CCA. 
 
Step 4: Apply for one-year NOC program. Use testimonials from Step 3 to support your application. If you had planned your mods properly, no extension needed. SU the big chunk of modules on NOC, and map back FYP. Also, I got one-year worth of full-time overseas, internship experience. Using internship salary, you have some money to spend on holidays (as opposed to a normal exchange program that would cost $10,000 - $15,000). 

Step 5: In final year, prepare to liquidate investments. Pay back full-amount owed. With overseas internship experience, and high CAP, apply for jobs. 

Result: 
- First class honours, with close to half SU and easier FYP 
- Good job, thanks to overseas internship experience 
- $30,000 in the bank, even AFTER paying back loans. Thanks to tuition, cash scholarship, savings from internship, investments, not spending $10k-15k on exchange. 
 
People keep telling me that I think too much. But sometimes I wonder, maybe they are not thinking enough.

 That's good advice thanks. My purpose of going on exchange to that particular university is to increase my chances (if at all) of getting into a graduate programme in universities of that tier; not so much on travelling since California's not cheap. If travel was my main aim, I would aim for eastern/central European countries instead. I am not (at least, I don't think so) the typical person who craves for exchange just for the sake of skipping lessons in that uni and go travelling all around. Exchange programmes are to immerse yourself in that school's culture. Travelling is a plus. But hey, to each his own. Cheers pal :)

 The science that I am against is the Rationalistic science that began with Scientific revolution led by Galileo's mathematization and Descartes's certainty method. In some cases, medicine can cause iatrogenic. Homeopathy is not "rational" as it does not provide a cure to an illness. But it stops you from seeking medical treatment when your illness is not severe and your body can recover from it.

"Now comes a study in the current issue of the Journal of Patient Safety that says the numbers may be much higher 2014 between 210,000 and 440,000 patients each year who go to the hospital for care suffer some type of preventable harm that contributes to their death, the study says."

To  Here's some advice, dont do what you can't do. If you cant study long hours, then simply dont. Dont stress over things you can or cannot do. Even if your grades plummet, so what? At some point, you have to accept that this the level of which you are capable of achieving. There is no shame in mediocrity. Instead, find something you are interested in and do that. You're still in secondary school and have a long way to go. Find success outside of academics. You are still young, you can learn a sport, or an art like photography, painting, poetry. Or just nua. If you really have to "force" yourself to study then you're doing it wrong. Take it from an undergrad. First-class honors students do not need to "force" themselves to study long hours. They study long hours because they want to and because they love what they study. Find something you like and do that.

Can any chemistry seniors advise me on how the level 2000, 3000 and 4000 modules are like and what to expect, in terms of workload, whether the modules are easy to score and the understandings of concepts? I have taken CM1111 and CM1131 and I find it relatively easy to understand. Will the difficulty level increase dramatically when it comes to level 2000 chemistry module, or higer level chemistry module? Please kindly advise because I have a hard time in deciding whether to change major. Your advice will be highly appreciated and thank you for spending the time to read this post.

I think the worst thing about confession  is that it shows how easy it really can be to graduate from NUS and even with a decent CAP on top of it. At first I was really angry at how naive this undergrad can be. But the more I thought about it, I realised I'm actually upset that such a loophole can be used here in NUS. There's gonna be at least one desperate who's gonna game the system and overtake those of us that actually work hard for our grades.

Employers don't even look at transcripts and individual modules so they won't realise that most of the degree was ungraded. And so what if only 60% of major MCs must be graded? It still seems weird that close to half of your degree is ungraded. Just one C can pull down my CAP by a lot. Now imagine that 40% of your degree is a C but covered up by S/U. What would your "true" CAP be?

Seeing the previous GE mod post previously, are GE modules without finals always better than modules with finals? But without finals only means that daily workload is heavier right?

There had been a couple of post about currying favour to gain better grades and the "sex for grades" case popped out again. Also I even heard stuff like if you are a female and the prof is a male, there's a higher chance you can succeed in currying favour from him (well things like that) but I suppose that wasn't true? I believe that the "sex for grades" case was an isolated incident and it happen mainly because the student kept "offering herself" to the prof and well, some guys simply gave in to temptations like this. Generally I feel that NUS profs know where to draw the line and they are highly unlikely to risk losing their jobs by giving in to temptations. 

Also just a question, why do some people think that class participation is one of the best chances to curry favour? Like if you say something smart and the prof get very impressed with how much you know about his/her module? If that's the case, then this isn't considered as currying favour right? Since the student indeed does know a lot beyond the module to gain that extra edge over the A grade people?

Hello! Please give me an input for my situation if possible. Thanks!

I am currently serving NS and will be matriculating in Electrical Engineering next year and I chose Electrical Engineering because it was related to my diploma and my love for Math and Science. While spending some time in NS and thinking about my future, I started reading books to improve on my financial literacy and I got very interested in it. So now I am in a dilemma whether if I should continue with Electrical Engineering or if I should take up Business Adminstration or Accountancy as if I were to continue with Electrical Engineering, I will probably be able to complete the degree in 3 years due to exemption of most year 1 modules compared to doing a Business degree for 4 years.

My next concern is whether a strong command of English is needed for a Business degree 

Lastly, how are exams conducted generally for the modules? (More of theory or calculation?) 

Thank you for reading thus far and your opinion will be greatly appreciated :)

Hello! Is it advisable to take GEM modules that are science related like drugs & society/food and health if I do not have any science background because I'm in a different faculty and did not take any science related courses in poly?

Regarding the post () about ang kat bola in order to get A+, is that a joke/troll seriously? I always believe nus profs are well, professional, and not likely to give certain students unfair advantage. From my observation, I believe that generally they give the A+ based on whether the student really deserve it, for instance, the student really did rank as No. 1 or 2 overall after accounting for all the tests and assignments marks, in other words, those students are already smart in the first place. If currying favour indeed does get one an A+, i suppose there would be plenty of students doing that. Plus many cohort have large class size and a prof have too many students, so if there' so many students trying to curry favour, then wouldn't there be too many A+ in a cohort, which arouses suspicion? If a prof selectively give only a handful of A+ to those who curry favour, then i suppose that particular student must have been super thick-skinned to do whatever it takes in order to stand out and get him/her an eventual A+? How many of you actually believe its possible to keep currying favour from profs and then end up with an A+? 
-
 
Regarding  and related posts, just confirming something. From the s/u's FAQ (for cohort AY14/15 & after), it says that at least a minimum of 60% of major requirements must be read in NUS (i.e., graded modules with assigned grade points or modules with an ‘S’ or ‘CS’ grade). 

Read in NUS != graded. So actually, mods taken in NUS which are S/Ued are still counted towards that 60%.

So the percentage of graded mods [depending on how many lvl1000 or 2000(without prerequisites) the major has] can be as low as 50%. 

Is my interpretation correct?

Hi guys, is it possible that if you got outbidded for a particular module, you go and talk to the prof and then he/she decides in the end to let you register for the module? There is this module which I am really interested in and it is usually over-subscribed and now that the system changes such that SS become GES, there are more vacancies given to the juniors, I suspect the bidding points may be crazily high and I might not have enough points. Given that I am already a year 3, what are the chances that the prof decide to let me in even if I were to get outbidded? Have anyone managed to successfully convince a prof to let he/she register for a module after failing to get a module through bidding? 

Btw this module is available only in semester 2, which explains why I am so worried about not getting this module....

 To the FASS wannabe, you sound naive. Come on, instead of asking "how do I graduate with the least amount of effort and with a good CAP?", you should ask yourself "what kind of takeaways I want after 3 or 4 years in uni?" But you might have some problems which prevent you from taking full advantage of a university education, so I'm not going to judge any further.

Let's answer your questions:

"1. Take 20MC in first semester. Focus on only one module to get an A. S/U all the other modules."

--> Yes, theoretically you can. I presume you will take Level-1000 modules, so it shouldn't be any problem passing them. But you might have underestimated the effort to obtain an A.

"2. With a perfect 5.0 CAP I can then apply for SUSEP and will confirm get to clear another 20 MCs in NTU/SMU gradeless."

--> From what I understand, the earliest any NUS student can head for exchange is Year 2 Sem 2, so you can't head for local exchange in Year 1 Sem 2. This is because if you apply in Sem 2, you'll be applying in the 2nd round (freshies are ineligible for 1st round because they have no CAP yet). This means that if you use the previous strategy, you must ensure that your Sem 2 results average an A- to maintain your first class. (If you don't understand this, scroll to other NUSWhisper posts or comments which explain how CAP works in a mathematical way)

 "3. Apply for overseas exchange for the third semester and clear another 20 MCs overseas."

--> It is possible to apply for both overseas and local exchanges, but note that if you're successful in the overseas one, your chances for the local exchange will be reduced. It is impossible for you to go in your Year 2 Sem 1, because of how the application rounds are structured.

Finally, although I'm not sure of your intended major, there is no "easy" major in FASS. At the end of the day, ask yourself "What do I want to learn from university?" Language skills? Making connections for future career? Research skills? 

Good luck!

Dear profs,

There is a particular topic that I do not understand in your modules. It is the last chapter: Grades.

Sincerely,
Nus students
-
 
 The best way to get A is to study what you are passionate about. The best way to mediocre is to take easy modules and get A without challenging yourself. FASS is already a dumping ground. If you continue to be mediocre, your life is screwed.
-
 
I need some advice please. What's the easiest way for me to graduate from FASS with a good CAP as easy as possible? Would my method work? 

1. Take 20MC in first semester. Focus on only one module to get an A. S/U all the other modules. 

2. With a perfect 5.0 CAP I can then apply for SUSEP and will confirm get to clear another 20 MCs in NTU/SMU gradeless. 

3. Apply for overseas exchange for the third semester and clear another 20 MCs overseas.

This way, I can clear half of my degree gradeless and still have 12MC of S/U to use if I want to.

I graduated a year ago. And guess what? I didn't work in the industry that I majored in. Instead, I work in an office environment, 9am to 5pm. Why? Because that industry requires long working hours and I forsake that career for something that gives me the work-life balance. Because of this switch, I lost touch with classmates and friends, and kept my job as low profile as possible because I don't want them to judge me and tell me that I can't succeed in that industry (actually I can...). And I'm happy with my decision I'm making, even though it may not please everyone. I can spend time with my best friend, bf, family, and find time to take up hobbies and exercise. Am I silly to make this decision?

Hi, I am a year 3 life science major and have a tendency to choose many LSM or biology related modules as it give me a higher chance of scoring well and biology was my only interest. During one of my my summer internships, I was advised by my mentor that I should not restrict myself to biology related modules even though they are my strength. He had econs background from A level and he recommended that I take for instance EC1301 because this would ensure that I have some basic financial knowledge and this can help me avoid being cheated by those people who promote some investment schemes. He said that without any investments, the money saved during work alone will not suffice for old age (he is intending to stay single and his salary is $4000+ as a post doc fellow). He said that even people without econs background can still do well in this module. However, my friends told me that the bell curve for EC1301 is extremely high and for people like me without A level economics at all, I may struggle with this module. Also, after planning out my timetable, I realised that if I were to take EC1301, I would end up exceeding the minimum 160 MCs to graduate with Honours. Lastly, I have zero interest in econs (although I understand that it could be useful for future but not likely to be helpful towards my CAP).

The question is, should I just focus on just taking biology related modules for my remaining 1.5 year, or should I listen to my mentor's advice that I must have fundamental econs knowledge to avoid getting cheated.

Is it true that if you intend to stay single, the money saved during work will not suffice for old age? Please advice. Thank you.

Some advice for the OP of  and people alike.

If you can't do mathematics, do applied mathematics. 

If you can't do applied mathematics, do statistics. 

If you can't do statistics, do economics. 

And if you can't do economics... maybe try gender studies or something.

For fresh graduates who are looking for jobs out there in the real world, do hiring managers look at honors class only, or do they also consider the specific CAP as well? I'm guessing the real answer is probably both, but let's say person A is 0.05 away from the next-higher honors class, while person B is 0.3 away from this same next-higher honors class. Are A and B of at least a slightly different position from each other (purely by virtue of their CAPs), all other factors remaining constant?
-
 
admins please don't filter this, my next four years pretty much depend on any advice here: any math majors who switched to statistics? I suffered a lot first sem in my math module as I don't like proving, and a search of reviews of the compulsory math modules for math majors has made me realise a lot of the modules in future require even more proving plus they're core mods so I can't run away from them. will it be any different in stats? if not I have to really totally change my major because I can't imagine suffering through this for the next four years. thank you any advice is appreciated.

Hi just wondering, does an A+ means being in the top 5% of the cohort? Or is it the top 10%? I understand that A- onwards are likely to be people within the top 25% so what really differentiates the A from the A+? And is it true that an A+ is subjective, which means the prof decides where exactly is the cut-off?

HIHI, I would like to ask if anybody has any recommendations of GE mods to take. Im from science and need to take GER1000 and another GE mod next sem. Would be grateful if anyone has any advice to give. thanks thanks!

First off, MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE! I'm the person who posted  and I just want to say thanks to everyone for all the advice. I have literally screenshot all the useful advice to follow haha. For those who asked, I currently have a gym membership so I usually go for class, one is a cardio-based class (combat) and the other is weight lifting (I think can be considered HIIT). Before I joined the gym, I used to run quite a bit, like 3-4 times a week about 6-10km each time, and I found that there was really a limit to how much weight I could lose, so I was advised to try doing more weightlifting in addition to cardio, which is why I go for these two classes at the gym :\ 

Currently I'm doing FYP which is why I don't have as much time and energy to exercise as before, so I notice the weight is coming back, hence the seeking advice on diet (I think it will be worse when I start working). I've heard of Insanity workout before but I am so afraid of it, and I don't know if I can force myself to keep going at it, but will definitely give it a try once my FYP is over! (this is why I need to go for class, so that peer pressure forces me to work hard and finish the workout)

Don't worry, I won't give up! Thank you everyone for all your helpful advice! I really appreciate it :) 
-
 
Seeling for advice here! Have any of you retook a module A (which happen to be a prerequisite for module B) and module B in the same semester? Is it possible to take both mods in the same semester if i write in to the department. Please advice!! I really wish to avoid late graduation!!

 US graduates don't need to worry about age. They have no NS to serve. SG guys have to think twice about getting a Master degree.

 As a graduating EE senior, I realised that the cutoffs actually quite accurately convey the career prospects of the course. There are plenty of EE students who end up taking a lot more CEG and CS modules because of this. I suggest you do the same before it's too late.

I can empathize with the Year 1s' anxiety over your grades. Like some of you, I was not happy about my CAP in my first semester. It was not easy transiting from NS to the academic rigour of university. However, I was genuinely interested in my studies and enjoyed tackling tough questions. So it was easier for me to adopt effective study strategies. My CAP improved in my second semester, and I graduated with first class honours.

In all honesty, my academic success was not about my innate talent or intelligence. There were people smarter than me in my cohort. For example, some of them came from elite schools or even gifted programmes. I succeeded because of discipline, effort and strategies. It's tough work, but getting good grades (and subsequently having a job with a competitive starting pay) is possible. 

Of course, I'm not saying that you SHOULD aim for first class at the expense of other things in university (like friendships, CCAs etc) or purely for the sake of money. I'm pointing out that it's not impossible to do well, be it moving from second lower to second upper, or second upper to first class etc. Unless you've other conditions which limit you, such as financial or medical problems, you can adopt some strategies to help yourself:

1) Choose modules which you're genuinely interested in. This is a no-brainer, but I've seen people who choose modules for the sole purpose of having a "good" time-table or because of their friends! And they complained about mediocre grades. 
2) After you got your modules, look at the syllabus. What are the specific objectives? What are the requirements (CAs, finals, lab work, field trip etc)? When are the deadlines? Who is the prof (if you don't already know)? Strangely, some people read their syllabus outline towards the end of the semester.
3) What are the course materials? Find your resources! 
4) Plan your personal deadlines. For example, if your assignment or test is on 10 April, give yourself one week buffer time. Always work and study ahead of schedule
5) Read your lecture notes and readings before every lecture. When you attend lectures, take down notes. After the lecture, before going to sleep, revise your notes. You will better remember the content and concepts if you revise earlier, not later. It's all about consistency, not that last-minute dash.

I hope these common sense tips can encourage you for the next semester! Good luck!

Ahhh sry for posting another result-related post but I was just wondering if it's possible/practical to ask for a review of results if I'm intending to SU it? 
I know the reviews tend to have little chance of increasing my grade whatsoever, but IIIIFFFF it actually did, would I be able to 'retract' my SU..? 

Thanks in advance for any advice!!

Regarding the recent CS 'rise in ranks', can someone enlighten me as to why is the requirement that some current CS students are proud of? Not like they're the ones that got into CS by AAA/A? I can understand being happy about it since it shows that CS is popular. But being proud? That said, why is any entry requirement something to be proud of for any major?

 Roughly about every 10 years, the Tech and Finance dudes will get over-arrogrant. There is a need of some crisis to shake the arrogrance off their face. It happened in 2008 for finance guys. Another one is coming for them.

The young padawan in tech industry have not lived through the Dot-com bubble as they were in kindergartens or primary schools. So many feel positive about the hyped-up Tech industry. Hope some crisis will happen in the next few years for them.

 well, it is coming, don't worry. That's precisely why I went to CEG instead. Engineering provides a safety net for computing students. Not to forget I can also go into IT industry too. Good luck to CS majors. 

I think more people chose CS because it is easier as compared to CEG and can get into IT industry too. Why spent time on hardware when the money is in the software side?

To S/U or not to S/U is about counting average, and coming up with guess estimates for probabilities. All freshies should not aim for FCH if simple mathematics is alien language to you.

I went on an exchange to the United States not too long ago. I learned a lot of new things, and met a lot of new friends from around the world. It was exciting.
But this is NUSWhispers, so I'm not here to tell you about the good stuff. I'm here to tell you about what it's changed in my views.

I found out quickly that I was the oldest among my peers and the other exchange students. That in itself is not a problem. The problem is, many of them are not only finishing their Masters, but also setting up businesses on the side, going to meetings with VCs, talking about picking up a second degree soon. The people I met there are generally 23 to 24 years old. I'm 25 and just finishing my 3rd year (this was summer 2015). Do you see the problem here yet? Even though I had fun, I also felt massively inferior the whole time. We like to think that NUS is 'top in Asia' or whatever, but this hardly registers a blink on their radar. The amount of things they did is immensely impressive. This is not limited to the American students, by the way. The Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican students too. I could tell you all about it, but that would be pages and pages of text and I know nobody has the attention span. It was a very humbling experience.

Towards the end of the exchange I began to think. I used to think that NS was a proud thing to do. But my views have changed. I now think it is a massive liability to the competitiveness of our young men. NS takes away 2 very important years in our lives. Those are the years where our interests in topics begin to solidify for life, and we spend them doing meaningless things we hate while confined to prisons. Sure, you can show me some outliers, but they are just that: outliers. On the other hand, hyper-performing students are the norm there. They are intensely passionate and put every hour of their lives into their area of study (aside from the ones spent showing the exchange students around).

I was given the option of deferring my NS and going overseas to study. I disliked the idea of being a financial liability, plus the mountainous paperwork and interviews I had to do, so I declined. Now I look back and berate myself in the past for not doing so. I may not be starting businesses (that's not my interest), but at least I can be doing my thinking and research while in my bunk, resuming NS after I return. That is too late now, though. Hindsight is always 20/20. Now I am an old man in a young people's world, at 25.

 - Age is but a number. I'm a recent female grad and I'm currently 24 with barely 1 year of work experience. This sounds normal, but in India, where my parents are from, everyone graduates at 22 (because they start primary 1 as early as 5 or 6). Now I want to go on to grad school next, but everyone keeps telling me I'm getting old so I should get married soon and whatnot. 

I don't want to comment about NS or other specific reasons for an age difference. My point is, there's always going to be someone younger or older, doing something more interesting or boring. Each person's journey is unique, with unique advantages and challenges. While easier said than done, it's up to you to find inspiration and motivation on your own path.

I am aware that grade improvements due to result-review applications are extremely hard to come by, but does anybody know of any instances, at all, of successful result-review applications? Successful as in got positive net change in grades. Anybody?

I read on NUSWhispers recently a lot of CAP-related posts, especially from freshies, asking whether to s/u certain modules of certain grades or if it is possible to achieve a First Class Honours at the end of four years with a first semester grade of xxx. As a year 6 going to year 7 (in other words I graduated 2 years ago), I would like to share some personal experiences which I hope can be helpful for our eager juniors and freshies out there. 

Fresh out of NS, like many guys, I was completely overwhelmed by the academic demands in uni life during my first year in FoS. My CAP for the first year (2nd semester) was then 3.8 - 3.9. I did not score anything above B+. Getting first class honours wasn't already in my mind then. I thought it will probably be unachievable. However as I proceed to year 2, I realise I am able to perform better with better grasp of the courses' demands. I even took the plunge to pursue a minor in another faculty (FASS) with zero prior knowledge of the subject in my sec sch and jc days, just because I am interested. Fast forward to my year 4 sem 1, my CAP improved to 4.4x, where the grades of my last semester was essentially crucial to determine if I achieve FCH. Alas, I did well enough for my final semester, especially with the help of 16MC FYP which I scored A, i managed to barely push across the border with 4.5x CAP, a FCH which I did not even dare to dream of at the end of my first year.

So boys and girls, achieving a first class honours is not impossible even with a starting CAP at the second lower honours range. While I do recognise however that a little bit of luck is also essential, my climbing from second lower to FCH doesn't come without hard work, persistence and determination. Quote a mural painted at the basketball court of my junior college "The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in determination". 

Do remember, however, that getting a FCH at the end of your 4 years or not is not the only purpose in NUS. There are more than grades you can and should strive to achieve in these 4 years. Join a CCA or two, go for exchange programmes, meet new people and make new friends, make full use of your 4 years for once its over, you can't have it back. Hence, I wish all of you juniors and freshies all the best in your academic pursuit in NUS.

To the freshies out there still feeling confused about that advice regarding how s/u-ing your mods can cause "fluctuations", don't listen to this "fluctuations" nonsense. It's extremely horrible advice that shouldn't have appeared in the first place. In general, just follow this rule and you will be safe. 

If you are aiming for FCH (cap 4.5>=) , s/u anything that's B+ or below. If aiming for 2nd Upper, technically you should s/u anything that's B or below. But if you are aiming for a cap above 4.0, you should also s/u any B+ and below. You get the idea. 

These "fluctuation" nonsense only happens during your 4 years in NUS, when you see your results at the end of every semester. These "fluctuations" in your cap has no effect on your final cumulative cap at the end of your 4 years. It is merely the process towards your final cap that sort of "fluctuates". If you keep those less-than-expected grades just because you don't want your grades to fluctuate over the 4 years, you are going to regret it at the end. A bad grade that's below the class of honors you want, will ultimately pull you down if you don't s/u it. 

The only thing you should worry about is whether you are overestimating yourself right now. For example, let's say you believe you can get FCH in the future and decided to s/u away all your B+ and below during your first year. However in year3, you realise that you are actually struggling to keep a 2nd Lower. Now those B+'s that you s/u'd away in your first year would have actually helped you in this situation if you have kept them instead. 

Ultimately, understand your own abilities, your goals and your own determination to reach them. After that, decide what grades will help you towards your goal, and what grades don't help you at all and should be s/u'd. 

Merry Christmas and all the best for your future results.

There is an advantage of being a C-Student. He/she is not afraid to getting bad grades. It's like a fireman who was burned early in his career. You get antifragile from these burns if you survived.

Engineering students here. This sem was particularly bad. My CAP are bad and I should feel bad. Actually, I do feel bad... Haizz, I feel that this course is a little too hard for me but it's just too late for me to switch. What do I do? 
-
 
Freshie looking for advice here! It is worth S/U-ing a B+ so that my CAP will improve from 4.5 to 4.67? I'm aiming for first class and was told a B+ will pull down my CAP in the long run if I want a First class. is the 0.17 increase in CAP worth it and advisable? How now brown cow? Tyvvm!

I almost bursted into joyful tears when I know that I got a B+ for German 5.
As a student who has never been to Germany before and got the module through the placement test, I really struggled through the module. Sometimes I even thought I would fail (wenn ich viele Fehler gemacht hatte).
The only thing to carry me on was love for the language and Germany the country! All classmates are very helpful and the teachers Frau Finner and Frau Verry are absolutely amazing. 
Just want to thank everyone who maked the impossible possible!

NUS is getting more and more ridiculous. All the S/U policies are ruining our university curriculum. They should seriously reflect on their policies before rolling em out and clarify with the students so that there will not be any misinterpretation. I was shocked and surprised that NUS made it into the "top" list in asia even though the system is screwed up. Just the government spamming loads of money on it.

Seriously, why can't we have a tertiary education that is as good as the foreign universities........ leaves me pondering...... pretty sad to be a sgrean......

Hi everyone, hope results day hasn't had too many casualties thus far. 
Just a quick question about the Online Degree Requirement Check. I wanted to find out exactly what its meant to do. 
I'm from Engineering and the link provided to us on our website doesn't work and it hasn't been working since last year (when I matriculated), so I have no idea what this webpage looks like or what it is for. 
Can anybody tell me anything about it? I haven't emailed any department office or anything since I want to find out more first. 

Thanks and Happy Holidays (especially to the admins who are still working despite it being vacation time) !

Hello, I'm a student from SoC. If i was already awarded a module from MPE, is it confirmed to be mine regardless of my grades? I am asking this because of the module CS2020. I understand that there is a prerequisite of A-, but I was already pre-allocated this module through MPE. Does this mean I still get to keep this module regardless of my grades when it comes out?

FASS yr 1 here. I'd tried planning my timetable for the upcoming semester. It's tough trying to compromise so that the lessons/finals do not clash. 

Would like to ask seniors out there, is it advisable to take 3 lectures in a day, from 10-12pm,12-2pm,2-4pm? (3 days week)
They're a GE mod, and 2 lvl 2000 mods from different fields.
Although they're in the same place (Arts faculty), I'm worried I would not find time for meals, and it gets distressing as my stomach produces audible alarms even when I go for a 10-12pm lecture with an empty stomach. 

Another option I have would be to take on 3 exams on consecutive days. (4 days week) Although I'm consistent with revision throughout the sem, there's a higher risk of mental exhaustion.

If it were you, which would you take?
I'm still trying to choose majors, (level 2000 research modules and interested topics for social sciences) clearing some GEs, so most of the mods are not similar in content. 

-
 
I keep telling myself, if I'm not in NUS where would I rather be. Since I wanted a degree that is recognizable overseas and prepare myself for the job market, I did it. I have to keep telling myself over and over that even if my grades were better, I wouldn't be as prepared for future work as well as NUS if I did the degree overseas. But I have to keep telling myself this over and over again. Being logical and all, I wanted an applicable degree, yeah I got it. I got it.

I know this might be a silly question. But I just want to re-confirm with you guys.
I feel like there are some courses that are very interesting to take. Is it ok to take extra credits in NUS? Thanks.

I'm sorry if this sounds really stupid, but I'm slightly confused and it doesn't help that I literally have 0 friends.. So, I'm from FASS and I couldn't declare my second major during the MDE.

Hi everyone. I have a question regarding student exchange. I am going for an exchange to Japan next year starting September. The issue is that the exams only end early February, which means that semester 2 in NUS will already have started. Has anyone faced this issue before? I would love to hear your experience. Thanks a lot!

Don't know why my post got filtered off but I'm gonna try again. I need some advice for SEP. I've been offered a school where I can only read mods from my major. Is it advisable for me to take 5 mods worth of level 3000 mods? Or how many should I take? And does it mean I will have to overload before I go/when I get back? Please don't filter I'm really confused!!! Thank u in advance for the responses!

After my first year as a science major, I am not sure if I can find a job with only a bachelor's degree. Science is my only choice as no other faculties accepted me. I am not the "You must do it for passion" type of person, I just want to survive because I am from a very poor family and studying in NUS offers me a chance of a better future for me and family.

I know that in order to be given a research position, in other words actually making the study of science worthwhile, one must have a PhD, but I don't think I can achieve this aspiration as my academic aptitude is only average. There's this joke my friend told me that science graduates will end up washing and preparing test tubes for the researchers. Most will become teachers. And some will work in government bodies, doing unrelated work.

Is it possible for somebody with only a bachelor's to work in a scientific research corporation, and rise up the ladders?  I really don't wish to waste my time and money studying an esoteric subject (it really is) which I will be doing a job that doesn't even require the hard science knowledge and training. Thanks much.

To 

Just my personal situation. It might be a different case for you since my family was never too particular about money; my parents trust that we won't spend unnecessarily, and I see myself as a saver and not spender.

Few months back, my brother was contemplating between doing an internship in Singapore or overseas. Cost was an issue to him. Having went on exchange in my uni days (although all I did was play), I thought an overseas exposure would be interesting for him. My parents paid for my Europe exchange when I was in uni, and I had a great 4 months of my life. I told him just go and feel free to go travel during weekends, I would sponsor him foc 10k and more if required. He was very happy about it, and told me he would pay me back the cash next time.  

If you can afford it and your brother is not an un-driven prick who intends to slack for the rest of his life, why don't you lend a helping hand? 

Side note: 
1. He recently spent a few hundred bucks on a Mont Blanc, while I am using my 4 years old wallet that cost me $30. :'(
2. He can be a prick at times, and likes to lord over me as if he is a king. Tsk.
2. Average family living in an average flat, and my dad is working as a cab driver

well, regarding the whole major and job prospects issue -

i'm one of those people who kinda chose something more practical over my passion. and it's not as if i hate my major, i don't. it's just that i don't love it. over the years, i've even found an appreciation for it. still, i don't love it. of course i understand all the arguments for choosing passion over practicality as put forth by the previous OPs. but kinda just want to say, sometimes, it's not that easy, especially when it concerns you, and your future, and that fear and uncertainty of the future might drive you to choose something you deem to be safer. 

i'm not making any excuses for my decision. i'm bearing the consequences now, and am also thinking of further studies in my area of passion in the future. but i'm just saying, sometimes, at least for me, it's just easier to go for something that is less uncertain. human nature, perhaps.

 appeared on my newsfeed and I would like to add my two cents worth on PSLE. I really have no idea why the public are so angry about PSLE saying that MOE is making it stressful, when in truth, I think parents and society are the ones who are making it stressful. I guess it's easier to blame it on an organization (or the government, which is always an easy target) than to admit to yourself that you are the cause of your child's stress and competitiveness.

I say this from an educator's perspective after having interacted with my own students and my friends from NUS - personally I don't think PSLE counts for much. During my time in NUS, a lot of my friends who were doing well in different faculties were often from the non-elite secondary schools and JCs, or polytechnics. So I often tell my students not to overly stress themselves out for national exams as long as they know they have done their best. Different people have different strengths so why let exam results define you if you have already given your all? It worries me that if they are already so stressed from national exams, how they will cope in the future with more important things like their jobs and families? Who makes them stressed? At least from what I've seen, it's usually not the schools. Of course there may be exceptions, but I think it's safe to say that the majority of us educators are actually concerned that our kids are too stressed from such exams.

So really take a step back and reflect before you jump on the bandwagon to blame MOE and the government for everything that goes wrong. I guess I am prepared to have people flame me or say I'm PAP IB or whatever, but I hope that at least the majority of people reading will try to think about the bigger picture.

Can any seniors advice if i should do FYP or 3 level 4000 mods? What are the pros and cons of each? My CAP isn't that good (around 3.8) so i'm not sure if i should take on FYP. But on the other hand i kinda like research too so I'm considering giving it a shot. Also, is FYP easier to score compared to 3 4k mods?

This is a little long. It's just what I feel about all this recent talk about the PSLE exam.

The PSLE is stressful because it is brutally meritocratic. Everyone takes the same examination, and everyone is given a T-score, which is accurate to many decimal places. It does not matter who your parents are, what house you live in (HDB, Condo, Landed), or which primary school you attend. We all open the question paper and stop writing at the same time, without referring to any special notes or “cheat-sheets” during the course of the examination. 

The primary school we attend is largely dependent on where we live and on the school our parents (or siblings) attended. Those who are affluent enough to live in Bukit Timah have a higher chance of getting into Nanyang Primary School. On the other hand, the secondary school we attend is largely dependent on how well we do in the PSLE. Perhaps there is a correlation between our family background and our performance. Students from privileged backgrounds attend expensive tuition classes that seem to improve performance. However, these students ultimately have demonstrate their mastery of concepts in the 1-2 hour exam paper. 

Short of banning tuition centres altogether, and finding a way to remove the advantages of having highly educated parents, I am not sure how we can bridge the performance gap between privileged and less-privileged students. I am quite sure, however, that removing the PSLE or delaying it is not the solution. If we were to delay the PSLE to the age of 16, how would we allocate students to secondary schools? Do we attend the school that is closest to our house, or one that our parents attended? Who then would get to attend “top” schools like RI or Nanyang Girls High? In his recent founder's day speech, RI's principal already lamented about how RI is becoming a “middle-class school” that is becoming “insular - a school unto (themselves)". What would become of RI if students were admitted by affiliation instead?

Perhaps we can still assess students by merit, but in a more “holistic” way. We might not need to give students a highly differentiated T-score. We can give them an alphabetical grade and use it to assess them, together with their Co-curricular achievements and the challenges they have overcome. This already happens, in some way, through the DSA process. We might reap benefits from assessing more students “holistically”, but we will also make the process a lot less transparent. 12 year olds can understand why their friend got into Nanyang Girls High with a score of 268, while they didn't with a score of 256. But will they be able to accept why their friend got admitted with 2A* and 2As, while they didn't even though they got 3A* and 1A? Many high school students in the US have difficulty grappling with the, rather opaque and unpredictable, “holistic” college admission process. Are we prepared, as a society, to extend this to 12 year old children?

The Singapore government has come up with many novel ideas, like the sample-count in the recent general elections. Maybe they can find a way to make this “holistic” admission process work, perhaps by setting a transparent quota (eg 70% of students will get admitted for their grades, while 30% will get admitted for their other admirable characteristics) for admissions. But this could also spark a debate as to which qualities and achievements are more admirable. 

I think the real reason the PSLE is stressful is not because of the way it is designed but because of the way we view it. Like it or not, as of now, the school we attend matters, and the stream we attend matters too. We are a brutally meritocratic society, and as much as we might deny it, many of us still believe our performance in the PSLE has some bearing on the path we will take in life.

As much as we might be sceptical about it, Mr Heng Swee Keat did a great thing by trying to get Singaporeans to accept the idea that every school is a good school. The day we as a society can truly accept that grades are not everything, and that there are many paths to success, is the day that the PSLE and all other exams will become a lot less stressful. But until then, while the PSLE can be tweaked slightly, perhaps it should stay – because it seems to be the best solution we have.

Hi Students, seeking your opinion. I am given a 8am class to teach next semester for the first time, how can I encourage students to come for my lectures? My senior colleagues say don't allow webcast/ give graded mini quiz at 8am (Duke-NUS does that)/ start class later, say 8.15am/ etc. One has a point: although it's excruciating at times to wake up so early, it gives respect and confidence to the Professor teaching the lecture. What would make you attend a 8am lecture religiously?

Is it advisable to do a sociology and philosophy double major? What are the job prospects? I set out wanting to do psychology because of how people around were telling me it was more 'practical' and safe but I really do not enjoy it that much.. I'm lost.

Our times 我们的少女时代 is too overrated. To be fair, it was quite a good movie but the hype generated is just too much. My whole news feed was flooded with various posts related to it and some of my friends even reposted more than 10 videos related to it. And it has been 3 weeks(?) since the movie was released. 那些年 and 等一个人咖啡 is just as good as our times but they didn't receive as much attention. Well all i can say is. just because you met the love of your life in school, doesn't mean that it is the best movie in the world.

So.. My family changed our domestic helper today. After almost 2 years. My mother had threatened to send her back and all but she never learn. She does not clean the house well and is super lazy but my family kept her because she is young and have a sad family background. I should not feel bad because the previous helper was not doing her job despite us giving her many chances over the past 2 years. We did not tell her of her employment termination until this morning, only giving her time to pack before sending her back to her agent. I should not feel bad seeing that she did not manage to help tidy the house etc but I just do... :(

I need to do plagiarism check for my thesis paper and is it true that we can't use Turnitin if it's not for a module? I can't find an upload button and seems like I have to click on a class enrolled in order to submit a paper for plagiarism check /: How does everyone else do plagiarism check? Just use random free checkers is it?

I really like my lab tutor for one of my mods. We've interacted quite a few times during lab and I hope to know him better. (Anyway, he is a undergrad tutor.) But how do I do that, since we have no modes of contact except the nus email?

A third-year student here. I'm planning my studies in the following three semesters and I have around 15 modules left (don't ask me why I still have so many), however I still want to take more modules for the sake of interest. I'm feeling a bit stressed, so I'm thinking about delaying my graduation for one semester so that I have more time and therefore less stress. Anybody has done this before? Can give me some advice? *cry cry*

I just need to get this off my chest. 

I am a NUS masters student who stayed for masters simply because my bachelor's CAP is not good enough to directly apply for PhD. I was aiming for good schools in the US and have spent over $1k for GRE and application fees, if we don't count my current school fees into this investment. I tried to maintain an enthu mood so that I could spin out a more positive statement of purpose. However, now that I have clicked submit on the application, i am suddenly overcome by this wave of sadness...a sadness that tells me to wake up and stop dreaming...because I will never get in anyway...

Year 1 freshie here needing some advice. I'm trying to plan my modules for next semester, but i can't decide whether to do a module that i don't really like with my friends, or do a module that i have interest  in alone. Are there any pros and cons of doing a mod alone? Or is it better to do with friends? Im afriad that if i sit alone in lecture ppl may view me as a loner. On the other hand doing a module i don't really like may cause my cap to drop.  Seniors what do you think?

Anyone knows how to be involved in Open Day without going through the nus ambassador interview? Missed the interview slot because of exams, but I heard from some friends that the positions available are not very interesting.

Hi, a confused freshie here. Can anyone please give me some advice on the international summer internship programmes available through the IRO?

Hi! Year 1 here, needing some advice for elective mods :P (admin please don't filter ^^)

Me and my friend are considering taking 'A Brief History of Science' (GEH1018), 'The Biophysical Env of S'pore' (GES1004) and 'Public Health in Action' (GEH1049). 

To anyone who has taken any of the above mods, could you share your experience with it? ^^ For instance, (1) what the assessment modes are like (2) how long we are given typically to complete assignments (3) the amt of readings to do (4) any projects (and how frequent it is e.g. every week one project)

I understand the assessment modes can be found on IVLE, but just wanted to confirm that the info on IVLE is up to date :).

For GES1004, what are map exercises like? Sorry to ask such a seemingly trivial question, but I didn't take Geog in upper Secondary and JC and Google didn't really enlighten me :/ Anyone with little background in Geog who took this module, please share your experience with it as it will really help me to make an informed decision ^^

Thanks for your time and appreciate your advice! :)

Tl;dr: Just need advice for GEH1018, GES1004 and GEH1049 :)

Well, having just ended the finals, here are some of my personal comments about the exams (whether you guys like it or not, it wont affect my choice of post). 

1. After putting in so much effort, questions that appear in the exam seems disappointingly trivial.... (Cmon.. you profs should have set harder questions, after all, we need to distinguish the intellectually rich ones from the dense ones isnt it?Whats the use of a bell curve if exams were trivial?(ಠ_ಠ)

2. YO! Poor organization of questions stifles creativity.Questions shouldnt be recycled, neither should it be similar to the ones in past year papers nor tutorials. We need to train our brain to think and nurture minds of the future (We are humans not regurgitating robots         [-c°▥°]-c)

3. People who complain that the exams are not conventional.... Please wake up your idea... Yes I agree that change can be unfavourable, but please take it as a challenge. Without challenge, how can one improve himself, thus surmounting greater difficulties and fufill greater ambitions? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) V

4. To those who have done alot of practice questions, be it from hundred or thousand year series.... (And yet stumble upon seeing the questions)Ask yourself whether practice helps in the first place when are lacking the idea and simplicity for solving questions.

5.People who have wondered why they cant beat their peers in terms of results. Ask yourself whether you have that creativity in your peers?ᕗᕙ༼o-ل͜-o

6.Last but not least, to the freshies who  just had their first round of exams and think that you can get an A+ just because you think that other people cant do the questions that you can do, you might haha at how much you getrolled by your own results on the day it is released. (Just reinforcing the earlier post)

Well.... I have come to the end of my post. Accept it, or take it with a pinch of salt... Up to you.

Now that this is the post exam period, i would like to reflect on things that allowed me to see the best and the worst sides of some profs this semester. I will start off with the best i saw of my prof this sem.

1) There's this prof, let's call him A, whom i heard about during my summer internship. I have this colleague who claimed that prof A is over-demanding and "does not treat his lab people very nicely". Well i did not probe further since i don't know prof A at that time. This semester i happened to take a module in which prof A was teaching and of course i was reminded of the comments made by that colleague and was a bit intimidated by prof A, whom i thought look fierce. Come the mid terms, i studied this module really last minute as i had an important lab report deadline to rush for. Thus i ended up with last minute qns which i emailed Prof A only at 1 am on the day of test, expecting him to not reply since it's so last minute. But he did, during the early morning, just in time for me to read through his reply as i travel to school for the test. Further into the semester, i find this module more and more interesting so i also ended up asking Prof A more and more qns over emails as i wish to know more. He replied to all of them too. Finally for my finals preparation, i decided to try out some qns in the recommended textbook as i felt that this module is concept based and practice would make perfect. This was the time that i really spammed his emails, with 10 emails consisting of around 50 qns over 2 days. I thought that even if he reply, he is likely to miss out some of my emails/qns since there's way too many. Guess what, he still answered to each and every qns i asked in these 10 emails, with very clear and detailed answers. I am indeed very grateful that prof A answered to every single qns i asked over emails throughout the semester, (despite the textbook qns being something extra only) and i am glad i did not hold myself back from asking prof A qns just because i heard someone talked bad about him. Probably that colleague may have done something wrong which annoys prof A and led him to judge the prof in a negative light....

2) there is this prof, let's call him Z, who really annoys me to the max. Firstly, a few days before the mid terms, i emailed him 3 qns to clarify about in the lecture notes. He did not reply so i assume he's really busy. Then during our very last lecture of this module, he encouraged us to email him more and feel free to ask him any qns we may have after revision. He even said that he hadn't seen emails from any of us except 1 student so he kept urging us to email him if we need to. During the reading week, i finished my revision and had 10 qns from his lecture notes plus 4 extra qns from past year papers that i had done. Guess what, he replied to NONE of those qns! I thought he probably forgot, so i sent him a reminder, but still no reply! It's not like i ask him extra qns, like i did for prof A... What's 14 qns compared to the more than 60 qns i asked prof A over the semester? Simply cannot understand why got such profs who don't bother replying even during reading week and some clarifications from his own lecture notes... please don't say google because i usually google first before i decide what qns to ask the profs. I always thought prof Z was ok, since he encouraged us to ask him qns during his last lecture. Perhaps he is just nice in front of us, but once he don't see us, he don't see the need to keep to his words.

Of course, there are also other profs who are also very nice. There was this prof who agreed to meet me to discuss any extra qns i did (be it from the recommended textbooks or from online sources). He prefers to discuss face to face rather than over emails. When i met him, i can tell that he was very ill as he kept coughing. Despite that, he spent 1h 40 mins to go through all the extra qns i did (as for the lecture notes qns, he answered them over emails way earlier already). 

My uni life so far had allowed me to see how committed some prof can be in terms of teaching, helping us despite being busy themselves. It had also allowed me to see how hypocritical some profs can be, such as those not replying even once or simply finding excuses not to help. I understand that profs are busy people but at the very least, they should reply at least once, especially during reading week whereby students would have some last qns after revising everything.

Do you all have similar encounters like mine? Would like to hear more from you all and thanks for reading this post:)

I want to do something significant in my life. But I know alot of people think I don't have the intelligence to do great work. "If you are good, you should be in Harvard already." "You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance." I reject the idea that life is like a lottery ticket.

To the OP of  and those others who are thinking about studying Japanese at NUS,

Please give it a shot if you're serious about building a proficiency in the language. I know there are concerns about the insane workload and the number of contact hours per week, but the Japanese language education offered at NUS is top-notch. I will go so far as to say that I received better education at NUS than at some (prestigious) Japanese university I was exchanging at this summer. I will also say that it's the best education you can receive here in Singapore. If you really wanna be able to *speak* the language well, especially, I really recommend doing it at NUS. You'll have all the practice you need to be able to hold a proper conversation. The lecturers and tutors are very dedicated and they work hard to arrange all kinds of activities to train their students in speaking (and of course in reading, writing, listening, and whatnot).

That said, CAP and workload are definitely huge concerns. But hey, previous batches of students have handled 7 contact hours per week and managed the workload on top of their other academic commitments. There's no reason why current and future batches of students can't, especially now that the contact hours have been reduced to 6 a week.

Other than the quality education, you'll also get to meet people from across different faculties so you'll get to make a lot of new friends. I got to know most of my NUS friends through the Japanese courses I've taken here. (By the way, I have done nearly all the Japanese language modules offered at NUS.)

Thanks to my teachers, I have been able to survive on my own in Japan without much difficulty. I have done a lot with the Japanese I picked up here. I have gone on summer exchange in Japanese universities, done an internship with a Japanese company, and I have three homestay families with whom I keep in close, regular contact. I have also done a bit of translation and interpretation as part-time jobs. Looking back, I can't help but feel that all these wonderful experiences wouldn't have been available to me had I not had the courage to pursue Japanese at NUS.

There's going to be a potluck party held this Sunday at Yale-NUS. The Japanese language staff and some senior students will be there to tell newbies more about Japanese at NUS! Do drop by if you have time! There'll food, fun, and games!!

"Ex-NTU prof Cherian George administered the greatest university exam ever with free cookies, Internet access

Highly forward-thinking, Hong Kong-based former Nanyang Technological University professor Cherian George has just administered the best exam for university students ever.

He conducted an open book exam with little rules that allowed his students to not only use the Internet to source for answers, but even ask course mates for help."

This is stupid. Lucky NUS professors are more conformists.
-
 
In response to , having an open book exam does not necessarily mean that students will offer more critical or original answers (this was Professor Cherian's objective.). Let me illustrate using the situation in my faculty. In my faculty, almost all except two or three exams are open book. 

However, students still rehash answers given by their professors or, more commonly, the viewpoints found in their senior's/friend's notes. Students do so because it is the most convenient way to answer and rehashing answers is, in itself, not conceptually wrong. Further, the bell curve protects students. If many students rehash answers, a professor cannot fail or give students a low grade. 

Another problem with open book exams is that the exam itself becomes a test of writing/typing speed and a test of who spotted the questions and prepared better answers to copy onto their answer scripts. This is particularly so if the exam question is an essay, and the professor dropped hints about the exam. In one such module in my faculty, the professor gave a clear hint, and many students turned up on the day of the exam with some sort of prepared answer ready to be copied into the exam script.

Hello I'd like to get some advise about taking language mods. 
I really want to learn Japanese, but the workload seems pretty heavy, and the number of lecture and tutorial hours are so long and I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it or neglect my other mods. Anyone who took Japanese 1 can enlighten me on how it's really like and your take on this? 
Thanks :)

Need some advice here. I'm a year 3 computing student and I'm considering extending my stay in NUS by 1 more sem, simply because I want to do extra modules, which are not required for graduation. Got a few questions though...

1. Is this practical/common/advisable? 
2. Do the extra modules count towards CAP?  
3. Is there a lot of admin stuff to be done?
4. Any other things i should be aware of?

SMH at people who use signing on/ being a regular as a derogatory term.. 

"Eh you dono what to do with life ah"
"Your results so cui cannot study ah"
"No future ah"
"Why so stupid sign on"
"When in doubt, sign on"

This isn't 1965 anymore, it's actually quite difficult to successfully pass out as a regular. Stop looking down on us ffs. *gasp* a uni grad as a regular? No way!

While my fellow peers are gaining knowledge from the modules through all these exams, I can safely say that I've gained a good understanding of where the MPSHs are and their exact locations. - A lost year 1 student :(

Finally had time to settle down after my last paper yesterday. Everything had been well for me this semester. Except one. 

Just want to say that can the so-called 'leaders' lead by example by first...completing their assignments, especially group projects. It is unfortunate that I had to work with a particular director from a faculty club ( nearest to NUH) and he put in minimal effort and even went MIA. Such irresponsibility.

After taking an exam paper, now I can't remember whether I have written down my matric number. If the number is missing, will my script be deemed invalid and marked 0? Or will there be any other consequences?

Not a confession, but i would like to get some insights from Math seniors here. I've gotten a spot to read Applied Math next year and considering to specialise in Financial Mathematics. However, I often question myself on the practicality of the specialisation, because the degree isnt as focused on how finance and the economy works as compared to the Business degree with specialisation in finance. Would this put Math grads who want to enter the finance sector at a disadvantage?

Does NUSWhispers have Turnitin to ensure that whispers submitted aren't plagiarised? Why am I seeing past-year whispers? Or is it just people who are repeating identical experiences?

Is it my fault that I find that I have not learned much from the modules that I took? I feel that I have not grok the materials properly.

Most lecturers are concerned with tests/quizzes/exams/assignments etc. It's like a game of hypocrisy. 'So getting A, I assume that I understand what I am learning'

What if I tell you there is a 50/50 chance that your grade will be A or your grade will not be A and your checking of the grade will determine whether it is 100% A or 100% not A. As long as you don't check your grade, the existence of the grade getting A will remain 50/50.

Thank god the finals is gonna end tomorrow for me, because it has certainly taken a toll on my sleep cycle. Previously, I tend to start playing dota around 10pm and sleep at around 2am. But due to the finals, I now study from noon till 12am and play dota till 5am, which leads to me waking up at 2pm the next day. #worklifebalance 

Anyway to sidetrack, on why I play dota so much. I play it because I personally find it really stimulating to the mind to understand your opponent's matchup and the high dependency of teammates in solo ranked matchmaking. Many times, the victories are decided at the picking phase and the early game phase where having a good team morale is crucial and this has given me opportunities to play as the mediator in the team to manage players (of a certain country I shall not name) who tend to be unreasonable and "cancerous". In my opinion, for those who are looking to increase your solo mmr rating, focus not solely on the technical aspects of the game, but on your interpersonal skills as well. If your teammate makes a mistake or loses a lane, getting all upset and flaming him won't help him play better, instead be encouraging and understand that everyone makes mistakes. A happy team wins game.

After my first semester, all I can say is that this fact is true. Took an FASS module, and totally different. Sigh... #disappointedYetExpected

Sometimes, I question the teaching abilities of some professors in NUS.
They might be brilliant researchers (and thats probably why nus hired them in the first place), but they cant teach for shit.

For example, during this sem, I have one such lecturer for some level 4000 module. The module content is quite dry due to many technical information. And this lecturer made it so much worse by delivering lessons in a monotonous voice and he always stands very stiffly, the only things he move are his mouth and forearms (yeah he doesnt move his upper arms, so his elbows are like stuck to his body).
And he speaks with a slur, which requires all the effort my ears can give to identify every word he speaks.

So yeah, it was torturous trying to keep my attention on him. The lecture notes can be used as waste paper imo, theres little to no explanations to stuff introduced, only definitions and some short examples (which skips steps without explanations so it seems like magic).

He successfully made me lose 100% interest in the subject and de-inspired me. 

Till now, I have no shit about how I can use what Ive learnt in the module in practical applications. Now that the semester is over, I felt that I have learnt nothing useful from this module and kinda regretting not dropping it before recess week.

I like my course, but whenever I go for his lessons, I will start questioning myself whether I picked the right course. But that is only for this module, other modules with better professors make me like my course again (thankfully).

PS. I will be extremely happy if I can give get a C in this module (the passing grade is D amiright?

I met this guy in my tut a few weeks back. He started talking to me and asked me out after exams. Should I go out with him? He always start the conversation and asked me if I am attached. Is he interested in me?

I'm an average sized guy with a belly . I can suck in and make my tummy look flat but when I sit down it's like layers of spare types . 
Problem is I tend to eat alot as I get hungry easily . When I was in poly I try to minimize the spending by adding rice , like a lot of rice . 
Ever since ord it got worse as I tend to eat even more . If I don't eat as much I get really hungry . But I don't think it's healthy with all these carbs . The 菜饭 auntie at engg canteen already know me as " 饭桶 “ d .

Does anyone have similar experience and had found an alternative food type? would really appreciate it .

Never take more than 1 final exam in a day.
Never have consecutive days of exams.

So the holidays are here, or almost here for some of you. Just some tips to outsmart recruitment agencies, if youre planning to engage them (RecruitExpress in particular, theyre p manipulative)

1) Online job ads are mostly designed to bait you. Suppose you only have 1 month to spare and you're looking for a admin position. Don't be fooled by an ad which says "1-3 months temp admin assistant". When you reach them, they will bullshit an excuse like "actually our jobs are subject to availability". Then the following two scenarios may happen:

a) They will bait you to their office for an "interview". Following which they claim they actually don't have 1 month admin jobs, and recommend some shitty jobs which have been lying in their inventory for ages because no one wants them. And they will make it difficult and awkward for you to say no and leave the office.

b) They will tell you to await their call. Miraculously they found the jobs you wanted and say they will send their resume over to the company for their consideration. It will happen 3 or 4 times over the course of the week. Then one day they will call and offer you a shitty job which no one wants. You ask about the previously offered jobs. They will claim that the prospective employers did not get back to your resume, so you're most likely rejected. Then they will push that unwanted job to you, interrogating you as to why you wouldn't want that job. If the persuasion fails, they will say ok, we'll find another job for you, and puts down the phone. They'll never get back to you after that.

2) Do not use the words "probably", "i guess", "i'm fine with that but i'd generally prefer..." etc etc. They will twist your words and you'll end up with the short end of the stick. Always be firm. If they ask if you're okay with some other kind of job, just say "no" if you'd rather not. Dont yield to their constant interoggation.

3) If you can only work for 1 month, you are seen as a diposable. They recruitment agents will give their best deals to candidates who can work for 3 months or more, because they can't afford to lose them at all costs. So if you're looking for a comfortable job, it's best to engage employers directly if you know they're hiring.

ST2132 is a module created from the very depths of hell itself, a pure maths module in disguise to slaughter students like me who blindly punch numbers into formulas.
Jia You Everyone! (And to the senior who said 2132 will be easier than 2131, I hope you find yourself wherever this 2132 came from!)

Totally random but is it a preferred practice to refer to a course by its module code rather than its (abbreviated or otherwise) title? Sometimes even the faculty members do so. Hahaha it's really strange! Always takes me a while to figure out which course someone is talking about when they just say a number, as opposed to a subject or topic! :/

Any undergrads who took mother tongue syllabus B and can help a junior here? I'm currently applying for uni but I have no idea how to record down my grades, I'm getting conflicting info like some people say to put it as exempted, while some say to put it under H1 subject. To further add to the confusion the transcript itself says "Not an O / A level subject" which further adds to the confusion! So I'd appreciate it if one of you could help me out, thank you very much! xoxo

 and anyone else concerned by 'W' grades: Am year 4, applied for the public service, Temasek and GIC and none asked me about my 'W' grades on my transcript during interviews. So yeah.

Don't worry about saving yourself by withdrawing. It's nothing bad and at most makes for a good talking point in interviews.

You know how people are just born with the mind of a leader, while some just aren't? Well I definitely wasn't, although I always liked to contribute to a group effort. Often, my initiative gets mistaken for good leadership skills and as a result I pretty much half-arsed everything I attempted to lead in. 

Starting off as a CCA leader in secondary school, then JC. Even in during NS I really just wanted to be on good terms with everyone, genuinely concerned about the welfare of my fellow platoon and section mates. But that turned out pretty bad because everybody just thought I wanted to wayang. They thought it for a long time until I revealed that during my EI I actually expressed no interest in command school. My specs started trying to psycho me to consider it, but I knew that I would probably fuck up again just like in previous leadership posts. I did not have the courage to tell this to anyone and often succumbed to peer pressure easily. 

True enough, I entered spec school and became a combat sergeant. It was shit because I actually enjoy helping my friends and juniors whenever they need help, but not when I'm in a leadership role. I really screwed up so badly to the extent that I often got voluntarily dropped from conducting mini lessons on combat knowledge to my unit recruits. It was really crushing on my self-esteem. 

I ORD-ed and the thoughts of my previous failures haunted me. When I entered university I constantly reminded myself not to accept any leadership appointments. But of course, being interested and curious about my CCA, the Seniors as usual mistook it and persuaded me to join the exco and then executed their secret plan to make me the new incoming head.

When I found out I was terrified as heck. The scars from previous humiliations hadn't recovered, and they never go away. Even to this day, years after I have left, my inability to lead people, inability to effectively communicate to my seniors and juniors still come back to me. All the guilt I feel towards my seniors and juniors and peers whom I've let down still stick with me. 

Through all these experiences I always had great inspirations to look up to - my predecessors from generations before. It was always me who was the embarrassment of a successor. I had always used their models and visions personally while in position but lacked the finesse and aptitude to carry it out. 

Perhaps, some things in life can be nurtured as time passes and people gain experience. But I know for sure that my passion for something would always be killed by my inability to lead in any capacity.

I'm . Some rambling on attitude and grades.

I had U and W on my transcript. I didn't study until finals, and would only go through materials one. In fact, for some modules, I didn't finish the text once because it bored the hell out of me. I skipped school, took long breaks, and slept in classes. My only redeeming point about my attitude back in school was I work hard and smart for projects because I liked them a lot. 

1. Just because you're getting your grades, it doesn't justify your shitty attitude. I always see my shitty attitude as an area for improvement. I do understand where you are coming from. Because I'm an ass too, and sometimes I do gloat at hardworking people working at the wrong ways. But good attitude is always better than bad attitude in working towards your goals. Don't ever delude yourself into recognizing your own weakness as a strength just because you are getting what you want. You could be better.

2. It depends on what is meant by YOLO. If you have the brains and time management skills, go and test the limits. It is another case, when YOLO is used as a badge of honors for one's failings. I don't aim for U and W when I study very little. I don't say I YOLO-ed when my results fall below my expectations. 

Just some personal thoughts for Yr1, Yr2 who are aiming for good grades, exchange, freeze caps, choosing hard/easy modules. 

a. If your results are bad, you should take more modules to put up the caps instead of freezing grades. Don't be envious of people who can go exchange to freeze caps. Chances are, even without freezing caps, good cap people will still get good cap.

b. Choose modules that interest you, you excel in, or are good for your future role. An easy module will simply mean you need to score in the high 90 to get an A.

c. For kids aiming for internships, try setting your exchange on year2 sem1.  It also helps to front load the relevant modules (likely 3000series) in year 2. 

d. S/U should be a last option, and S/U can be spent on grades below your targeted cap. B+ is a noob grade for FCH, B is a noob grade for 2nd upper. If you are getting grades below your targeted cap too often, it is time to re-strategize. Change how you study, or how hard you study.

Screwed the paper for the 1101 mod, and a level 2000mod of my intended major. Now i feel like shit. Should i even major in this since my basics are not even there? I'm also taking modules (besides just their 1101 mod) from another major and I have a feeling that I might actually score better in those modules. I have an interest for both majors and I chose the former because I thought that it suits me best. Plus, I've made lots of friends whilst taking those modules. I'm confused as to which I should major in... Should I still just go ahead and follow my initial plan? Or pick the one that I score better in... I don't want to keep switching my majors either, I wana graduate as soon as I can because school fees aren't cheap...

Does anyone know how the grading is like for modules with no bell curve? Badly screwed up the finals, and perhaps some idea of how they work will help.

Seeing so many questions about s/u and CAP makes me wonder how is it that many ppl don't understand the system.

To keep things simple, your CAP is basically the average of all the graded modules you've taken thus far (to be more exact it is the weighted average based on the number of MCs of each module). 

Having perfect CAP sems does NOT make any difference.

If you s/u all but one module in your first semester to get perfect CAP, then your CAP is highly subjected to fluctuations because that 5.0 only carries a weightage of one module (or the equivalent number of MCs).

Hence when you reach your final year your CAP is more stable because your CAP is carrying a weight age of over 100+ MCs as compared to ~20MCs you take in one semester.

So.. use your s/u wisely. If you s/u all A- in your first semester because you wanna aim for FCH, you better make sure you get straight As for your next 7 semesters. Else that A- might have pull your CAP highly if you didn't s/u it.

To 13006,
While I wholeheartedly agree with your first paragraph,

What is really wrong with YOLO attitude? I burnt all 3 SUs (all on C+ and B-s) by Year2Sem1. I ate a B- for my compulsory life science module due to 0 interest. I bought 3 free SUs using overseas summer exchange. Heck I even went on a 1-week holiday overseas for one of my semesters. I ponned some modules with horrible lecture timings for the whole semester except for the exams. You could say I have a really messed up attitude with respect to school. But really. Who cares about attitude?! I aimed for 2nd upper during freshie year, now ended up borderline above 1st. And I'm not even ambitious though now I feel compelled to maintain it. In my major, the people who kick the ass out of everyone else CAP-wise (above 4.7) are the ones who don't ever turn up for lessons. They are the jokers whom you are module/schoolmates with for 4 years but you don't ever see them except for exams and graded presentations and yes I am year 4. The ones I see in lectures are pretty much low-1st class and below. How's that for attitude? End of the day these 4.7+CAPpers will be better perceived than your typical guai-kia chasing grades your "legit" way with the "appropriate attitude".

Chill dude. Grades only. No need to bring attitude in the picture.

Prof strolls in CM2121 exam 5 min before the paper ends informing us that there is a (somewhat crucial) error in the paper question 2. And no time extension was given or whatsoever. Even the invigilators also stunned.. By the time he finish writing the corrected error on the board.. it was already time to stop writing.. so... what now?

So I'm finishing my finals tonight with a core module that I absolutely detest but have to take anyway because it's allocated... looking at the bell curve it seems like I'm at the D+/D end of things (taking into account CAs too). 

This might be the case for another one or two of my modules, and I can S/U only one of them (the rest have prerequisites). I'm in Year 2 now and this is just simply depressing. 

Anyone has any advice/experience with such situations and know how to bounce back from this, other than (obviously) putting aside my social life and pulling up my grades with As in future semesters?

@  

If you want a first class honours, I will S/U even B+ module. For a B+, you will need an A. For a B, you will need two As to even it out. Those who said keep B, are either not aiming for FCH and don't have a FCH grade or they have bad logic. FCH material will score A-, A, A+ easily regardless if it is first year or last year. Otherwise, it just mean you should modify your goal. 

Anyway just a word of advice. I do not think you actually care about getting good grades, so why bother aiming for FCH? In addition, what the f is YOLO attitude, and intention to exercise all S/U options in sem 1, and getting B, C, D for sem 1? I agreed that grades are not everything in life, and different people have different goals. However, it disgusted me that you are aiming for good grades with such an attitude.

No proper FCH aspirant sets such awfully low targets. Regardless of what we say or how little we study, we aim for perfect cap every semester, and our bar is set at a minimum of 4.5 (with S/U as the very last option). Wake up now if you really want to get your first class honours.

Hi NUS kaki! Freshie here. Want to ask about S/U options. I take geog, global studies, theatre, french & econs. Thinking my econs will confirm be C at best or even D (Is there an E?) 

Came into sem 1 fully committed to exercise all S/U options b/c I'm dealing with a lot of changes in my life right now and I feel it's too unrealistic to expect a 5.0 CAP. This is why I had a very YOLO attitude & club & just take life chill for this sem. No regrets! I love NUS! But my OG friend likes to chide me for it saying that "waahhh u partygirl ah etcetc. Eh today wake up alr not?" I feel like he's looking down on me when he says it. But I feel like life is more than grades & uni is more than being blindly hardworking. I worked hard in JC & realized its inpt to learn to work smart grade-wise. Life needs to be balanced. We need to build our other skills like networking & pursuing interests & giving back to community. 

I want to be an entrepreneur, that's why I feel grades are not as important as learning, understanding the market & networking with people who can help me get to where I need to be. 

Nonetheless, I'm still a perfectionist. I still want to graduate with first class honours, do a double major and become a polyglot. 

My econs grade is severely pulling me down though. I will probably S/U it but I need to understand the assumptions behind the whole S/U exercise. 

Dear seniors, do you assume that if you S/U enough grades to get a perfect CAP in sem 1 that in sem 2, you will get A for everything? Is this realistic? Do people actually get straight As in Sem 2? Do you purposely take subjects which are easier to score in for the sake of CAP even if they're boring af? Some people tell me that even if you get a B in sem1, you should still keep it because its harder to score better grades as you progress through the years in NUS. Whose advice should I follow?

I'm actually quite curious-- did anything happen to people who were late for final exams yesterday as a result of the train breakdown? I mean, I know the news says that LTA called up SEAB re the A Level papers, but was anything done for the university students who were late for their final exams? Or did everyone just get penalized for being late and lacking foresight to seek alternative transport modes at the start?

Quite curious about the University's policy in dealing with train breakdowns during finals period (like the SEAB and the national exams-- the signs around MRT stations telling students the nearest school to go to in case of a breakdown)

We met at a dialect group award ceremony. You are from Medicine year 5 (or is it 4?), and your dad was sitting at the same table as you during lunch.

I am going for exchange this coming semester. How do I secretly hint at my relatives to give me more money for Christmas and Chinese New Year to fund my exchange? 
-
 
If you don't even know how the bellcurve is like yet, maybe its safer and less presumptuous of some freshies to not go about saying, oh, i'm going to get an A etc because you're assuming that the 90-95% of the cohort is going to do worse than you, which usually doesn't happen. Your optimism might become laughable or even embarrassing once your first set of grades return.

I've been searching on facebook and on the NUS website to see if there is a triathlon/biathlon club here at NUS. Does anyone know if one exists? Or, is there other groups/clubs out there that I can join that isn't really expensive? I am a novice but I've decided to give triathlons a shot since I find myself alright in all 3 sports.

Building a relationship is a lot like coding. To come up with a code requires you to put in time and effort, growing the code line by line. Sometimes the code will give you an error, sometimes the code will give you a bug, but as long as you take time to resolve it, the end product will be highly satisfactory.

But then sometimes you get a blue screen.

Hi I have a question after seeing one of the comments in another confession. How does NUS select its provost? The prof with the best record? Random number generation? Popularity contests?

Hello, this aint a confession but i dont have much seniors to ask:(( can i just ask around here, can Y3s MPE for L4000 modules for Y3S2? 
-
 
I have ranted to so many people already, but from their response, I dont think they understand what is the crux of the matter. Heads up, this is a post about the bell curve and the ugly truth about the bell curve. To those who think that there is more to life than the CAP, please scroll past this post yea?

Today, Professor showed us some of our grades by uploading them onto IVLE. The module I took is a 100% Continuous Assessment module. It is project-based, so there is no finals. Since this is a 100% CA mod, with graded weekly group assignments, I would say that this module requires a lot of time and effort. Every week we had to submit report, and we only have 4 days to work on the report. I mean, the module itself is fun and interesting. But it is the bell curve that is crazyy!

How the bell curve works: You take a test. You get placed under the bell curve and compared "relative to your classmates". You get a letter grade. RIGHT. But the issue comes when that letter grade is a poor representation of the time and effort put into mastering the subject matter. (This. is what Im freaking frustrated about.) What is to say that I deserve a C+ just because there are 50 other geniuses, who get full marks for their tests while I get 90 marks for my test? I try so hard to master the subject, get 90 marks (close to perfection), but Im deemed "not good enough", because I am statistically below average, and hence get a C+? LIKE WHAT?! 90/100 still not good enough? YEA. because of the smart geniuses in class, 90 marks is not good enough. No, to those who might be thinking, "oh, maybe your module too easy already", it is not that this module is easy. IT ISNT. It is because of the high proportion of geniuses enrolling into this same module that cause the bell curve to be screwed up.

Yes, There is nothing I can do about it. Yes, I should just suck it up and accept that letter grade. Yes, it is pointless to get all upset over this, "anyway, it is only a letter", "there are more meaningful goals in life other than being focused on a good CAP". But it is the frustration that comes when you put in so much time and effort and hoping that letter grade comes as a true reflection of your hard work, it comes back at you saying "sorry, you are not good enough." Yes. This is the ugly truth of the bell curve.

To those who are going to comment: "Dont care the CAP, just be happy", you apparently didnt read the third sentence of this post. Go read it again.

Please, if you dont share the same frustration that I have faced, dont comment. And if you dont get it, it's alright, just dont pretend that you do. Thanks for reading till the end of this post.

Okay. Back to revision. Hope the bell curve is better for my other modules.

To 12933: I feel ur pain. My grades are internship based and sometimes I get very sad as well when I slog my guts out for my boss but get some shitty grade in return while others may not have slogged as much but get very good grades all because our bosses have different standards. their excellent may be 10/10 but my boss may think excellent is 8/10. So I really understand ur frustrations. 
But that said, I have learnt to move on cause it does me no good. I mean we are all gonna have grading even at work. And the amount of effort and time we put in may not always produce results from the stories I heard from many working friends. So this situation will stay in our lives. But I choose to let go of this frustration and I hope u can too :) it's not easy definitely, I will be upset if I were u. But let go for ur sake. Be happy! Life is really short, U have tried ur best and u know u can have a clear conscience with that.

Anyone feel more demoralised/stupid in NUS? I came to NUS to pursue my passion in my major, yet time and time again I get beaten by the bell curve and every one else who are more hardworking and smarter. I just get more and more demoralized to study my favourite subject. What was once my passion in secondary/jc days, now is just a burden to me. I question my choice of coming to NUS and even choosing this major. It sucks because you have to choose to do modules to do well, instead of choosing what you like to study. It sucks that your friends chooses to group with smart people in order to do well instead of making friends with genuine people. Is it CAP determines everything in NUS? True enough NUS is not all about grades, I met some of the most genuine people outside of faculty. However when it comes to my major and stuff, everything revolves around CAP. 

I just wish I can study what I like again. 
I yearn to have that feeling back again, that feeling of just studying what I like. No pressure on grades.

Anyone intending to sign up for the half marathon for next year's Sundown marathon? It's on 28 May by the way. Looking for someone to run with me on the day itself (I know it's kinda early, but I guess I'm just throwing the ball out in the park to see if I'll get any response haha). 

I intended to go for it alone initially as one of my goals for the new year but my sister who took part in it this year encouraged me to find a running buddy because she found that it helped motivate her a lot to complete the race. She's not free next year though, and none of my friends would likely be interested or able to join me. Just wondering if anyone might be planning to go for it alone as well and would like some company? I guess we may not necessarily have to train together, it depends but I'm also open to that if schedules can meet. It would be nice to have someone that I know on that day itself (and hopefully can become friends with in the next few months?) instead of just charging alone in a sea of strangers in the middle of the night haha. 

If anyone is interested and open to making a new friend, you can get to me at @jlgoesrunning on Telegram (:

By the way I'm a girl, just putting it out there. I'm not super fit, but I guess starting earlier I think I should be able to get to a reasonable level of fitness by the time the marathon comes around. This is my first time attempting a half marathon as well though I did participate in runnus 10km this year. Looking forward to some responses! And good luck for finals everyone!

It becomes worse when I realised my heavy careless mistakes and the other correct answers after taking a short nap...

Since graduation, my friends and i have been getting 2-3 texts a day or calls from random numbers advertising for loans, solicitations and financial services. This despite that i have been registered on the DNC registry for years. I wonder two things, 1. Does this DNC actually work? 2. What is NUS doing with our personal information upon graduation?

To lodge a complain, we have to either fill out a troublesome document with many details for each incident, or physically send a printed document by mail, which is nothing but red tape and i doubt its effectiveness. Beyond the initial charges to afew companies in 2013 when it was first launched, it seems the agency has either lost its will or willingness to enforce anymore.

I know its not a matter of life and death, but its a pain in the ass and disturbing to know that our personal information is so readily available out there.

I found this dropbox link embedded in the NUS logo in one of my notes.

Has anyone ever changed faculty including starting over on a clean slate? Is there an interview too? Feeling really nervous given my poor grades.

if the uni is constantly asking us if the gradeless first sem should be extended to be a gradeless first year,
why not give the same number S/Us to the Year 2,3,4s? but of course not meaning that one suddenly has a gradeless sem in Y3S2 for example. but maybe like allow them to have the chance to S/U their past modules which they couldn't S/U or their own major's modules too. isn't then fairer in integrating this new system, rather than completely introducing it to the new batch only

Question about the s/u option and retaking modules.
-The s/u option is not applicable for modules dropped with W or F grade (during the module dropping period).
So getting a F from dropping the module during this period means the s/u option can't be applied. However if I didn't drop the mod but still got an F in the end, am I allowed to s/u it? 
I have to complete either mod 1 or mod 2 for my major requirements. If I get an F/U grade for mod 1, do I need to keep retaking mod 1 until I pass or can I do mod 2 instead? However, mod 2 isn't offered in sem 2 so I can only take it next year. Both mod 1 and 2 are 1000 modules but aren't listed as prerequisites for my 2000 major modules on NUSMods, so would it be ok to not retake mod 1 and wait until next year to take mod 2? Or must I complete all the level 1000 modules by the first year?
Thank you for any help

The local fresh graduates are competing against with other graduates from other country with dubious education system.

In the end, the foreigners got the job.

That is mockery of the Singapore job market.

The local should demand a reasonable pay to maintain the expensive living standard in Singapore. I do not think they are being fussy but they are just being realistic. Unless the government want them to stay forever alone, I dun think they can date any gal or form any family with miserable salary.

So, why put the blame on the fresh graduates if they are being robbed of job opportunities due to weak labor law ?
-
 
why is there no feedback exercise for department admin staff?
Some of their attitude sucks so bad but i cant complain anonymously.
-
 
There may be more competition in the job market nowadays for new entrants ("Tougher job market for new entrants"; Nov 2), but there are also other factors at play.

Fresh graduates are pickier than before, and are willing to accept only jobs which pay more. Many do not take into account the quality of their resumes or their exam results. They do not think about working their way up.

The question is: Why would employers pay more for Singaporeans who are less willing to work hard, as compared to foreigners who can be more capable and are willing to learn?

Rather than question why there are no jobs available, fresh graduates should instead ask themselves why they should be hired.

The mindset of Singaporeans must change in order for them to be more competitive in the job market.

Having more skills will help get employers to choose them over others.

HEY EVERYBODY, we need help :(

We are two students graduating in 2017 and we are looking for adventure-seeking comrades to join us on an epic journey across the Americas for our grad trip! As you might expect, it's gonna be long (approx 1 year, starting mid 2017) and it will involve lots of trekking and backpacking (camping included). If you were wondering, no, we are not sponsoring the trip and we intend to work while travelling! The journey will take us from Canada to Argentina (North America to Central America to South America) and all forms of commute will be on land (on foot, by car, by train, no planes). 

We know this shoutout might seem kinda early but as you would expect, it's tough finding like-minded people who are willing to embark on this adventure with us, hence we are taking to NUSWhispers! 

Contact @soonkueh and @chweekueh on Telegram if anyone is interested/would like to gather more details! Jiayous for finals!

While you are studying, be aware that there are more foreign talents coming into Singapore after the AEC. 

The professions that are affected include engineers, tourism professionals, dentists, architects, surveyors, accountants, nurses and doctors.

I don't know what engineers refer to. Most likely affect degree holders from FOE and SOC.

We often heard people saying accounting is an ironbowl job. Not anymore.

Most importantly, don't complain.

Um just want to say something about my roller coastering values..
I'm from a country where everyone works extremely hard to get good grades and my JC equivalent is one where everyone seems to be talented somehow-not necessarily in studies though. But those just in studies the competition is much more fierce than other schools as there are people who seem to be better than you in everything. As my parents really want me to get best education, ie a word-class uni, they have pushed me a lot. Luckily I quite enjoy learning, especially sciences, so I feel alright to work hard and do want to be a researcher. But I felt the push is so strong sometimes. Like, once in an exam I got no. 17 in my year and my mom scolded me to tears. (Not that I'm smart!!! I just work damn hard and in previous few exams I had the luck to make it into top 10. ) I understand my mom now as in my country where there are just too few resources and too many talented young people, one has to be top 1 to get some opportunities. 
But now that I'm in uni, my parents have been keeping opposing my future plan of being a researcher, though I have developed a passion for sciences already... They want me to strive for a more lucrative/ less stressful career and tell me that grades are not that important anymore, that I need to find alternatives to my so called scientific way of thinking, that I need to enjoy the colourful uni life.  But somehow I just can't change my mindset so swiftly. 
I mean, my parents are excellent strategists and I'm a linear dreamer... I don't blame their change, but I can't help thinking the plausibility that if they had told me earlier that grades aren't everything I could have valued things differently. I could have learned German earlier, or developed a love in photography, in business, in programming, in travel or in public speaking, which I now find cool not very experienced... But the material taught in my modules are still what I enjoy most. And I still think getting bunch of academic knowledge should be my first priority, and instinctively feel very bad if I don't do well in tests. Many of you will disagree with me and call me nerdish! Yeah that's why I feel so dilemmatic/zerstört.  
 I need advice on:
Does one have the right to do what one enjoys when this is in conflict with what one should do (in terms of developing hobbies/ joining projects/planning careers)?
Is there a principle that I can hold on for my life?
How can I prove that my pursuit for a career in research is worthy, if it is worthy at all?
Thank you all for reading, and all the best for your finals and life!!!

Sometimes, you worked so hard during the semester that you realized you have nothing much to study for during reading week.

Projects. Le Sigh.

Can I ask which IDIOT complained to EC3332 prof that the midterms was damn easy? Are you kidding? Why would you even do that? Now the whole batch has to die with you for a DAMN hard finals. 

Even that aside, don't you think its really rude to the prof to completely write-off his exam as 'very' easy? Did you think of those who couldn't score well? 

(And no, my scores were pretty decent, but I know of a few people who didn't do too well)

It is my second last final exam and I am seriously contemplating my career options now. My expected CAP is poised for FCH. But the confession and comments in the referenced post made me undecided if I should join the civil service. Although Prof Ben seems to reassure that there is no invisible ceiling imposed on the career ladder of non scholar, the other commenters also make valid points of its existence. 

Is it true that a non-scholar can also rise (as quickly) to take the top/respectably high post in the ministry or stat board?

As an engineering senior with no clue about the new compulsory internship (EG3611/EG3612): is it true that it will be letter-graded? What's the point when grading will be subject to severe volatility, which is the rationale behind SEP modules being CS/CU in the first place?

Can any juniors confirm this?

Received this e-mail in my NUS inbox. All names and e-mail addresses censored. Who in the world wishes riches upon a completely random stranger and then immediately after that says "your reply is not welcome"? Want to scam people, at least don't be so obvious about it lol. I pity the fellow student whose e-mail address somehow got hijacked into sending this. Take note, all!

Why did NUS Whispers filter out my confession about Paperbaton vs the Box NUS Resource folder? 
-
 
 Precisely because they are scholars sponsored with a few hundred thousands that they deserve to be given more opportunities to prove themselves.

There are also plenty of scholarships awarded every year, be it PSC or individual ministries/SBs; even if there are plenty of misses, the cohort on average is still superior to an unbonded local first class graduate and the vacancies to be filled is small to begin with. That's the hard truth.

You'll have better luck elsewhere if you insist on prioritising personal development instead of actually serving the nation. They don't really have time for someone unproven or sieved out at 18 like chaff from the wheat.

to that op of  
cs3216 is not just about good idea. ideas are cheap and useless. if it is expensive, we wont have so many chatting apps, snapchat, telegram, whatsapp... 

the important part of this course is to learn about good execution of an idea. you only look at ideas but ignore abt how students managed their time in order to build 3 apps in one course plus other school work in 3 month time which someone probably spent in talking cock lol.  

a good app is to solve a problem, a small problem. many of their apps are solving problems, printing company problems, food ordering problem in a company, problem of insufficient study materials in univeristy, problem of not able to talk and share ideas with others watching general election in different places, or that problem bothering many lonely hearts. 

not sure if u are clear about this course. the whole process of their projects is like this. brainstorm an idea -> build/develope the app -> talk to real users -> make changes - iterate -> market the products. when you evalute them you should evaluate how they execute every steps and how their app could make impact. (or also other perspective that makes sense)  

I know u had freedom of speech but I dont think what they need is what u just posted, but suggestions/advice on their app. for example, if u think their ui/ux is suck, u dont know how to use, thats their problem. or if no one use it at all, thats also their problem.

Dear NUS readers,

I am writing today because I was recently faced to a situation while working on a coding team project.

The fact is that I discovered that one of the teammates has copy-pasted his job from a previous project and then tried to cheat all other team members by refusing to admit it. After long discussions he finally admitted doing plagiarism.

I want to share some of the discussions we had in order to show to all NUS students/staff what is the state of mind of some of the students. How can NUS pretend to "Lead the future" with such students...

Please feel free to share your comments and point of view.

team member who cheated said:

"It was one function. I was also honest about telling you that I did it. And its not plagiarism untill we submit it. So lets just disagree and move on can we?"

"We didn't submit the assignment. its only plagiarism if I claim it to be my work. I clearly commented above all the funtions I wrote. [...] But now lets move on"
-
 
Anyone's feeling so so alone amongst all this sh*t? Exams to study for.. Assignments due soon (no idea why profs like to eat into reading week..).. Struggling in the midst of fyp.. And no one to confide in cuz no one around me understands all these going on in my life rite now. And my SO just ignoring me now cuz SO too busy studying (dun even want study with me). I feel so alone during this period. 
-
 
The bickering about CS3216 and STePS reminds me of the Henry Kissinger's quote: “Academic politics are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so small.” Even though these are academic projects done by students with very little at stake, people can be so vicious with their comments.

To get into NUS, you are not supposed to fail. So most students who managed to get into NUS are people who are not used to real failures. But outside university, it is common to see businesses fail. We don't laugh their failure. As Taleb said: "There is no such thing as a failed soldier, dead or alive (unless he acted in a cowardly manner)—likewise there is no such thing as a failed entrepreneur or failed scientific researcher".
-
 
Went to the STEPS showcase and looked at the CS3216. Seriously the apps can be thrown out of the window. wtf does griddit even do? talked to some paperbatom people and their pitches don't even sound reliable. and why does letterbox rely on so much adverts on nuswhispers? wtf... how to trust our elites to build apps and represent the schl?

The letterbox video was such a waste of time. It was so long but had zero content. And good job on using a better than average looking girl just to get people to be interested.

And my god are you wrong about "better than average looking", I checked out her fb and I think she's damn gorgeous

Not a Nus student but I really want to shoutout a greatful thank you to those medical student who allowed me to observed them in their procedure, teach me and even let me do a bit of hands on. Happen on e 2 or 13. Thanks for making my attachment more enjoyable. To other medical student, HO and MO who let us observe you guys doing procedures and taking the time to explain to us thank you to you guys too and I'm pretty sure us student nurse will be more than willing to help you guys if need be.

In response to 

"I did a cursory search and figured that renting a small (3 room or so) apartment for 99 years here comes up to a figure of a different order of magnitude. " 
Buying and renting are 2 different things. Obviously if you rent an apartment over the years, it will cost more.
Which bank offers an instalment plan for 99 years?  The maximum loan duration is 30 years. 

"Furthermore, compared to many other densely populated cities, ours already looks like a steal."
Why are you comparing property prices in Singapore with other countries where the context differs? You should compare "property prices" and "average salary" over the past few years.

"Am I sorely misinformed in some way?"
Yes you are.

I'm discouraged when thinking about joining the public service. I want to do my part and the payscale is satisfactory, but I can't help feeling severely hampered despite having a FCH because of the lower CEP compared to the scholars.

I don't dispute the correlation between one's performance at the age of 18 and one's performance thereafter. I'll never reach the standard of an administrative officer either. But to be filed away as an "at-most-MX11 officer" unless I seize a non-existent opportunity to show what I'm made of makes me sad.

Now I know how it feels to be like a diploma graduate in the public service. The glass ceiling is real.

Just want to check whether it's normal for profs to change the weightage of module components at the last minute. At the start of the module it was stated that class quizzes constituted 6%, midterms 44% and finals 50%. And now at the end of the module he told us that the quizzes were now 20% and midterms 30%. I admit i ponned a few lectures because of the low weightage of the class quizzes (he gave us occasional quizzes after the lecture, each of 1%). I was willing to give up that 1 or 2% to do my other projects. And now he suddenly upped the weightage by so much and needless to say i'm feeling rather pissed. Is what the prof did normal? Cos i feel like complaining.

I came for exchange with the desire of finding out how's the education like in another top university - yes I came here not for travel but I'm really here to study, unlike many of my peers - and it turns out that I just took several modules that are among the most horrible in my entire university life. My life sucks.

Ironically, not only do I come from a well to do family, my mother herself is a music teacher with a degree in Music. It would have been so easy for me to learn piano free of charge from her yet I never had the interest and passion to pick it up. My mom was not 'tiger' enough to force me either. I wish you were in my position! I admire you for your passion and persistance in seeking it. Good luck all the best! Self-direction and intrinsic motivation trumps all odds, and I sure wish I had those qualities you have.

You know why they now going back to the good old hard skills? 

Because the antartica searoute and the silk route hsr from xi'an to holland will make our ports redundant liao. 

We will lose one big customer - hewlett packard. They have decided to transport their computer goods from beijing to europe by rail when the silk route hsr is completed, cutting short the lead time by 2 weeks compared to sea journey via sg. 

We have to fall back to create electronic goods again like 70s & 80s, but then too late liao la. Compared to the other three little dragons, we did not grasp the computer and handphone tech all these years.

I'll be honest:

I think anyone who's a diploma holder and above, gainfully employed and earning a salary should not be saying anything like 'money no enough'.

You don't have enough money not because you're being underpaid, but because you're overspending. There are tons of things you don't NEED in your life, and you sure aren't living hand-to-mouth if you were just a bit more disciplined. Watch fewer movies, and drink less starbucks and you're fine.

Degree holder and unemployed? it's not cuz your degree has poor job prospects. It's you. You aren't flexible enough to reinvent yourself to stay relevant. You're not relevant, and nobody needs you. Otherwise you'd already be hired.

 Allow me to fan your rant. Other than the irrelevant ad-hominems and punctuation that break my ability to speed read, I wish to highlight that the headline of the article that he quoted referred to the painful lack of growth opportunities, that the work is boring and mundane.

That is the deal-breaker for me. I do not challenge the assertion that pay ought to be pegged to actual contribution (even though comparing across professions or industries is genuinely challenging), which essentially means professional development to increase such a contribution is paramount.

However the scope of work available locally, at least for my engineering discipline, primarily centres around maintenance. The painful truth for all of us is that even the return-to-investment indicator you trumpet dearly turns against you in such a field of work. It is elementary knowledge that a cost centre is not the ideal place to be in; look at SMRT for instance. I for one believe that the SMRT snafu will be repeated countlessly in times to come.

We who are unable to stomach the volatility of alternative careers in start-ups because of actual pressing commitments like loans to repay or families to support sacrifice our dreams. Some even join the public service and of course there are also the finance industry sellouts. I do not think that such a decision is immature.

Ever since I started my journey in NUS, I am not as motivated as I used to be in my polytechnic days. In poly, I am able to put my heart and soul into modules that I used to dislike but this is not the case here for me in NUS! The transition to student life again after nearly 2.5 years is a HARD one for me... I can sense that people are able to adapt quickly into the culture but why not me? I never thought that being a student once again would pose so much stress on me. I need some sort of advice!

Hey there's something I've been wondering and really hope someone can shed me some lights. Today is the first time I realised there is a tool to check for plagiarism on IVLE so yup, I had to try it. It was an OMG moment T_T! The percentage indicated was much more than I expected!! So does anyone know what is the acceptable percentage of plagiarism allowed? And a lot of content in my essay just coincide with other sources that I do not even know of, so is that acceptable as well or do I have to change?

Being a SoC student, I have submitted countless pieces of code for various assignments. Occasionally, the feedback given will be in the form of praises, saying I've done very well in some aspect, be it code tidiness or approach to the assignment, etc.

Whenever this happens, I can't help but go back and admire the code I've written. I don't expand on it... I just read it again and smile at my own 'brilliance'.

This is normal right - right? I mean, I imagine FASS students re-reading one of their best essays, or engineering students re-visiting their masterpiece-answer to some complicated thermodynamics problem that no one else seems to be able to wrap their head around.

Or maybe I just have an ego problem.

Human beings are not empty containers or machines into which information can just be downloaded in one direction. Practical skills and abilities only develop when learning is interactive, creative and dynamic. Knowledge has to be applied directly and used creatively in meaningful situations.

Maria Montessori pointed this out decades ago, as have modern researchers and educators such as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Ken Robinson, Carol Dweck and Howard Gardner. There is no way to bypass the natural skill development and mastery process, because humans are living beings, not robots. Children understand this, intuitively. During the first years of their lives they learn quickly and informally- mastering their parent’s language, discovering how to communicate, explore, walk, run, sing, paint and dance.

In the early years learning is a source of great joy for children, they explore their surroundings playfully, with confidence, curiosity and excitement. They are intrinsically motivated to understand the world, build skills and discover new things. They are not afraid of failing and making mistakes because they don’t measure or compare themselves to others. They know that nothing can be mastered without trial and error. It is for this reason that wise parents and educators place more value on mastery-oriented character traits, curiosity, interest and positive attitudes toward learning than on assessments and test scores.

A child equipped with patience, perseverance, curiosity and self confidence is best prepared to learn new things and overcome obstacles in life. They understand why practice and re-learning is so important, why they need to continuously update their understandings, cooperate with others and learn from those who have greater skills and wisdom. If guided wisely, they will come to realize that there are no short cuts to “achievement,” and that test scores alone are meaningless if they are unrelated to essential soft skills, creativity, love of learning and depth of understanding.

It's so hard to approach you since you're always with your friends in lecture and I don't see you anywhere in campus. If you think I'm referring to you and don't mind befriending me, submit a hint anonymously  so I can identify you. I know you follow this page (:

I'm the OP of . Many thanks to those who responded. 

It seems the general consensus feel that she's not interested. But I'm not one who gives up so easily (unless she already has a bf then thats a different story). I was thinking that now is probably a bad time to make any advances since exam's next week.  Everyone's super stressed and the last thing on anyone's mind would be any relationship stuff. 

I was thinking would it be better to try again after the last paper? Or perhaps text her during reading week next week and ask her if she knows how to do question xx from the tutorial.. You know.. those sort of module related stuff. 

She's the first girl that i've really liked and i dont wanna screw this up. 

Appreciate any advice from you guys. Thanks a lot!

Why do we need to take this IS1103 as a compulsory module? I find that IS1103 teaches very watered down version of categorical imperative and utilitarianism.

If my contribution to my group's final report is so little, is it considered slacking? The problem is I DID contribute a lot at the beginning, but we faced some complications and had to delete away half of our draft then. My part happened to be inside the half that got deleted. So I started by contributing elsewhere. But in the midst of reorganising our stuff here and there, my new part somehow got split up and scattered all over. Now when I look at the final report, I don't see a distinct part which belongs to me. I guess my members also noticed that, because they kept dropping hints throughout our final editing meeting. Sigh.

Based on the research in the "Rational Optimist", we can remain happy if we simply withdraw from competition and set our own goals for happiness. Hope this help students who are obsess with grades.

Example: 

A doctor who always dreamed of becoming an amazing doctor healing people and succeeded but one day happened to attend a conference where many of his past batchmates were also present who were making insane amount of money by working for insurance companies. 

This doctor now felt unhappy and jumped the same bandwagon making even more money that before but the cost of happiness. While the example is anecdotal, the research does show that competition for social status makes people unhappy.

I am taking this mod where a significant percentage of the marks comes from a group project. My group members are mostly slackers and I have this feeling that they dislike me for being proactive in voicing out my opinions and contributing actual work to the project, maybe they think that I am putting in too much effort for a mod that we can all s/u? I tried being friendly but all i got was either no response or cold replies. However, I genuinely  want to do well for this mod. Now I am worried that they may gang up against me in the peer evaluation, is it possible for such a thing to happen? And if it does, can I explain to the prof in charge and provide evidence of my effort to unveil the truth?

If a team member's name is left out from a report or if other team members write email to complain to prof, will the prof question why or will the prof just ignore the grade of the student?

Last semester I got a really bad grade for a module, I got A for mid-terms which is around 30%, project 40% and finals 50%. I estimate that my finals should be decent, but since the grade is bad, I suspect that it is highly possible that my team members back-stab me (3 of them are good friends and I am the new guy). 

If you suspect that you are back-stabbed, what should you do? Send email to ask prof after release of result? Will the prof respond during the holiday (since result is released only then)?

I think people who complain about welfare packs are missing the point. Spare a thought for the people who work hard to find sponsors, plan logistics, and distribution. They spend valuable time packing hundreds, even thousands of these bags when they could be studying or finishing up their assignments, only to have people nitpick and whine when they're not satisfied with their FREE WELFARE PACK. It's not an entitlement, and you're not a toddler in the toy aisle of your local supermarket. Grow up.

to , I think for most jobs (especially those where you are constantly dealing with clients, patients, students etc.) you may never feel fully prepared, and the best way to prepare is to just do the best you can once you start working. I'm a teacher, and I can tell you that when I was going to start practicum I was not prepared. I was extremely stressed and lost 5kg in 3 weeks (practicum is 10 weeks long and I was originally 50kg). I'm also quite emotional and it was very tough at first trying to deal with students who refused to listen to me or taunted me outside of class because I was new, sometimes in front of my CT and NIES (our grading for practicum). You'll pull through. The important thing is to really seek advice from more experienced colleagues whom you can trust, or observe them and learn from those who are good at their job. 2 years later, I'm really happy with my job; I've learnt a lot from my wonderful colleagues and you also learn to focus on the ones you've made a difference for, and just try to learn from any mistakes you've made.

I think in jobs like yours and mine where you have this huge sense of responsibility to fulfil everyday, and you don't want your patients/students to see through that you're a noob, call you out on it or receive complaints because of it, it makes the job very stressful in the beginning stage. But I think that our jobs are also very very fulfilling if you stick it out because you know you're making a difference in peoples' lives :) YOU CAN DO IT! Just try to be confident and always seek advice if you are unsure! I'm sure most colleagues are generally very nice and willing to help :)

(I'm not saying that other jobs are not stressful, but honestly, unless you are working in similar industries I don't think you can understand how much responsibility we carry with us everyday. Maybe I'm also not drawing a fair comparison cos maybe doctors/nurses have an even more stressful job than teachers? I'm also not saying that other jobs don't make a difference. This post is not about trying to compare these things so please don't nitpick and flame me in the comments.)

 - Med Student here. I think that medicine is so vast that everyday is a learning day. MOs, HOs are still learning everyday and if they ever make mistakes (the mistakes or any shortfalls) will be discovered and filled in by other doctors.

Then again, as a nursing student, I don't think that there are a lot of things for you to do during rounds? Just read the case notes and follow the instructions. Maybe your ward staff nurses can guide you along.

Word of advice - Always seek advice from your senior nurses.

Hi guys, I have a question regarding the CS1010 modules, hope to get some help here. A FASS student interested in taking a computing intro module next semester, preferably CS1010s. However, there isn't any bidding history on NUSMods/Corspedia for the arts faculty, only for FOS. Is CS1010s reserved only for science students, or that it's so popular there isn't any vacancy for other faculties? Would love to try CS1010 or CS1010e, but both modules clash with my essential major modules.

Thanks in advance!

This is probably familiar to NUS and other uni students. Several times I have been approached by people around our age (not sure if they are NUS students), and asked to do an innocuous survey. The questions will ask about our spending and saving habits. They would also be adamant that we leave our contacts behind (sometimes I would fake my number). But after my first time filling in such a survey, a self-claimed financial advisor will call me and ask for a meeting about purchasing a regular savings plan or insurance policy etc. I rejected him and from then on I was wary about such surveys.

Its not a one-off incident and I wonder who I can report to if I want to keep these insurance people out of campus. 

And btw guys, do more research about insurance and regular savings plans before you buy! The Internet has lots of info - and even a DIY online insurance platform. I see alot of students signing up for products which they probably aren't too familiar. Insurance agents, because of the commission structure, will NOT recommend policies which really enhance our protection or interests.

Not a Nus student but I need advice. Do any of the medical student feel that 5 years in med school is not enough to prepare you for working in the hospital? Dun get me wrong I know 5 years is a very long time not to mention how most of your friends are already working while you guys are still mugging for exam. Do you guys feel that in the last year you guys can't wait to graduate and start work but once your very last attachment is nearing you guys are like I dun know if Im ready to be a HO. I'm a nursing student and having my final attachment before I graduate next year. But somehow I feel that the next few months of attachment is not enough to prepare me for the transition from becoming a student nurse to a staff nurse. I feel that I'm not ready to carry out orders from doctors and talk to patient family members. Being posted to a high mortality, I'm afraid of talking to people about their disease/ death especially when some of them are close to my age. Being the very emotional person I am, small little thing can get me close to tears but I have been told it is not professional to cry. I know I have to take the opportunity to learn a lot during this I few months participate in code blue even though If I feel like a bull in a china shop and I feel so out of place when participating in dr rounds. i just feel that I only have the head knowledge and I'm not able to transfer it to practical use. Any advice?

Hi, I am a year 2 engineering student. I have this orientation group friend who always copies answers and he has been doing it since year one. He skips lectures and tuts all the time. My other friends have also told me about his bad teamwork in projs. Whenever an assignment is due, he will just msg me to give him the answers. Sure we help each other out once in a while and he can be quite helpful sometimes, but the helping ratio is probably 1:10.. We also joined many activities together such as sports camp, colour run, etc and have been quite ghum. He always picks the same mods as me so that I can carry him. Recently, we took a gek mod together and we were in the same team. There are 5 of us and all of us have done our part except him. We have each written a substantial amount for the report whereas he only wrote 1/5 of what we each wrote. He just comes up with excuses after excuses. I have confronted him before but he doesn't take it seriously. The other day, our report was due the following day along with an assignment. He called me to tell me he had no time to do both and told me to give him my assignment answers if I wanted him to work on his part of the project. I always see him playing his computer games on steam. Recently, he started playing fallout 4. This really hit me hard. I felt like I was being used and was being threatened. I got so pissed that I just hung up and ignored him. He continued messaging me, asking me for answers. I decided not to share my answers with him this time and left him on his own. I'm starting to feel quite guilty now. I mean.. I treat him like a good friend, but his bad attitude towards his work and his teammates really reflects how he treats me as a friend.

I won't be reporting him to my prof even though my other mates want to, but I have made a decision to not join with him to do anymore projects for two reasons:
1: his fundamental knowledge of basic engineering is not there. He knows almost nothing about engineering.
2: he has very bad working attitude and will be a burden to the team

Are my reasons justifiable for not wanting to be in the same team as him?

 Yet, I still want to keep him as a friend. Any advice? How should I tell him that I don't want to team up with him?

This might sound like a noob question, I'm sorry for being a noob freshie :-( . Where do we check our exam locations? The out of my 5 mods, only 1 prof mentioned the location during lecture. Is there a particular site I can check or will they announce through email/ivle when it's closer to the day of the exam? 

Thanks in advance!

I am completing my first semester  and am already regretting my choice of degree. I feel burnt out and clueless while all my friends seem to be following their passions and are already set on their paths to success. It doesn't help that my family has such high expectations of me. I want to find out what it is that I want to do with my life (already have a vague idea, but I want to assure myself of it), and most importantly improve my self-esteem for which I think a gap semester would help. But I am afraid if this is a wise choice, or if it is even advisable. Has anyone been in similar shoes before ?

so. the fass welfare pack was supposed to be given out across 3 days. but it is day 2 today. and they have run out. (this was seen slightly before 4pm, the collection time is until 430pm) what? did they not prepare enough to accommodate not just those who already completed the welfare survey beforehand but those who did the surveys on the spot? i know they said while stocks last ... but seriously? :( #iwantmywelfarepack

Hello, I'm currently a year 1 student, and I'm thinking of switching course to food science. Are there any food science students who can provide some insights as to how the course is like? And since the intake for this course is really small, does it mean that if I really do transfer, I will only be able to commence my studies next year? How about the job prospects? :/ I considered food science previously, but I was quite unsure about the prospects and I regret it now.

So apparently I have this friend A , he graduated last year and was offered to study Masters in the UK. But he wanted to have some working experience first so he joined a local SME . After which he finds the work repetitive and pointless, instead of looking for another job, he went back to this scholarship provider to make enquiries. Somehow this friend B heard about it and started some rumors about how he already quitted his job to go for this scholarship. 

As u know rumor spreads fast, so when his boss finally knew, he placed him on probation and fired him after 2 months with shitty reason saying they have enough manpower ard which is bull. 

Problem is as he rejected his scholarship offer before, they are still discussing whether to reoffer him or not. So currently he is jobless and just waiting for news. 

My question is, this friend A is a dear friend of mine and I have proof that friend B started the rumor. B wasn't well liked during schooldays as he was known to be a selfish and arrogant person. But still we do hangout during big gatherings. Do I confront B directly? I can live without him but seeing how he likes to destroy people's career I'm afraid that the same thing will happen to me.

To our whining med students on this page: you get the same treatment as any of us do - suck it up, or drop out. 

Did you know about the high-stress environment in the healthcare profession when you signed up for med school, or were you just deluded? The door's always there, you know. But nooooooo, how many of you would actually drop out? How many of you are going to become mediocre healthcare providers instead?

Do the healthcare profession a service if you think you can't stand the abuse and fuck off.

How accurate is the grading for the final exams? I'm not talking about debating whether an answer is correct or whatnot,  but rather on tallying up the total marks for the paper, accurately keying into the system etc. We don't get back our papers so we can't verify that marks are indeed counted correctly. What if a prof, when tallying up the marks, accidentally skips a page due to fatigue , resulting in a much lower score than expected? Any prof can shed some light on this?

I feel a bit sad with all the bashing lawyers and doctors get nowadays. Everyone is somehow happy that the law industry now have more lawyers, fees are dropping etc etc. I'm a law student, so here's my take. 

(1) more law undergraduates doesn't mean you get better quality. I've seen graduates from overseas struggle to deal with Singapore law. Some of the basics are even forgotten. It's quite scary. heck, even our local graduates are lost most of the time. I pity the clients.

(2) how often do you even visit a lawyer? Singapore isn't exactly a very litigious nation. the demand for lawyers isn't that high actually. what you really do in practice as a junior lawyer is just research and more research.

(3) no one in their right mind would choose law or medicine or dentistry, unless they actually believe in it (or they are sorely mistaken that they are going to earn big bucks). I haven't went out with my friends for months, I'm stuck doing readings over and over again. I tell myself at the end of the day, i'm in this course because i hope we can do some good eventually. but it doesn't help when everyone else keeps putting us down (Lawyer Jokes: if i had a bullet and i had satan and a lawyer in the room, i'll shoot the lawyer). No other profession takes a bashing more than lawyers. 

Law students are also human. So are the medicine kids. Stop being so nasty to us. We just wanna do our own job, and we do want to do some good. If you don't like what we are doing, just keep it to yourselves and leave us alone yea?

I'm a year 4 computing student, and I haven't applied for any jobs as I don't really know what type of job I want to do. The most common positions are probably developer or system analyst, but I'm not exactly interested in IT, and at the same time, I'm worried that I may not have enough technical skills. But then again, I'm not interested in anything else too. Any advice?

 I resonate with you.
 are you the sort of people who demands that the doctors should do your bidding just because you pay?

Honestly, do you know how much we have to learn before we earn that title in front of our name and how much abuses we face on a daily basis? As a student, I am just getting the tip of this massive abusive iceberg.

You will be happy to know that doctors are underpaid here with long hours (in the public system) compared to other western countries.

On a side note:  - we are actually rich because we have no time to spend any money as we are spending our time taking care of people like .

I really need some motivation to study. I have been very stressed since last week and there are so many deadlines and finals coming in the next 3 weeks. The thing is, I am quite sure that the knowledge learnt in some of my modules will not be used at all in the future. And it seems to be quite meaningless to just spend unlimited amount of time trying to improve the project report, presentation slides, plus everyone knows that no one will give a shit for our 'ambitious' project after this semester. Hopefully I can get a better grade for doing these, but then results in these days are not important anymore. So seriously, what am I doing here?

Having average A Level results, I didn't bother applying for scholarships. Hearing stories of how people who got their scholarships are getting free stay in NUS, free tuition and getting an allowance made me really want to apply for a mid term scholarship, since the sum of all of them is almost $50,000 and that's a year of my family's income before taxes. 

I kept getting judgemental glares at first, like why I would study so for the first semester and I should "enjoy the experience" "grades are just grades, bruh" - but there's more than just wanting to show off a near perfect CAP, like being able to get the scholarship will help alleviate my family's debt so much and the allowance will help pay off my sibling's Uni tuition fees as well. It will help my dad do a mid-career transition without worrying too much about a stable income. It will help my mum not stress herself too much about not getting enough sales and not having enough commission to bring home. 

The transition into Uni has been hard for me, and I put my heart and soul but all my results thus far have been just average, 2-3 points above or below the average. It feels like running a race with a sprained ankle while other people are trained Olympians. 

It feels like I'm seeing my chances of helping my family's financial situation just drive off, while I'm barely limping, running out of breath. 

It is a bitter pill to swallow, and the idea of trying to apply for a mid term scholarship with B and B- (maybe a B+ since I got a perfect score for a CA, but so did half the students), I know a scholarship is merit based, and financial aid has helped a lot, but to see some really rich people getting their tuition fully paid for, and an allowance on top of that, sigh. I guess I am lucky to be the first in my family to get into a Uni, but there's still other bitter pills to swallow, especially when overseas exchange season comes along.

I have a stable long term relationship with my bf. We are intending to go on a short getaway after exams. Knowing my parents, they will say no and i'm intending to give an excuse ( saying i'm going with friends instead etc) But my mum has a tendency to get me to forward the hotel and air ticket confirmation to her. So how do i solve this issue at hand? And advice will be greatly appreciated.

A junior doctor works 6 days a week (yes on weekends) on top of at least one night call (36 hours or more). I just did a rough estimation of their hourly pay and we are looking at less than 15 per hour. Just saying so that the majority of society can quit telling your newly graduated dr family or friends that they are rich

Anyone else thinks that doctors are way underpaid and overworked? (Not talking about private sector ones). My boyfriend spends hours in the hospital and works tirelessly and is paid peanuts per hour. And his working hours are terrible. Why doesn't MOH do anything about this? He just graduated last year by the way.

Is the School of Computing okay with non-students joining in for lectures? I'm serving my NS and having an amazing time learning Computer Science on my own, but I'm reaching a point where it's a necessary to discuss with an expert about some fundamental concepts (rather than a stranger off the web, though sometimes that works), so I was thinking of asking an NUS SoC lecturer - anyone know if they're cool with this? Are lecture slot timings available online too?

I think the tests/finals that we engineering students take are all open-book, right? Especially after the first year. It is simply not possible to internalize *all* of those screwed up equations and summon them from memory at will. I can't help but think that I'll be completely handicapped without my trusty notes. Or is that precisely the point of being an engineer? To know how to use the wealth of available resources rather than to internalize everything? Shrugs.

Anyone else here think that the products appearing on Kickstarter/Indiegogo by the Industrial Designers are way, way more impressive than the products from CS3216 thus far?

i graduated this year and have been working in a SME for close to 7 months. recently, due to some organisational reshuffle, i was changed from an accounting role to a marketing role. i expressed my displeasure to my superior but it was not heeded. today, my director asked me how i am coping and i told him i am still not receptive of this change. he told me i was narrow minded and should explore this opportunity to understand the career of a marketer. Am i wrong to feel that my career is jeopoardised?

Faculty of Science SEP office sucks. They said they would release results of SEP by mid October but they didn't. They released at end of October. Couldn't apply for other programs cos I wasn't sure if I would be selected for exchange or not. Now they're keeping people on a waiting list, and they were supposed to tell us whether we're selected or not by Wednesday. Well guess what they didn't. FoS in NUS is inefficient, and they have no opportunities to provide students on how to get employment either. Engineering and computing has industrial attachment, but science? Na nothing. Regretting the decision of choosing science now.

Can't believe I chose to do this project with this lazy f--k. It's already f-&%ing week 12 and he keeps asking the same old questions about the project which is ongoing for the past 6 weeks. Not sure if he is a stupid person or he is behaving like an asshole. Presentation is next week and i bet he is gonna screw it up. 

Well, i am guessing he joined me bcos of my good grades while I paired up with him on the basis of him being an acquaintance in my CCA. Come on dude, if you are not willing to put in an ounce of your effort then don't expect me to do all the report writing and the slides. Honestly, I will gladly tank a B or B- in this mod. Hope there is a special place for you in hell.

Confessions of a QM 3 student: When I saw "Paperbaton" I read it as "Perturbation". I swear it's challenging our mindsets of value of notes and whether the lack of friends to get free notes means one can pay through this.

Dear exchange students, please don't be put off by the OP of ! Sometimes people get too carried away and get overly enthusiastic about a topic and that's totally understandable. Most of us NUS students are a tolerant bunch and if things really get out of hand, we'll nicely remind anyone to lower their volume. The semester is coming to an end and hope you guys have had a great semester at NUS! Cheers!

to the OP of  don't be naive. Even if the new buy/sell place doesn't exists, seniors still pass their resources (NUS Resource Box? Dropbox folders?) to their juniors any way. after all, people face consequences of their own choices - Paperbaton doesn't make it any easier for people to just rely on other peoples' content. it's actually making it harder by placing a price instead of passing freely. - with <3, bizJunior

Are people really this inconsistent? Three examples.

1. Meetings: we lament long meetings. When I took over chairing meetings, I kept them under an hour. But people come late so I thought the natural solution is to start punctually and leave the catch-up for them to do. so I end on time. I get scolded for being unforgiving instead, even if I had shown that I had indeed wasted much fewer man-hours.

2. I was asked to critically evaluate proposals. Someone submitted one, and all I had were three questions: objective, rigour of method, expectations. I wanted to merely show the essences of the proposal being flawed, and I got scolded, once again for being unforgiving. Someone told me I should have read it in detail, but if it didn't even pass such tests, shouldn't the major errors be fixed first?

3. Often communications is a standard reason for failed implementation, so I thought I would adopt models where communication is easy and effective. I told my staff and they agreed, but when I asked that they follow " standardised phraselogy" to minimise confusion, they baulked. I thought it's common practice in any operations team, be it military, 24/7 ops manning teams, security crew, radio operators e.t.c.? I was supposed to run a camp that needed a fast response task force for emergencies and I got shot for being too demanding.

I wonder whether people really complain to vent or genuinely want to improve systems.

I am the OP who posted about how loud the ang mohs were today in Pc commons and they were talking about some German Carousell app they were gonna developed. I would like to clarify that I AM an NUS student. It was probably because I was raging that's why I didn't type properly. The lady told me the private room was meant FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE THERE FOR THE WRITING HUB ONLY. I am a LEGIT NUS student and I'm surprised that some commenters can't even infer such simple things. Why would I even bother if I'm not an nus student? Seriously?

Hi, i have a qns here. From my 2 year in nus, i realised that i tend to only do average in CAs which have unconventional assignment (for eg diagram drawing, making posters, anything that require more than just theory knowledge). But when it comes to theory based exams/mid terms (even those that require application of theory knowledge), i stand a higher chance of going much higher above the average. Why does it appear like no matter how much effort i put in for our normal assignments, the best i get is usually the average, whereas for our normal tests/exams, i tend to do better? 

Is it generally true that people who do well in exams/tests are not necessarily good in doing unconventional assignments and vice versa, simply because doing well in exams/tests means being exam-smart but may be lacking creativity etc?

Does anyone have any suggestion on how i can improve my grades on doing unconventional assignments? Or this kind of thing very hard to improve because it depends on your in-born characteristics eg creativity?:/

I am one of those who received many emails from the NUS Resource Box. To be fair, the admins have helped to maintain the folder very well and people shouldn't blame the admins anymore - since it was a problem on Box.com's part. 

But I just want to point out that Paperbaton is very useful though. Yes it is important to do our own cheatsheet, but once I have completed my own cheatsheet, I can get a "second opinion" go Paperbaton and download a senior's cheatsheet to compare with. 

Just saying. Thanks to  Paperbaton team for coming up with the awesome idea & web.

Past few days saw Colin Tan and NUSMods' FB post about one of the projects in CS3216 which claims to be "a marketplace to sell and buy study materials", but it seems like too good to be true. more like a scheme to scam people's money? How can I get my money?

Since it is near the end of semester already, the CS3216 bunch seems to be very disappointing and useless. is this what we get from the elites of Computing??

Starting to feel that the CM1501 module is more and more of a joke with professor being late 15 minutes late for a 1 hour lecture and mid-term examination results not being released after 4 weeks, much less having our scripts returned. Complete lack of motivation to work hard for it.
-
 
To  : Welcome to psychology :)
-
 
Is there a reason why we don't get back our exam scripts after the final exam? We get them back for midterms so I don't see a reason why we can't get them back for the finals. Although i do a mod which allow students to optionally take it back after the prof has marked it, but thats's the exception rather than the norm.

Starting to feel scoring well for exams cannot predict if you are research capable??

Occasionally I do very well for my exams, but deep down I realised it is because I have learnt to game the system, and question spot extremely well. 

Research wise, I am still unable to come up with any new ideas of my own...but I can understand existing methods relatively easily reading papers.

Anybody going to Temple university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for SEP in year 3 sem 1? Hoping to know some people before going over =)

BTW has anyone been there b4? Hope to hear some opinions. 
-
 
I'm now having my SEP.

The lecturers here do not provide comprehensive lecture notes, instead they ask us to read the textbooks. I feel wanna scream since the books are so goddamn thick and there are too many useless details. The university also doesn't provide any webcast. All students must attend the lectures, otherwise they will need to catch up by themselves which is pretty demanding.

All these make me really miss NUS. I miss those good old days where I skip all the lectures and stay at my room, watching webcasts reading lecture notes and eating popcorns.

If a CS student don't score well in Data Structures and Algorithms module, should he/she consider changing course to IS since the student is not suitable for Computer Science?

Why I feel so stress in university??? I never had these kind of feeling while I was in polytechnic... Someone help me!

I feel that competition demotivates me from learning.

When something is not graded, I tend to learn more.

School system is biased towards those who are motivated by competition.

I realise that over these few years in NUS, I didn't get that much smarter academically. 

But if anything, my last minute efficiency has improved tremendously by leaps and bounds.

I am a Year 2 Student, and had a great start to University life. I enjoyed my modules and had a First-Class CAP at the end of the Y1S1 (and not because I exercised my S/Us). In Y1S2, I struggled a little bit and my CAP dropped to a high second upper. This Semester, however, has been a great struggle... I took up a leadership position in my CCA, and while I do not think that is the sole reason, I haven't been able to keep up with readings throughout the Semester... hate this feeling of helplessness now as exams draw near, don't want my CAP to fall drastically. I guess consistent work is really so important. Time to work harder next Semester.

Has anyone been able to convert a subject to a S/U grade past the deadline? I'm wondering if I could send in an appeal because I made the wrong decision in not S/Uing one of my subjects. I wouldn't mind retaking it because the grade is pulling down my CAP very badly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!(:

Freshie, I hope you all still work hard although it is a grade free semester. You will regret if you play too hard like me. I am graduating soon and trying to look for a ok job. It is just too hard to get one. Employers dont really care what other sh*ts I did in my year 1. They asked me those fundamental knowledges that I were supposed to master in my year 1 and I just cant answer any question. - a frustrated graduating senior

Hey Freshies, how is GER1000? Quantitative Reasoning Sounds a little boring don't you think. But anyways, to cut the story short, I'm year 2, and I'm definitely glad that I still have freedom to do 2 breath mods, rather than being forced to take Quantitative Reasoning and Critical Thinking. 

There is also another small change for the new cohort -
"Students are not allowed to read modules from the partner university while on Student Exchange Programmes and use them as GEMs to fulfil the GE requirement."
So much for providing a broad-based education... why all these restrictions.

That's sad, especially coming from a major course that doesn't let you clear your own core mod overseas. That means my juniors have only 2 UEs left to clear during summer. Oh well, I can count myself lucky, but I do hope they revert back to the old GE system of 1 SS, 2GE and 2 Breadths.

I am a university graduate and after working two years in the corporate world, I'm thinking of switching to the early childhood education sector. But I feel like I've wasted my university education, spending four years studying hard for a degree only to switch to being a early childhood teacher. My mum wants me to work in large MNCs. I don't want to disappoint her but at the same time, I think I would be happier educating young children. I don't know what to do and this has been on my mind for a few months..

Profs who are too old to care are the worst. I know of one who openly and proudly declared during a lecture that he no longer cares about students giving him negative feedback at the end of the semester since he will be retiring soon. This attitude has certainly pervaded his teachings during lectures and tutorials.

Unsurprisingly, he turned out to be a highly unpopular mentor during a recent FYP balloting exercise, probably since it is almost guaranteed that he will not give even half a ball of excrement about his prospective mentee and his/her grades, which would affect him even less than a feedback exercise would.

Will profs like this please just do the undergraduates a favour and retire already? Don't let your lackadaisical attitude affect our grades and our degrees, thank you very much.

I am from a particular CCA/club in NUS. Currently, I am part of the executive committee and am in charge of one of the main roles (marketing, programs, logs etc) 
Being a year 2 student, I honestly feel that those in the current exco, especially the ones in charge, are a spineless and irresponsible bunch. 
Let's start with the captains/presidents. There were many times where I proposed something for the sake of our CCA/club, but instantly got shot down by those higher-ups who were just too afraid to try out new things. They didn't even take my proposal into consideration and immediately rejected it. I had put in so much effort to draft a proposal and they felt it wasn't worth a look? Additionally, many a time they have no idea what they are doing and constantly rely on our seniors for help. Literally, every time we encounter a problem, the exco would be their usual clueless bunch and we end up asking our seniors for help. 
Next, the issue of responsibility. It doesn't help when those exco meetings end off with people saying " I will do this". "will get it done by next week", "yeah we need to solve this issue". Guess what, nothing gets done AT ALL. Only after constant reminders and nagging from the rest of us(me and other non-exco members)then those lazy buggers start moving their asses to get some stuff done. 

Currently, my club/CCA is involved in an event coming up during the coming hols and yet so much stuff still remains unresolved. Some of the committee members really did a half f**k job in terms of the preparation, while our leader and the vice just sit and watch show. I have already done my part but the others are just...one day say " got project too busy " or "this week got test so need to study first". cmon man, where's the responsibility??. If you wanted this role in this first place, then jolly well expect such committments! We are all adults, and such reasons are ridiculous. I have tests too, I have exams too, but I still complete my stuff as I understand being an adult, commitments like these have to be fulfilled. Quite sure even with lousy time management, those guys could have done something respectable for their part. 

Oh well, I'm just unlucky to be part of the most useless and irresponsible EXCO in the history of my cca/club. Peace out.

To OP of  WHO ARE YOU? ARE YOU ME? I'm also a Y3 girl stuck in the wrong major! I showed my friend your post & she was like, "You submitted this yourself right!?" 

Anyway, hey! I'm also Y3 and I realised too late that I hate my course and really suck at it. I considered transferring majors too but NUS doesn't offer what I want and there is no point in settling for anything else since it's probably going to end up the same way... Anyway, this is my last sem trying, i.e. if I fail the sem again, I am going to quit school and switch over to my passion. Sounds radical but I really don't want to spend 4k again and again repeating the same sem + there's a limit to our tuition grant. BUT! If I don't fail, I will trudge on till I grad from this course and then continue to pursue my dream course :)

Now that intro is done, I'd like to share w you my thoughts on our predicament:

1. Friends joining workforce
I fretted over this too, esp since my closest friend is alr in her final year. That means while I'm enrolling in my next course, she'd have been in the workforce for a year! While I'm still... studying. Am I.. wrong...? To not have followed societal norms? Of not joining the workforce after uni of 3-4 years? It was then another friend told me, "She wants to work; you want to study - You are both doing what you want! You care about what other people want to do for what???" Exactly. True, we may have lost some years but at the end of the day, be it your friends in the workforce or us still in uni - we're all doing what we want. But you must be clear of what you want and then make your choice from there. 

2. Career prospects
I wouldn't be the most reliable source since I haven't started working (probably won't till 6-7 years later too lol), but your current major does NOT dictate your job in the future. So, please don't think your current major can't land you in a job in your ideal industry! This is not good enough a reason to switch courses. Unless of course your dream job is highly specialised and technical, then well... uhm. If you're deciding to stick it through, find the good points of your current major and how it could be applied in your passion? For me, my major and passion are extreme ends but I tell myself, the stark contrast will offer me a different perspective when I cross over :)

3. Passion
How important is it to you? I hope you know exactly where your passion lies at, cus "something I feel much more passionate about" sounds ambiguous and not worth transferring over for. Of course you could also have left it ambiguous to protect your identity so pardon me. Anyway, beyond the woes of lost time, career prospects and limiting tuition grant, the most important question you need to ask yourself is - how important is your passion to you? Can you live without it? Have you thought about the career prospects in that industry? Have you tried anything in there (e.g. internship)? Personally, I chose my current course for pragmatism because it promises a good pay. Two years on, the money doesn't motivate me anymore. The only thing keeping me sane is what's at the end of the tunnel - the chance to pursue my passion. I've come to terms with the fact that my dream job wouldn't pay as well as if I'd just continued in the field I'm studying for. I did an internship exploring my passion and oh my, I've never felt as much gratification in the past 2 years of studies as I had in those 2 months!!! I may be getting paid less... but working for passion... ♥ Of course ideals might change as I proceed into later stages for life, but until mid-to-late 20s, this should keep me happy :)

Slighhhhtly far-fetched but if you are in a stable r/s that's going towards marriage, maybe you'd consider that a factor in your decision-making too? Since 6-7 years from now, we'd be 27-28... I'm not in a r/s so this was never a point of consideration for me heh. 

Finally, just wanna add that - it's week 11 already!! Now is really not the best time to think about this. 
I think you would know this too if you regularly think about this over the sems haha. Focus on your deadlines & finals for now!

After that, we will figure something out :)
We both made a stupid mistake 2 years ago that's cost us 2 (and more) years of time. But these 2 years aren't completely wasted. At least we found out where our true passion lies at and that where we're now is not it.

Meanwhile, WE WILL SURVIVE!!!

My tutor for a psych mod transferred over from NTU and she has been very harsh on all the presentation groups. It appears she also marked our midterm papers. Is it guaranteed that our feedback will be anonymous during the review exercise at the end of the semester? It seems she is staying on and I don't want to offend her ><

I would like to ask how valedictorians of the different majors are selected. Is it based on CAP or SJAP? and does it include other discretionary criteria?? thank you guys :)
-
 
While I believe that most of us understand that our CAP may not make a significant difference in the long-term, we still ultimately work hard for it. 

Why?

Quoting Steve Jobs, "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever."

Alway put in your best efforts and trust that they will pay off eventually, somehow.

We are reaching the end of the tunnel soon. Press on everybody!
-
 
To the OP of  This is going to affect your future! Would you want to be stuck in a job related to your current major now, and be miserable your whole life?! Why pursue a major you have no passion in? I know that all your friends are going to be entering the workforce before you. However would you rather graduate in major you have no passion in or graduate in a major you love! I choose the latter. Make the transfer. Passion is key for success in my opinion. Yes, you will be a few years older than the rest of your co-workers. So what? At least you will be doing what you love.

Is anyone else receiving calls from a particular insurance company asking you to join them as an agent and promising obscure attractive benefits and whatnot? Apparently they got my number through one of the orientation camps (two years ago) and I've received four calls from them over two semesters. Bloody irritating!!! I tried blocking one number but they simply called me from another. How do I get them off my back once and for all? Will talking in a civilized manner even help?

I need help.
I am stuck in a cycle.

I have too much work therefore I feel stressed.
I feel stressed therefore I game.
I game too much therefore my work piles up.
Now I have even more work.
And the cycle repeats.

Hi guys, 

I have been wanting to send in a confession for awhile but I was contemplating how best to get my story out without being too obvious who I am, so here I am and I really hope I can get some sincere answers, because you guys seem really nice. 

I am a poly kid who regularly stalks this page for motivation to study hard and make it into the three local unis because this page is honestly better than any promotional material that I can get. I belong to that growing group of students who choose to attend poly when we are well-qualified for JC because I am very sure of what I want to do in future and feel that my course would give me good grounding in the industry that I intend to work for. However, it appears that the admission chances for us are very low, as from what I gather, it is you meet the GPA IGP or go home. 

Now about my GPA. You guys may argue that if we can't meet IGP, we probably can't survive uni. But just like CAP, GPA is not an accurate indicator of our abilities. I am hampered in some modules by a very specific kind of learning disability, and in the GPA system, you could have 10 A's and one C, and your cGPA becomes a B regardless. I am therefore quite frustrated because I believe I am capable and qualified to join you guys, but yet at the same time this dream and goal seem so far whenever I look at my results. No one wants to be born with a congenital defect in their brains, if given a choice. :( I have often asked myself if I have known the impact earlier, would I choose a course where I can easily score the GPA I need, but yet go against my conscience in knowing that my passion lies else where? 

So tldr here comes the questions: 

1) Is the poly vs JC kid divide very obvious? In poly, we do absolutely nothing that requires a higher level of academic thinking, and in fact I believe all of my classmates don't quite bother with the news and happenings around the world, except for me because I genuinely am interested. That's a downfall in the system that I am unhappy with, but its a story for another day. 

2) Am I overestimating myself? Is the learning curve for us really steep? As mentioned above, we don't do any higher level of academic learning and thinking and whatever I am learning now is pretty much practical knowledge of the industry I intend to join (ironically no one seems to expects anything from poly kids and internships are still limited to mostly service line lol). Is there really some truth to the fact that we are really subpar from our JC counterparts? Does not being so green at working life and understanding the real industries out there really not give us any advantage over JC kids? 

3) Lastly and most importantly, after all that truths, HOW can I help myself? Of course, without a doubt, I am working very hard to pull up my GPA but after some calculations, chances are still very slim. If my GPA doesn't work out, is there anything else I can start doing now to get into the three local unis? And yes, I have a pretty substantial co-curricular portfolio till date and still working on it.

Give me a tight slap about the reality of things if you need, give me a helping hand if you want, and I am really interested to know and read your replies. 

Thank you to whoever you are, for making through my semi-rant, semi-question post. :)

To ,
I changed my major at the end of my second year and had to delay my graduation for one year. Despite so, I really LOVE my new major and I looked forward to attend my classes everyday! I never regret my decision. I was also quite hesitant at that time, as I've heard the best time to change your major is during/after the first year. My new major is quite specialized therefore a change of major is definitely necessary for me enter the industry. I'm not sure about yours though... But if you're really sure of what you want, just go ahead! Try to map as many common modules you can. 
Do take note that the subsidized tuition fees is only for a maximum candidature of 6 years if money is one of your concerns.
-
 
Friend comes from a rather well-off family. Tuition fees tots not an issue. Never has to work to support self. Relatively plenty of time to be involved in CCA. 

I come from an average family. Loan to pay tuition fees. Working/tutoring part time like many of us to support self.  Some spare time for CCA, not too active of course. 

Friend wins scholarship/grant: a year off fees, hostel paid, etc. Deservedly, of course. Friend is amazing and dedicated to CCA. 

But. My god. i could so do with that grant. More so than friend i would say. 

Tldr; rich gets richer, poor gets poorer.

So as i pray, Unlimited B Works!

I'm considering staying in university for 5 years instead of the usual 4, so that i can take all the modules I want to take; possibly do a double major and a double minor?

I can't decide if it would be a sensible/good thing to do... 

The alternative would be to just study those subjects in my free time if I'm really interested in them, instead of wasting time and money by extending my candidature. After all, it wouldn't even show up on my degree scroll since it's not like I'm taking a double degree, and it might make zero difference in employment prospects. It would also feel kind of lonely and strange to be left behind when your friends graduate, while you graduate with a bunch of people who are not your batchmates..

I'm conflicted though, because for all the faults in the pedagogy, I still find that for certain subjects, learning in a formal academic setting does help, perhaps because you have a more structured syllabus, access to relevant material, and instructors/coursemates to approach if you have doubts? (yes the Internet is great but I think we are prone to doing selective reading -presumably the google search algorithm exacerbates this-, and sometimes you don't even know where to begin to look?)

If I do decide to stay the extra year though, ideally I should be working part-time to fund it? But I've tried planning my modules for the next couple of years (taking the 5th year into account), and I'd most likely still have to overload almost every semester. I'm afraid I would be too tired to work during the semester, or that if I do work, I may end up doing badly in my studies... (maybe this could all be easily resolved if I just had better time management skills sigh)

Any sound advice would be appreciated! Thanks for reading ><

Hi. I'm an economics student with a CAP of less than 3.. i have not done any internships and i'm very worried i cannot get a job in future.

Hi OP of  I am the OP of . My CAP is 4.6 ish, so I wouldn't say it's high since it's the lower tier of first class. I am that kind of person who doesn't work hard everyday as you've mentioned. But I do put in a lot of effort when it comes to projects because that's what interests me most of the time. I usually lag behind in my studies right after midterms, and catch up with everything in the last two weeks before exams.
Of course all these contradicts with what I've posted about not procrastinating. But it turns out that most people are better off with putting in continuous effort rather than sprinting near the end. I'm studying on the edge while spending my time on my other interests. It works for me.
According to your post, you have friends who do well with seemingly little effort, and some who work hard but don't do as well. Now think about this, if your friends who work hard stop working hard, what's going to happen?

I have this guy in my group project who is very incompetent and always hold back everyone. We have also started complaining behind his back. However, he is also very hardworking from what I see. I have to admit I am a very goal and quality oriented person and find it hard accept any form of unsatisfactory work. Should I report him to my prof that he is not doing a good job?

I picked the degree with the worst employment rate among all the faculties.....GG

"The report also showed that degree holders with qualifications in education (0.7 per cent), health sciences (1.7 per cent) and engineering sciences (2.8 per cent) had the lowest unemployment rates as of June last year, and were well below the average for all residents (3.7 per cent).

At the other end, graduates of the fine and applied arts (6.2 per cent), mass communication and information science (6 per cent), and humanities and social sciences (5.3 per cent) had higher unemployment rates than the norm."

To all those people who have all the bad things to say about people with higher CAP. Stop hating. If it weren't for people like you they wouldn't be there in the first place. Whether it's that you are smarter than them but you just want to play mind games and give them the illusion that they are smarter at the sacrifice of your CAP, or that you just can't motivate yourself to study, it's all you. 

You and your imaginary friend called procrastination giving all the reasons in the world to explain why you didn't do well. It's about time to break off that relationship and move on.

Luck sometimes do play a role during exams, but if you work hard enough then luck will not determine much of your grade. Besides, if you say you were unlucky during all the exams that you've taken, then you can consider yourself bad luck Brian's friend and post a meme of yourself and become famous.

 Hey OP, what's your CAP? It's probably quite high, I assume. Do correct me if I am wrong.

Hard work does not necessarily translate to good grades. Procrastination? I have friends who work their asses off everyday and sacrifice their meal times for consultations, but they end up scoring less than a B. Whereas I have other friends who slack off every weekend but still get that A. Sure, Einstein said that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% pespiration. There are people who just lack that 1%. Just let them have a chance to vent their frustrations since they already feel hopeless...

I am the OP of  and . ( I would like to remain anonymous) To all struggling students, I was at that stage a few weeks ago, feeling a serious lack of self worth when I was reminded once again that my academic capability is not as outstanding as the rest of my peers. Life is also tough in the sense that I have to work to support my family, while juggling my studies. 

However, I realised that my grades really do not define what I am. I am sure you have other capabilities out there, and a CAP lower than 3.5 just means that perhaps your talents are elsewhere. I am sure that there are other things you enjoy doing, and excel in doing. Celebrate the fact that you are in NUS, which itself is an achievement. Keep people who bring positive energy to you, and be brave to do things you like. Change major if you are sure that you would be happier doing that major, continue to pursue a degree that brings you happiness even if you do not do well; ultimately we just want a fruitful and memorable experience in NUS that we can fondly look back in the later years. 

Be brave, have faith. I think all of you can do it. The going is tough, I send strength to all of you who needs it.

Don't ever give up.

Maybe when the bills come in again next week I will feel the sense of hopelessness again, but I count on everyone here to give me the strength to continue on. 

We can do this.

Dear readers, I am frustrated and disappointed right now. Please kindly advise me on what I should do.

Recently, I had this 3-man group project where I ended up doing 80% of the work. This project contributes a significant amount to the module's overall grade. We are allowed to blow the whistle if 1 member of the group is not contributing; the grading will then be adjusted accordingly.

I am contemplating reporting the other 2 members to the Prof as I have endured injustice and have sacrificed an astronomical amount of time to complete the project . I do not know why they chose to ignore this graded project (perhaps its because they are able to S/U this mod?) but time (their social media updates suggested how their time was spent) was never the issue. 

However, being cynical and skeptical, I did consider that they may weave a story to gang up on me. What should I do? It doesn't matter to me what grade they get but I do feel like my aspirations for an A grade has been compromised. I do somewhat have evidence that I did majority of the project. Please kindly advise me on what you think I should do. Thank you.

I have never met anyone who is so dedicated in his teaching, making all these hilarious videos that have educational value (BTW I think NTU copied your Flipped Classroom Model) , and always setting aside time to answer our questions and even giving us extra practice. Hope to do you proud on this Thursday's celebrations Sir!

I need some tips on how to be motivated to study! I simply cannot study and my attention span is becoming shorter and shorter. I cannot concentrate during lectures and all I think about is when the exams will be over. But if I don't study now, I will totally screw up all my modules which have a high percentage for the finals. Help!

to op of  , but i have been tanking most of the projects every since i enrolled into university. I take it on me that i am more intellectually capable than the others in my group, gone nights without sleep and social interactions so that i am able to churn out the project on time. They did try their best to contribute but i don't think it was significant help.

Knowing that they cannot do a better job than i am, i mostly solo-ed all these. I am not sure why people are so concerned about sleeping members in their project groups. People have different motivations and incentives to put in different amount of effort into the project. They might have other things to do as well. Unless the person is a total no show, i will not report any of these members to my Prof as there need to be a carry in every team.

If you do your part in the project and understand the concepts well, you will be damn sure you can out score them in the finals.

I have depression because I can't get a good CAP in order to apply for top grad schools in the future. My depression worsens my grade.

What a vicious cycle.
What should I do?

Does anyone know if we can get anti-depressants from UHC? Need to restock but I've no time and school is most convenient.

I have read a lot of posts regarding how important CAP is and how devastating it is when your CAP is low.

I have always been the top and constantly winning awards since I was a primary school student and with 3 scholarships I have never known what making payments for school fees is like. My CAP is in the First Class range, I have got a semestral CAP of 5 thrice and I am on my way to get my double degree and minor in 4 years. But then the cost of being unconsciously immersed into that way of life being nurtured since young is that I socialize less and the stress, pressure and even depression that I usually have to face throughout my life. It feels terrible when you can't get rid of it because it is never comfortable to get a B+ or A-. I think many students with CAP of 4.5 and above will have to go through this correct me if I am wrong. While some may say that I set a high expectation for myself, I sometimes wonder if my life would have been better and happier if I had been born not to be academically inclined it sounds silly I know. Yes I believe life is fated. I really have a feeling that I have missed a lot of things by looking at other friends. And when you unavoidably and constantly have that kind of feeling and you don't know why, you can be sure that life is not just about CAP. Instead, uni should really be a holistic education for all. Sorry if the post is long and thanks for reading. Hopefully it will help those who are not happy with your CAP feel better somehow.

 This happens in FASS as well. The more prestigious majors are Economics, Psychology and Political Science. Humanities are the least popular because they are not 'sciences'.

It's the ahlian gf issue again. And no, unlike the other poster, I do not have an ahlian gf whom I have sex with everyday.
I am just an nus student who is dating an ahlian who is three years younger. A legit ahlian. Not just another promiscuous clubber with tattoos who labels herself as an ahlian to look cool. She stayed in girls home before, told me that she is still in a gang, calls on her gang to beat people who cheat on her friends(quite regularly), has several tattoos, is a chain smoker, speaks fluent hokkien and swears like my father.
But deep down, she has a heart of gold. Not trying to stereotype nus students, but she seems to be more mature and independent than 99% of all nus students I've ever seen. I'm tired of seeing the first world issues of these nus girls (and admittedly myself), such as not having a high enough CAP, failing SEP applications or complaining about how hard the midterms are. Being from a broken family, she has earned her own keep since 14 and is now even funding her own private diploma+degree. However, this means that while we're studying at night trying to pull our CAP up, she works as a promoter in clubs and bars almost every night (the pure ones like Harrys not the Thai discos). She simply cannot find any other jobs that pay enough to fund her school fees which are 7k a semester. Still, these jobs sure gather unwanted attention. People tell me she's not the one, and that I should go for a university student instead of a tattooed "bar hostess" I met in a club "just because she's chio".
I'm in a dilemma here, not because I think she's not good enough for me, but whether I'm good enough for her; whether I'm able to protect her from the ridicules from my fellow nus students when I introduce them to her. What should I do?

Well, I am halfway through my NS and I have secured a place in NUS at the start of this year. The thing is, I intent to pursue Mathematics in NUS and now I am feeling really insecure about it. I am expecting fierce competition from foreign scholars as well as talents with Math Olympiad experiences, while I have none. Back in my JC, I was good with math and physics (though I didn't top the level) and enrolled into H3 physics in JC2. But now the more I think about it, the more insecure I get. Can any senior (preferably in math major) enlighten me on this? Is it possible to excel in math when you have minimum experiences in Math competitions? Is it possible to do well in Uni math just because you did well for A levels math and physics? How do people with just a normal A level education excel in Uni Math?

Recently there is this post by a local company owner (who is an engineer), complaining about the local graduates. I am really curious what kind of employee he is looking for.

A) If he is looking for top engineers or developers, it is unlikely he can get with 3.6k (compared to MNCs, banks)

B) If he is looking for people who is not capable/ambitious enough to start their businesses, surely he knows these people are looking for stable job with best pay and benefits (aka MNCs, banks). Of course they will jump with better opportunities. Does he offer something the MNCs can't offer?

C) The incapable ones, surely he's not interested?

So my main question is, what does he really expect from local NUS graduates? isn't it clear that NUS student (most I assume) wants to achieve great things in the future (wealth, career, etc). How is he able to help his potential employees achieve their goals? Honestly, do you think it's employees' problems that you can't afford them (with regards to VC funding)? It's a well known problem that SMEs will require employees to work longer hours (vs MNCs, banks exception due to higher pay and career progression), so is his company the same kind of SMEs?

Call it entitlement if you want. But this word should only be reserved for these "losers" who don't get their desired salary and jobs because they have nothing to offer except perfect CAP (0 experience or 0 network). Not for these who fought and got what they think they deserved.

To the startup owner of , as a soon to be CS graduate next year, I'm glad to have an offer to a prestigious Silicon Valley company after I graduate and not have to work for your company or any other local company for that matter.

I wonder where did you post your job ads to complain about lack of candidates? CS people are seldom found in general job ads. You have better luck to reach us via NUS Career Services, tech mailing lists like NUS Hackers and so on. Set up a booth at Career Fare instead of taking the easy way out.

Funding levels are seriously not our problem. If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. If you don't have enough peanuts, get more peanuts from other VCs and not complain about can't find talent at your payscale.

I have seen this comment everyone wants to be managers. Where is the statistic to back this up? Everyone probably wants to be a manager as the pay for a "lowly" engineer is probably too low to live decently in Singapore. CS ppl love our craft but we expect our passion to be rewarded reasonably and not be exploited.

Your condescending remark "If you (are) that capable, why are you not in Silicon Valley" hits the nail on the head. I appreciate your praise for people like me who already have an SV job or offer. Thanks to business owners like yourself, things are a self-fulfilling prophecy and you can't find good talent in Singapore.

Don't filter pls! TY! 

I need help. I am so lost I really dont know what to do anymore. Has anyone ever switch faculty after 2 YEARS! I'm in Science and I hate it here. It's not meant for me. I want to go to arts. But would they let you change course after 2 years? Pls share your experience if you guys don't mind. I worked so hard to get here. And to graduate with a major I have no passion/interest in is just so depressing. Any advice on how to go about this? thanks in advance.

how do you guys even get the motivation to study. i hate it. really really hate it. i'm studying only for the sake of studying and it really sucks. if not for the fact that i'll be useless without a degree i'd probably just not study at all. gahhhhh. just needed to rant.

There seems to be this talk on social media recently about how CS/Engineering is not appreciated in Singapore. Many would-be engineers intend to find jobs overseas or switch to local non-engineering roles like finance which pay better.

As an owner of a local startup and a former engineer myself, let me enlighten the cause of this situation. Many of you don't want to be an engineer in the spirit of the job in the first place. At least three quarters of Singaporean CS/engineering candidates I have interviewed want to be project managers instead of coders. That is, if I can even get any applicants at all. If everybody wants to be managers who will do the work?

Engineers especially the good CS people bemoan the low salaries compared to what they can possibly get at Silicon Valley. I don't dispute the numbers, in fact I hope to pay as much as the US companies if I can afford but the VC funding levels in Singapore are nowhere near the US levels. This in turn constrains how much I can pay my employees after considering business expenses.

Foreign workers. This is a touchy subject but I feel I have no choice but to venture in. Two-third of my engineering employees are foreigners. Before you slam me for relying on cheap labour, let me declare that I pay them around 3.6k which is a typical fresh grad salary for CS people and higher than the EP requirement of 3.3k. There are key differences though, my foreign employees are generally more hardworking, take less sick leave, punctual and deliver work on time. Granted, my sample size is small but I have spoken to many other business owners and all generally have the same comments.

What about my Singaporean workers? Turnover is high. I'm willing to invest in training but they job hop the moment a better opportunity awaits. Half of my Singaporean engineers have been in the job for less than six months. Singaporean workers cost more by the virtue of the CPF and male employees (most coders and engineers are male anyway) have reservist obligations. I'm willing to pay these costs to hire a local but you guys should not make things more difficult for me.

To end of, blame the business owners in Singapore all you want. However, do understand the limitations we face and don't throw your entitlement mentality around. If you that capable, why are you not in Silicon Valley earning the high salaries instead of complaining about local businesses. I read post  some time back and it deserves a mention once more as it matches my sentiments exactly.

Hi! I need some advice from the community here. I'll try to be as concise as possible, in case of TL:DR. 

I am under a lot of stress, and now I think i need to solve a problem regarding my gf, but I'm afraid my stress level may cloud my judgement, hence the appeal for advice. 

I think my gf has a spending problem. She is working now (2.6k/mth), while i am a final year student. After my internship ended in July this year, we went overseas in August. She financed a part of her share of the trip by taking a loan from me ($800). She has finished paying it off as of now. Meanwhile, she has entered into 2 monthly financial obligations, relatively big compared to her earnings. Orthodontics ($200/mth), insurance ($300/mth). These are necessary items, so I don't think it's a spending problem. 

The problem is she is still following the lifestyle she had back when she was still on monthly allowance from her parents. She spends a lot monthly on facial products that I have no idea what they are, or whether she is paying a fair price for them. But generally I think she subconsciously think cheaper = worse quality. Some alarm bells rang last night when she wanted to buy lipbalm. We went in and out of Watson, but she only bought some floss from Watson. We did saw some generic lipbalm there, around $4 each. Next stop was Sephora, and she found the lipbalm she was looking for, $16 each. I was a bit shocked and asked her, "Why so ex? 4x more?" She replied "a lot of ppl say it's better." I remarked, "City Harvest is also ex what, and alot of ppl think it's good too."

She stormed out of Sephora, and I sent her home, without speaking a word on the way. 

As of this morning, we are on a bit of cold war over my remark last night. 

What do you guys think? Or is it just me being stingy? I tried imagining married life, but i foresee that we will quarrel a lot over money when we get married. Or is this just stress from school playing tricks on my mind?

Would be very thankful for any kind advice. Sorry for long post.

I'm someone who is pretty good at maths. And I always think I'm smart because I'm good at numbers and stuff. But it has dawned on me that no matter how good you are, there's someone who's better.  But the sad thing is, I want to be one of the best, and i want to handle exam papers no matter how DIFFICULT it is. But it seems that I can't. And I'm very very depressed over it. (I did put in a lot of effort too... And when the paper is unconventional, i can't handle it. And I envy the top students who can. I know people will say there's many out there who also put in effort but can't do it too. But then again if you console yourself with this, you are never going to make it to the top.) becoming very unmotivated and disappointed with myself. And it's only year two sem 1. How? Should I push myself further or just be an average student.  Of course there's more to it other than your grades, but when my ego kicks in...I can't handle disappointment. Sorry for the rant, I'm easily depressed

Hi I really need advice so please don't filter thank you! I'm a science student in JC and I'm not sure to apply for life science or economics. I scored B for both subjects in As. TBH I'm not sure if I'm a science or arts student. I mean I like biology. But do I love it? Urm not sure. I guess I get science on the superficial level if you get what I mean. But going in depth doesn't spark an interest in me. Economics on the other hand kinda does. (I guess Econs it is then) But I am very much aware that Econs is much much more than those case studies we got in JC. So how is Econs like as a major? I'm terribly confused. Would appreciate if any econs major could share their experiences and the career prospects of an economic major. thank you!

Hope a prof can answer this. Are we allowed to report group members who contribute absolute crap and sloppy work?  He does contribute to discussions and turn up for group meetings, but it is so damn clear from his attitude that he doesn't give a shit about it.  When we assign roles, he would always take the easiest one and even then most of his work is just copy paste from internet with almost 0 personal input. I ran his part through a plagiarism check and it came back something like 90% plagiarized. And since i'm somewhat the editor where i put everyone's work together, i end up i need to totally redo his part, on top of my own, as I simply cannot accept such crap work in the report.

So i ask again, are we allowed to report such idiotic group members? Or perhaps just don't include his name in the report? I've done that before btw, and i wont hesitate to  do it again. This guy is not my friend after all since our grouop was randomly formed by the prof.

Debate time ! 
Topic of the day : 

How many people here agree that girls gain significant advantage in male dominated fields like Engineering and IT ? For example, the boss needs to pick one particular person to handle difficult clients , let's rate capabilities by efficieny percentage, say if the guy is 80% efficient and the girl is 70% efficient , the boss will choose the girl. Same goes for during promotion . These are very common scenarios .

Do u agree with this ? And why?

Just wanted to ask is a 2nd lower class degree going to get you anywhere in life? All the good companies require a much higher CAP score as just a basic qualification. Really low on self esteem here feel like I am going to end up no where. I am in the middle of my second year first semester and I already feel like life is going all haywire on me and I just don't feel like doing anything anymore. Is it even possible to bring up my cap by a significant margin as I have heard that it is really really difficult? Who is going to offer me a job? Anybody has any experience motivating themselves from this kind of situation?

Not advocating the introvert-extrovert division, but there are some bits in this article that make sense. 

http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/09/introverts-at-school-overlook/407467/?single_page=true

"The way in which certain instructional trends—education buzzwords like “collaborative learning” and “project-based learning” and “flipped classrooms”—are applied often neglect the needs of introverts. In fact, these trends could mean that classroom environments that embrace extroverted behavior—through dynamic and social learning activities—are being promoted now more than ever. These can be appealing qualities in the classroom, of course, but overemphasizing them can undermine the learning of students who are inward-thinking and easily drained by constant interactions with others."

Peace :)

To OP define did badly. And no worries. Its actually very easy to get C for MA1101R. I got a single digit for my mid-terms (10+%) when the average was like above 80% for the paper. Never did a single tutorial. and studied a few days before lab test and finals. Just make sure you go for tutorials and the lab really helps alot in your understanding. Skipped the last topic but i guess its really high weightage. Good luck.

Hi all,

I have a few enquires and I hope some of you kind souls out there are able to help me!

Firstly, is it true that all engineering courses will be similar for the first year, eg, learning the basics for every engineering element etc, or this is only valid for common engineering?

Secondly, does common engineering course allows an individual to take a specific route such as aeronautical or computer engineering when we reach year 2?

Lastly, I am interested to be an engineer but I am still unsure on which field to take, is it advisable for me to take common engineering and be exposed to various fields and make the decision from there? (Provided that the second question I asked is valid)

Thank you!

To the girl who posted  like you, I am a Social Science major and my strengths lie in Mathematics. Getting As for the Math modules will really lead to doubt and uncertainty about the choice you made. 

Perhaps you might want to ask yourself, why you chose the Arts major in the first place? Intellectual curiosity? Or maybe you value the usefulness of an Arts degree more than that of a Math degree? 

Everyone has their own reasons and perspectives for choosing their major. While earning big bucks may not be the reason, it's not wrong to choose something just because you want to explore that field of knowledge. To each his own. 

There are times when I doubt myself, but I just tell myself not to think so much and to be in the present. All the best.

I'm an engineering student in the midst of applying for Industrial Attachment. There's this particular slot in which both engineering and marketing related tasks are involved, which appeals to me I guess, but the engineering part seems to be totally unrelated to the engineering I'm studying. The hiring peeps said that those from my course are eligible to intern, though.

Any input or advice? Would I be somewhat wasting my time on my course so far? Additional info: I am somewhat sick of my course lol. Anyone else who's had similar IA experience, particularly engin peeps? Thanks a lot!

Any computer engineering students able to give some insight into student life in this course like free time, running around, workload etc?

I am in my last year of school, and in my course, it's compulsory to take FYP. My most dreaded project. FYP makes me feel so dumb, I can't do it, I just feel so lost and then getting depressed and upset when I have to do it. My prof said I'm not doing enough, and I might not be allowed to continue next sem, which means I can't graduate. This makes me feel so depressed and I always dread working on it. I don't know what to do. I can't do it, but I want to graduate on time too. I just feel like quitting school right now and just screw this whole stupid system.

To the OP of , your sympathy is appreciated, but as it stands the system seems to work perfectly fine for NUSSU and other Faculty Clubs, so the system stays. #justsaying 

And to the OP of , , , allow me to show my deepest appreciation for your astute remarks (no, I am not being sarcastic, but you may assume it if you so fancy). We need Science students to be more like you: deeply concerned about the state of affairs in Science Club, ethical & logical, and burning with passion to see Science Club follow the will of Science students. I would love to see Science students become more active in choosing and learning more about the people who wish to serve them better, I really do.

Indeed, the decisions are controversial and are 'undemocratic' because they go against the collective votes of Science students. Since this is of such great concern to you, please do spread the word about this among Science students so that they would pay more attention during Open Elections (not 'external elections', mind you). We need more Science students to take Elections and the Candidates more seriously, and in doing so hopefully attract people of great caliber to contest the positions in the Management Committee!

To  For the record, the people who got voted 'NO' weren't that far off actually. In fact, none of the candidates who  failed Open Elections really were. All candidates received more than 50% of the vote, so without factoring NUSSU regulations on 60% minimum, all of them were technically supported by the majority of Science students, no? (Pun intended). Of course, you aren't convinced and have decided to bring this up on NUSWhispers, which you think works much better than confronting the Management Committee directly. 

Since you are so convinced of the ineptness of the VP, pray do raise a petition of some sort with several other signatories to prove your point. Do include good anecdotal evidence of her lack of competence, to strengthen your argument, because you lack grounds for this statement other than 'going against the collective will of the students' or 'decide to ignore our opinions' (I do not share the same opinion as you, so please do not speak for me. You neither asked for my opinion nor are psychic, or you are probably a deplorable one.) 

Science Club Management Committee takes its members seriously, and they do not simply accept people simply because 'a position needs to be filled'. They had left positions vacant over previous years, mind you. As for this new VP, I find no reason to doubt her: she was chosen as the best Management Committee Member in the previous Management Committee, which indicates the approval of her past fellow MC members. 

More over, she passed a panel interview by the new Exco of the Management Committee, who were properly elected during Open Elections. By questioning their judgment, are you then calling the Science students stupid for electing them earlier? I must applaud you for your audacity.

To the OP of , my dear learned friend, do share more of this 'relevance' you speak of. You seem to best understand the 'relevant matters' of Science Club/Science students, much better than the current members of the Management Committee. Pray, do share more with them, or better still, join them. Last I checked, they are still short of members to fill roles in the Management Committee. There lies your chance to indeed make the decisive difference to end the indifference to Science Club. Your inaction is a great loss to Science Club indeed. 

And finally, to the OP of , the poor unfortunate soul who received 'spam' from members of the Management/Sports Committee, forgive my friends their trespasses, but the NUS PDPA coverage sadly does not include mobile phones or their associated platforms such as WhatsApp. (You are free to protest otherwise to OSA, #justsaying).

You are disturbed by the lack of transparency in conducting committee recruitment and raise issues of exclusiveness in selection of members. Well, I am sure you must be aware that OPEN committee selection was held previously, and that they did not get enough members needed for their committee. Clearly, if you were lacking project members, you'd go to a person you trust more readily (his name is 'friend') over a total stranger. (You're welcome to join this committee, by the way, if you love a good sport!) The issue highlighted here isn't about openness, but a lack of participation. And before any smart-alecks would chime that it means 'no confidence' within Science Club, I would like to say, bollocks. 

As a responsible Science student, I feel the great need to address your claims because I just love Science Club, and I have spent much time, effort and energy into making it a better place. I would like to think that you do so too, or why else would you be going to such extents to point out its flaws? I look forward to meeting you in the Science Club Room, it's located beside LT24, open from 10am - 5pm on weekdays. I look forward to a lively discussion on making Science a better place for all ;)

GER1000 is a complete joke. You get marked down for knowing your concepts and your peers get marks for getting conceptual error. Furthermore, in order to plot a bell curve, their MCQ questions are ambiguous at its best. Any attempt to seek clarification is impossible because the instructional team will either just ignore you, or blatantly tease you for addressing the person wrongly on the forum. Well done. (Y)

Oh and PS, you will also get your marks deducted for not booking for a project meeting slot with your Tutor within 36 hours of notice through that one and only email.

Sorry uh, seriously cannot take it anymore.

Sometimes I wonder what is the Science Club Management Committee thinking. Sacrificinng their life, time and studies  for a bunch of Kkids who doesn't appreciate  what they get. Without these SCMC members, where does your welfare  pack items come  from. Have you ever compared your pack to those of other faculties? The amount of effort they put in are only repaid  with stupid comments and unappreciative remarks. 

The election system is so flawed letting a bunch of monkeys vote base on popularity. Perhaps its time NUSSU rethink about the open elections and actually do something about  it.

From a science alumni.

 Well played. You elicited the response you wanted; you must have known that they were quick to anger. The pugnaciousness and irrationality of certain students trained in rigorous methods of rational and scientific study are now dragged into the light.

Do other faculty clubs have such drama too? I feel that after the sexism season it's time to move on to something concrete, such as bettering our learning and CCA environments through active whistleblowing. Fortunately or not I have nothing to report, but an anonymous platform like this is excellent for such endeavours. (Not sure if you'll need Tor or seven proxies.)

 In another context. I am a graduate from FASS. People come up to me and say that studying in FASS is a waste of time because they can borrow the books in the library and read it. Again, it takes time to understand what you are reading and thinking about the implications. People like to belittle others when they are ignorant.

To OP of 

Since when has that faculty club you mentioned has ever be of relevance to its science student population? All the activities that the faculty club organised has always reached out to the same group of students. The attendance of their Internal election held recently is also of pathetic attendance. Thus, "Science Club", a representative of student body for science, I think much transformation is needed before they can ever say that statement.  I think we shouldnt waste too much time on them.

Is it a good time to join ccas in final year? I know we are most likely going to be tied up with fyp, not sure if i should still join ccas since i'm not sure if i can cope. However, i haven't been very active in my first 2 years and would like to try sth new before i graduate. Anyone has any experiences to share?

I need some advice on what kind of (acoustic) guitar to buy. I'm a total beginner and have no idea what brand/model I should get. Any expert guitarists can give me some advice? Some additional stuff about tuning it and use of guitar picks would help too. Budget: Max 400. Thanks in advance!

Is it really worth the effort to ensure that your report contains good English with some flair and no grammatical errors etc., if the prof is from China? Or would it be better to do otherwise since they would be more likely to understand not-so-good English anyway? Not trying to be mean. Genuinely curious here. Thanks.

This is just a rant.

I've been interning as a programmer at an engineering company. The software team in the company is small but a lot of the algorithms we implement are quite complicated that probably anyone who knows programming can appreciate the considerable time and mental effort required to pull it off. In fact, many of my other CS friends were impressed when I showed them the code I was working on.

The problem is my manager is an electronics engineer who probably don't understand programming at all. During the meetings, whatever the team did (e.g. fixed fatal bugs after slogging for days, introduced new features after months of work) will hardly impress him and he will always ask us "So what?" and look on the verge of rolling his eyes. To be honest, I need to restrain myself from slapping him every meeting. On one occasion, someone else from another department 3D printed a phone case and showed it to my manager during the meeting and he was visibly more interested in that phone case than whatever we have done. He also insisted that we do not show him any code (not a single line) since according to him, if the product turns on, he will treat it as fine? So technically, it doesn't matter if we program anything or not?

After three years in NUS, I noticed it's like many non-programmers think programming is incredibly easy and unimportant since they can't understand what's happening below the surface. Take NUSWhispers for example, some of my non-programmers friends call it as "just a website" and thought they can easily create it themselves in a couple of days. However, NUSWhispers is actually a webapp with fairly complex source code. This probably took the developers months to write. Kudos btw! (Guess it takes another programmer to appreciate a programmer.)

All in all, what frustrates me is that while I like programming, it really sucks that your hard work is not appreciated at all. And I am doubting myself if I can work like this for the rest of my life.

I messed up pretty badly for a midterm. Below average, midterm is 20%. However I've done pretty well for all the other CAs in this mod. If I manage to do really well in the finals, would I still be able to get an A? Prof Ben's advice would be appreciated :)

Reading the comments on the recent post on IB salaries made me realise that so many people are in denial. Yes, ib salaries are close to 10k a month, and this is why almost 70% of biz students aspire to IB at some point in their lives. Also, 4k is just an average. That means 90% fall within 2SD of this number. A 1st class honors in biz can easily snag a 6k salary straight off graduation with the right resume and interview skills.

"here is the msg (dun spam, just send to friends):

Hi! This a message from Science Sports Comm 16. We currently have positions available from each department and are still doing closed recruitment! But first, here is more information on Sports Comm and what we do! Sports Comm organises the following events: Sweat!, Science Sports Games (SSG), Night Rider 1 & 2 and last but not least IFG!

Sweat! is a sports exposure organised for Science students to introduce them to less known sports. SSG is like IFG but within Science where Science students form teams with their friends to play in various sports as friendly competition! Night Rider 1&2 are night cycling events where Science freshies sign up with their orientation groups from various camps and go cycling and suppering through the night. Lastly, IFG is a NUS-wide event in which Sports Comm hosts 2 of the many sports and also cover our Science athletes in action!

So if you're interested in Sports Comm and are willing to commit for this long work period, please contact xxx at xxx with your full name and email to arrange an interview slot."

So this is a message that I received in a group chat about Science Club subcommittee recruitment. I am baffled by the word 'closed recruitment'. 

Does it mean that if one is not 'friends' with the committee members, one is not allowed to join? Is this the kind of exclusiveness that a students' club is supposed to have?

I initially thought that these committees are around to give everyone an equal opportunity to learn and grow but yet, it has been reduced to a friend-recruit-friend situation.

to  IB salaries are above 10K, rather than "close to". Source: biz student myself, have close friends in IB. But these people are brilliant and they work so hard. Going home at 2AM is considered early. The job is also highly demanding and stressful. It's not for everyone.

I will take Computer Science, but being from JC, I have absolutely no prior experience in this field. Nonetheless, I have passion in this field which is why I applied for CS.

Any advice on what I should do now in this 6 months before I matriculate? Maybe get abit of insight in this field? If so, any recommendations on what I should read? Or am I just being paranoid and theres actually nth I need to do and wait till I actually matriculate? Tkxx alot in adv

To the OP of  and  
I transferred out from Science to FASS after spending two years in science. It wasn't easy. Like you, I did badly for my Science modules and got Cs and Ds. But at the same time, I took a few FASS modules as UE in the major that I wanted to study in and scored really well in them, scoring As and A-. So in that sense, I got my transfer because they looked at my FASS grades. Also, after performing well in those modules, I did talk to some of the profs from that major and they said that my performance showed that I would be very suitable for that major. One of them decided to help me along by writing in a letter as well.

Thing is, just because you are bad at science doesn't mean you will be good in FASS. The school needs to know that you are not just transferring to FASS because you hate science. Your intention to transfer to FASS should be based on how much interest and at the same time how well you would do in FASS. You need to give them that assurance. How can you know that you actually want to study in FASS if you've only taken 1 or none of their modules? My advice for you is to simply take FASS modules next sem without any science modules and really do well in them. 

In all likeliness, you will have to spend an extra year or at least an extra semester. But if this is what you want then it really is worth it.

I have a problem. 

My girl has needs; to be stroked more than 3 times a day and she requires much tender loving care, all in the privacy of my room and sometimes in a public area, where the excitement allows for greater pleasure. However, I simply cannot provide for this due to my busy schedule (school work and all).

Hence, she's up for sale, $2200, with a fresh set of Elixer strings on this babe.

To 

One of my friends worked at an investment bank fresh out of graduation and his pay is well above 10k a month with an annual bonus of >40k. So his annual salary for his first year of working is well above 120k a year. 
Technically, he can comfortably afford his own car but his parents bought one for him anyways. So now hes saving up for a house since hes paid too much to be eligible for public housing.

So yes, there are some people that can afford their own car within a year of employment.(assuming you want to buy a first hand car) I hope you read this and feel sorry for yourself because no one really gives a shit and i'm telling to this so that you'd feel like shit. Google the salaries of people in IBs if you find it hard to believe

I have already graduated last year. I regret not taking more modules that I liked instead of those easy modules. Looking back at my university life, I only remember those fun modules. Try to make the best of your time in NUS, I really miss it now :((

Do check out languages in NUS, language classes are really expensive outside. Last time I took Korean and Japanese. It was useful when I went for my grad trip to Korea and Japan! It gets difficult to find enough time to learn a new languages when you are working. Just don't take both Japanese and Korean at the same time because it gets quite confusing. 

What modules do you enjoy the most?

Was it just me or does it appear like ever since IVLE changes, there is some problem loading the webcast. For instance, I used to be able to skip easily on my laptop, but now, the moment I tried to skip, the webcast buffered for very long, so I went to do something else. But after some time, the whole thing turned blank and would not buffer anymore....it wasn't like this before IVLE changes (doesn't matter if I used new or e Classic IVLE, the same problem occured). It's like the only way I can watch the webcast is to watch from the beginning, I can't even put more than the 1X speed or the whole thing just stops:( 

Does anyone else encounter problems with webcast when trying to skip certain section? Why do ivle have to change if it's causing quite a number of problems here (all my friends did not like the new IVLE system too)?

Is it illegal to not disclose? Can the government agency find out from the hospital records since it is a government hospital? or is my medical records confidential?

Universities are businesses hiring PhD holders, researchers and staffs, and they’ve effectively engraved the idea into everyone's mind that knowledge and an opportunity at a high-paying job must be bought with hard earned money, unless you are a scholar under a scholarship.

Parents who’ve never been to college see their friends go to university and make bigger bucks. So, they want their kids to go university and hope that their kids could make big money like their university-educated peers. What the parents don’t realize is that their college-educated peers are making big bucks because they are smarter. It’s not because they have degrees.

There are many students who scrape through university by selecting easy modules and majors irrelevant to the job they want to do, just to get that paper hoping to get a higher pay and survive in Singapore. And now they’re taking a job that doesn't even need the training provided by that degree.  And who knows, the money used to pay for their degrees and the time spent in university can be utilized to start their own business if they are more street smart than academically inclined. A degree with your name neither guarantees a happy ending, nor does it guarantee a head start in life for you.

Universities should only be for people who are planning to work in highly intellectual or specialized fields; researchers, engineers, professors, scientists, lawyers, doctors etc. But reality is, not everyone will be working in these fields. In fact, most university students will work in jobs where building relationships are more important than contemplating theories, studying complex cases or inventing the next big thing.

As too many people are going to university, we have destroyed the true meaning of a higher education and made it into an artificial job qualification, some called it an "education inflation". What is saddening is that we stigmatize anyone who doesn't get one of these "branded" degrees, even if he/she is brighter than the average university student in many other useful ways. And there are tons of idiots who have good degrees. I know because I've met them. They believe they know it all, yet it's nothing but smokescreen to cover up their inadequacy. 

Thus we must decide what we really want to do in life, and whether the relevant degree can help us get there. As each and every one of our ability varies, it is harmful to assume that every Singaporean student's success story is determined by being able to get into NUS/NTU/SMU/SUTD or the top schools in the world. Even as a NUS graduate with a good LL.B., I felt I should have been more opened with my options during my youth, instead of succumbing to the pressure from my parents who are both successful solicitors and advocates themselves. And now, I struggle to find my identity and my place in society. When I was given a place in NUS, I have the wishful thinking of earning a lot of money with a prestigious law degree and live to brag about it. Now to me, it's nothing but emptiness and dissatisfaction. The reward is not worth the price to pay.

You have to be the best among the best if you want your degree to even matter. If you know you can't realize your full potential in what you're currently doing, you should choose to walk a different path, yes I literally mean you should consider dropping out of NUS and pursue what you really want to do and what you are good at, be it start your own venture or go to an arts college. No risk no gain. If you are good at anything, you can make a very good living out of it. My girlfriend's dad is a hawker drawing 20 000+ dollars into his pockets per month selling Yong Tao Fu because of his amazing culinary skills, business acumen and hard work. I even suggested he should open a restaurant, but he said restaurants are expensive gimmicks to attract people who want to look good eating expensive food in front of others. He fervently believes good food will be good food regardless of how you package it, and people will know about it. Well, that's up to him. It's funny how he works in a sweaty and oily T-shirt, while I work in a clean suit and tie, and my income is not even a half of his.

If you prefer a safe route which most of us are awfully tempted to follow, then you should learn to be satisfied and cope with a less-than-expected job. This is because not everyone can be the next CEO, director, or even promoted to the next level. And that's my advice to you. Good luck my juniors! Ganbatte!

To the OP of , the general statement made by you that undergraduates who drives a car is one that they did not work hard for is an extremely unfair statement. How sure are you that the vehicle is not a product of their hard work over the years?

Undergraduates may be working, apart from studying, to finance the vehicle out of their own financial independence. I believe such a group of undergraduate drivers do exist and I personally know some of these drivers even. I sincerely hope that you can give them some credits, no doubt they are probably the minority, but they still deserve the due acknowledgements from my point of view.

To reply to your question, I guess we female asked the question is so that we could meet such drivers with the oomph and drive for a better future and that impresses us quite a bit.

Currently working full time so would like to make use of my time before the craziness begins next year. Thanks in advance!

 I was a science student in sec sch and jc (triple science all the way). Naturally I ended up choosing the sciences in NUS but I realized how much I hated it after a semester. Ended up switching to a humanities major and I just graduated this year. Don't think I've ever regretted the move to humanities. I still love science, but just not at the uni level I guess.

I am the OP of . Without FYP, I am struggling with my major already and FYP is mandatory for my major. All I hope is to graduate and look for a job to support my family. Thank you for the encouraging comments, especially the alumni who shared his life story. (Prof Ben Leong you are really cool) I am feeling less down in life today. I will work hard, and hopefully that my CAP does not drop in my final year too much.

And if I cannot do well in this degree, I am sure I can find a future in something else. 

Thank you everybody.

Referring to Prof Ben Leong's comments on the indicative grade profiles (IGP), I would like to clarify: How does the IGP help to manage demand and supply of graduates?

During a certain language module lecture, sometimes there are pop quizes. After that, the students have to put their quiz papers on the chairs the front of the LT according to their tutorial group,  indicated by a sign which is a piece of paper the lecturer has put on the chairs. 

How could anyone be so stupid as to put their quiz papers ON TOP OF the sign indicating the tutorial group!? How would other people see which is their tutorial group to  find the correct chair to put their papers?  Appalling that university students can be so inconsiderate.

I study hard for a test and then I get a D?!?!?! A freaking D. What am I doing wrong? I really envy those people who come to class and they are so well informed about everything. They perform every experiment so effortlessly in lab. Even when I read the notes, it's like I will never be on their level and that just upsets me so much. I love my course, but I can't attain that level of knowledge. It's like they immediately understand whatever the TA says, whether it's during lab/lectures. How can I reach that level of experience and knowledge? Its honestly getting depressing. For once I thought I was actually doing well. But no. Sigh. And the worst part is to be surrounded my classmates that tell you 'Oh I didn't study/ so stressed I bet I screwed up this CA!' Screw up can still get A huh??? Omg. Like what's the point of being in NUS when I can't even do well... I seriously need advice for studying science subjects. I feel so stupid :(

I am currently a year 3/final year student of the Global Engineering programme (GEP) and here are my thoughts of my whole varsity life thus far. Academically, being a GEP student, ppl (even myself) tend to have really high expectations of you and it's like getting a B+ is equivalent to failing a module and an A- is a just-pass. And living with those expectations, I managed to scrap by with first class honours by final year and it seems like the only thing I can take pride in, and why? Because my resume have got zero internship experiences due to all the cramping of MCs during all the summer vacations and stuff. And the sad thing is that many companies don't even accept final year students on their internship programmes, now I am really worried about my future

There is this friend of mine that I am doing a group project with.

Now, onto our second project, he has contributed close to nothing to the project. We are good friends, but not close enough to tell him upfront to contribute but I don't really want to email my prof and tell my prof that said friend did nothing at all. What should I do?

I take a module that has in-lecture quizzes held on IVLE. It is a big class, and due to the sheer number of people around, I can never connect to the NUS WiFi while in lecture. So I always rely on my 3G connection for internet, and accessing IVLE.

What's more is that during the quiz, 300++ students access IVLE in the space of 20 mins. What results is that each page takes approximately 5 minutes to load. The problem starts when I need to load 6 pages in total to answer 4 questions, which is impossible given the timeframe.

As a result I have lost about 2% of my grade all thanks to the robust IT infrastructure that NUS has in place. Hence I must express my gratitude to NUS Computer Centre: thanks for inventing a new way to help me lose marks! I really appreciate it!!

I don't know why I should study hard. It just seemed like a sad chore. I also think so what if I study hard, get a damn good CAP, get a damn high-paying job only to live a life full of stress and horrible workplace politics. I'd rather work in a more humble company with nice, genuine people if such a thing even exists. So I asked others why they study hard or why they think people study hard. 
1) They want to provide for their parents in return. Well call me a bad child but I never really thought much about this, we have CPF and they are earning enough to live just fine in their old age.
2) They aim to have a bright future with their significant other and perhaps start a family. I have no SO, only a heartbreak.
3) They simply enjoy what they are studying. For me, not really maybe just a slight interest. 
4) Typical kiasu Singaporeans - they just want to do very well/be the best among the best and are afraid of losing out. That's not me and frankly I really don't like the environment here at times.
The only reason why I'm still studying is because it is damn burden if I have to repeat my modules and NUS fees are so freaking expensive that I need to get some job to eventually repay them and not feel completely cheated.
I was motivated studying for O Levels as I thought getting into a good JC was such a nice, prestigious little thing and my future would be bright. Now I see myself studying just to become another corporate drone, working on boring things.
Tell me why you people study so hard, I don't understand anymore. For those who are not secretly enjoying this because I'm a bell-curve angel, save me.

Even now in my final year, I always wonder about this, on whether the minimum grade of admission to a particular major in uni is determined by demand and supply, or by the difficulty of the course of study.

The grade profile shows that most law students need to attain almost straight 'A's for their A Levels to gain admission, while you can afford a few Bs and Cs to gain admission into let's say engineering. But I doubt law is more difficult to study than engineering to THAT extent. And no, I am not an engineering major. So is it because being a lawyer seems more prestigious and profitable? And a constant high demand and limited supply in places, exerts an upward pressure on the admission criteria for law?

During my freshie year, some of my friends, who couldn't make it into other courses, chose computing because it allowed students with 'B's and 'C's. Back then, computing wasn't really that popular because we associate computing with nerds doing boring shit. However, from the Silicon Valley hype and the surge of overnight tech billionaires, we see an increase in interest in computing. And the most recent grade profile showed you must do very well to study computer science. Their admission standard is now on par with the ever popular business course. Is this due to the same upwards pressure caused by the demand and supply mechanism? So if let's say the IT sector doesn't look too favorable in the future, will admission to the computing faculty become easier as more students shun it?

When I asked friends about this, I heard a lot of explanations, ranging from economic plans by the government to conspiracy theories.

Does anyone have an idea on how it actually works?

Hi. It's B77W here. :)

Phew. Thankfully the plane that got hit by a collapsed nose gear (http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-airlines-plane/2184022.html) is not me, but an A333.

Anyway, I have a response to  Actually I think you should talk to more people. Of course, B77W, being a marvellous piece of engineering, will be biased towards an engineering job.

What is important, I feel, however, is to ask: what you really want to do. Is the salary the main driving force? Or do you want to do something that impacts lives more directly? Do know that people do change careers mid-way much more frequently now as compared to the past.

Is a general degree good? Yes and no. Yes if you're undecided and think you want to go into something remotely related. But taking a decision means opening some doors and closing others. Doing a degree in economics, for instance, is great, but it means you will find it incredibly difficult to convince someone you can go to Duke-NUS to do say, grad school med track if you suddenly think that saving lives on the operating table is your kind of job. But don't let what B77W deter you from chasing your dreams.

Remember, B77W always hopes for others to dream far, fly high. :)

I am starting to get annoyed at my project group for their lack of 'motivation'. They do work only when asked to, and rarely offer to contribute. Some of them are busy with their personal commitments such as hall, tuition, part time jobs, sales job, going out with friends etc, and prioritise these activities over projects, leaving a few of us to cover for them, while enjoying the grades. Not only are they not apologetic for it, they will sometimes give attitude when prompted to do work, by saying they are busy, they have to go etc.

I am not someone to report them as I don't want to sour the friendships, plus I don't really see the point of reporting them. I am not hard up over grades, but just want to finish up the project nicely and forget about it. >:

Regarding to  post, I too think that some faculties in NUS which do not have local profs are hard to understand. But then, beggars can't be choosers, it would be a blessing if we can understand them, if not there's always google plus self study. I

myself have a fair share of non local profs, who do not even upload tutorial answers after setting them as tutorial questions, those are lower end tier kind of profs. What make matters worse is that the questions which the prof goes through during tutorial only benefited to those who presented as the prof will individually talk to them, while neglecting the rest of the class. Nonetheless, my peers were able to score well ranging (B to A-) in that module just by self studying, so.. don't lose hope!

Why does it appear like most Ang moh lecturers does not have a fixed structure to their curriculum? Sometimes lessons are so unstructured that we do not know what might be tested for exams...previous batches have feedback in the survey but still they continue teaching in an unstructured manner. Does anyone else have this issue? Why is it that only Ang moh prof teach in an unstructured manner? And their CAs are kinda weird, not your usual write an essay kind or tests, but rather things like making videos, cards, which means only creativity can help you go beyond the average. Seriously thought this was annoying since most of us are quite used to a structured environment...does anyone felt the same way?

Hi NUS friends. I am an NS guy and I plan to apply into NUS during the next application period. I did well for my A Levels and I am eligible for all the courses based on the indicative grade profile. I am equally interested in particularly two majors, engineering and law. However, I think it's better to seek the opinions of the students to have a clearer picture for career opportunities. I heard most engineering graduates do not really get to innovate and build the cool stuff in their career, most would usually end up doing boring paper work or maintenance jobs in Singapore, and many ended up going into the civil service or finance which I think is a waste of the rigorous engineering training. Also, although a recent article showed law graduates get a significant higher starting pay, however it's difficult to get a legal career due to an oversupply of lawyers. I am really interested in both subjects but I can only choose one. And the path for a suitable job is very blurry. How do you guys actually decide on your 1st choice? Or is it better for uncertain students to take a general degree such as business or social science, and then specialize in their graduate studies? Thanks in advance.

How do you take advice/opinions/criticisms? I joined a sport that I have no prior experience in, so during and after trainings the seniors always point out my mistakes and give advice. I am not offended by this and I greatly appreciate their help. The problem is, I usually don't have anything to say, so my response is to just silently nod with the occasional "mmhmm" and "okay". During NS I was accused of being rude and disrespectful to my superiors for my kind of response and was eventually marked down for this. I do not think highly of myself and am very open to criticism; in fact I'm non-confrontational so even if the criticism is not constructive, I won't argue back. Obviously my RBF isn't a great help. Anyone can give me some advice (pardon the ironic request)?

After part 2 of a certain heat module in Mechanical Engineering. I swear my belief in professors attending courses in communicating effectively is further strengthened. CELC can u do something about the quality of profs and tutors in Engineering. Im not too sure about other faculties but the casualty rate in Engineering is too damn high. What's the use of recruiting these star studded lecturers when they can't give a lecture without chasing out 3/4 of the lecture hall? I dont need a SUPER prof... I sincerely respect a particular prof who doesnt give a hoot about anything and wears t shirt and pants walking around in school. Oh god pls save us.... Admin pls post this thanks!

I have this prof who is not local and a handful of us cannot understand his accent (not sure if this apply to the majority but some of my friends did complain that we can't understand him) and he did know that as we also feedback to him about this issue. When I tried asking questions over email because i couldn't understand him, he did answer to those qns but then, I was told that next time if I didn't Google and ask him qns directly, he would not reply to those that can be googled. Truth is, I googled and guess what? Some of the Googled answer contradicts his answer! Furthermore, it appeared as though he did not read my qns properly sometimes and failed to answer my qns. I felt that since his accent may be a problem for some of us, I think the least he can do is to try help us clarify our qns over email properly, because online sources are not always reliable. Yes you may argue that we can read academic papers for a more accurate view but I thought it's rather difficult to extract a small piece of information I need from so many words in a paper. The time could have been better used to revise further or practice more don't you think? Asking him qns directly after lecture may not be a wise choice for me since I may have problem understanding his accent and thus it's a waste of my time and his time to ask him after lecture.

This is not the first time things like this happen. A few times in previous semesters, a prof, also not local, have an accent so terrible that almost the whole cohort was complaining. When we asked him qns, sometimes he don't bother replying at all! And it's not as though this module is an easy module...

What should I do? Does anyone have any idea how to effectively extract answer to your qns within the shortest time possible from an academic paper? 

I heard that some prof don't really want to spend too much time on students emails as good teaching doesn't really determine if they can continue as prof in NUS, but instead, it's their standard of research that determine if they get to stay on. Thus not all will feel obliged to help students. Is this true?

This was the first time I ever had a prof telling me to google first before asking, which I did but just that I do not trust online sources too much. Should I rebut him over email and show him what exactly Google gave me? Or just leave it and avoid asking him qns next time if possible, since he does not seems too willing to spend much time answering students' emails?

Please advice...

need advice on coping. I'm a freshman, trying a double major, in a sport cca and a committee, and giving tuition 6 hours a week over 3 days. have been finding it difficult to cope recently as I have been letting unwatched lectures snowball while I studied for midterms. with my current workload and committments, is it still realistic to aim for a honors with highest distinction? my most recent midterms have been results of around B+ which I know is quite off the average of A- for the honors im aiming for. seeking advice from double major/degree students with several extracurricular committments to share how they cope with all the work, please help!

Dear fellow university comrades, I'm currently embarking upon my honors thesis project and I would love to get your support! (I must confess I'm pretty desperate)

In a system where students have to balance their school workload and any personal commitments, levels of stress and anxiety may be high.

Students may inadvertently pursue erroneous strategies to fulfill their duties, like sacrificing sleep which could compromise cognitive functioning.

This study aims to demonstrate that the various strategies will help students be more effective and improve their overall well-being and effectiveness. Moreover, the study is interested in adherence to these strategies.

This study is eligible for University students only and will be held during the period of late Oct – mid Nov 2015.

 Wow the commentators should read properly. OP's heart is on philosophy but felt pressurized to study something that the job market want. It's a rare thing to have philosophical-bending when our society discourages it. I encourage OP to nurture it by studying it. It's not enough to just read philosophy books. You need to do it in a dialectic manner in a classroom with your peers and your professors.

Hi, I'm currently still in ns. I'll be going to uni in 2017. Can I just get some advice in what degree should I major in and whether smu or nus is more suitable for me. 

I'm more of a jack of all trades but I detest science. I'm fine with math and gp and econs. Or rather I love subjects which involve crafting arguments and having different points of view. Hence my interest in philosophy. But my worry is that it isn't a very "job oriented" degree. I love to read up on many theories formulated by ppl. As for uni, I'm stuck between smu and nus. Smu because of convenience, nus because of student life?
I need advice please.... deperately. Thanks!

This is a dota 2 post, so you can skip it if you dont play. 

I normally play 5 stack with my friends on most weekends (and sometimes weekday nights if i have time ). First I must say that it's really a lot of fun playing with them cos of all the stupid and crazy stuff they do like trying to 1 v 5 the whole enemy team, going 0-10 as a carry, doing stupid strategies like sunder dagon on terrorblade etc.

And therein lies the problem. Most of them are really CMI   despite playing for many years now, but of cos I never tell them that cos those games are all just  for fun only. Now i'm not trying to boast or what but I think  I really need another group of ppl to 5 stack with and have a serious game (not competitive standards but decent enough). 

FYI my solo mmr is high 4k-ish, i think around 4870 last i checked.  I was calibrated at 4k then worked my way up. But my team mmr is WAY lower, due to the party I normally play with. Some of you might say, well then just go play solo mmr if you want a game with higher standards. Yeah but you know... dota 2 is a team game and it's obviously way more fun talking and strategizing over skype. In solo mmr every now and then you will be teamed up with a complete idiot. And yes even at 4.8k mmr I still encounter idiotic pinoys who think they are the next s4 or sumail.

So yeah, if any of you are looking for a decent team or open to the idea of forming an NUS team or soemthing do comment below and I may PM you. Do note that by "decent" i mean having standards of 4.5k mmr or higher. In fact the higher the better so I can perhaps learn more as well.

"Let me explain. The happiest undergraduate on campus would be able to use his degree scroll like a normal scroll, that is, he would look into it and see his results exactly as they are. Does that help?" 

The Dean's Lister thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we have worked for... whatever we have worked for..." 

"Yes and no," said the Chancellor quietly. 

"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate deeds we have done on campus. You, who have mugged hard, consulted your lecturers, see your research fellows standing around you. The Second Lower, who has always been overshadowed by your comrades, sees himself as a businessman, the richest of all of them. However, this scroll will give us neither knowledge or truth. Undergraduates have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible."

Hi, i have posted earlier to ask if it is wrong for me to request slides (via email) from the lecturer/tutorial. I understand that NUS promotes inductive learning but i really feel that the slides would help me better with my revision. I even request them to upload it onto ivle if they find that just giving the slides to me is unfair to other students. I even ask to talk to the professor in charge of the mod (since she personally replied me after my tutor forward her my msg) so i can explain myself. But can i ask if i am wrong? Should i just not push for it? Please advice.

To  and , there are ways to hold nussu accountable. One way is to attend the nussu council meetings which are held once every few months, but sadly normal students have no voting rights during such meetings.

Another more effective way is to call an extraordinary general meeting (eogm). If you look at nussu's regulations (http://bit.ly/1VI2Wv8 and http://bit.ly/1QcvQSP), you can call a general meeting in 3 steps:

1. gather 45 friends + you (ie 46 students) to demand that such an eogm be held.
2. make sure at least 100 students attend the eogm (if less than 100 students then eogm will be postponed 3 days later).
3. get more than half of those attending to vote for your motion/motions.

What motions can be decided during an eogm? Well, you can kick out the nussu president or any exco member that you do not like or even the entire exco or council, as long as you can garner the support of more than half of those attending the eogm. Heck, even the very act of forcing an eogm to throw out the president will force him/her to come out and defend himself/herself (basically to be accountable).

There is also a referendum method, but the thresholds to getting one being held is too high, so don't bother.

However, nussu is now so irrelevant that the vast majority of students don't give two hoot about them. The only ones who give two hoots are those who are interested in defending them. Although every revolution begins with a spark, you need a tinderbox for the spark to work and that tinderbox is sorely missing in nussu. 

If I were you, I rather spend my time on more productive and relevant student/external organisations. Just treat the $24 you pay nussu every year as money wasted down the drain and be happy with the occasional welfare pack/welfare giveaways that you get from them on the occasions that they decide to descend from their Ivory Tower of Irrelevancy.

p.s. not sure how fast nussu will take down the regulations page since such regulations are disadvantageous to them and they have a habit of ignoring them as and when they desire.

I'm taking a mod that requires us to write essays. The lecturer just put up the CA question not long ago and I recently just emailed him regarding the essay and how to approach it. Yet I keep having this feeling that I'm semi cheating. CAs are for us to gauge where we are and how well we understand. But I've emailed and received "tips" from the lecturer, though he posted my question on forum so everyone could see. But I still feel insecure and weird. But if I don't ask him then I will feel insecure too. Agh the struggle for results and not deceiving myself.

to add on to the whole QET thing going on.

I'm a poly student, and in my first year, sem 1, it pissed me off SO much that I had to group with JC students who had no idea how to write an academic paper. The style of writing, the APA formats, the whole lot. I, too, thought GP covered it. Guess not.

thank God you guys learn fast though so by year 2 it was all good (Y)

It is the 21st century. For more than 30 years a Chancellor has sat on his chair in the university. He is the master of undergraduates by the will of the government, and shareholder of a hundred companies by the might of his inexhaustible funds. He is an old man writhing invisibly with power from the university rankings. He is the Lord of NUS for whom thousands of souls mug every day, so that his legacy may never truly die.

Yet even from his seat of power, the Chancellor continues his eternal vigilance. Shuttle buses cross the student-infested miasma of the campus, the only route between distant faculties, their way lit by the Route, the psychic manifestation of the Chancellor's will. Undergraduates fight for the school in his name on the soils of many countries. Greatest amongst his legions are the Dean's Listers, unnaturally gifted super-muggers. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Office of Student Affairs and countless department lecturers, the ever-vigilant Registrar's Office and the techies of the ComCenter to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat of CCAs, hall life, rag & flag, and worse.

To be an undergraduate in such times is to be one amongst untold thousands. It is to live in the cruellest and most unforgiving regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of open-book exams and lecturer hints, for so much has been culled, never to be re-introduced. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark campus there is only memorization. There is no peace in the discussion rooms, only an eternity of mugging and projects, and the laughter of the bell curve god.

Some ppl have been talking about choosing mods that you like, instead of mods that you find easier to do well in, (the best is if both apply lah), and I totally agree. Not a math major, but enjoy taking math mods, and yet don't do v well. I don't know, sometimes I feel like I am just digging my own grave taking up math modules because I take VERYYY long to understand, and always pon lectures as I find it better if I can pause to digest info. Plus my major totally unrelated to math, so competition damn stiff. But srsly, at the end of the day, I am always amazed that I enjoy learning the subject, although not everything makes sense (hence aforementioned avg/ below avg results). BUT my point is, for those unsure abt what mods to take, just take mods that you enjoy! I believe that if you take mods that interest you, however badly you do, you will always learn something new/ meaningful/ interesting. Better than memorising stuff that you dun like. Some might say that needa maintain CAP, choose those easy mods which they are not interested in But CAP 是死的, 人是活的。

谢谢。

So my previous post from 2 days ago got filtered out. hopefully this one doesn't get the same fate, just because "election fever" is over. The thing is that this topic has got to be ever present versus just seasonal. This is precisely the reason nussu isn't able to engage the student population. 

I really have an issue with the Nussu exco election. I made the special trip down to school on my free day just to vote. But I am terribly disappointed by the lack of transparency thereafter. 

Recently, i came across an acquaintance's post on the nussu exco photoshoot. I was shocked to see some people included in it. I don't understand how people who have not been elected (and the results that are posted on their fb page clearly stating a NO status and some with the lowest percentage of votes) are in the final line up of the exco. 

Did someone drop out and another took over the place? Is that constitutionally valid? If that happened, shouldn't it be announced at least? They definitely owe us an explanation at least. And surely as constituents and voters we should have the right to information. 

My suspicion is that the ones who got voted in from the 2 opposing teams ultimately could not (or may be did not want to) work together as one and hence they vacated the positions. If that's the case, it speaks volumes of the election campaigning process & the candidates themselves. Not just of those who left but those who aren't willing to work together.

To  QET is usually just taken by poly grads and international students... I'm an FASS freshie from a local polytechnic and I've already learnt critical and academic writing from my modules in Poly, so I'm fortunate that writing essays or papers is something I'm used to, considering the nature of my course. I was still required to take the QET because I didn't have 'A' level credentials, but I cleared it with no problem. One of my poly friends didn't clear it though, which is puzzling because I've worked with her before and her writing skills are better than mine....

I also see quite a few of the JC people struggling, because being good in GP/English does not equal to being good with academic writing. They are clueless to APA/MLA citations, plagiarism, the type of language/vocabulary required etc. It's not fair to both sides: those who already learnt critical writing are sometimes forced to take modules they don't need, and those who are clueless are expected to learn on their own without proper instruction or guidance. The QET is not really a good way to gauge and it seems that there needs to be a review of how NUS evaluates a student's writing and language abilities, and how to help them if they do not measure up. 
-
 
It's hilarious when I scored A for GP and A1 for English at the 'O' Levels but I'm still required to read the "Critical Thinking and Writing" module. I might be able to write better than the average FASS undergraduate after reading a fair share of FASS modules that involved group work, where I often ended up proofreading and correcting my groups' papers.

I empathise with the stereotype that engineers cannot read or write after observing the cohort's demographics, but wasting my time and two electives on something I've already mastered is simply inefficient. Even if the 'A' and 'O' Level grades are not seen as reliable indicators, I'm more than willing to take a QET to prove my capabilities.

It appears inconsistent to me that an FASS undergrad gets away with just passing the QET when they clearly require stronger writing and communication skills. Or are they expected, instead, to pick that up throughout their candidature?

Thank God CELC offers ES1501x.

NUS has recently been ranked high in Global University Rankings. I come from a faculty in which NUS has done very well in, falling behind respectable institutions like MIT, Cambridge and doing better than schools like UCLA etc, just to name a few.

In its bid to achieve academic excellence, many has been sacrificed in the system. The way the school identifies the brightest is sometimes problematic and vicious, because in front of the Bell Curve God, we often pray that our fellow course mates do badly. Or we see selfish behaviour amongst students. What sort of wicked mentality is this? Of course, there are people in groups who are always very willing to help each other. It also does not help that the system recognises how well the students cram for the examinations and tests, but overlooks how the students may have been exemplary in their skills or activities outside of academic matters, which are permanent in nature.

Also, when there are stories that employers do not look at your degree to determine your prospects, the hard truth is that they do look at it and uses the academic results to separate out candidates from the rest. I know the Government does at least, where a Second Lower and First Class can have a salary difference of at least $1000. In addition, the person with second lower class honours can expect to remain stagnant in their career unless they do well in the one opportunity they are given.

Life is indeed stressful. We all need to catch a break at times. All the best everyone, and may the odds be in your favour. 

Let the 76th Hunger Games begin.

I chanced upon the NTU confessions page and was appalled at the poor English of almost all the confessions. I don't wish to say this but it truly makes the NUSWhispers page here seem so much more intelligent and elite. I'm just wondering why do NTU students have a relatively poorer command of the English language compared to NUS students. I've also heard before, that NTU students tend to be more Chinese-speaking compared to NUS students, but seriously the command of English as I've witnessed on that page is really subpar. "There are some courses in NTU that are just suck!" and no one comments below about this very embarrassing mistake.

University life is like playing Pokemon. 

It doesn't matter how hard you study but rather, how effectively you do it. Even a level 50 Pokemon that has been EV trained to maximise its potential can beat a level 100 Pokemon that has been trained brainlessly. Don't worry too much about those people who study hard 24/7. Find a technique that works for you and you will be able to do more in less the amount of time.

Of course, like in Pokemon, everyone is born different. Some lucky ones are born with perfect IVs and Nature. These are the ones that seem to excel at anything they do. Instead of competing against them, work together with them. No matter how strong an individual is, a group of individuals will be even stronger. Just like a Pokemon party of 3 or 6, every member balances each other and covers different type effectiveness and weaknesses. There are countless other parallel lessons in life that we can apply from the seemingly childish game of Pokemon.

And that, Mom, is how "playing your Gameboy all day long" will benefit me in life.

I feel so so so burnt out. I don't remember it being so bad last sem, maybe its because I've moved up a year (but I'm still taking level 2000 mods, so there isn't much of a difference). I'm less active in hall this year as compared to last year since I no longer wish to stay next year so I didn't join a lot of activities, but I still feel so drained and I'm lagging behind. I don't really know where all my time goes to. It feels like I put in a lot of time but the work produced is really very little. It was not like this last sem so I don't know what's going on with my life anymore.

So much for teamwork in group projects. Looks like I'll be soloing for both projects for one of my modules. Again. The others are so hopelessly unmotivated or simply incompetent (not trying to be mean but it's true) that it's a futile effort trying to get them to do meaningful things anyway.

Not like I can report all of them to the prof without feeling like an arse. Oh wells. Suck it up and this will all pass. But for now it's so frustrating.

At least I have awesome groupmates for my other mods!

I feel too stupid to be in SoC. I do study hard and prepare for tutorials, but somehow manage to get all the answers wrong. I do the labs but always end up making silly errors, so while there are people who get full marks I always get a few marks less. If there's a code to be written, my peers finish it in 30 mins while I take the full 2 hours to do it in a longer and complicated way, albeit usually right way. I feel sheepish when students present the right answer and I see that I got the wrong one. As for approaching the clever students...well they travel together in their separate bunch and look slightly unfriendly. Moreover, I'm a girl and I just feel too shy to approach those guys. Problems of being in a male-dominated faculty I guess..
I think I'll be switching from SoC next sem, I just don't like the feeling of going there for classes.

I am very motivated to pursue a professional degree overseas. But my family doesn't have the finances to support me. The only way for me to pursue what i want is to take a bank loan. (around 80k minimum) However I am scared that I may not be able to pay back the debts. I am willing to work part time while studying, and during my breaks. So my question is this.. has anyone been in the same shoes as me before? How did you deal with it ? Looking for some advice on how I can go about funding my education and come out with the least debts. This is very important because the course I am interested in involves long years of studying.. Thank you so much in advance to anyone who replies! It really means alot to me :)

I am fascinated by this group of students doing push-ups and sit-ups in SoC. I notice recently that they start to add in other exercises, too. I really want to be a part of this group but I feel too awkward to ask. What should I do?

 To continue my post, I am saying that students who are not interested in engineering should consider enrolling in a course in FASS.  Stop thinking it is a dumping course where students learn useless stuffs. Open your mind to social sciences and humanities. They may mean something. FASS contains many treasures which are not yet being fully understood.

There is a demand for great user experience. Learning engineering alone is not sufficient. Their UX/UI design modules are crappy. Think about it. Which are the oldest subjects that have studied human experience?

 For those who study engineering but have no intention of being an engineer, I suggest they get an Arts degree from FASS. You will receive a broad range of education which allows you to work in diverse areas.

To OP of , i believe i can relate to your situation, cos i also stay relatively far away from NUS, and it takes me 2h plus to and fro. But the decision to come to school really depends on a few factors

1) The most practical aspect is what is the grade you are aiming for, is is an A+, A, A-, B... Of course, the higher your aim, the more reason for you to gain that extra %, since your peers will most probably get it while you won't. If you can S/U it, the decision might be more clear-cut.

2) Next, how good are you actually in your module, and relative to your peers. This is a harder conclusion to arrive at, as you can't really tell from your peers' actions and behaviour in lectures and tutorial, their degree of understanding. Personally, i will rather take it as the competition is stiff, and go for the extra %. If you are really that good, i believe this will affect you less significantly.

3) If you actually attend lessons by travelling long hours, you could also study on the public transport by reading your notes. While you are walking, reading notes is not really a feasible idea, so you might want to visualize certain concepts you have difficulties with. That allowed me to understand my knowledge gap, when i have to visualize the whole concept by myself, without any notes or guides.

Ultimately, i guess it boils down to your aim; how much do you really want to achieve the your desired grades, and to a certain extent, how much you understand yourself with your learning progress. All the best too.

Is it worth it to spend 3 hrs travelling to school and back just to rescue 1 or 2% of the module grade? Need some advice

The idea of NUSwhispers is very good. Sometimes I am very emo and sometimes I am very frustrated on some things and this gives me a platform to write and writing really help remove these emotions from me.

After reading some posts about lab people who can be nasty, I had a story to share about a bad experience i had with a prof. During one of the academic years, i was rather desperate for a research project and wish to try out how research is like. A lot of prof i approached rejected me, saying their labs are full, currently not taking in any students etc. Till now i still do not know why many profs do not accept students (my grades were decent though not first class). Finally one accepted me and i was happy. The prof met up with me, briefing me about my potential project, let's call it project X. I was so excited for my project so i volunteered to go to the lab at least once a week to learn experimental techniques before i start my project proper during the summers. For the first week, i was told to go to the lab meeting to know the people more and understand what the lab is doing. For the second and third week, my potential mentor told me she can't make it. Finally in the 4th week, i was told i can go try out  experimental techniques. However when i went, all i can do was watch others do but now allowed to touch anything. I was told to watch a lab person do his experiment. This person told me he was supposed to have done project X, but one week into his project, he was told that the cells could not be secured and it was changed to project Y (very dry and technical as it is bioinformatics stuff). He took it up anyway as he may not be able to backtrack since he already registered on the nus portal. However he did not have enough time to finish project Y by the end of the semester and had to extend. Even though he ended up doing the project for 1 whole academic year in total, it's counted as only 4 MCs since he finished his own project by Jan. Instead, he was told to do other people's work for the remaining time till the end of sem 2. Despite working till late as there was many stuff to do, he was neither paid nor given extra MCs for doing 2 sem of work. Needless to say, he is obviously not too happy but there's nothing he can do. Fine, by week 5 when i come back to the lab not to do anything, but just to pass my mentor my lecture notes which she requested for learning new techniques. The mentor told me the same cells could not be secured, even by the time summers come. I panicked and ask the prof what should i do. He offered me another project, which to my horror is a continuation of project Y. I was never good in bioinformatics and neither was it interesting to me. But since that was the only project available, i thought i need more time to go back, read up about the bioinformatics before making a final decision whether i wish to do project Y. I told the prof to give me some time to reconsider. Upon hearing this his face turned black and he grumbled that some students are just plain irresponsible, like he spent so much time talking to the student earlier and in the end the students don't want blah blah blah. I told him my concerns but he still continued to grumble. 

I was so angry at this point. I felt like he simply treat students like free labour. Why did he offer me project X when he cannot be certain whether he can get the cells or not?? Had the guy not shared his story, i would never had known that this incident happened once. In fact i felt as though the prof is using project X, which is extremely interesting in most students' opinion, to lure students in, only to switch to project Y for the students to do that someone else can take over the job of doing another part of this bioinformatics when the guy leave. If someone else could take over and generate more data, then the paper is publishable. I am lucky in a sense that i pull out before it's too late, like what happened to that guy. Had i not lent my potential mentor my notes, i might not have discovered that the cells would not arrive and would have ended up with the guy's fate... i think the mentor out of kindness, decided to be truthful with me that the cells will not arrive even by summers. I heard that this prof last publish a paper at least 5 years ago and seniors told me that if a prof had not publish for a long time, it's best not to work with that prof since it may suggest a bigger problem eg lack of funds, lack of progress etc. Had i listened to the seniors' advice, i would not had encountered this issue. 

Ok fine, i take it as a lesson learnt, that not all prof are as nice as you think. That if they seriously need students, they might resort to desperate measures like not wanting the student to go, even if it may not be very ethical. 

Is this common in research, like some PI normally don't care about the students, as long as they get someone to do their work? Does anyone has any stories about horrible prof to share?

I am a year 4 life science student and I regret staying on for Honours year. Since year 2, I knew that life science was not meant for me, especially when I am not a very technical and objective person. Yet, for fear that I might feel the same way if I were to switch to another major, I persevered on and actually decided to go for Honours year. I knew that feeling this way will not do me any good at this point, and I should be more optimistic and get the best out of Honours year. However, I have no idea how long I can last through this ordeal. 

My prof and the people in my lab are very nice to me, and they would help me if I need any help. However, sometimes I feel that I am such a burden, as most of the time I did not understand what they were saying and I was in a different frequency from them. It makes me wonder what have I actually learnt in life science for the past 3 years. 

At this point, I feel so depressed and not motivated. I don't even bother listening to the lectures anymore. To all the juniors out there, if you feel strongly that a major does not suit you and you are not going to do anything related to it, highly recommend that you switch your major before ending up like me.

 The most important thing is the knowledge you gained rather than the 'A'. If you try a difficult module but did not do well, you gained the knowledge of some difficult subject.

You came to university to learn difficult things. Those who take easy modules are not optimizing their money and time well.

I am a freshie who has been working very hard since the first day of semester so as to hope to get back into the 'study mode' after a long period of break from studying since JC times. Full efforts were given to complete every single assignment and tutorial or even projects before the deadline or class and constant revision were done to the content taught too. I have begun preparation for mid-terms way before my peers and have yet scored much lower than them after the result was released.

All it takes was an hour of last-minute revision for them to achieve a near-perfect score while it took me so much more to achieve so much less. Their thoughts were that it was an easy paper while it is definitely not the case for me. Am I not suitable to be here in NUS?

Been having a strong thought of quitting university since that day, should I just do that or should I not and complete the rest of my mid-terms? Just can an individual survive in our harsh and judgemental society without a degree in today's context?

"Most people study very hard but they pretend they do not study at all." I am really the opposite. In front of my friends, I study very hard. But when I am alone, I spend most of my time either on nuswhispers or porn website. Truth is I hardly study alone. I cant focus when I study alone and before you think that I am those very smart people, I am really the complete opposite as I almost failed all my modules. (BTW, most of my friends really thought I am those who got very high grades since I appear to be very hardworking in front of them)

With regards to , thank you @NUS Students' Sports Club for offering their help. I found out a few days ago that he is attached to a really sweet and demure girl. I guess I have to give up hope for now... But I am happy for him. Hope to see him one last time during the next Sports Club event...

I am looking for advise for SEP. I am a student with high CAP of above 4.5 and I took up a lot of leadership roles and CCAs. All of my friends are applying for SEP, and whenever they ask me if I am applying, I would say yes. However, I do not really want to go overseas to study. I dislike the competitiveness of the selection and deep inside I am just scared of surviving overseas. But then again, it will really boost my resume and employers nowadays look for people who overseas exposure. What should I do?

 Hey there! I too suffer from anxiety and panic disorder. Didn't had any problems whatsoever entering FASS, even after the medical checkup. Heard that medicine might be slightly stricter though. The doctor just asked if I was okay and to seek help from the UHC counselling services should there be a need. Don't worry too much!

I don't have the site design or coding know-how to implement this, but here's an idea: a networking platform for students to give and receive surveys. 

Let's face it, every uni student will have some burden project somewhere down the line which requires a survey of some sort, and we all want nothing more than to just chalk up enough responses and be done with it. We really don't care if our entire survey group is 18-25yo people with easy internet access, we just want to get the numbers in. So imagine a network of like-minded uni students to which you can post your bullshit google form survey and get a guaranteed response to move on with your project. You could set up a semesterly check to ensure that all members have completed a minimum number of the surveys posted, which gives members incentive to do the surveys in order to maintain access to the network. Heck, why stop at uni students, when poly and JC students also have projects which need surveys? And if the network grows big enough, you might even be able to monetise it by charging companies who want to do customer surveys to let them post their surveys to the network.

Now if you'll excuse, I need to get back to spamming all my social media accounts and whatsapp group chats with my burden survey T_T

I have heard of many graduated seniors who work long hours for a good performance review, or for a good bonus.

 Not feeling well as in...? Homesick? Given the limited information you've given, I don't think anyone can give you good advice and only you would know yourself best. Have you tried seeking help from the partner university such as their counsellors? I think as far as possible, you should try not to withdraw from your exchange given that you will delay your studies. It should be plausible to get an LOA but you should check with your faculty advisor or IRO with regards to further consequences if there's any penalty for depriving of others of the SEP slot. Also, if you were awarded the NASA scholarship, I believe there are penalties if the reason for not completing the SEP is not deemed valid. Take care :)

I am currently giving tuition to a P1 boy and he has English and Chinese spelling every week. However, he is extremely unmotivated to learn his spelling words and keep running around his living room during the lesson. When I ask him to try to spell the words by pronouncing it to himself, he just keeps telling me "i don't know" and refuses to write anything. Any advice on how I can motivate him to learn? And innovative methods to teach him the words without rote memorisation? Will bribing him with sweets work? =/

I get jealous of rich peer who can afford to travel abroad often. 
I came to Singapore with my parents in Sec 1. My parents divorced just before me and my twin sister did our A-levels. My father has married again, and I have a new born step-brother now. Life is actually looking fine, my father is self employed and I would say his financial status is above average in Singapore. Yet I feel very broke and poor for myself. As me and my sister both feel that we are on our own already, and father will focus more on his new family. 

I am not really staying with parents anymore, though I still asks allowance from my dad.
I am worried about my financial status after graduation, when my father no longer "obliged" to support me. 

I get jealous of my school mates who are on exchange or holiday trips to expensive countries like Europe. And yet I have not travelled to many countries (1only) so far. Looking at my situation now I cannot even dare to ask for more allowance to travel.

So am I putting too much stress and complaining for the wrong reason? Am I comparing to the wrong group of peers? I have tried to save up for trips, but money I earn is already paying up my living expenses. For example, I have stopped asking for allowance during my internship. Need advice on getting out of this emo mood and jealousy...

Seriously how can NUS rank so high in the world when they can just close down the automotive specialization just like that with an email. All of the sudden I feel so cheated and I'm starting to feel that NUS is slipping in so many ways.

Today I saw another Facebook share on how university students are pamper and expect $3-4K of starting pay (old news that was shared again and again). I was never affected by these sort of articles anyway, until i saw the comments. The commenters were saying "NUS aiseh", NUS students think they are so "sak key" (big deal), they rather hire a chennal talent who will be paid the same but willing to do more. They think that SIM students are the underdog that will work harder because they are more hungry. Given the opportunity, they will give the SIM students the job. 

I thought that was rather insulting. They should give equal chance. Since when people start to have prejudice against NUS students?  In university level, we've all experienced that humble feeling before - we are not as good as we thought we are. There will always be someone better, smarter, faster. And, so, we constantly look for things that will value-add our resume (internships/CCAs/USP/NOC). We strive for the better and some of us really work hard for knowledge or to progress forward in this meritocracy society. 

But so much of this is so easily dismissed as "you elitist" or "you book smart only lah". When I say I'm a NUS student, they think I'm stupiak because I've never been to the Society University. I'm pretty street smart - I can speak various chinese dialects fluently.  I think NUS folks are street smart and realistic too. They actually think that we've never google our own starting pay before. We go glassdoor.com as well please! 

In life, there will always be people who will put you down so to boost their own ego.

I excel at procrastination. In week 2 I missed a lecture because I was late (snoozed in bed too long). Hence, I was stuck at the first chapter in the module. I told myself to review the content that I missed before the next lecture so I wouldn't be lost, but never got around to doing it until the next lecture came.

I then convinced myself to skip the lecture to review the previous lecture that I missed as well as the current one, but of course never got around to doing it.  Cycle repeats itself ever lecture. Fast forward to week 7, midterms are here and I'm still stuck on the first chapter. 

The best part is, I'm spending my spare time typing this on nuswhispers instead of trying to catch up... Im retarded

reddit stories are interesting wutzz...does the story become less fascinating because the content ain't original by NUS students? So I don't get it when people say blah blah blah is from reddit so its bad. They just look like sour grapes to me. People actually take the effort to search online to see if the online is original. Much wowz, such time. 

Just enjoy the read man. At least they are willing to share funny reads they came across from the internet to the stressful NUS students.

Some opinions to things Singaporeans dislike/disagree:
1) Government uses 24-hour PSI to decide if schools should remain open or close: 24-hour PSI is a pretty good measure to tell if the haze is really staying and getting worse. Imagine if they use the 3-hour PSI, or even worse, 1-hour PSI (yes they do provide it, you just need to move your lazy ass to click a few more buttons to find it); they will one minute declare school close, next minute declare open. Why? Because you want to pegged on the short measure! No excuses there. If you want to chao keng, don't blame anyone, put in some  effort to come up with reason.
2): Train/Bus operators make profits: I think they believe that they have mentioned that they are making a loss from normal operations, money is coming in from the peripheral businesses (please correct me if I am wrong here!). Coming to think of it, if they only breakeven (expenditure=revenue), how do you expect them to make investments into better equipment? i.e. new trains, new wheels, new rails. Let me guess, government? And these will fall onto... taxes?
But I do agree that the profit seem a little too high...

What do you guys think?

You chose the most elite* engineering course in NUS, it's not going to be a walk in the park, expect to be up against the elites.

When it rains, it pours.

I'm a FASS Freshie. Just gotten back my first Uni assignment. The results were 2 grades below what I expected. This was a take-home over the weekend assignment, and I'd slept daily at 3am throughout the Elections weekend trying to improve on my essay. It was my birthday but I chose to stay in school to focus on the essay. I'm still trying to find out what went wrong. I've been consistently reading and studying, spending an average of 5-6 hours/day since week 1. I'm already lousy at relationships, and now even the things I like are starting to let me down. I'd considered minoring or majoring in that field, and made lots of plans. And yet, this only shows I'm not good enough. My essay was too shallow. Now I think my dreams are too idealistic.

Moreover, I did so badly for my class presentation today. Even though I'd went through in my mind what to say beforehand, those words just wouldn't be constructed into proper sentences. 
In another module where I'd came up with majority of the group proposal, the main argument proposed was shot down by the TA. We're going to use a parachuted idea instead.

I'm at a lost. I feel so conflicted, dejected, irritated and tired. I'd felt like the weather throughout the day. Wandering around aimlessly waiting for the next class. After the 3rd and last lesson of the day, I couldn't take it anymore. Here I am, curling up in my room, crying to the outpouring of rain, giving my CCA a miss. 
I'm sorry for wasting your time but I had to get it all out. I'm not worried about being identified. I do not have close friends. I'm just a shadow. 
I just hope the sun shines tomorrow.

@
The sun will shine and along with the radiance in your world, your shadow will stand out. Everyone has a shadow, everyone has weaknesses and sometimes we think we are totally incapable. Don't forget that you are Not good for nothing. You just don't see yourself in a positive light. You may suck at something, but there's always something you can do about it. Suck at academics? Chat with your profs. Suck at relations? Join more CCAs with positive, welcoming and inclusive attitudes. Can't present well? Pick up public speaking modules, activities, debates and CCAs. Not all CCAs are suited to everyone, and not everyone is suitable for any CCA. In other words, seek out people and groups who accepts people, find CCAs and activities and friends who help you become a better self.

No one is perfect, but no one is absolutely useless. In the darkest hour, when neither moon nor sun shines, find the courage to switch on the lamp. There's always a way out. All the best.

Back in school, if you get a shit prof, that is a serious matter.. Because you might probably get screwed and get a bad grade for that module. 

But at work, if you get a shit boss, that is a FUCKING SERIOUS MATTER. because having a shitty boss is infinitely worse than having a shitty prof. It is almost life and death. Your shitty boss will make life hell for you, whether intentionally or unintentionally. 

Well, cheers to everyone who has a shitty boss. We will get through this.

This is something I have been wanting to get off my chest for a long time. I'm just a typical university male student, getting on well in school and obtaining decent grades. I have my own circle of friends and I participate actively in my own cca. However, deep within me, I have this super inferiority complex when I think of my two older brothers. This stemmed all the way from when we were kids. I was always the sibling who underachieved as compared to both of them. Both of them enrolled into a elite secondary school and jc and did very well there, while I went to a average secondary school and jc and only got quite average A lvl results (ABBB/B).

The nadir came during NS. For those who don't know, the "better" performers during our BMT in Tekong became commanders, I.e officers or specialists, while the rest became men. Both my brothers did exceptionally well, one got Company best while the other got Platoon best. As for myself, I was the introverted awkward guy during my BMT, and my mates never took me seriously or looked upon me with much regard. I ended up becoming a man in artillery unit. It was more embarrassing for me given  that prior to my posting results after BMT,  I still told them that I was confident that I could emulate my brothers and make it to Officer cadet school. When I got my posting results, I felt so worthless, especially when I thought of how proud my parents were when we attended my brothers' commissioning parades( my oldest brother received the sword of merit), and how their faces beamed when they put on the 2lt rank on my brothers' uniform.  When it came to my own passing out, I was too ashamed to inform my parents of it, and I just told them I didn't have such an event so they will not come to my passing out. I felt so useless and worthless when I compared myself with my brothers, and my NS Days were truly the most torturous 2 years of my life. However, My brothers, despite all their achievements, never judged me for what I was and treated me like a normal younger brother, giving me helpful advice along the way. However, this only exacerbated my inferiority complex. 

When it came to university, as expected, both of them obtained comfortable first class honours while I am only sitting at second lower currently. But the damage has already been done. I feel like such a failure in life, especially when I compare my NS achievements with theirs. I thought since I was always not as academically as my siblings,NS was the time to prove myself to my family; my brothers and parents, that I could distinguish myself, yet it turned out to be a reaffirmation that I was always inferior to both my siblings. I don't know how to stop myself from thinking like this but I can't:(.

To OP of , I am the OP of . I actually did an internship AFTER my graduation. At that time I wasn't sure if it's the right move as most of my peers are securing full time positions. I was also worried if they will view me as lousy/incompetent. 

I took the risk, and now it is paying off. Actually no one was looking down on me, it was myself being insecure and worried about how people may view me. 

If you (or any of you reading) aren't sure what your passion is, my advice is to first identify what you DO NOT want to do. Let's say HR, Recruitment and Marketing and I know that I don't want to do Marketing, but unsure if I want to do HR/Recruitment. Just apply. Whatever you DON'T MIND doing, just apply. Along the way, whether it's preparation for interview or during the interview, you will get your answer, whether you want to do it or not. 

Of course, since my results weren't so good, be smart in your resume. Don't state your CAP score on your resume. Highlight your other strengths and accomplishments. Hope this is helpful!

If a man mentions to his doctor that he has sex with other men, is the doctor obliged (legally or ethically) to report it to the police? (Since the act is a crime under Singapore law) And if a doctor decides to report the act, will the police proceed to investigate and file charges? Just curious.

So it's less than two days left for the 'W' grade when you drop a module.

...and you cannot drop the module because it falls below the new 18 MCs requirement (CORS doesn't allow it). Great. So it's either slog through the module, or... slog through the module.

In a sense, we *tried* to do 20 MCs for the past six weeks, but things happen which result in us thinking "hey, maybe dropping this mod is a better idea...". Guess I'll need to suck it up and just think of what to do with this module of mine going forward.

To everyone else, definitely get feedback regarding modules you intend to take in future so that you don't get screwed over when you can't cope well with it and cannot drop it.

Damn, I'm so salty right now. :/

To OP of , 
Could you kindly share more about your experiences? I'm in my third year now with a CAP of less than 3 as well, so i wont be going on to honors year. Since its my second last sem now, im not sure if i'll still be able to go for internships. In fact, i dont even think i want to continue working in the field that I'm studying now, but yet at the same time, im not sure what my passion is. Would be grateful if you or anyone else can give some advices. Thanks!

Hello, NUSWhispers. Rant incoming.

I'm tired.

It's my second last semester. I fucked up badly the last semester and I've been trying really hard making this semester right. I've been working hard to change my life for the better after a really rough start to this year. But halfway through this semester I realize: I'm tired. And I'm alone. And I'm slowly realizing that this all may be a futile battle and I'm just gonna end up disappointed.

No, I cannot take a breather. I don't have the time for that. No, I cannot turn back. It's too late for that.

Everything is a futile effort. And it sucks.

I'm in the midst of researching and applying for SEP, and I am utterly confused and frustrated. I've been to several talks about it and I've also trawled through the SEP FAQs etc., so I do understand the big picture processes, but now that I'm down to the nitty gritty, I don't really know what to do or what to even look out for. 

By any chance, are there any FASS student who's been on exchange to Germany before whom I can possibly PM/get in touch with for some firsthand advice/help in navigating this? I will really appreciate it. 

(Furthermore, almost all German unis' winter semester cuts into mid-February, thus clashing with NUS' acad year and I understand that LOA is not guaranteed. Now what?)

I have been a sportsman for most of my life. I think I have been relatively successful in my sport, representing my schools and even NUS in competitions. I was even called up for national team selection from time to time. However, there is this stereotype that sports people (jocks) generally have girls going crazy over them. I think it may have skipped me, I have never been in a relationship before. I don`t think a girl has found me attractive like ever despite being quite good at my sport. So, I genuinely want to ask all you ladies out there, how attractive does being a sportsman actually make a guy?

PSI300 and school is cancelled for primary and secondary kids. But I had to go to school at PSI of four fucking hundred when I was in JC. Kids have it easy now :(
-
 
Woah... even the 24hr PSI has crossed the 300 mark! I am really starting to wonder about how to go back to normal classes next week or more importantly what to do in between classes. I have really bad asthma and I'm very worried. If not for midterms, I would really like to stay home. 

Other than the library and AS7 or hoboing along the classroom corridors, are there indoor spaces that we can go to? Could we crowdsource a list for all faculties? 

( On side note..... isn't this the best time to test the disaster preparedness of our e-learning system. Surely the whole point of that is for situations like this? )

Hi, I would like to post academic queries here. I am told that only publishing in good journals is preferable for a PhD graduate student. If so, should a graduate student published in edited volumes and/or book chapters? Are there any benefits in publishing in those? If the edited volume has no peer review is it not advised to publish there?
-
 
Would really appreciate if NUS can activate E-learning week coming week. That's also to give a break for all the canteen vendors and cleaners who are more exposed to the haze than students and professors who are in the classrooms or offices most of the time.
-
 
I really wished all lecturers would webcast their lessons. It takes them perhaps a little more effort to record and put the videos on IVLE, but it's a god-send when I can't wake up in time, can't concentrate, or when I'm trying to revise by going through lectures again.

Maybe I'm too spoilt, but sometimes I really wonder what's the point of trying to force every single student to show up at a particular place at a particular time just to learn something new. And I'm thinking particularly of those modules which lectures offer zero interaction and yet hold surprise, in-lecture-only quizzes that affect your grade. What's the rationale? Can't I just be allowed to study at my own pace?

Where else is affordable  to study medicine if I don't get in locally? Are there bank loans offered for students to pursue undergraduate medicine overseas?

To OP 
My partner is petite as well and I'm above average. We were both a little worried at first. But lots of foreplay, constant communication and not taking ourselves too seriously   made things alot easier. 

Important thing is to be relaxed and wait for natural lubrication. Can buy lube around as well. We spend at least 20-30 mins to get into the mood. I'm repeating cos it's important: constant communication.

I've seen a lot of "2:2" in the posts/comments but I've no idea what that is except it means a good grade/CAP? (Does it mean first class?) I've tried googling but to no avail. Thanks! (:

I am a freshie and am currently enrolled in the Korean Language Preparation Programme (LPP). I took the mid terms last week (LAK 1201) and it was disastrous. I studied hard, but it seemed that it wasn't hard enough. I can only blame myself for not studying hard enough. It took me a long time to figure out the 3 conversational passages, hence, I left out many questions. The main problem is limited time - we were only given abt an hour and 20 mins (excluding time taken to listen for listening section). Honestly, I only had one hour to write because I have to stop writing when I listened. I learnt my lesson and have decided to study even harder to pull up my grades, perhaps, I will practise writing and listen to Korean more. 
I am afraid that my mid-term results will pull down my grades. The module overview does not post up the weightage and other assessments involved (hence, I don't know if some of my careless mistakes in the homework handed up will cost or not). Any seniors who have taken this module care to enlighten me on this module? What made me more afraid is that this module is infamous for the steep bell curve. Will my place in the Korean LPP be removed should I not do well or fail this mod? 
I am afraid that I may have to S this module and some of my other modules (touch wood, but I am really not confident of my other mods as well). Does anyone S/U all 5 modules for yr 1 sem 1?  What are the repercussions if one do so? Will exchange opportunities be affected/delayed? 
Also, how do people decide what to S/U for the gradeless sem? Some told me that I should S/U any mods that don't hit A. Is it true?

Guys, the haze is getting really bad.. Remember what we've trained for all these years? That's right. E-learning week. Let the E-learning begin!

Since the haze condition in Singapore (esp west part) already reached the medium section of VERY UNHEALTHY RANGE, I think it's a good measure for school to extend our recess week....Don't you think so?

 This is what we define as the Hall Effect.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect

As an exercise, show that:
$V_H = \frac{IB}{nte}$

where $I$ is the current across the plate length, $B$ is the magnetic field, $t$ is the thickness of the plate, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n$ is the charge carrier density of the carrier electrons.

How come Singaporeans like to judge people based on their salary and exam grades? They think they are damn sexy if they score better or earn more than you. But they are unwilling to help you. Everything also must compare.

I stay in hall and partake in my fair share of hall activities be it sports of 3am hthts BUT I also do do my work in group projects and also individual assignments. However, I do see many of my friends and peers who stay in hall not doing the same. I think while it should not be a sweeping statement that ALL hall people do not do their work, it can be understood why people think that way. I have seen highly irresponsible people not contributing AT ALL to group projects because they have too many cases for them to handle and they devote all their time to them. Such a group of people is not uncommon but yes, do tell your prof.

Yo. 

Can you guys stop talking about all hall people like we're a bunch of extremes? Do you really think all of us fill our schedule with hall stuff and irresponsibly shirk off all other responsibilities? There's a big majority of people who take part moderately in hall activities, juggle our social life of 3am HTHTs and still play our equal part in group projects, alright? If you're so unhappy, take it up to the prof or use your group evaluation tool to express your unhappiness. 

Don't anyhow come to anonymous page and stir shit among NUS students who have a spectrum of preferences for their involvement in CCA's. If you like to do things of this nature, go and submit your anonymous letters to those pro-opposition pages instead.
-
 
 I stay in hall, and in my past 4-5 project's i've ended up doing the lion's share of the work. What's with this hall vs non-hall discrimination?

People choose how they want to spend their time. Instead of comparing people who choose to spend their time at hall doing things / out of hall doing things, why not compare all of them with people who do, like, nothing?

Hey, need advice regarding SEP. If my CAP is below the eligible CAP needed to go for SEP, should I try to appeal ( if possible) to relevant department or should I stay in NUS to try to pull up my CAP during the remaining semesters? Will I lose out to my peers if I didn't go for exchange overseas? Thanks.

Dear OP of , what makes you think one is missing out on uni life if one doesn't stay in hall? I take pleasure in using my time to do other meaningful stuff like volunteering or reading instead of meaningless stuffs like HTHT-ing until 3am (seriously how many of them are you gonna stay in contact with 10 years after graduating?). 

You're probably one of those irresponsible project group mates that always skip group meetings for the sake of going for hall CCA practices. If you wanna jeopardise your own grades for the sake of not "missing out on uni life", by all means go ahead. But if you're dragging your group mates down, that is no go. Yes, there are and there will be people who CAN juggle hall life and studies very well. But so far, I've encountered none in all of my project groups. Guess I have bad luck. But so far all of my friends whom I've surveyed (albeit casually) generally do not have a great impression of hall people. None in my circle of friends that stay in hall have 2.1 and above. 

Bottomline is: if you get lousy grades, don't justify it by using "Oh, I stay in hall," as an excuse. YOU CHOSE TO FORGO STUDY TIME for hall activities. So, stop being sore by saying "Oh because you not staying in hall and have CCA right" to those who have better grades than you. Grow up. 

To hall people who are doing well in studies and hall lives, THUMBS UP MAAAAAAAAAAAN! 

Sincerely, someone (who's in a teamNUS CCA) not staying in hall.

In CS2103, we learn the principle of avoiding premature optimization. Yet in CS2010, I fail to apply this principle to the last question about graph during our midterm. Feel like harakiri.

When you're staying in hall and being active in many CCAs, it's easy to use that as an excuse for having a not-so-stellar CAP. But at the end of the day, there are still many hall people doing well in their studies. Likewise, not staying in hall doesn't mean you don't have external commitments, or that you study at home all the time. I think self-discipline and time management skills are much more important factors than whether one stays on campus or not. 

So don't use hall life as an excuse to bail out on your groupmates. You made the decision to take on more responsibilities, doesn't mean your group members have to pay for your choice.

How does peer evaluation work in group projects? What if a student doesn't like someone in her group and decides to give that member fewer points or something, even if the latter has done her share of the work?

just curious, where s NUS confession?

I am a Geography major and i am very perplexed by what I can do after I graduate from NUS. One reason is because my CAP is not as good as compared to my peers (bordering around 3.4). As much as I want to be a Geography teacher, I am not even sure if I can even be one. Much less working in the public sector etc. Sometimes when I think about my future I get really scared. Any advice ok what I can do?
-
 
I really hate it when people ask me what my CAP is, and I'd just answer "oh its 4.X" then they'd say "So high ah. Oh but its because you don't stay hall/join NUS CCAs/no family or money problems" Seriously? I really enjoy what I'm studying and I find it really easy to understand because of my passion and interest in my major so maybe thats the reason I tend to be doing better. Yes I may not stay in hall or have a NUS CCA so I have more time to study but honestly it irks me so much

 Don't worry. There are students who are potential Asperger / High Functioning ASD type in NUS. You will find most of them studying subjects which require strong logical reasoning like Math, Statistics, CS, Physics, Philosophy, Economics, Engineering etc.

On the other hand, the faculties that are unfriendly to Aspies are Business school, where herd mentality is strong, and some social branches of FASS with ideological leaning, Design school etc. In such places, you will find neurotypicals thinking that they are intelligent. Contrarian view is seldom found.

Pick your choice wisely.

HII PROF BEN! just wanna say I love reading your carefully thought out comments on this page and it's really heartening to see the effort you put in to help random students/people on the internet despite having your own commitments

thanks prof on behalf of everybardyyy

This is just genuinely out of curiosity: was anyone accepted into NUS despite having some form of ('official') psychological disorder? (Depression, bipolar, adjustment disorder, ADHD, etc.) ('Official' in the sense where you had to see doctors and declared it to the school.)

I had clinical depression (with anti-depressants and all) when I applied to NUS (a long time ago now), and I remember the rejection letter - for all 12 course choices - arrived rather quickly. I eventually appealed on CCA merit, and was accepted into NUS after an assessment by a UHC doctor (his main concern was if I could adapt to university life, which, I feel, is valid concern).

This just made me think there aren't many people like me around on campus. Though I could be seriously mistaken.

hi there, im a freshie in engine, however, i have always liked and wanted to study geography, then become a geography teacher. but because my parents and eventually me thought it might be impractical due to earning less in the future, i didnt dare to go into it. what do you guys think? should i stay or should i go study geog instead?

I know I walk on a tightrope whenever I face exams, and the profs are always like 'YOU SHALL NOT PASS' when they set their papers...but it never occurred to me that maybe them profs see us students as fiery monstas. Heh.

All the best for mid terms.
-
 
Does anyone know whether it is the profs or the NUS exam committee (or whatever you call them) who gives the letter grades like A, B+ etc.? From what I think, the profs are the ones who determines the numerical grade (out of 100) and then submits the results to the exam commitee, who would then do all the moderation and bell curve stuff, then give a letter grade according to the bell curve. Is my understanding correct? Perhaps some profs can shed some light on this....? I'm kinda curious....

What sucks/pointless about exams is that you work your ass off for days or weeks trying to understand and get everything into your brain and then you get like 1-2 hours in a hard chair (+ sleep-deprived) trying to organize and regurgitate all the shit you've learned and that’s it, your grades are determined. Then when holidays comes, you forget most of the stuffs and the vicious cycle repeats. Sigh, why are we wasting our youth like this?
-
 
Is there anyone who actually uses the new IVLE layout? I mean, everyone I know switches back to the old IVLE upon logging in. I know the school will force the new IVLE layout upon us later this year, but I hope they don't because it truly sucks without the end-user in mind.

To those who say science students shouldn't squeeze on the buses just because they can walk to school, yes it's true they can walk and some do. But 1) those people you're referring to aren't just science students 2) it's everyone's personal choice whether they want to walk or not especially when everyone is paying for it. I don't see why some people have to pay for a service everyone else can enjoy just because of their faculty location. If you want to avoid the crowd, take the bus earlier or take public bus instead. Or you could send a feedback to the school to let some of the students opt out of paying for the shuttle bus to make things more fair for them.

Ultimately there are many options for everyone to get to their faculties and it's up to you to choose the one that best suits you. If there are things you can't change, then change your option and make the journey to school a pleasant one for all of us, yeah?

Advice needed. How would you approach your professors for letters of recommendations, especially if you are not on very close terms with them (they know you by name, but nothing much more than that).

And to the professors who read this page, what are some of the things students write in their requests that will instantly turn you off?

Thank you.

I hope I am not the only one who wish for universities to continue the yearbook trend we used to have during our secondary school days. It could be in digital format (like duh!) instead of printing physical copies (which would be insane). 
Of course, it's not for the sake of having my pathetic face up there for everyone to criticise, but rather to increase the chances of spotting our eyecandies among the 37,000+ faces so that we can know their names and stalk them on Facebook. HAHAHAHAHA

 That's what I am talking about. Humanities say many things about Love but there is no practical advice. Mathematics can give algorithms and formula to do things.

I have been managing well in school in my entire life but when I got into University, things changed. I am struggling badly in school, and I am stuck in a major I do not love as much as I thought. I regret not changing major three years ago and now as I move on, I want to tell juniors, do not be afraid to chase after your dreams. Pick the major you want to do the most, and not be afraid of the career prospects of your major. Your attitude defines your prospects and any major will give you useful skills you need in your future life, while loving it in the progress. 

- A depressed senior undergoing compulsory fyp but not doing well in school. Also struggling with studies. And feeling really crappy when the bell curve god does not favour its fervent believer. Feeling dumb too.

I am a believer of the 'Big Fish Small Pond' and believe thats why I scored relatively well in my JC and secondary school. In the end, I chose NUS and these are my thoughts...

1. NUS/NTU/SMU/SUTD are very big ponds. Even the low entry courses like engineering are externally injected with FTs to enlarge the pond. I understand why they do this for PhDs and research positions but is it necessary at the undergraduate level? 

2. SIT/SIM are extremely small ponds. I always feel like you don't get a complete university experience by attending these universities. Or is it an excuse for my lack of balls? Anyway, I think SIT new campus is a great idea but Im born too early.

3. Overseas universities are great and offer a good balance but not everyone have the money :/

I'm thankful to enter NUS but my path is set to be an average folk. #ScrewSocialMobility

I hope this post won't be filtered off..

While I'm already in my second year, there were many occasions when I doubted my own abilities, wondered if I have the calibre be in my major or this university. Having to take the year 1 and half of year 2's core modules, I realised that a majority of them focused so much on applications and  calculations where purely memorising off the lecture notes did not seem to work. All I was told to do was to understand the theories before applying it in the exams. However, till today, I have yet to fully grasp that, probably because the nature of this major is very different from what I studied in high school. It terribly frightens me whenever I cannot do the advanced level tutorial questions (those which ain't straightforward and requires one to think in depth). Simply plunging in formulae which I think is related to the qn asked is probably suicidal :(. It's not that I didn't try to understand the concepts or seek help from lecturers, I just find it so tough to understand the meaning of applying what I learnt in lectures. This is so different from high school, when I could understand, then regurgitate the info and ace the papers.. I understand that this is university education where we need to develop our critical skills whatsoever and I should no longer act like a high school kid, but even so, I really have no idea how to or even where I can start working from... Am I the only one who feels this way? ;'(( I'm stuck..

I'm in trouble, I'm in so much trouble. This is not even a normal level of not being able to cope in school, it's as though I'm just knowingly letting things slip through my fingers while I stare numbly by the sidelines, and then superficially brush off feelings of disappointment and anger at myself. Sweep them under the carpet. Out of sight, out of mind. (Delusionally so)

I have skipped so many tutorials because I never get around to doing my readings and completing my tutorial questions. It's not that I'm exceptionally busy, I just procrastinate like fuck and don't have an ounce of drive in my studies. On days where I do go for tutorials, I'd be merely glancing through my readings and then rushing the questions just an hour before class starts - half-hearted, rushed, superficial answers. 

My readings. I'm in FASS and we all know how insane the readings are. I'm taking Level 2000 and 3000 mods this sem, which makes the workload even worse. And yet? It's already Week 6 and I'm still stuck at Week 2's readings. 

I'm not clinically depressed, I have a decent social life, but this intense disappointment and loathing at myself for singlehandedly and consciously screwing up my studies is now overwhelming me. I don't know what to do or how do I even start picking things up from here. 

Time and time again I say, ok, I will change now. I will do my readings, etc. But when I realise 3 hours later that it is virtually impossible to catch up on 4 weeks worth of work across 5 modules, I sink into a rapid downward spiral and I am now unable to face anyone, including myself, without feeling intense pangs of inferiority and shame.

To 

Haha, how is that a problem? I see Humanities not using mathematics to reason something very special and beautiful.

Look at the top programmes in STEM and they have some element of Humanities in them. I dare say that we use humanities in our everyday work. Programmers need to appreciate elegance to create large code. Engineers need to understand empathy to understand what customers want. Researchers need to critique coherently (not just with numbers!) for scientific progress. 

I think engineering has in recent years acknowledged this and stepped up their game by introducing Humanities. Thus the lingo: STEAM.

I'm just a random student on NUS whispers and I just wanna say that I really salute Prof Ben Leong for his kind words and advice towards the students/alumni on this site. He's really one of a kind - so genuinely patient and empathetic towards students' troubles, not just to fulfill some KPI. Too bad I'm a business student with no computing bg and will never get to sit in one of his classes. 

I wish him all the best in his life, be it family, teaching, research or anything he's aiming towards

There is a recent news about Japanese government removing seats for Humanities and Social Sciences in their universities. I am worried that our government will have future plans to do the same thing. Recently, many students are pressurized to get a STEM degree like Computer Science, Statistics, Engineering, Business Analytics etc. It seems justifiable since many students from FASS are underemployed in civil services and private sectors. Moreover, there is a perception that FASS students are lazy and less stressful compare to STEM students.

I think that this is happening because our society have not found a way to appreciate arts and cultures unlike the technologies.

Here are some questions to further ponder:
(1) Is it really worthy for taxpayer to pay a student to study something which cannot be used in the industry?
(2) Do STEM subjects provide the sufficient skills to understand the human world? Remember that to change the world requires one to first interpret the world. STEM subjects often have a presupposed world in their knowledge.
(3) Is it the student's fault if the Capitalist industry cannot utilize what the student have studied and hence underemployed the student?

Travelling seems to be the most 'in' thing nowadays. No matter which social media platform I am on, all I see are pictures of friends exploring some country in Europe (why is everyone in Europe???). 

Can someone please enlighten me on why people put so many hashtags for their travel photos? 

P/S: to all those who are on exchange right now, have fun and enjoy. But don't forget all those who paid for you to have this experience, ie. the parents. 

I have heard of people who lied to their parents about SEP being compulsory so that they can go to some fancy European country for SEP. Why do people do this? If your family is not well-to-do, maybe you can consider some other countries that are cheaper for SEP. The idea of going to Europe for SEP is indeed very appealing, but do think of your parents who are working hard every single day. 

Just ranting.

Looking at a Prof page and I realized he held so much achievements yet he is humble, funny and nice. He has an American accent which I loved listening to so much. He had a phD in MIT, got into the dean's list, won excellence in teaching award, published many scientific journals. I'm sure the chemistry majors know.

I submitted quite a few posts, but it was all filtered idek why. ):

Anyway, I just want to say, to those whose family are rich enough to travel every year/holiday, please treasure those experiences and do not take it for granted. Not every family is fortunate to be able to afford such luxuries. 

I never had a family trip to anywhere else other than Malaysia. So, sometimes I do get jealous of those whose family travel every holiday (and to exotic locations, mind you), but I have learned to accept this. I will be working harder to save up more money so that I can bring my parents and siblings for a family trip to some place.

I love it when a teacher says things like "It's because of you students that keeps me going." A teacher/tutor/lecturer/professor/staff that cares for the students is one that deserves tremendous respect. 

Just want to share a friend's consultation that inspired me. My friend could not understand the content and he went to consult the lecturer, Dr Ti Hwei Chen. After several rounds of questioning and answering, my friend still could not understand the concepts and was frustrated about it. Dr Ti, likewise, was frustrated but just as my friend has given up asking further questions and wanted to walk out disappointed, Dr Ti told him "Don't give up, I will ask you again tomorrow." I was by his side when he said it and I was seriously touched by it even though the words are not meant for me. It goes to show how this senior lecturer cares for each student genuinely. 

Times like this, I just wish to stay forever as a student. Thank you Dr Ti, even though our cohort has not been the most cooperative! I will continue to take snapchats of your comical teachings in lecture hahaha:)

With the influx of exchange students (especially those from western countries), I would like to bring up this issue to tutors/exchange students. I understand that in your home countries, students tend to be more vocal and ask questions. 

However, today I was in a tutorial class where the tutor spent 30 mins out of the hour allocated to answer a question that had little to no relevance to the topic we were discussing. As a result, we only went through 3 out of the 7 tutorial questions. 

The tutor was nice enough to answer the student's question on the spot but the student kept following up with more questions. This has been going on for the past 4 tutorials (though not as bad as this week's). Please, leave your non-relevant questions until after class and stop wasting other people's time. 

Tutors, please notice that you've spent too long on things like this and carry on with the tutorial. Its no wonder the attendance for the class is less than 6 outof 20.

 What about computing/engineering girls then? :( Prof, you should market them too. Don't be biased... 
-
 
Interesting remark from Prof Ben Leong that engineering guys are good bf/husband material. What about girls? Which faculty girls is good gf/wife material?
-
 
To the social escorts out there, a quick question:

Does being a escort necessitate sleeping with the client? I mean, most of them are looking for company, but does that mean sex is involved?

Just curious. 
-
 
Which faculty girls are good gf/wife materials? SCIENCE. Haha! Especially Chemistry girls cause we're able to build chemistry with you *wink (No prize guessing which course I'm from)
-
 
I've been pretty interested in this guy in my class, but haven't really had the opportunity to get to know him better. Guys, what can I do? (Girl here, btw.) 
-
 
I've been working as an escort for about 4 months now, and I just have to say that it definitely isn't as bad as most people think it is. I'm not promiscuous outside of this and I don't actually enjoy sex with anyone I'm not seeing long-term, but I recognize the huge supply-demand gap in the industry and hope to capitalize on it. Earning a few hundred dollars an hour on a very flexible schedule makes me not have to worry about my expenses and also allows me to save up for the future education I hope to take overseas. I don't think having safe sex with multiple people diminishes my worth as a woman, and hopefully any future partner I get after quitting this job will think so too. 
I haven't told anyone in real life about this because I'm afraid of the backlash, but it feels good to finally write about it and get it off my chest anonymously.

I know innovation is important and would like to sincerely thank the creators of NUSmeet.me for their efforts in proposing a solution to tackle the whole issue of people not being able to meet the right people hence using NUSmeet.me as a bridge to do so.

However, as an individual who honestly, wholeheartedly does not feel the need for myself to use the app, can I please request that y'all either stop emailing the entire damned school or provide an opt-out option with regard to these emails? PLEASE. I'm begging you. Like, seriously. The nonsense emails are bad enough- please don't add to the list.

(inb4 "you can just ignore the email what": its still there and I'm never going to get back the sixty seconds I spent reading the email.)

"But actually, I always say that the engineers make for good bfs and husbands. Reliable and low maintenance. You put them in front of a PC and you can go do your stuff. When you come back, they are still there. tongue emoticon"

Thank you Prof Ben Leong. You are my new idol. I see light at the end of the tunnel.

During the financial downturn in 2007, my family was going through hard times. My parents lost their jobs and they were working odd jobs to make ends meet (they didn't have high education in the first place so the jobs were low-paying). It didn't help that my older brother was an immature jerk who complained how our parents were so lowly educated and that our family was poor because of them. I was in primary 3 so my parents' constant absence hit me quite hard. They came home late every night and sometimes I cried and begged them to come home earlier, told them the amount the money they earn didn't matter, as long as it was enough for bills and food.

Now that I'm older, I could better see things in different perspectives and learn from them. I saw where my older brother was coming from. When my parents still had their stable jobs, they didn't enrich themselves when opportunities arose, so all the jobs they took were low-paying. They didn't give a hoot about improving their skills and learning, and in that way, my brother was kind of right about the lowly educated part (educated here refers to upgrading skills and oneself). On the other hand, I thought my older brother could have been more understanding and help out at home instead of harping on family finances and being a dickhead.

Also, I realized that money really is secondary. I'd rather have just enough money and more time than with my loved ones, than have the reverse. Some people may think otherwise, but to each his own.

Can anyone from pharmacy major or students minoring in pharmaceutical sciences tell me if this module PR1101 Physicochemical Principles of Drug Action still exist in NUS? :/ I don't see it in NUS timetable builder and nusmods although it was stated on Pharmacy website as part of module requirement to complete pharm minor ? If yes, is this a semester 1 or 2 module? Thanks much!

They keep telling us to avoid long, convoluted sentences and unnecessary jargon in out essays. They should tell that to those who wrote our readings.
-
 
I loved my course. I still do but not in the same way. I used to be really naive and happy , doing what i like and having not to write any more essays or do any more mathematics, be free to chase my creative pursuits ... you know the drift. Theres one issue though: the grading system sucks. really sucks and i'm not talking about the bell curve. 
Things get really unfair to the extent that even before and during final crit , all the grades were already predetermined and decided on.  The dean and some professors had already decided whom to award the first class honours whom to allocate in which class. Even when we can't seem to see the value in certain projects , they always seem to have a way to promote their favourite students and their projects. Worse thing is stuff gets around fast cos its a really small cohort  but there's really not much the rest can do . 
Really tired of all this. Not all the professors are like that though but one bad one with the highest authority is really enough to override everything i guess.

If you want to know about nice guys vs bad guys, MKT1003X Marketing is the module for you.

Nice guys are like the product concept. They improve themselves in the hope that the right consumer comes along. But as we know, without proper marketing, this rarely happens. The nice guy ends up with the wrong target market and is unable to be fully appreciated. This has caused the nice guys to be sad.

The bad guy embraces the marketing concept, and sells himself extremely well. These bad guys however, tend to commit marketing myopia, being too focused on the immediate appeal and ignore the consumer's actual needs. The bad guy does not fulfill the consumer's expectations often making them sad.

Just a question that I'm curious of. Which faculty or course is the most close knitted? Coz I've heard that in some faculties, you'd know almost everybody whereas in other faculties like fass, students take different mods and more often than not, friends are usually hi-bye. Your impression of the faculty counts too, just wanna see everybody's opinion(: cheers.

I'm a year 2 student. I managed to scrape through the first year alright but I feel like i should be doing better. Are there any seniors who can tell me what methods you employ when you study? Would like to know the methods you use so i can test it out and perhaps find the one that works best for me. 
P.S please don't flame me, I just want to improve :(

I am keen on volunteering as the counting agent for the opposition party as i have heard that many of them are lacking the said manpower. The reason i wanted to volunteer is because i want to challenge the prevailing fear of publicly supporting the opposition. However, my parents have warned me that my chances of entering the civil service will be next to zero since I publicly associate myself with the opposition. I am conflicted. Any advise please?

I have a crush on my TA in arts. He's so patient and understanding compared to all the other TAs I had before!!! The module is shitty with a crazy workload and lecturer, but he's the one that makes it tolerable. I really want to ask him out sometime, but I've heard TAs can't 'get too close' to their students. Should I just #YOLO and ask?

to OP, I have similar situation as yours. There are these kind of friends around me. Always claim that they didn't study well for the exams. Only finished first few chapters. They didn't have enough time to finish all the syllabus. Sure will fail this time. Gonna retake the module.....BUT in fact, they do study, and study really really well, you can tell this because when we are discussing the questions outside the MPSH, they seem to be able to answer most of the questions....(Eh? I thought you didn't study?) but they said they ANYHOW STUDY only..... After exam, they will say they sure dabao this time. The paper was just too hard for them, because they didn't study that part, so just anyhow answer.
For me, who really put in effort to study all the notes, think that the paper was manageable, of course there were questions that I couldn't answer. But overall still okay for me. 
Maybe I was too innocent to believe in what they said, even cheer them up and said, it's okay, let's work harder next time. Don't be so upset. Ended up scoring an B for me, A+ for them.....WHAT THE HELL! Did I just cheering up an ace scorer?
Anyway, now I finally have an idea why are they doing this. If they keep claiming that they didn't study well for the exam, and the papers are too hard for them, when the results are out:
Score well --> they are smart enough, able to answer the questions even though they "DIDN'T REALLY STUDY"
Score not so well --> make sense also, because they "DIDN'T STUDY AT ALL", how to score well?

Hi OP of . I'm not here to start an accounting war or get into the political stuff but I believe that it is wrong to interpret the financial statement that way. (btw I'm not accounting-trained as well) The financial statement that Low Thia Khiang showed is a one month income statement (IS) and the one on the right is the notes to the financial statement. If you look at the reference numbers (8 & 9) on the notes, it does not cross-reference to any number reflected on the IS which means the breakdown of the details in the notes has no relations to the IS. I know ACC1002X taught us that every IS entry is accompanied by a Balance Sheet (BS) entry but I think that transfer of funds which is what is happening here will not be reflected in the IS.

I know it's random but I have no idea why Low Thia Khiang is showing that because it doesn't prove anything. Income and Expenditure Statement is showing what happens during the specific period and even with the word 'accumulated', it's still whatever that has happened within a year at most. Showing the Balance Sheet would have helped though :)

Just to re-emphasize that I'm not accounting trained and I might be wrong so please don't flame me. :)

One thing about project work I will like to share my philosophy to everyone and I will like to find out what you guys think.

If the groupmates are randomly assigned, then there's nothing much to say because everyone also 'lan lan' gets randomised. However, if you get to choose your groupmates, be it knowing them beforehand or not, you CANNOT complain anything about them. This is because YOU were the one who agreed to group with them in the first place.

So what happens if they do not contribute much or create problems? From my perspective, suck it up and clear up the mess. If everyone have the 'wait and see' mentality, nothing will be done and everything will be procrastinated, usually till a couple of days before the deadline, and things may start to turn panicky, messy and inevitably ugly.

In summary:
1) You have no right to complain about your groupmates because you chose them in the first place.
2) If you do not take charge and do it, no one else will.

Anybody have any advice for group projects where there are members who REFUSES to do shit. 
If only we could have a blacklist system to blacklist these people to warn others from grouping with these selfish people which may in turn deter people from being such social idiots.

I find that I have no idea about how a business works even though I have specialized CS focus areas knowledge. 

When business owners ask me questions about business efficiency, I give rubbish answers like spending more money to hire architects and rebuild a better system.

I was tutoring my primary 4 tutee today and we came across a comprehension passage on racial harmony. Somehow we ended up talking about how her peers in school outcasted her and even hurl hurtful remarks at her just because of her skin colour. She told me once her class was supposed to form groups of 4 for a mini presentation. She didnt have a group initially, partly because her class size was 37, and maybe also because she was outcasted. No one wanted to take her in even though the teacher said it's okay to have a group of 5. But she eventually found a group with the teacher's help. But the mean thing was that on the day of rehearsal, her groupmates PURPOSELY handed her the wrong piece of information to present on, after telling her last minute that theyre changing the stuff. She was laughed at, and the teacher even questioned her why she was presenting on something that was totally irrelevant and different from the rest.

There were other instances of bullying that let her to cry alone in the toilet. Her teacher was aware of such stuff going on. The bullies were reprimanded by the teacher but the failed to repent. They went up to my tutee and questioned if she was the one who reported this to the teacher. 

Despite being very angry after hearing what happened, I am not sure how I should help my tutee. I am questioning the moral education the primary school students are receiving and the school is giving today. My tutee is from the best class, and this means that academic wise they're brilliant, but what about moral education? Is the school paying more attention on academics than moral education? Do the bullies' parents know about this? Are the students receiving enough disciplinary action? What are the primary school students learning nowadays man.

I felt so angry and pissed after hearing this. Why should my tutee suffer all these just because of her skin colour and why are the bullies not even repenting. I am not sure if I should inform the school about this. I am not even sure if the school will look into this matter. What should I do?

In response to , one of the comments that profs know students' grade caught my attention and written below are 2 incidences which occured last semester and made me suspect profs indeed know a particular's student's grade.

1) there is this module, let's call it module A which had a recent change in the pre req. Initially there were 2 pre req  needed in order to take module A but they changed it to only just one of the pre req. Having taken one of the pre req i emailed the prof to double check that i can indeed take module A. The prof's reply was "yes. But if you wish to take module A first, i can waive the pre req for you." I did not think much as i believe the prof is nice enough to want to help the student clear this module fast but i just let the prof know i had already taken one of the pre req. Another friend of mine also wish to take this module but did not have the pre req. He emailed the prof to request to take module A but the prof told him to clear the pre req first. When he emailed one more time to appeal for the prof to allow him to co-take module A with the pre req, there was no reply. The only thing i know was although my result is better than the friend, i was not in the first class range. So i do not know if the prof by chance miss out on my friend's second email or the prof really did find ways to check the student's results somehow to decide whether to waive pre req or not. (Btw i had never been taught by this prof before).

2) there is this particular module which is considered difficult by most people. I did not do well in one of the assignments but the prof emailed me to explain why i obtained this particular mark even though i did not ask him why. Nevertheless i thank him for giving me comments so i could learn from my mistakes. To my pleasant surprise, after he marked the final exam papers, he emailed me back to say that i had done very well in the final exams, which is probably true after i see my final results. My question is how do profs know the student's name from the matric number? Do they know the name only after they keyed in the marks, as the system will reveal students' name after the results were keyed in? Or the prof went to find out about this student's marks?

Why can't engineering lecturers be more engaging and lively? Professors in FASS are much more animated and teach with passion. Maybe Engin contents are just dry and boring, but the lecturers' voice is not helping either. :( 

I chose Engin thinking that I can learn how stuffs work, but all I see everyday is Mathematics. Learning coding is fine and practical, but I cannot see how Maths can produce the end result. Am I too shortsighted or is this normal?

Sigh too late to change course; what was I thinking..

For an average student, the fees per semester that we are paying for is approximately 3.5++k per semester. Having to pay this amount of money even when on a semester long industrial attachment is perfectly fine. But does NUS realise that the amount of money the companies pay to their interns is not sufficient to even pay for their semester's fees even though they are working full time?
The companies gives on average, $800 per intern from NUS. After taking into consideration $400 for transport and food per month, we are left with $1800 for the 4.5 months of work. Barely enough for half of the fees that we are supposed to pay. Even hiring an intern from NUS is cheaper than that of hiring a paper boy who photocopies documents for them, in which some of my friends end up doing during their attachments.
There's the argument about experience being more important than pay, yada yada. But can't NUS do something about this issue?

Those students who stay in Hall, but skip all their lectures and generally are in it for "hall activities", are inconsiderate, irresponsible and selfish. Stop wasting your parents' money; just stay at home and watch webcast and leech off your friends' notes and time when exams come like ya'll always do lah. You deprive those students who really wanted a slot in that lecture (and they will turn up) or those who really needed to stay on campus because they stay 2 hours away from NUS. Sincerely, a student who stays near Changi Village and couldn't get a slot in Hall and in some modules. Shoot me.

I am already in my year 3 of my university year. This problem had been bugging me ever since i entered university. 90% of the time i cannot understand or catch foreign lecturer accent, especially ang moh ones, mainly because they speak too fast or pronouce some words differently and i was unable to guess what they were saying. Worst, i think i am the only one who cannot catch what they are saying, judging from the fact that everyone laugh at the prof's joke but i can't since i don't know what he is talking. Even in english films, i had problems understanding what was being said and i really must look at the subtitle or risk not understanding what is going on for most part of the movie..

I had thought of emailing the profs about this problem but was afraid the prof may judge me since i am highly likely to be the only one who cannot understand accents. They would probably think its impossible that a uni undergrad is unable to understand their accents. I think the best i could do was to google as much as i can but there is only so much i can do to help myself comprehend what was being said in class. 

Why is it that i can only understand local english (singlish in particular) but have so much problem understanding ang moh accent? (In fact this is a major reason preventing me from going western countries for exchange as i fear being unable to communicate with the locals there). My english grade from PSLE to O level to A levels (GP) went from A to B3 to C. So is it merely a problem of my english being so bad that i cannot understand ang moh prof 90% of the time or is it due to lack of exposure ? What can i do to improve this situation? Is it too late to help myself be able to understand accent properly? Please help..

No, there is no such thing as a blacklist. You're too f small fry. Small companies are too small fry. Big corporates are not gonna waste time doing that. If you're a bad employee, it's a plus for them to have you working for rival firms.

Go for courses. Take up jobs and build up your resume and skills. Go network. Build up your interview skills. Read. You are clearly lost, and would like to shift the responsibilities to some non existent blacklist. Look within yourself and try to see how you can improve. I can't give a more honest advice.

 35% of international scholars here graduate with 2:2 and below. I wonder what's the figure for local scholars? If the average local (sponsored or not) indeed graduates with 2:2 and below then perhaps the current way of awarding international scholarships is good enough. Or can we be more targeted to improve the international scholars' performances?

Personally I think the 15% + international exposure we get justifies the expenditure, but you also clearly haven't read a previous confession that OFA turned him/her down due to 'insufficient funds'. Sure it's only an anecdote but...

Why is my post rejected? I am genuinely troubled by this and I really seek the answer to this... I've already dug out the email of my hiring manager and apologized in hopes of being forgiven and taken off the blacklist (If there ever is one, or even one list especially for recruit agencies) This is not a troll and I am really desperate for any advice given as this concerns my "ricebowl" for the rest of my life.... Haiz I wish they could forgive me since I was only a teenager who didn't knew better at the time... Is there really such a thing as a blacklist? How can I remove myself from the black list? I really really hope you can post this, thanks a lot!!!!!

Is it possible to be blacklisted by public and private companies? Do they share a secret portal online that lists out all the names of people whom they should avoid hiring? How it possible that I was forever rejected and nobody ever wants to hire me no matter what kind of jobs I've applied for? During my summer break I've tried applying for random jobs like teaching tuition/promoter/sales promoter/retail assistant/accountant/admin assistant/data entry/packer etc...but I kept getting rejected...
Recently when I apply for whatever intenship positions I can find on career portal/apply for any and every job that "welcomes fresh graduates", I am also rejected by them...
This is too much of a coincidence...This matter has been troubling me and I feel really unease about this... (A few years ago I've offended my hiring manager by shouting and throwing a tantrum at him because I half-suspected he belonged to a crime syndicate that makes people work for free and cheat them of their salary but it turns out to be completely untrue, he's just really lazy and I am really afraid that he keeps a track record of blacklisted employees and publishes it to other companies that'll ruin me for life... ) Does anyone know any information about being blacklisted by companies? Is there a website where I can find out if I have a bad record or if I've been blacklisted such that all the companies will avoid hiring me? How can I apologize to the hiring manager who blacklisted me? Or how can I remove myself from the blacklisted position so that they will give me a new chance and hire me again? 

Thank you immensely for your kindness! Any help would be appreciated!!

With regards to , I can't help to notice that the change in bus service for D1 to go from Utown to the other side of Engin was mentioned to be due to NUSSU. I would like to clarify that it is actually suggested by another club/society directly to Office of Campus Amenities (OCA) and I strongly believe that NUSSU was not involved.

Moral of story: NUSSU is not the only entity taking care of NUS Students. Sometimes the students have to take care of themself.
-
 
I'm yet to wonder why people keep calling one of the NUSSU elections teams incumbent. I only recognize three faces out of the whole team from the previous EXCO. 

And anyways even if they are, don't we all have to rise up the ranks? Whose heard of anyone becoming president without having represented the students or been in the organization before? Even Obama was Senator before. 

Not sure if it's extremely foolish or too ambitious. Don't know why students want to wait till their final year to suddenly jump to the top or voice out 'change'. Sigh.

Cb la, what saga? Liverpool kena trounced 3-0 by West Ham also more interesting than what NUSSU election sia..

Let's face it. Whichever team won the elections is of little to no consequence for the general school populace. How dare people even compare this to the upcoming GE, bodoh sia..

Seriously, I like my school year ahead with as little NUSSU and their publicity stunts as possible.

I'm a girl and I'm 22, but I'm only a freshie. I went a long route of NA, retaining in JC, retaking A Levels... I feel so judged when people learn about my age. I'm older than the guys in my batch and the girls are so young, it's so hard to click with them. :( Anyone with similar stories? Of unconventional academic journeys? Sigh~

The Computer Science programme in SoC is becoming slacker and slacker. Highest distinction used to require at least an A- in FYP, but now requires only a pass.

In light of the NUSSU saga that's going on about how NUSPA does not endorse their own representatives, I have something to say about our own engineering representatives running for NUSSU EXCO.
The engineering representatives for AUTC don't even attend any of the MANY engineering events held by the Students' Engineering Club. How will they be poised for the best interests for the Engineering students? Was this team just some rojak team put together for the interest of their team leader?
Conversely, the supposedly 'incumbent' team has been around helping us out since last year.

Got anyone cry before exam cause never study? Will teacher give chance or not?

I used to be very hardworking but now only like to take shortcut in everything. I spend my time laughing at my classmate who cannot calculate properly and accuse him of cheating. I sued one of my gay classmate when I was the one whole stole his money for safekeeping. I told my sinkie teacher that she is useless and threaten to replace her with cheaper, better and faster pinoy teacher. 

Do you think i should be kick out of school for bullying classmates and teacher instead of studying? Will crying 2 weeks before the exam help?

I have a suspicion most of these kids running for student councils, with a few exceptions (and bless the exceptions), think uni is like JC. JC do student council because it's good for uni applications, therefore uni do student council because it's good for job application. Unfortunately, it's not true.

Is it possible to be re-admitted into my previous Double Degree Programme if I have dropped it?

I have been going through very intense internal struggles and I dropped my DDP several weeks ago. Now I regret it and am wondering if there is any possibility of reverting it back. (My grades are pretty good btw.)

If you choose to join a committee, at least do the work allocated to you. Don't simply go MIA and expect your fellow members and chairperson to clean up your shit. You did nothing the last semester, but you still have the guts to claim credit for things which weren't done by you.  No wonder some people think we all join just to beautify our resume.

Lecturers who provide incomplete lecture notes and no webcast to force students to appear for lectures, do you know that they are too busy copying down whatever you are presenting to listen to what you're saying? I don't know if seeing a sea of students busily copying down your slides makes you feel like you're teaching, but they'll learn about as much if you just kept quiet while they're copying.

If you want students to learn, encourage them to listen to what you're saying.

What is the point of the government spending so much on providing more University placings in sub par Universities? Is it really necessary to have 40% of graduates per cohort? Why not just provide more funds and resources for existing students from reputable local universities? Like more scholarships?

Please don't judge other people's social life based on their amount of social media posts. Hey, I have quite an interesting life too and I do go out with friends, visit places, eat nice food. Just because I don't take pictures and post them up, you assume I am some loner...

I took a module last semester, and somehow this girl introduced herself to me. She treated me as her friend with academic benefit, only asking me for homework help. It was seriously irritating but I could not find a way to get rid of her. She was so blatant in her asking after a while that giving her hints was not enough, I had to practically feed her the answers. But the assignments were graded, and she copied my answers word for word! This sem, I was shocked to see her in my mod again, even though we are of different majors. During lectures, she keeps sitting near me but not next to me, as I sit with my other friends. I am so thankful that this mod only has midterms and finals, hopefully she will not approach me for the rest of this sem. Fingers crossed!

Hi , try being forced to take Physics, Chemistry or Biology as Core Modules - not even electives.

Is it weird that my dream job is to be a waitress then going on to be restaurant/bistro manager/supervisor? The job doesn't pay much but I truly enjoy interacting with customers, looking at food and checking the ingredients. And since I'll be working long hours, it's not like I have time to spend much money, so I can save a lot too. I was a waitress for part-time job throughout NUS so I know that's what I really want to do. Then meanwhile, all my friends aspire to be investment bankers and fund managers which pay a crapload of money.

Regarding , haven’t anyone thought that perhaps better effort could be spent trying to collectively solve the problem for people like her? If she could have simply gotten a bank loan, she would! But those who have tried getting bank loans know that getting a guarantor is extremely difficult, and the interest over the schooling 4 years piles and kills (12%p.a compounding interest over 3 years… wow…, and needs monthly minimal payment) . 20k seems like a lot for an individual, but think about it, NUS Rag raised nearly half million for charity. Isn't it quite a shame that the NUS student body cannot help save a fellow schoolmate the guilt from selling her virginity just because of 20k? She is after one of us, a schoolmate, a potential future wife to someone too. 

My back of the envelop proposal to such problems in the future: A social enterprise that combines elements of crowdfunding, P2P lending and micro-finance. Make a loan plus partial donation (if require) to people who fall through the cracks due to emergencies, with funding from the whole student population. 

The cost and impact: 30k new students a year. If each student gives an average of $10 over their whole uni tenture, then its 300k, which implies u could potentially save 15 gals from escorts service every year. Do we have more than 15 NUS escorts? I bet yes. Do we have 15 NUS girls who would have chosen not to be a social escort if given a social loan fiancé collectively and to be paid back after graduation? Maybe… I dun know. Hopefully not, but reality might be a harsh one. You would probably have heard of desperate and stupid decisions people make, causing much pain and regret. We can save that regret.

The operating/business model: For every request of desperate need for money, we make that loan, for exchange of (1) a right to film a documentary of their crisis, (2) the right to authenticate the truthfulness of story via perhaps hospital receipt etc (3) divulge the identity of the person seeking help to the donors/lender (4) and a contractual loan agreement that shelf interest commencement till their NUS commencement & (5) to divulge the full story to the public eye if the person eventually breaks their end of the promise. 

Clauses: No we dun sue them if they can't pay, lenders takes the risk of defaulting. But the whole world knows, with proof of the borrowers' story. I believe there will be those who genuinely deserve a haircut, in which, forcing a bankruptcy makes no sense. I believe too, that accountability is important, and borrower must give back what they take from the system, wherever they can. 

Ending note: we can continue to salute sacrifices that OP of  makes if none of us make an effort to eradicate such a problem. And we can continue to bash each other about moral issues, every time someone else sacrifices.  But we can make an end to this. 

If this confession gets 3,000 likes, 250 shares, with 50 comments to volunteer to attempt to take this proposed solution to execution (like 6 hours of effort a week) and at least 3 law students/practitioners familiar with finance regulation and 2 computing students able to write apps, I will reveal myself to those comments and volunteer as tribute… I mean director. My resume for this includes a short stint as MNC employee, social consulting service, SME intern, and company director.

I am a year 2 engin student, and under graduation criteria > faculty requirements I have ES1531. However for my intake we took GEK1549 in place of ES1531, same module different code. Since GEK1549 is a GEM, does it count toward my 2 GEM requirement as well as the faculty requirement? Or must I take 2 other GEM mods?

Also, how does reading a module during industrial attachment work? On my department's recommended schedule it says I am to read HR2002 and 1 more mod during my industrial attachment. How would I attend lessons while I'm on attachment?

I'm a JC 2 student, planning to stay in hall next year when I enter university. When asking for advice on which hall to enter, here's what a senpai said. 

"EH is a pretty dark place. For all I know, many people I see still staying this year have a wide network of connections. Those who worked hard for their CCAs were denied stays. Is this the culture that's being promoted in this hall? I don't know man. Maybe a coincidence but I should have just tried making friends here and there and not go for CCAs. Lollll idk about the other halls maybe I can help ask around"

Really? What other halls should I go then? THANKS! I know abit too early to ask but A lvl revision is tiring. Need a break

Am I the only who feels the NUSSU have a lot of self centered person who are only concern about their portfolio. Not that everyone in NUSSU is bad, just that I have not hear anything good about them, even from people inside. And seeing the upcoming election candidates, some are my friends, I feel that they are even more pompous then the GE.

hi there!

my friend and i love music and love performing, but so far we weren't able to get the opportunities to do so. we tried joining the groups in sch, but they were a little too high level for us and we ended up being excluded :/

so, we were thinking of creating our own unofficial student interest group! it would involve practicing and busking in random places in sch! :D everyone in the group would have the opportunity to sing or perform together with any instrument of choice (be it a waterbottle, chopsticks etc etc...). itll pretty much be like a 'hobo' or 'hippie' group haha. we can chill out with some music and beers! :)

this will be OPEN TO EVERYONE, and WILL NOT HAVE ANY PREREQUISITES WHATSOEVER for you to join! we're open to all genres of music, but we like mainly el songs (alternative, indie and mainstream pop) though!

we havent really decided on a name for our group yet, so feel free to leave suggestions!

would anyone be interested in making music with us? :)

p.s. if we get enough responses we'll post another confession about the details of our first practice session :)

10 reasons why I'm not hiring a Singaporean developer.

1. Most developers are males which have reservist. Those unfit ones have to do RT. Huge waste of time.
2. CPF costs ain't cheap.
3. Those good ones are not here anymore. If you are, you are dumb in another way, too dumb to leave.
4. They have no creativity.
5. They cannot write/write well.
6. They job-hop too much.
7. They have no social skills.
8. They demand the world in salary but not the productivity to justify it.
9. They all insist on a work-life balance even before they have earned it.
10. Their skills are not relevant to the work. I don't give a shit about your algorithms or data structure knowledge in the age of libraries. We are not Google. I care about writing the database, backend, webapps, iOS apps or Android apps. You mean SoC don't teach all of them to everyone?

NUS-educated foreigners are so much more value-for-money. Even though they have the above flaws, they compensate with being more worldly-traveled, usually can speak multiple languages and loyal.

 It's quite amazing to see Computer Science students learning the 2000+years old Aristotelian syllogism. In fact, I think every student should take some classes in Aristotelian Logic to train your mind. Quantitative errors can be rectified easily with better data. But Logical errors in arguments and hypothesis are difficult to rectified.

I have a confession. I am a final year Chemical Engineering student and over the summer, I had a one night stand with 2 girls from the same faculty.

Do you think I should still approach her?

I missed the first two days of Student Life Fair as my lectures clashes nicely with the fair itself, so I did not get to join Rock Climbing. I am so stuck with what I want to do at least in my first year of university life. It can't possibly be just studying and studying right. I didn't come from any major performing arts or sports cca in my entire education journey, so really, I have no idea what to join. I wanted to join NUS Stage but I fear that I will just be left as some backstage job (due to the seemingly strong competition for audition) which I don't really want. I also wanted to join Games Development but I don't even play computer games (not even Maple Story). I am so lost. I have no one to consult. How? :'( I need sincere guides.

Is it possible to do another bachelor's degree after graduation? I just came to realise that I really have interest in another subject but it seems that it's already too late as I'm already in my third year.

I really want to do this degree although it probably will contribute nothing to my work life. I want to take it just for the sake of interest...

Somebody suggested me to take a master's degree instead. How is a master's degree different from bachelor? What do you guys all think? Is there any way for me to receive education on another subject after I finish my undergraduate education?

I hate GER1000. It is the most irritating, annoying, redundant,repetitive, monotonous, and confusing module as hell. After viewing and reviewing all the video lecture I get even more confuse. This is a mind-fucked module. Omg the spreadsheet. When you want to show people the formula can you please at least name the cell instead of showing us all the cell address? Who got time to trace every single cell in the goddamn long formula. Seriously please review and improve your work and make it less confusing and simple to understand.

I'm sorry I have to rant because school has been nothing but shitty thus far. I thought my return to school after a 2 years of hiatus would be smooth but in life you always don't get what you want. 

1. I was injured in school during one of the sports events. I had a really bad ankle sprain and the doctor said that I have to undergo a MRI scan because I heard a really loud pop sound when I sprained it. Little did I know that the MRI scan is horrendously expensive. Initially I wanted to skip the scan because my family can't afford it. But till now it's not even healing and the thought of not being able to engage in sports or dance really kills me. My insurance only covers a limited amount so I really stressing out over this.

2. I applied for bursary from NUS but the school rejected my application because they said my PCI was more than $1900. I maybe an arts student but I certainly know my math. I went back to check with my parents and I emailed the office once I confirmed that my PCI was way lower than $1900. I really needed this bursary because it breaks my heart to see my parents having to juggle with my sibling's university and polytechnic fees along with mine. But the school rejected me ''ín view of limited funds''. 

3. I finished two years of my service in NS diligently and converted to citizen this July. I tried to ask if I had my PSEA account set up and the ORD bonus could be used to offset some of my fees. I called the hotline only to find out that the bonus is only for citizens who completed their NS meanwhile PRs don't get any of these benefits. I believe that when you complete certain stages of your reservist, the government will top up your CPF and your PSEA accounts. Does it mean that I'm not entitled for these benefits too? Then what for do I give 12 years of my life to the nation only to not receive any help from the country. 

I'm really quite stuck and I had considered other ways to earn quick money, but my moral values and desperateness are having a huge fight going on right now. So if anyone could offer me some help please leave it in the comments.

I am a year 4 student and I don't feel any different from when I was in year 1. 
Most of the things I've learned are forgotten. 
Most of the internships I've gone through sounds prestigious but meh. 
If all is well in my final year I'll be graduating with first class honours but damn I feel like I'm cheating on my future employer because I'm still that girl before entering uni. 
I don't mug hard, I just study a few days before exams. 
I only complete assignments that are graded, and I feel like a bad student. 
Please overwhelm me with criticisms because I deserve them. 
Meanwhile, it's time for me to apply for a job......hmmmm......or should I further my studies?

All the stories on feeling alone and no one to talk to is making me bored.

Firstly, I think you should widen your scope and open up to the world. Why nvr go for camps? Why nvr go orientation? The fact that you don't know ppl in sch is the result of you being passive in engaging with others. Second, nvr go for camp, don't know ppl. Of course no one to talk to and sit with. If is like that, learn from exchange students. Talk more with course mates in class. Discuss during labs. Thirdly, if you still can't do the above, then you need to convince yourself that being alone is not a bad thing.

My family is quite rich and my sister and I have a huge sum of inheritance and the family business waiting for us when the inevitable happens, but I am known as the guy who's constantly broke among my friends. I limit my monthly spending to a minimal amount because the industry I plan to go into is very passion driven and probably won't give me big bucks. I plan to just give my share of the inheritance to my sister or some charity organisation.

I am a financially needy student. All my life I have been avoiding going on overseas trip etc with my schools as I am worried that it will be financially straining for my family... after all these years, I feel like I have missed out on these opportunities and experiences. This motivated me to work really hard for my A level so that I could qualify for a scholarship and not miss out on opportunities such as hall life and SEP because of my family's financial situation. I held leadership position in my sports team in school back in secondary school and JC(though we didn't win anything). Alas, I only had 4 As for A level.. I panicked and applied for many different scholarships and none replied.. while I had a glimmer of hope when I discovered about the bursaries that NUS provides, it was short lived as I realised that it was still insufficient to cover my expenses should I stay in a hall.. sigh life sucks.

Wow. I completely screwed up my lab work for CM2191 banana oil synthesis today... The separatory funnel was not tight and I spilled the mixture. Later the CO2 generated blew out the stopper and while I was shaking the funner, and I again lost a lot. At last I got only a tiny drop of my product, although I think I had synthesized a lot. The purification process was just too messy for me!! 
I got great lecturer and TAs to help me but the result was still a disaster. My yield was close to 0%. As an aspiring chemist-to-be I am super sad now. :(  I know such things happen in chemistry lab, but I am also feeling ashamed by my poor lab techniques. :((  Not sure if I will become a qualified chemist by graduation or not.
Anyway, I think I have to cheer up now and prepare more for the next experiment.

To 

Hi, I'm the op of .

I think it's a good first step that you've recognized your issues. I feel that what you need may not simply be accommodation, but also a sense of belonging. If it helps, you could stay in school daily and commute home at night, where it's more likely to have seats. I'm sure there are plenty of places you can study, PGP is one. 

Studies-wise, if your course is reading-heavy, it helps if you'll take the time to read readings beforehand. If possible, write/create short notes and bring them to lectures. If your course requires lots of formulas, then all the better. I've only recently discovered the treasures in CL, and tried to use rephrasing of concepts in other books for better understanding.

I'm not telling you to neglect social like ofc, but trust me, you'll feel better once you feel you're in control of your life. Try out different ccas, expose yourself to new friends, and enjoy the knowledge learnt. Take this time to learn independence?

How do I open up myself to contribute more during class or group projects? I have always wanted to voice out my ideas and prepare for tutorials but along the way, I always feel unmotivated to do so as I feel that my ideas are never good enough. Sometimes I also tend to feel like my answers are wrong/stupid.

 I do not come from a JC like most of you all and was from a neighbourhood secondary school (a normal academic student, at that) Making me feel really inferior about myself. I always think that I am never as smart as my classmates. Its a struggle and I think I'm losing it to the point that I don't really care if I don't speak up. I do complete all the required work (e.g reports and presentations) though. I just feel that I do not contribute and not smart enough for this school.

Has anyone tried appealing for tutorial slots via CORS and was successful in doing so? I did not manage to get a slot for a core module as the classes I am available for are full.

Hi everyone. I'm an NUS super needy student. And I'm a freshie. While everyone is talking about relationship matters, I'm trying to think how to go through my University life without developing major gastric problem. I have questions:

1. Where can you get free food for lunch and dinner? I know this is a stupid question but I'm giving it a shot maybe there really is a community service in NUS that give away free foods. I'm just guessing. 

2. Which stall at which canteen sell rice e.g Nasi Lamak below $2? Seriously my budget spending is $2 a day.  

3. Where can I get free books? Is there a book donation drive or some kind somewhere that I can go and grab a few books and papers? 

4. WHY JOINING CAMP/ORIENTATION/CCA ETC HAVE TO PAY SO MUCH MONEY? REALLY? NUS? EVERYTHING NEED TO PAY? SO IF I DON'T HAVE MONEY I DONT GET TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL BESIDE GOING FOR LECTURE AND GO HOME SUCK THUMB? EVEN PRINTING STUDY MATERIAL ALSO NEED TO PAY OMGGGGGGG.  

IT'S BEEN ONLY 1 WEEK BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE DROPPING OUT ALREADY!

As a male medical student I tend to limit my choice of potential partners to people within the faculty, not out of some elitist notion, but because I am unsure if girls of other faculties will easily accept a bf working long hours on shift work, especially since I'm thinking of joining a rather intense specialty eventually. I haven't even gotten started on all the studying (for specialist exams), Continuing Medical Education courses, and research (an increasing focus in medicine) that happens in the after hours.

I am a freshman this year, and I went to the Student Life fair yesterday. However I am actually interested in creating a new club rather than joining a pre-existing one. My main concern is whether I can find people with a similar interest as me. I don't dare to take the plunge because of this. Hope to get some advice for this. ^^'

To 
It's not easy readjusting your priorities, when they each matter to you in different ways. I have been juggling school, work and volunteering since the start of my freshmen year, and it has been fruitful and tiring all at the same time. But if you want to excel at a certain area, you do have to spend more time and effort on it, and as such, it is important that you learn how to let go.

I am working a full day every week (under a contract) that gives me enough pocket money to cover my daily expenditures. On the other hand, I try to allocate enough time to study as I think school is my main priority as a student. Hence, the only part I can cut back on is my volunteering. It is something I tried not to touch when I started uni, especially when you feel obligated to the children you are tutoring. But I need the extra time to study and rest (don't underestimate the amount of time you need to recharge! Once you burn out, you can't provide a spark to others as well too), so I told our volunteering head in advance that I was most unlikely to commit regularly when the semester starts. (On a side note, our volunteering head is juggling uni, a couple of jobs, and volunteering. It's obvious he's not sleeping much, but his passion for volunteering keeps him coming every week still!)

As for time with family/friends (Not being attached is honestly one less commitment and responsibility to worry about oops)... While it is not one or the other, you do have to somewhat choose which group of people you want to spend more time with. I'm more of a family person, so naturally I prefer to go right home after lessons instead of hanging out with friends out of lessons/CCAs. A few friends have joked that I have "no life", but that's really how you define how you want to spend your life I guess! There's no right and wrong no matter your choices as long as you can answer to yourself (;

All the best!!!

Whenever I come across a pretty girl in lecture, I would fantasize so much to the extent that I can't focus on what the professor is saying. After I am done with my lessons and have returned home, the first thing I would do is to search the cohort list on IVLE for the pretty girl's name, and I would double check if it is her by using facebook. After which I would send her a friend request and I would proceed to stalk through her photos, while stroking my disco stick. This whole process of sieving through names usually takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours depending on the cohort size or whether she has a prominent facebook profile or not.

As a result, a 2 hour lecture + another perhaps 2 hours worth of studying time for a module would be spent on fantasizing about my coursemates and relieving myself. And this 4 hours is just spent on one module.  I will be having six modules this semester, which is one additional module from my usual five! Some simple math would tell me that I would spend a whopping 4 x 6 = 24 hours per week just on pure pleasure this semester! And this is not taking into consideration the tutorials and group project meetings I will have...

The minimum 20 hours per week last 2 semesters have already driven my CAP to an all time low of 3.8x (last digit not revealed to protect my identity). I honestly can't begin to fathom how the additional 4 hours per week would affect me in terms of my CAP..

I need advice. Urgent ones, as I promised my mom that I would get first class honours by the end of 4 years so she would get me a new car. I really want that sweet Mercedes...and my CAP isn't exactly helping the situation.

Is it true that if you study very hard to the very end just for a cert, yr working world will be long lasting, meaningful and enjoyable? That's what most of my friends think when they got into Uni. Work hard and dream big enough? Just a slight track off, I have seen ITE student prospering earlier than ??? I am also a Uni student just to share my views and feelings here only. So in all, is it all depending on individual or a plain paper in this current world? Current world now looking at qualifications only and of course character as well. Plz debate and comment for me...

Hi everyone, I need some advice, thanks in advance! I'm in my last year, and haven't been doing enough internship in areas of my interest, so I'm planning to do a winter internship, but the internship dates all cut into the next semester. Has anyone here took winter internship that cuts into the semester before? Did you choose to go for lectures or did you let the interviewers know beforehand and maybe have a half day work schedule? Thanks again!

After 2 years in NUS, I finally understood that it is better to do what I am good at than what I love. I love biology but life science is not my forte. I should have chosen Geography long ago. Ah, if only this is Life Is Strange/D4/Harry Potter, I would gladly turn back time and chose Geography instead. #pewdiepiefan #lifeisstrangeaddict

Can profs just decide to cancel a tutorial slot even before balloting opens? He's just doing it as he assumes a slot will have low sign up. Couldn't he at least just wait until balloting is over to have a sense of how popular that slot might be, before actually deciding to cancel that tutorial slot? Pretty unfair considering we plan our timetables using their schedules provided, and they just change it as they wish. Actually, I'm just bloody sore cause I am forced to have a 3-day work week instead of the initially planned 2-day work week. Dammit. - Year 3 FASS student.

K ranting so CORS is really stupid like I have a swap request from Class 1 to Class 2 which is pending but yet I can simply choose to update to Class 2?  I mean why?? If there's a space in Class 2 just assign it to me then drop my Class 1 la why must wait until there is someone who want to swap from Class 2 to Class 1? Doesn't make sense now I have to stalk CORS to see if there's anyone dropping Class 2...

I have applied and got accepted for Medicine in one of the universities in China not recognised by Singapore Medical Council. I am fully aware that China's medical degrees, except for 8 universities' program, are not recognisd and not allowed to practise in Singapore. Do I take a risk to quit studying and go for it? It is recognised and eligible for USMLE, PLAD and AMC Exams though. A dilemna indeed over a top Singapore university vs an unrecognised medical degree from China.

I'm strongly against equalising every schools resources. I came from a neighbourhood school where gangfights and substance abuse were commonplace. 
 Let's say somehow we improved a schools available resources like-reducing the teacher to student ratio, provided more learning resources and improved facilities to better facilitate students. Assuming this happened in my secondary school ( God forbid ) there would be a marginal effect on a students education because no one would utilise them. 
Yes, there would be a handful of students that will benefit from it such as myself. But now we have to consider what taking away these resources mean to a student from an elite school, where students have the capacity and the eagerness to learn. 

Yeah, ideally - all students are pushed to their maximum potential but in an ideal world there wouldn't be cancer, aids and poverty. In an un-ideal world like ours, the most pragmatic way would be to leave the resources to schools which have a good track record of using them. 

With regards to converting wealth into academic advantages? One thing I've learnt in JC is that the more other students take up tuition, the more time your tutor would have for you. 

Plus, there is absolutely no way to stop wealthy parents from spending money to benefit their child. Every parent wants the best for their kid, plus if I had spare cash I'd do the same and you would too.

I'm from computing, I've just been rejected for my appeal of taking a 16MC sem. Coming from poly, If i take 4 mods every sem from now till graduation, I will still graduate by 3.5 years. I've reasonably proved that fact. I know of many others who are in the same situation as well. I will bid for a 2 MC module for this sem, but I feel actions should be taken before next semester starts. 

Am I supposed to take 5 mods every semester and 1 mod for my final semester? Am I supposed to clear more than my course requirements? If so what are the benefits of going to poly? And these extra mods will affect my CAP as well. 

Does anyone know who can we bring this issue up to, and also, anyone wants to join me to make NUS administration re-think this new rule? I will Identify myself if there is anyone who can help.

 An ideal being impossible is not a justification of consciously choosing to not improve the allocation of resources. A commenter said that "you can't make it (a horse) drink" but since you were from a neighbourhood school as I am as well, you ought to know that many are not even aware of the opportunities available - the knowledge conferred at the family level at the very beginning is already unequal, though not a problem per se.

The thing is this - a slightly above average but poorer student will do worse than an average but rich student. Your experience in neighbourhood schools may justify your view that there is a strong correlation between the ineptitude of students and the poor ranking of schools, thus the latter do not deserve more than marginal funding, but all these hinges on the assumption that the students knowingly spurned opportunities to improve themselves and their prior education in neighbourhood primary schools can prepare a national average student to score >200. The stereotype that certain streams are 'condemned' exist for a good reason.

Sometimes I wonder why I still bother to ponder endlessly over problems like these. I made it out, right? That vindicates the government's social mobility measures and everyone else who didn't make it through are necessarily inadequate, so I should not be looking back and wondering how to prevent their children from unknowingly falling into the same cycle, right?

I enjoyed the OfficialPAPIBGuy's response to my original confession though. I just feel sad when I hear stories from my MOE TS/TA friends. Sorry for the rant.

Apologies for another national policy-related post, but I would like to moot the point of meritocracy & our education system.

(Link to speech transcript) http://www.ri.edu.sg/UIs/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=4i3je77wxy33msjl3byk6mios4%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D

I was under LLC and don't know how this guy is as principal, but I think his points are very valid.

I don't agree that families should be left to convert wealth into academic advantages, and am also not satisfied with the disparity in standards across neighbourhood and elite schools.

But at the same time given the resource constraints, the above-average students will be hampered should we equalise every school's available resources and teaching standards. The sorting in P6 is thus an uncomfortable reality we need to accept...?

Special shoutout to the OfficialPAPIBGuy :D Would love to hear your view on this too since it's also your alma mater.

I still find it hard to send emails to professors at times, even though I'm already in year 4. :/ Especially response emails, when they clarify your question. Sending a "thank you" as an email response feels like it's just wasting their time to read another email, but not sending that email makes me feel like I'm very rude.

In recent years the politcal landscape in Singapore have changed alot. This time round seems like every 啊猫啊狗 can just set up a political party and contest in the GE machiam like rag & flag. 
Since the last GE after LTK managed to clinch a GRC with his team, PAP seems to have opened up to negotiations.
I look forward to a watershed election this year. Good luck to all oppositions. Have you have enough votes to retain your deposit fees.

How to get lost 

When I came to the Freshmen Inauguration Ceremony I got lost in the most spectacular and inconvenient way possible. I was suppose to go to the faculty of science to get my ticket but since I live near the east coast and got stuck in traffic, I arrived an hour later. After that I was meant to navigate my way to the cultural center somehow and as luck would have it I took the wrong bus. Which meant that I had to walk for 30 minutes in the rain. (Yay.)

 I guess in that moment I felt like I was in the right place (even though I was still stuck at FASS). I didn't get biomedical engineering (my first choice)  since I didn't really take HL Physics in IB and HL Math did not help me much. But in a weird turn of events I was happy not to get my first choice, because it was ultimately what my parents wanted me to do and not what I really wanted to do. I was delusional about how much I actually wanted to study BME. Only a quarter of that course was interesting to me and I can tell you that I am genuinely excited about learning everything on the life sciences guide. My mom says either you become a doctor or a engineer or a potato. Nobody wants to say my kid will become a vegetable someday. 

After I finally found my way to the cultural center, I realised something about myself. I realised that I was bound to get lost in life and that my most fatal flaws would get keep chasing me. But that doesn't mean that I am not stubborn enough to keep ploughing through everything anyways. Somehow, I can and I will forge a path for myself regardless of the odds and my turbulent history. 

I have no idea how I will make any friends when I live so far away from campus and I didn't attend the science camp because I didn't get my offer until mid July. I honestly don't know if I actually will become a potato after doing science because as always I am very skeptical about the economy. The one thing, I do know is that experience is the most valuable thing in life and you don't have it when you actually need it. You only get valuable experience after you drag yourself through mud, get lost a couple of times and screw up a bit here and there. 

I'm not afraid of getting lost, because I know at the end of it all I will have a good story to tell.

I don't think I'm mentally well. I don't want to go "see someone" to check. I reckon I'm depressed. 

School is starting in a few days, and it's my last year. I already got a thesis supervisor months ago, and met up with her once. But since then I havent  done anything at all. I cant bring myself to do anything lately. Not even to "play" or do anything fun. I have been considering taking LOA but I'm not sure if its a good idea. I really need more time to get myself sorted. But then, it's my last year, and thesis takes a whole acad year, not just one sem. Plus, my parents would not understand and would SO not be happy if i took LOA. If i did take LOA I wouldn't know what to do either. All i know is I'm crying myself to sleep every night (I sleep like more than 12hours a day), my room is a mess and so is my head. It's a miracle that I could bring myself to shower everyday, really. 

Should I or should I not take LOA? Would they accept "Personal Reasons" just like that or would there need more details before approving the leave? I could say Financial Reasons though - I really am broke and have no idea how to pay for fees this sem. I'm not qualified for Financial Aid because Per Capita exceeds blabla. but my siblings are all working to pay for their schools too. 

Anyway. LOA or carry on?

I feel that I am like Arsenal. I can win all the pre-season trophies, then when the true shit starts I get hammered by West Ham.

Perhaps if every RAG recycles the trash from the previous year, people would see the vanity of this exercise. 

It's not that there are no good points, but there are better ways to do them. You want to show you're hard-working, publish a paper. You want to show sincerity to special needs kids, visit them regularly. You want to show you care for the environment, clean up trash after events. You want to show unity with new friends, volunteer for NDP. Don't put on a show for the sake of showing off.

I was sick and tired of being evergreen so I desperately trying to find a girlfriend in my first year that I failed 2 of my mods and did very badly for the rest of my mods. I have to retake most of my mods ( much like uni version of retain ) and I lagging behind everyone. I have just wasted one year. My life is screwed.
-
 
I wonder why round 3 of bidding always start when the semester starts...Haven't they realise how panicky some of us may be when we still had not gotten our last few modules? Worst, before you were confirmed to have gotten the module, the lesson happen to be on your first day of school... Does anyone know the rationale behind putting round 3 of bidding on first day of school instead of settling all the bidding during the vacations itself so that there is still time for appeal and all?

Most confessions here reveal an underlying unhappiness in our student / alumni community. In no particular order, here are things I find people posting:
1) difficulties in finding employment and building a career 
2) competition with foreigners for grades, scholarships, jobs,etc
3) loneliness and single-hood
4) failed relationships, taken crushes, cheating/uncommitted SO
5) dissatisfaction with looks and body image
6) overall depression and lack of direction
7) fear of rejection by society over one's sexuality 
8) financial & emotional difficulties faced by families 

This makes me sad :(

Hello everybody. Hope your SG50 long weekend is off to a good start. Just a quick question for anyone who's taken the CFG Headstart module. The description says that the online tutorials are available on Coursera. Does this mean we create our own personal account or the school creates one for us with our matric number? I know that they'll provide more info soon, but I'm just interested to find out. 
Also, for those who wanna take the first run of classes, does it start next week or from the second week? There's conflicting info given in two different places. So it would help if those who took it earlier can tell me when their's started. 
Thanks and Happy National Day!

Seems like with all the new compulsory modules and re-structuring of the General Education curriculum, first- and second-year students (particularly those pursuing majors with already highly structured curricula) are not going to enjoy the same kind of flexibility their seniors did, which is quite a pity.

I wonder why we are headed towards a more structured curriculum when six years ago, I vividly remember the unparalleled flexibility being one of the selling points of the undergraduate programme here. As far as I can tell, many people do make full use of the wiggle room to broaden their horizons quite a fair bit.

When can NUS like MIT etc. who share their course materials and provide online free lectures ? 
May I know if most of the NUS profs prepare their slides by just "copy and paste" and are lack of passion in teaching which eventually cause NUS not "presentable" in pedagogy?

my bf's family background is not very good and he still has 3 years more in uni while i will be graduating soon and has a better family background. Thus, my family has not been supportive of this r/s. we have been together for slightly over a year now. i do love him as he is of me but sometimes I ask myself if i can accept this financial difference.. me entering the workforce 3 years earlier and having family financial support. i can't decide to wait out and see what happens or put a stop to it...

Why SSB2217 only have 13 slots available?! If I'm not wrong, this results in unequal group sizes. And it could be unfair, especially when the group-work component is higher than 40% . makes no sense! Someone enlighten me!

How can one lonely guy get a girlfriend in NUS? Join a CCA? Speak up in class? Bid for more project based modules? Can't I just ask a girl out directly and try to see if we are compatible on subsequent dates, even if I am just a random stranger who saw you in public?
-
 
Do profs actually inform students that they've been given a poor peer review? People can say they'll give you good reviews but the converse could happen and you'll never know. Does this severely impact the grade received? This has been on my mind for a while now and I was so tempted to email the prof for one particular module for which I scored poorer than expected but didn't because I didn't want to look stupid; maybe people simply performed better than me in the finals rather than due to poor peer reviews.
-
 
I wanted to wait until the final results are out before posting this, but it would not make much of a difference.

Simply put, too many slots are allocated to the freshies. If you scroll through the open bidding statistics, there are so many gek and gem modules with the H/VH indicated. But look at the new codes(especially the geh), there are so many slots not taken up. I am just angry that after planning for more than 2 months, I could not get the module I wanted due to the unexpected reduced quota. Furthermore, the freshie section for my module has enough untaken slots to cover the extra bidders from us, the seniors.

I hope that the remaining slots can be open to all in Round 3A. So far, I cannot find any information if this could be true.
-
 
It's 2am. I still cannot sleep. Car suspension systems are running around my head for my fyp this coming year. And I still have a vehicle to fix later.

On the topic of choosing your groupmates, honestly if profs didn't group us together no one would want to work with exchange students. I had the misfortune of being grouped tgt w a PRC girl who was on exchange. Long story short, she did minimal work. During one group meeting, we asked her through WA where she was. No reply. 5 hours later as were were tidying up the report. We asked her for her matric number through WA again and she replied in 5 minutes -.- not saying all exchange students are like this but most aren't as motivated to work hard as the locals as their grades aren't counted! Maybe profs shd group exchange students in one group to not negatively affect the grades and work performance of other students.

The flipped classroom thing is bloody nonsense.

I paid NUS for the experience of a live lecture and not some online learning crap. There are better materials from Stanford/Harvard/MIT etc.

NUS better wake up their stupid idea.......

Just curious, what do most students look for when it comes to bidding/balloting for their timeslots? Which of the following are the most/least important to you all?
1) Avoid coming early (8am lectures)
2) Avoid ending late
3) Having a free day
4) Ending early on Friday
5) Avoid travelling too much between different locations on the same day
6) Avoid long days

If I have missed out anything you consider to be important feel free to mention them in your comments. Would love to hear what you all have to say about this. Thank you for your opinions.

Local universities will never be prestigious in Singapore context. Most of Singapore Govt elite scholars are sent oversea to renowned universities such as Cambridge and Stanford. The rest of the elite scholars study law and medicine in local uni. Rarely do you see elite govt scholars taking EEE/Math/Science in local universities although their ranking in these areas are higher than some of the oversea illustrious universities.

To the people who are against foreign students coming into NUS, I guess my question is: what then? A whole bunch of local people get bumped up from second-upper to first class honours, and everyone lives happily ever after?

The worth of a degree is entirely dependent on the university's standards and reputation, and any university that tries to claim to be one of the best without engaging the international student community is an outright joke. You may complain that foreign students are keeping you stuck in second-upper, but the reason why your second-upper is worth even half as much as it is right now is because of the same foreign students creating the competition needed to raise the bar of the entire university. I for one am grateful that I don't have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and fly overseas just to attend a university that is well-respected internationally. As, evidently, said foreign students have decided to do.

That's why a final-8 finish in the Olympics is worth so much more than a gold medal in a nameless local school track meet.

So the freshmen have new general education mods which only they can bid for. But why are so many slots allocated to them? They still have so many years to go, and this year they only need to fight among their batchmates for the slots. I am a year 2 and I have to fight with all the seniors who have more points! It is so annoying that I cannot rely on the bidding history anymore as the quota of several gems have changed due to the freshmen taking away all those slots. Why is the school allocating more slots to the freshmen than us? We have 3 batches fighting while they only have 1 batch!

Sorry for ranting, and I don't blame or hate the freshies. Just feel that the school is unfair. I wish I was a year younger.

I just graduated from nus and joined the civil service earning high 4k+ with my first class honours. I feel that I am a traitor/betrayer if I don't vote for the incument this coming election. After all..they are the one paying my high salary. 

In addition, I am also worried that my career path will be affected I voted for the wrong party. Any civil servants here who can advise whether this is true？

I never understood why so many salty guys keep using NS as some form of justification why they (Singaporeans) have it tougher than foreigners.

Coming from a Singaporean, sure I think 2 years NS made me delay my studies compared to my fellow female peers, but I don't see how it has anything to do with foreigners coming to study. Think about it; you dislike foreigners coming to study in your university just as much as ppl in the US and UK hate foreign students. Justified hatred? Or just jealous and salty that you aren't as good as them?

 Besides, I honestly didn't think that 2 years was a waste of my time. I made many really good friends, went through really good experiences with them, plus I have exciting stories to share with friends and family (and kids too). Furthermore, I could still use some spare time to read and upgrade myself.

So stop using NS to indicate that citizens have it tougher than foreigners, because it's just you being immature and self absorbed enough not to make full use of your 2 years. That's why you wasted your 2 years. You spent NS complaining, compared to others who invested in the experiences. No wonder you were buried in salt.

I have a similar experience as  recently. I graduated with honours degree in Science recently. I applied for this position through Recuit Express and I received a call from agents called L. She started with asking me how long I have been finding job and how interviews I already had. I told I already had X numbers of interviews. Then she commented 'So little?'. Then asked me what kind of job I was looking for. When I describe to her, she laughed and said 'So vague arh'. Then she asked about my expected salary. I said about 3k and lowest I would go is 2.8k. Then she said 'Is there a reason why you asking such a high pay?'. I said 'My friends all receiving higher than that'. Then she added 'Does you friends have more experience than you?'. I felt like I was being ridicule. She said the job that I applied for is for executives and I am not suitable for it. Then called me again 5 mins later to say she had a position for me. When I received the email of the job description... It is the exact same description of the job that I applied for.

Let's get some facts right before we get emotionally swayed by all the SG vs foreigner debate. The number stands at a mere 18% international students in local universities. That's not a lot. It's just right. So please don't complain as if they're taking up the entire university.

Secondly, some are complaining that they 'steal our As' in university. Would you rather they are mediocre then? What's the point of bringing in foreign talent if we can easily surpass them? The day we can easily beat the foreign talents here is the day we know that MOE is not doing their job. On top of that, the presence of a foreign scholar doesn't magically make you stupider. Yes, maybe if they weren't here you would have gotten your A. But your calibre would still be the same. The only reason you got your A is because you didn't face competition. Such hollow achievement. Understandably, most people who are anti-foreign scholars also have a lower CAP. It's understandable but you should look to improve yourself instead of blaming others.

Thirdly, NUS does derive a certain percentage of their rankings from having international students. It's a paradox. You want to get into NUS because it's a good and highly ranked school. But what makes NUS good and highly ranked is its diversity and its stiff competition is due to the fact that it's highly ranked. Don't want to face stiff competition? Go to a lower ranked school. 

Lastly, the foreign scholars here are not all rich kids and not all local students are poor students. Meet some of your classmates from Malaysia or Indonesia. They can tell you how bad they have it because their parents simply earn so much less due to the exchange rate and the fact that their country has a much smaller GDP per capita. In comparison, most locals in NUS have it so much better.

The only way I could afford to go through 3(hopefully 4) years of NUS was to take both the TFL and the living allowance.By the time I graduate, I would've accumulated about 50k worth of debt.My father is the sole breadwinner in the family and he would turn almost 70 by my graduation.The thought of the amount of debt and my parents old age means I have little margin for error in university.This puts so much pressure on me to concentrate my academics and I always have second thoughts when I want to do non-academic stuff like CCAs, camps or sports.I have considered working to support myself financially but then again the same thoughts creep through my mind.Any advice or reassurances?

To OP of 

I know how you feel! Try being a nursing student it is definitely 100% worse. Imagine day after day of people giving you the "oh"  look when you  tell them you're a nursing student, then saying "why you choose nursing?" or worse, when you go for clinical attachments the question becomes "nursing got degree ah?" "nursing also need degree? " and" why you don't want to be doctor? " I don't need to freaking explain myself everyday. And the salary talk is worse. Yes I know nurses don't earn much. But parents please stop Comparing how much your kid earns in comparison to our peers from business and law etc. When they say every degree is equal, they don't mean it when you're faced with these derogatory questions everyday.

How does the rest of the NUS community feel about people who get jobs through the back-door or through connections? 

I just graduated recently with a good CAP but I still cant find a job. Same goes with many of my course mates. We're from a pretty obscure major in FASS. During commencement, I was quite surprised that a couple of my friends had already secured jobs. They did not get a higher CAP than me nor were they active in sports/clubs in uni. So I asked where they applied the jobs they found and they plainly told me that they never even applied! There wasn't even an interview. They got the jobs through connections with people they knew within those big MNCs and are now earning quite a decent income while I'm still jobless. Needless to say, these friends of mine are already from privileged backgrounds and their parents worked in or close to those MNCs. Shouldnt this be against company policy? I guess for a big company, its hard to keep tabs on all the people that are hired everyday. Worst of all, they didnt even seem guilty or embarrassed that they found jobs that they clearly had not deserved nor earned in a meritocratic way. 

Is this the norm amongst NUS grads? Ironically, many of the modules we read together in FASS discussed a lot about privilege and how certain groups of people abuse that privilege to undermine a meritocratic society. Maybe they didnt score well for those modules.

Wrt to  

I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any foreign scholars with grades worse than a Singaporean but still under a scholarship funded by our govt. All foreign scholars I've met all had straight As. So your argument does crumble. 

I've met foreign scholars who are also under scholarships from their own foreign govt or from private companies/institutes. But they these 2 entities are not within our control. So don't assume that every foreign scholar is funded by Singaporean tax money. 

But I will concede that scholarship application processes are terribly flawed. Scholarships for BOTH local and foreign students are based on A-level grades or whatever pre-U qualifications you have. We end up with a peculiar situation whereby 4.5 GPA students who did badly in A-levels do not have scholarship while 3.5 GPA students who did well in A-levels have scholarships.

IMO this is a very unfair situation. Scholarships should be reassessed on a yearly basis. Should a non-scholar overtake a scholar during the years in university, then that non-scholar should be awarded the scholarship instead. 
-
 
In US, students who choose to dropout have an option to return back to college. But why in Singapore, students are not allowed to come back when they dropout? Don't talk about LOA which is just one year. 

If a student have proven that he/she is able to pass the enrollment criteria, shouldn't we allow them to come back. This allows students to take more risks.

Whatever excuses you are giving for NUS, please explain why US universities are not following NUS?

Tuition fees for Singapore citizens aren't high. I consistently clocked at least 30 hours of freelance work per week during my four years as a student. That paid for pretty much everything, except on-campus accommodation and SEP. My grades weren't stellar, or even "good" by some people's standards, but my professional experience was some of the best education I've received in my life. For the record, it has already begun paying some sweet dividends.

Some people consider this "life on hardmode", but I think it's just an issue of jumbled priorities. Maybe if I was paid a handsome stipend for just being an undergraduate student, things would have been very different now.

In May I was not sure if I will be graduating or taking honours because of the 3.2 requirement, which I am really close to. So just in case, I went for many interviews. I saw a company which claimed to be "financial wealth management". Anyway, they say until like that, so I applied because I'm a business student specializing in finance. I almost signed up because they were really convincing, they made me question my self-esteem. "You can never get into banks because your results suck, we are your best option." Oh you are from Hwachong? Not so stupid I guess. In the insurance industry is the only place you can stand out because the other agents are idiots, unlike in NUS." I prayed and asked my friends, so I did not fall for their tactics. Now I am taking honours, did a good internship and now have an even better part-time internship. If I can do it, so can you. I want to warn all NUS students to not fall for their unethical interview tricks (they were NUS students somemore).
Their tactic:
1. Show you a recent news article about how bad the economy is.
2. Ask you "tell me about yourself" (I had to sound confident so that they know im not desperate for a job)
3. Ask you what motivates you (NEVER say money, bc they will say insurance agents can earn a lot of money).
4. Depending on your personality, they will use a gentle persuasive emotional appeal (like tell you how your clients will kneel down in gratitude when you save their lives) or intimidating (i got that one) technique. Because i seem like i only listen to professional people, the insurance guy kept on saying hes pro by saying he sell insurance to goh chok tong. Not like I can check, hello?
5. Finally, ask you if you got any doubts. They make you take a stupid mcq test, 100 qns repetitive to check for consistency. No matter what your personality still fits internship.
I want to reiteratethat I don't look down on insurance as a job. Some people like it, good. But if you are only applying for it as one of your many career choices, then don't get scammed. For me, they "lied" that it's a wealth manager job that's why i even went in the first place. Then it was disgusting at how they talk down to you. They say I will be more likely to do well in this because of less intense competition, but I realise that is not the ppint. I dont do something because it's easy, i do it because I find meaning and I love it. I'm glad I didn't take it because they would have forced me to write down all my friends details and start selling to them, destroying my friendships. Only after I went home I realize how illogical their statements are: "9 out of 10 wealthy insurance agents are wonen, so you will be successful too". So illogical, I can't even. Note that he had wealthy parents that's why he can sell to them what. If you are going for their interview, be guarded.

Hello, freshman here. The concept of bidding wasn't difficult to understand but the sheer diversity of modules and their relevant details... I've just spent two hours squinting at these pseudo-random alphanumeric strings that you call module codes. It's hard finding a combination that I like and that doesn't clash. Timetable organising is particularly mind-boggling and in fact absolutely awful haha I wish there was someone around taking the same course whose timetable I could just copy.

Well, not that I'm snubbing CORS, of course. I do think this is a relatively logical and fairly efficient system for its size and scope. I guess I'm just not familiar enough with the module codes and details, so there are about ten tabs open with various details about bidding rounds, module details, curriculum requirements, that sorta thing. And I know this page is currently teeming with "nice guys" but that's alright, you don't have to be nice and explain CORS to me (though if you want to, sure, go ahead). I'm just kind of exasperated with how much clicking I have to do. And also kind of distraught and in a mood to complain, because when I went for dinner earlier the teh bing was too sweet and my favourite dimsum stall was closed, as was my second favourite dimsum stall (!!><).

Update about minimum 18MC requirement. Spoke to the assistant dean of my faculty regarding this issue. Their primary concern is to prevent students from delaying their graduation beyond the typical 3 years or 4 with honours. If you can reasonably prove that you can graduate on time with underloading (e.g. accumulated extra MCs from previous sems through whatever means) you should easily be exempt from the minimum requirement. (But you still need to appeal)

As for the rationale behind the requirement, the prof did explain but I personally do not think it is appropriate to state here. You will have to ask for yourself if you are interested. 

Hope this helps.

 Thanks in advance for being an effective altruist and tanking the bell curve. Those of us who got As are grateful! Cheers, mate! :)

Many people are asking what is the root cause of SMRT's frequent train breakdowns and who is to blame.

My answer: the Public Transport Council (PTC) that regulates fare hikes.

The fare hikes are miserly compared with the rate of inflation.

SMRT's 2014 financial report shows that although revenue increased, many financial indicators - such as profits, return on assets, return on equity, free cash flow, earnings per share and dividends per share - had been falling for five straight years. In fact, free cash flow was negative last year.

Borrowings were up significantly from 2013. Fare margins were down for five straight years, too, and negative in 2014. Non-fare margin, for businesses such as retail, on the other hand, was improving.

Unlike other companies, SMRT cannot shed its money-losing train business. Yet, it is yet expected to improve reliability even as the PTC moderates fare hikes to meet the demands of commuters, some of whom even want a freeze to fare hikes until reliability improves.

How is that possible?

Train fares in Singapore are low relative to gross domestic product per capita.

Raise the fares if we must, but continue to offer discounts to students and targeted assistance to the needy. The rest who happily use our latest flashy iPhones and Samsungs to kill time on the trains can surely afford a fare hike.

WRT 

What's so bad about the bell curve? With the curve, you get to know where you stand within your cohort. 

In the real world out there, you will always be constantly compared with others. Your products will be compared to other similar ones and people will only buy your products if it's better than the others. 

Even when you look for a job, you'd be compared to the other applicants that are applying for that same job. So get used to the bell curve grading system. It's how the real word works most of the time. You're only considered good if you're better than the rest of the flock.

Imagine there is a rich student. The rich student decides that she wants to obtain a first class honours, yet she does not possess such a calibre. Hence, she takes very few modules per semester to reduce her own workload and it allows her to score first-class grades. She graduates in 6 years instead of 4. She doesn't have to do NS either so graduating 2 years later isn't that bad for her since there would still be many other graduands who are much older than her. 

When she applies for work or for post-graduate studies, she is seen as a first-class honours student. Is this really fair? Should she be considered academically equal to those who get a first class in 4 years? 

The minimum MC requirement levels the field. Someone with more time and money to spare would not be able to game the system to come out ahead. It's also fair as the minimum cap doesn't apply to students doing their FYP and students on their last semester. 
-
 
 I know plenty of students would disagree. It is very popular to hold the view: "Non vitae sed scholae discimus".

From every modules that I took since year 1, they have changed my life. Each module informed me in their own unique ways. If you are not learning much, I guess there is some problem with your attitude toward learning.

This entire summer holiday, I did nothing but slack at home and grew fat. I've gotten so lazy and so used to my sedantic lifestyle such that I am so reluctant to go back to school again. All these news about having to bid for modules make me very depressed. I also don't understand why my friends bother to do an internship over the summer. I mean, you are going to be working for the rest of your lives, why choose to work now when you can slack?

 There are things which we cannot find immediate practical use. That doesn't mean they are useless. The dots can only be connected backwards due to our ignorance. 

From the comments, I suggest students take a better attitude towards learning rather than condemning some modules to be impractical. The streetsmart and booksmart dichotomy is created by that fraudster Kiyosaki to sell his books. It's your life. You decide.

There are reasons why fundamentals are emphasised. Imagine a web developer who want to create a website but have weak understanding of HTML. You can teach the person all the latest stuffs. But the person will find it diffiult to grasp what they learned. Same with Mathematics, Physics, Humanities etc.

This is not a university related confession but rather one which has been bugging me since the start of my teenage years.
 I always dreamt of becoming an RSAF pilot after learning more about the vocation through magazines/brochures and stuff when I was in secondary school. 
When I was in JC, I applied for the COMPASS test and sadly did not make the cut for the prestigious job(although I passed all the tests for other vocations lol).
I rejected offers to sign on as an officer of a separate vocation within the Air Force and continued serving my NS life in BMT-OCS-unit feeling extremely heartbroken. Not even the euphoria of commissioning as an officer could make up for that emptiness in my heart. 
Long story short, I ORD-ED and matriculated into NUS BIZ last year and I've been doing fairly well so far ; got decent grades and got attached with an awesome girlfriend. But my ambition to be a pilot has never left me. I still very much aspire to be a RSAF pilot in any capacity ( transport, heli, fighters). 
I really want to just try for it again after I graduate in 3 years time. Since the compass test results lasts for 2 years, my previous result would be considered null and I would be able to take it again after I graduate.

Now comes the dilemma. Firstly , I fear I will be too old when I graduate ( will be 25 sadly) and I am afraid that my age will be a limiting factor even if I manage to pass all the prerequisites(medical , COMPASS), like I will be kind of overlooked by those instructors eventually due to my age. 2) my girlfriend feels extremely insecure as she feels it is too dangerous a job and she threatens to leave me if I ever attempt to try for Pilot. 

P.S: to clarify, it's not about the money, it's about the passion and wanting to make a difference

Can someone tell me why do we have to bid for our core mods that are compulsory for our major? If we fail to bid, then we cannot take the higher level mods, this will hinder our progress. Since the uni knows how many students there are in each major, can't they at least adjust the quota accordingly or something? It's pretty obvious which core mods the students will be taking each sem since most of the core mods have prerequisites. It is super simple to figure out the sequence of modules which most students will take.

It is unfair when your major has more students and you have to use more points. Prevents you from bidding other mods that you like.

About the person who about having a career goal in mind, I agree that one should have a career goal in mind. And indeed one must be focused on getting there.

I am in the midst of moving into the medical field. It is not easy to meet the requirements for entry. A lot of hard work. And I am stuck with the option of taking another qualification to improve my chances. Why did I want to do that? It is a waste of time and money. But I know that I want to be in the medical profession. The role, challenges and diversity makes it very interesting. And yes the passison I guess.

So it does not matter which industry you are in, as long as you have the interest and strive/focus on the career goal, you can get there. It is not easy but it is definitely worth it!

I'm a CS major. This post isn't dishing out advice. It's asking for some.

I realize that I was so "strongly" devoted into following my dreams of delving into a career involving Games that I haven't even thought about it from all perspectives. I don't know much about possible (local?) job opportunities after I graduate should I choose to actually pursue it. So...

Calling all CS undergraduates, are there any out there that is thinking or is intending to go into the new Computer Graphics and Games focus area? What are your future plans?

CS graduates who took Interactive Media previously, what was your experience like? Did you specialize heavily into it, or did you play it safe and chose to use your UEs to enter another focus area (other than Visual Computing?) in case future job prospects didn't work out? Where are you people working now? What advice would you give to someone who wants to go into this area?

I apologize if this post annoys you, but it doesn't hurt to ask, right? Right? D:

With reference to 

I must say I'm not at all offended by your question and if anything, I hope to give some insight as to why students choose to study in FASS despite the low demand for jobs for us :)

I think the great place to start answering the question you ask is to clarify what you mean when you say 'there are not much demand of jobs for them'. Your phrasing is rather ambiguous but I shall take it to mean that there is low demand for FASS graduates / little supply of jobs for FASS graduates (do correct me if I'm wrong). 

If all there is to university education is career prospects, then perhaps it might be simply implausible that students would choose to study in FASS. 

But fortunately, university choices are shaped by a wide array of issues, from gifts and talents to passion and the belief that the work in whatever field we choose to enter is essential in making the world a better place. I would think that occupations like psychologists, economists, policy makers, sociologists have an important role to play in shaping our society in ways that Computer Science and Engineering cannot (and vice versa). Maybe it's because some choose to see beyond their own lives that they are able to see possibilities. In addition, most FASS subjects allow you to work in a variety of fields. (Tin Pei Ling, a psychologist grad, is an MP, some political science students go into finance, etc) 

I don't mean to burst your bubble but the world has proven itself to be extremely unpredictable and with the exponentially increasing complexities, it's only going to be more unpredictable. Low demand for FASS graduates currently and as projected in the near future, in no way, ascertains that it will forever remain this way. Every degree has its worth in society and that's why it was put in place in the first place.

During my registration (part one) I incorrectly used my application number(1 letter followed by 7 digits and 1 letter) instead of my matriculation number(8 digits) to register. However, the system allowed me to register and my student card is printed. Now, my application number is the same as my NUSNET ID, which seems to be different for everyone else. I don't know what to do and I don't dare to call the help desk as the part one registration deadline is already over and module bidding is starting soon. Any advice?
-
 
Regarding FASS and jobs, this might be controversial and, other than the next sentence, my theory could be totally wrong but here goes.

A few years ago, entry to FASS got more competitive. I'm guessing this is caused by the increasing number of science students (particularly PCME girls) switching over to FASS. Why? They can't see themselves being scientists wearing lab coats doing experiments nor do they want to be teachers. They clearly know what they don't want. But they also don't know what they want either. Like the past 12 years of education, they just want to 'get by' (get good grades, get into uni and get a steady job). FASS is seen as a 2nd-choice general degree (because business courses are slightly harder to get into). Government jobs are also seen as safe and 'steady jobs'

It's just sad that FASS and biz schools represents the failure of our education system that boasts itself as the best in Science education.

And to , I don't think the study of Arts is irrelevant. Look at the top STEM universities (MIT, UCB, Stanford) and they have an equally strong Social Science department. But we will never be like them because we were wrong since the start.
-
 
 Why do students choose to study in FASS when there are not much demand of jobs for them? Unemployment in this faculty is usually absorbed by the public or civil service sectors unlike those with technical degrees like Computer Science or Engineering can find jobs easily.

The free market proves that which degree is more valuable. Milton Friedman is correct.

To make things short, I am new to NUS and am extremely lost in the CORS  bidding exercise. I do have a few burning questions, and i hope someone can help me with them!

2) I have read through some of the past statistics for CORS. And i realised, why is it that some modules are not available for bidding at all? How am i supposed to get those modules in such a situation?

This is Anthony Tung, a relatively unknown professor working on data analytics in SOC. In view of the recent discussion on CS3216/CS3217, I am going to offer SOC students who are not taking CS3216/CS3217 in the next two semesters an opportunity to work as a part-time undergraduate researcher(USR) under the NUS SeSaMe Research Center( http://sesame.comp.nus.edu.sg). The renumeration is S$8 per hour for up to 16 hours per week during semester time and 40 hours per week during semester break. As an USR, you will have the opportunities to work with a big group of people (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153410961143972&set=a.480078368971.258852.844518971&type=1&theater) including my Phd. students, research engineers and other USRs. Depending on your interest, you can choose to work on frontend, backend or just research in projects like IVLE Readpeer(http://ivle.readpeer.com), Trendspedia(http://trendspedia.com) or GENIE and LAMP(http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~atung/gl/). 

There is however one down side to this offer. You need to attend weekly meetings and make sufficient progress in order to continue being employed as an USR. You see, we have no time to let you learn slowly.

Hi year 3 CS student here. I just want to know how important NOC/taking the right mods is in helping you with your career. I've been seeing posts about how you should pave your own path etc Is there a possibility that your own path could lead to a great future as well? Will it take longer if you don't do all those cool mods/NOC? Are some people just meant to have a lesser life than others? I mean I know, there is no fixed answer and 'a great future' is subjective, but I guess I just wanted other people's opinions on this matter. 

In this competitive world there will be both winners and losers...

In light of all the talk about CS3216/7 in  & , I feel like I need to get the word out about the other non-mainstream third year project modules.

CS3281/2 and CS3283/4 are both really good and underrated alternatives that require students to work independently and create a complex, large-scale app (usually from scratch). Most projects are for a real world client with real end users, which means your code will impact peoples' lives! 

I had the privilege to conduct end-user testing of my project on behalf of my client and I can honestly say that seeing their eyes light up and hearing their positive feedback is the most gratifying thing in the world. It reinforced my passion for software engineering and encouraged me to put in even more effort for the rest of the project.

As with 3216/7, the 81/2 & 83/4 modules also take a less structured approach and most of the knowledge gained is self-learned, along with regular peer reviews to facilitate knowledge transfer between teams.

Teams are formed by students and you apply as a team for your preferred project. So in that sense, you are responsible for your own choices, whether you have struggling team members pulling you down or a hard working cohesive team lifting you up, is entirely on you.

This also means that not every project made is fantastic and not all groups are strong, but the onus is on you to make your project the best that it can be. (This is less of a problem for 81/2 because of the vnp/tp majority requirement, but in 83/4, there is broad range of students with varying abilities.)

Imo (and this is purely my opinion), CS3216/7 is a great 'networking' module to allow the 'elite' students to work together and get to know each other, but in order to achieve this, it has to break up the modules into multiple short intensive projects. While this allows for mingling, it sacrifices the opportunity for large scale software development during these short sprints. 

To me, CS3216/7 is like trying to hit gold timing for 2.4km 3 times consecutively without breaks; it is intense and great training if you come out of it alive. But CS3281/2 & 3/4 is like running one single 42km marathon spanning 1 and 2 semesters respectively; it is not about short bursts of coding power, but pacing yourself throughout an entire year's worth of iterations to deliver a polished product without letting fatigue get in the way.

In short, the various 3rd year project modules target students with different goals and preferences (not just different abilities!); read up about ALL of them (CS3201/2, CP3208/9, CS3281/2, CS3283/4 & CS3216/7) and pick the one that you think is more suitable for you.

p/s: Look beyond the module name and descriptions because 'Thematic Systems' and 'Media Tech' are not very meaningful and do not do these modules justice.

SoC newbie reporting in. I'm super excited to be able to join SoC family in few weeks time, especially after seeing so many helpful & talented seniors and funny professors around makes me proud of being one!

To the OP of , I truly admire your passion and I certainly can relate to your frustration of being rejected. You have a very positive goal and strong belief in yourself but I think you have expressed it in a less effective way.

Why not prove yourself being better than those who have taken CS3216/7? If you succeeded then you will be able to give a big tight slap to the "Elites" you mentioned, and of course, the committee that rejected you. Turn your anger to something positive, you don't need a "module" to excel. It does give you guidance, but you are not limited its restriction.

All the best to you senior!

so due to the new 18mcs per sem, ppl now cannot underload ah? im pretty happy tbh. ive felt like from all the advantages rich ppl alrdy have since birth, this might even it out even more. going to special term is an expensive privilege since during sem time they can underload and hence get better grades due to more studying time. i know some ppl have their reasons to underload like perhaps IA but for the most part, special term is for rich ppl only.

Hi OP of ,

Beng here. I'd usually be reluctant to add to this, but since Prof Ben Leong mentioned me, here’s some context. Perhaps you, or others, might find it encouraging.

At one point, my CAP was 1.13, and I've experienced plenty of rejection and missed opportunities. Because of my dismal grades, I could only take the more “mainstream” CS3201/2 software engineering modules. But in my spare time, I kept building my own side projects, exploring new stuff and learning.

I've never managed to get a summer internship, so one of the ways I sought to improve during summers instead was to release and iterate on products myself, e.g. NUSMods. That’s the same kind of thing you would do in CS3216/7. (I did get into CS3216, but only in my final year.)

While CS3216 certainly does provide a combination of guidance, teammates and an environment so challenging that it practically forces you to learn faster than you would probably want to duplicate on your own unless you were massively masochistic, what's one semester vs. a lifetime of learning? [=

 Long post guys, hang on.

The part about protecting you from the mod is not bullshitting. 

3217 is a killer mod and not for the weak.

I got rejected for 3217 at first because my CAP was lower than the bar, but I appealed to the professor with my 2103 grades. There was an unexpected vacancy, so I got in.

We were doing assignments right from the first week and picking up Swift on the go. Assignments due every 1 or 2 weeks. The workload was crazy.

I was struggling really hard. I spent most of my time on 3217. I only took 4 mods that sem but my CAP went down.

So yeah there's a reason why they let the 'elites' in - because they can handle this killer mod and their normal mods together.

Honestly I don't regret doing 3217, but it's not like this shiny gateway to heaven that instantly makes you better- it's a hell that you have to work through and come out the better for, and YMMV depending on how much effort you put into it.

Also if you're rejected, it's not the end of the world. (Yes, coming from someone who got in eventually, you probably don't believe me.) Just find alternatives!

Whatever I learned in 3217 could be learned elsewhere. You just need to make the effort to learn. You don't need to take the module to learn what is taught there!

Regarding alternatives to learning what is taught in 3217, watching WWDC might be a good start or picking up an online course in iOS development. 

If you want the experience of working on a big project, why not try contributing to TEAMMATES? Or find an internship?

If there's a will, there's a way. I'm sure the professors won't mind recommending other sources of learning too. :)

Stop talking about the CS module please. It just a frigging module. Get a life. Go watch naruto or something~

I was from a neighbourhood secondary school. Having been through the system, I would say I turn out decent, for someone from a neighbourhood school (I graduated from NUS!) Would I have wanted to go to RI or HCI? Hell yeah! 

Being around smart and capable people would have changed my would view, motivation and opened door to so many opportunities (their education is more stringent, and forward). Well, you get the idea. 

On the neighbourhood front, we were just a 'degree' mill. The education was not the most exciting, but sufficient. We were not doing the most exciting stuff, but it is wrong to say we cannot excel. 

Thus while I wholly understand the rationale to differentiate students, it warms my heart to see the government trying to even the odds (very slightly) for neighbourhood schools.

The truth is, I am talking about cs3216/7. Its not the rest of the mods are not good, but rather cs3216/7 are attractive because they better opportunities. Sure you can learn the skills on your own, but do you want the best teachers and environment? 

I think there are many facets in this issue. Why aren't the other modules as exciting? Does the profs owe it to you to make the module exciting? (hell no). In my opinion, perhaps the school need to address the issue of why and how can the students get similar learning opportunities from those of cs3216/7, not necessary by opening up more spaces in the class (prof alr says it is over subscribed), but prepping the students for a working world where  mobile, web and a creative mind are in demand. (Please dun tell me u cannot make a person creative. It's about being in a environment where it is encouraged.)

We should have more robotics related modules with practical components. About drones/UAV's, localization etc. Sadly it seems there aren't any, or they are all relegated to masters modules
-
 
I agree with . I don't understand the reason for this, and if they even have one. I wonder why the rush to implement this. I took a module over the holiday so that I could underload next sem and take a harder module. Now I just wasted my summer break and still have to take a standard workload next sem. NUS can you explain yourself?
-
 
Is there any reason to bid in the open round? I personally feel its no use unless you are unable to bid in the closed round or time is critical eg. Freshman seminar. Bidding in open round will only cause panic/inflation as everyone tries to stay within the minimum. Bidding in closed round will more accurately reflect how much each student wants the module and not artificially raise the LBP. I believe pple should just put as much as they can afford and are willing to spend on that module in the closed round. 
-
 
I initially planned to under load next semester but not sure If I can do that now with regards to the new policy changes.. I'm going onto year two next sem and admitted in AY2014/2015. I contacted my home faculty admin and they told me that I need to write reasons to my prof why I had to under load and take 16 MCs only. ZZZ. Screw this.  Anyone facing a similar situation?

I'm the OP of  who was rejected from CS3216. Am still not convinced of the arguments that were put forth by Ben Leong and Colin Tan. Shan't argue anymore with the immovable Profs.

To those who took CS3216/CS3217 before and commented, please take your elite faces and go back to your ivory towers please. Like the post in , it is easy for you to say, "just do better, try again, there are alternative routes, you don't need CS3216/CS3217" when you have the opportunity and I don't. You are nobody to judge that I might not be able to handle the workload and be a tremendous drag on my potential teammates when I did not have a chance in the first place. Why have the double standard of pretending to be like the workforce and turn around and say those inside have to be protected? If one does not need CS3216/CS3217, why did you not walk the talk and not apply in the first place?

It's proof enough that Colin admitted that 99% of apps died after CS3216. This means most of the stuff you guys did weren't good enough to be commercially viable. So much for being the elite. Most of the more visible stuff from Computing students like NUSMods, NUSWhispers and the SoC Print app did not originate from CS3216/CS3217 in the first place.

Since writing more will not overturn my rejection anyway, peace out and goodbye.
-
 
I have a suspicion that this whole CS3216 rejection saga and drama was staged by the CS3216 staff to show how awesome the module is and how coveted it is to be selected to be part of the module.

Well, I'm about to find out for myself, on 12th August. Hehehe (:

I just graduated with a project and facilities management degree and i would like to find out if i am suited for the building industry. I am contemplating between going to SME and government agency. I heard that if i go to public sector, it would be hard to get out of it to go to private sector. Is it true? Also the SME is a contractor firm, i was told that if i want to learn how the construction industry works, i should go to a SME first to gain experience

Is anybody else deathly scared of the CORS bidding going terribly wrong for them? I'm going into year 2 now, and having had loads of mix-ups (some my fault some not at all) last year I'm so damn frightened. 
Last yr sem 1 : I foolishly wanted to take a yr 2 module with NUS mods as pre-requisites. So I had to go get the pre-requisites waived and somehow it took ages for the change to reflect on CORS website. So I couldn't bid for it until very last minute. Then I ambitiously wanted to go bid for a very popular SS mod and obviously failed miserably and ended up doing one less module than I wanted to. 
Last yr sem 2: I wanted to take a mod that was the equivalent of two other faculty-requirement mods. It seemed like a golden ticket. Until I discovered it clashed with a the lecture group of a pre-allocated compulsory mod. So I had to go to my department and beg them to change my lecture group. So when that was done I could finally bid for this module. 
This yr this morning : I decided to stick to the beaten path and not do any funny funny thing. Then I'm nicely adding all the regular core modules then BOOMZ. I cannot select one of my department core mods. "You do not satisfy the pre-requisites blablablabla". 
But I do satisfy them! I took the correct module previously! Aiyaaaaa
So then I call the CORS admin person from my faculty. Very nice - not picking up phone. Then I call another admin lady from the undergrad program office - she thankfully answers and says to go talk to my department. So I call my department and tell my story again. Then she says "go try again in the afternoon". Surely enough an hour later I am able to add it. PHEW.
I don't know if I'm a magnet for bad luck or what but it seems to me this process cannot get any less smooth. Haiz I hope nothing else goes wrong, like a bunch of crazy people attacking the UEM I want with 1000s of points. Maybe I'm just incredibly dumb.

I want to get to know the person that thought: 
"Oh hey, let's introduce a 'minimum 18MC per semester' requirement effective IMMEDIATELY next Sem onwards AFTER the MPE for the next Sem is already over!"

Source (see Section 7 within the Doc): https://share.nus.edu.sg/registrar/student/circulars/REGCirNo1-RO-464-15.pdf

There goes the 4 Mod completely CS schedule I had going for next Sem zzz
I guess I shouldn't complain, because they probably had (hopefully proper) reasons to do this. Does this happen often? If so I should probably learn to not plan next Sem schedules so early :|

I received the rejection from CS3216. Entering my final year too so I will never get another chance to apply for CS3216.

I'm pissed, I'm really pissed. I read Prof Ben Leong's essay on the strict selection criteria of CS3216/CS3217 and he openly admitted the elitist nature of these classes. To be frank, Prof Ben's elitist premise of these classes may seems righteous and reasonable, is very flawed and similar to income inequality, further perpetuates the divide between good and not-so-good programmers.

Every student who wants to take these classes should be be given the opportunity. In terms of outcome, if they do badly, well they do badly and face the music. We preach about equality of educational opportunity in Singapore but when it comes to walking the walk, SoC is not doing it. We all pay equal school fees don't we? Why are we denied equal access to quality modules?

On the argument that other students may suffer and their protection, isn't this already happening with the standard modules that most SoC students take? In the working world and other mods, sometimes we get the wrong group mates and we have to live with it. If they are really as good as made out to be, they will get through it.

I venture to say the selection criteria of CS3216/CS3217 are the only undergraduate modules in SoC and possibly NUS that reeks of the thinking of a certain old political party. No surprise why we still don't have another Facebook and Google that has spawned from CS3216/CS3217 alumni despite trying.

For the elite few who managed to enter either of these modules in the past and the coming semester, I congratulate you on your great effort and fortune in impressing the selection committee. For mere mortals like me, I have to contend myself in taking more mainstream modules.

You are not alone. I am mentally prepared to stay single for the rest of my life because I know my parents are not receptive of the LGBT. I have also gave up on my ambition of being a teacher because of the same reason. Now, I am stuck working in an industry I hate and face the need to stay single for the rest of my life.

I received the rejection from Facebook. Starting a new job soon so I will never get another chance to apply for Facebook.

I'm pissed, I'm really pissed. I watched Facebook’s video on how to ace your coding interview and they openly admitted the elitist nature of these interviews. To be frank, Facebook’s elitist premise of these interviews may seems righteous and reasonable, is very flawed and similar to income inequality, further perpetuates the divide between good and not-so-good programmers.

Every software engineer who wants to join these tech companies should be be given the opportunity. In terms of outcome, if they do badly, well they do badly and face the music. We preach about equality of hiring opportunity but when it comes to walking the walk, Facebook is not doing it. We all pay equal internet fees don't we? Why are we denied equal access to quality companies?

On the argument that other software engineers may suffer and their protection, isn't this already happening in most companies? In the working world, sometimes we get the wrong colleagues and we have to live with it. If they are really as good as made out to be, they will get through it.

I venture to say the selection criteria of Facebook are the only tech companies in SV and possibly SF that reeks of the thinking of a certain old political party. No surprise why we still don't have another Dustin and Adam that has spawned from Facebook despite trying.

For the elite few who managed to enter either of these companies in the past and the coming hiring, I congratulate you on your great effort and fortune in impressing the selection committee. For mere mortals like me, I have to contend myself in taking more mainstream jobs.

I'm from FASS and I currently don't qualify for honours; I foresee that I will be able to pull my CAP up but only to third class. Should I graduate with or without honours?

I've always believed that learning is a lot more than a number to quantify how ‘well’ I did in school, and because of this I've been taking classes purely out of my own interest rather than for easy/free ‘A’s. However, I know that I'll want to take my learning further after my BA and do a Master's programme overseas in a US university, and I'm worried that my low CAP/degree without honours won't fly with the schools I apply to. Am I being paranoid? p/s: I actually want to complete my education as soon as possible to start working, so I'm wondering if I can get into a decent MA/MFA programme with just a three-year BA :\

I am matriculating this year and had fail to get into hall. I have appealed and am now waiting for news about it.. I really want to get into hall as i feel that it would help me better kick start my life in uni. Apart from the cliche reasons which are convenience and to experience hall life, i feel that life away from my home (which is a little dysfunctional) would provide a better environment (to study and emotionally).. Seniors please tell me what are the chances of getting into hall now that hall camps have already started and if there is any other way to get into hall? (I do not have any connections that can help pull me into hall :( )

My dream is to work in something related to Finance. To get a good internship, I am willing to take LOA. Now I have a dilemma: should I accept the first company that offers me even though it is a temp, admin, non-Finance role at a not-bad company? Or only save my LOA for something very good like banks or very relevant to Finance. I already have 3 internships but none related to Finance (my major).

With reference to  (and also replies posted to said post),

Perhaps some of the issues brought up by OP aren't particularly constrained to just halls (e.g. raising fees every 3 years), but the point on exposure camps, as well as comments regarding the same point, are what I want to explore.

Victor (in his comment) mentioned that camps were acceptable in the past, and it was a legal lapse because only registered residents are covered by NUS insurance, among other stuff. If that is the case, shouldn't all camps be disallowed from staying on board campus accommodation for the entire duration of the camps, seeing that they aren't "registered residents" of the accommodation which the camp organisers booked? Is that a legal lapse as well?

If, on the flipside, this is not a legal lapse, (i.e. freshies who are confirmed to be incoming NUS freshmen are covered by NUS insurance etc.) shouldn't the onus be put on the exposure camp organisers to ensure that incoming freshies are indeed confirmed NUS freshies, rather than saying that "they aren't registered residents so they are not allowed to stay in halls for camps"? To take it a step further, if the matter at hand is insurance and legal coverage, why can't necessary steps be taken to ensure that campers are adequately covered, rather than blanket ban overnight stays?

I am asking this because the quintessential definition of "hall exposure" is simply, hall life; you can't say you've experienced hall life until you've actually tried staying in an actual hall, with actual neighbours you share toilets and facilities with, with hallmates whom you share supper and interact with, isn't it? If the "top brass" (in Victor's terms) have preferences on the nature of activities, that is fine; but isn't the crux of a hall exposure simply hall life? The day to day interactions cannot be emulated outside of it's very environment, where it thrives.

tl;dr: quoting Zetong, real confession (and questions) from a real person who stays in a real hall.

I'm just an incoming freshmen. Signed up for O'week but am starting to regret.. How to survive in University with me being so introvert, eccentric and afraid of meeting people?.. 

I just did my research on NUS bidding and modules to take, and everything suddenly seemed so overwhelming in the end. I have zero clue about whatever GEM Breadth or whatever.. 

What's worse is that, i hardly know anyone that is coming to the same faculty as me .. I just hope i can manage all the bidding things all by myself.

I was doing my planning on NUS mods. Do i actually have to prepare to bid for other modules if i'm unsuccessful (in the same round)? or if i failed to get the mods, i have to re arrange my timetable for the second round? Anyway, there are so many different slots for tutorials, what if i didnt get the tut i want and my timetable gets overlapped and messed up.. Omg stress.. stress..

I am actually quite envy of people that knows what they want to do in their life or what they are passionate about. They seem to have this fire in their eyes.

Next year is my final year and I have zero idea what I am going to do for the rest of my life. I am in a Electrical Engineering student on my way to FCH. However I study for the sake of exam, I will forget most of the stuff after exam. It doesn't really interest me. Although I am interested in some of the course project during the school term, But I would not spend my holiday exploring other software/hardware in my free time. 

So I am not sure if I should be continue working in the engineering field after i graduate, because I generally feel that people working without passion would not go far and most of them will just end up to be cogs and gears in a larger system. Which most of them end up hating their job.

Like to see if any seniors can advise me on this issue or share their story. What other careers or industries can I explore other then engineering? Banking and finance/ public services / start up?

Hi all, I have a few queries about comp eng course. 

Firstly, I do not have any background knowledge on comp skills (programming, coding etc) is it perfectly okay for me to just go in the course without any prior experience? 

Secondly, I do have interest to start exposing myself to basic comp skills, but where do i start? 

Thirdly, I have actually more interest in comp sci > comp eng, because i find the hardware component pretty dull (electrical circuit, etc kinda bores me) and its because my A level results cant qualify for NUS comp sci which is why I am thinking of choosing comp eng instead. Will it be ok as well? 

Next, I was offered NTU comp sci but because NUS is much nearer to my place and I feel NUS is much more prestigious, I'm thinking of choosing NUS comp eng instead. Is that a right decision?

Lastly, what are the prospects for both comp sci and comp eng? Are the prospects good? (in demand or able to have a stable career) And are the prospects similar for both courses?

Thank you.

I graduated from NUS Biz a few years back. I have been working for close to three years, but I don't feel the drive and passion that I have in my current career path anymore. I am facing a dilemma - to continue in my current  path or to choose a totally different career path which is Teaching. I understand that i need to consider carefully on this career switch decision?  Any kind souls out there can give me some advice? Or has anyone done this before and is kind enough to share ?

I am the OP of . Just to elaborate more on my journey on accumulation. I strongly believe in that you do not need to have a high paying job to be comfortable. Remember, divide your salary by the number of hours you slog every week, and someone else with a seemingly humbler job may be better off. If you have time in your hands, think of ways to convert it into money. For me, it's through tuition.

And to answer the comment on investing, yes, a sizeable sum is generating dividends in the market as we speak. Yes, we should always invest. Especially when we are young. It's not how much we put in, it's how early on we get into it. 

New birds in the job market, use your first paycheck wisely =)

Studying Algorithms change the way I think about Mathematics. In school, teachers often give the impression that there is only one formula and one method (given in the textbook) to compute an output. If one goes deeper, there can be better ways than doing what is prescribed.

 It is not a must-have to attend CS3216 / CS3217 in order to learn how to hack and build things. Similarly, it is not a must-have to join NOC before you can start a company to execute your idea. If SOC or NOC rejects you, it's no problem. Move on. In reality, we sometimes get rejected without been given any real feedback. 

People are just too lazy to give actual feedback. They either like it or dislike it when they see something. So don't ask them what they want. They don't know. Question the dogma given by the lecturers in Communication and New Media (both SOC and FASS) / Human Interaction / Entrepreneur / Marketing classes. I know some of these modules are taught by the Titanic Professors / lecturers who are entrepreneurs. But be skeptical. Ask whether what they know are hindsight.

Scientific methodology is not relevant here as they study things from third-person perspective. Even psychology failed to inform us when they become a cognitive-scientis with their after-hand experiment.  What we want is a first-person perspective and the intersubjectivity involved.

Really, don't ask people what they want. They are clueless. Just create what fascinates you. If it fascinates your friends, then start to show some strangers. If it fascinates them, then it is probably going to fascinate their friends. One by one, things grow. You don't need to know exactly what they want. Try creating what you don't like in order for some grades. You will know how frustrating it is. There are hundred thousands of people in Singapore everyday waking up to take mrt/buses or drive to a place where they do something they don't like for some monthly salary. Many have grown apathy about it.

If you are a hacker (http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html), you will create things for fun on your own regardless whether you are in 3216 or 3217 or whatever. And the thing that you create doesn't always have to be NUS related apps or websites, the world is much bigger if you borrow a map from NUS Geography Department. 

In any modules, you can create things for fun using your new found knowledge. But if you decide to mug for grades, then you miss out the joy of creation. Then you complain that what you learned is useless. Yes useless because you have not use it or think about the implications of what you have learned.

Eventually when you want to create something 'Zero to One', you will face plenty of rejections from many people. Your investors start running away. Your team-mates start to quit. You are left alone in the office drinking coffee. The social pressure is on! Your friends are doing well when you browse the Facebook. You look like a loser according to the social hierarchy.

Hi, I know that this may not be the right place to ask my question, but I've been really frustrated since I cannot find the answer anywhere on the NUS website. For students from the 2014 batch and before, I understand that we're supposed to take at least one GEM from Group A, the Science group (I'm from FASS), and these modules are usually coded GEK15--, while the Group B arts GEMs are coded GEK10--. But what about the GEK19-- modules? Does anyone have any idea which category they fall under? Thanks so, so much!

I'm not sure if others notice these, but I feel the following points about our society are improving, though there's still room for improvement. Good for discussion here I feel.

1. In leadership selection across various sectors, there's a gradual shift from purely academic considerations to a mix of experience and characteristics. More variation, more dynamic. This is a good sign.

What I feel will be good for improvement is to continue working on building an environment that encourages people to step up and take on higher responsibility. We should constantly encourage one another to develop leadership qualities and look out and elevate people to leadership, especially late bloomers. More opportunities should be given as entry points to leadership, e.g. opening more entry points to OCS/SCS other than a single BMT posting exercise so that more people on the ground can volunteer to try leadership. The civil service should raise the CEP of more "farmers" to higher leadership estab, qualify them for similar opportunities as "scholars" and slow down progression of "scholars". I'm not too sure about the private sector, but they can do likewise if they haven't.

2. Our education system is getting more and more dynamic with pilot projects to help students explore their strengths and level out the playing field. CAP-less semester, "eveyr school is a good school", Polytechnic Foundation Programme, schools of specialisation and niche such as SOTA and SST, elevating the overall image and profession of the ITE to its current position and etc have been milestones.

What complements this good effort will be the paradigm shift in employment dynamics as well. How can salary be better pegged with the various forms of education in the various sectors? I'm not sure about this part myself, need some input. Thanks!

Being a recent SoC graduate, I still have much regrets such as not being able to read CS3216 and CS3217 despite applying, I think its quite annoying that the 'selection committee' took a long time to go through our application and if they reject you they don't give you a reason why. They will probably tell you that they don't have time to do so but really, if we spent time applying for it, its only decent to get feedback on why they reject you for a course you have applied for.

I always thought that grades don't matter much, so my CAP wasn't too awesome and I missed opportunities such as going on exchange etc. But isn't learning something that we can pursue without looking at CAP? I mean, everyone have to start from somewhere, some may not be as bright but if we all have a passion to learn, we should all be given a chance not be rejected cause they are trying to be elitist.

When I was young, like 17/18, I used to be very into online MMORPGs. I took competition very seriously, and wanted to be at the top. Now there is this concept called guild war. Basically its a war of mini communities. So you probably have say, a group of 10-100 people trying to kill another group on the internet. The thing is, I never ever played nice. I viewed the enemies as a bunch meant to be beaten down to oblivion. I wrote guides for my fellow guildies to creating anger among online gamers. For eg. if I know some guy was studying in ITE, I would be like "LOL, study more then talk to me". Condescension works well in generating anger. I will skip the details but, usually generating anger, creating internal strife and "blaming" will result in disharmony within an online gaming community. Coupled with the fact that there is little obligation to stay within the community, in game-speak, the guild disbands in a matter of time. I have done this in several online games. I get a kick out of destroying communities.

In any online game (after the maplestory era), you will notice that the people who tend to be at the top are actually.... undergrads/jc/poly. In fact due to the business model of online games, people who are doing well in the game are people who can pay through it. These people usually come from a well-to-do family, or are already working. And sometimes these people happen to be my enemy. They are a relative mature bunch compared to some who screams and spams profanities. In fact some people are already friends or even bf-gf in real life. I needed more approaches to kill off such enemy guilds. I first turned to search-engines. You see, if you are very good at googling and know what to google, with just google alone, you can pull out dirt on people from the internet. I have also learnt to disrupt bgr relationships. I found it funny I can just create a new character, private message the girl and send her links to evidence or sometimes, "forged" evidence of her cheating bf. However due to the nature of this approach, it sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. There are unforeseeable outcomes. In fact I spent 1 year on a certain online game practising this. I tried to quantify my approach by logging my moves down in an excel sheet. It is so easy to be anonymous and so easy to be an asshole in a world of mediocre beings who spends the bulk of their time playing online games. Of course I knew very well I once fit in this category. I've stopped being mediocre since years ago, and graduated to "real world".

Oh btw in case you guys think I play online games only to break people up, no. I still play "normally", leveling up quickly and joining stronger guilds etc. You can't be lvl 1 in an online game and expect to be accepted in communities.

Today, I have a "cookbook" in the form of a word document of how to destroy human relationships (not just in the bgr sense).
In all honesty this "cookbook" isn't that great. It serves as a reminder of common sense to me in case I miss details out during execution. I don't know why I'm confessing here on this page actually.

I was part of the organising committee of one of the most well subscribed camps in NUS a few years ago and I would like to provide an  insider's perspective with regards to the perceived discrimination of  applicants in all these freshmen camps.

Firstly, contrary to what people think, camps are not aimed at orienting new students and helping them ease into college life. Camps are organised by students and students have very practical and selfish motivations. Camp organizers aim primarily to build their camp repute as being the most popular camp in NUS, as an opportunity to have crazy fun with their batchmates and freshmen as well as a potential hunting ground for romantic interests. If freshmen can get to know the school better, then it's a bonus, but it is by no means the primary objective. 

Camp application lists are  mere spreadsheets of hundreds of names with superficial one liner descriptions of by the applicants. Under such situations, it becomes next to impossible to truly judge who would be a "fun", "sociable", "enthusiastic" individual. Consequently, the easiest and most straightforward way to judge applicants is by their looks.

For all those who look to cry foul, allow me to enlighten you to the reality of life: employment studies conducted by HR and management institutions have shown that better looking applicants enjoy a 92% better chance at getting a job when qualifications are the same. Similarly, in the scenario of camp applicants, everyone is literally equally qualified but seeing that most people do not take the effort to distinguish their applications in describing themselves in detail etc.; physical appearance  often becomes the defacto criteria for selection. 

Its not discrimination, it's simply the law of natural selection.

I'm a year 3 Statistics student and my CAP isn't that great. Should I graduate with a third class honours degree or none at all?

To ,

Given what you have just said, it therefore shows that the camps does not serve the purpose of "orientation". As such, why the need for such camps if it does not live up to its name (orientation camps)? Shut down the orientation camps then. 

In fact, I was told that OSA banned hall exposure camps this year. That staying in was prohibited. But nonetheless the halls still went all out to defy and conducted their exposures. Notably, one of the halls even conducted their "illegitimate" exposure out of nus campus, which oddly, defeats the purpose of hall exposure. 

And then, we have some camps that still conduct fright nights under the guise of some other title when OSA already banned fright nights. Faculty camps are shrunk to 4 days, yet there are faculty camps that defied and dragged on to full 5 days. 

And the list of camp controversies goes on. I really think that OSA should step up enforcement and shut down camps that obviously serves the frivolous desires of students and not to truly orientate freshies to the school proper. I believe freshies can very well survive in terms of finding friends since they will somehow make some friends in their major and even their CCAs. Having such camps to "make friends if not you will be all alone in school when sem starts" is just a lousy reason. 
-
 
What do you all think about being a teacher after graduation? I mean, I have pretty decent grades and will likely be able to make it for honours but seems like most teachers only have a degree. The starting pay may seem high but feels stagnant. Is it worth it to be bonded with them? 
-
 
In light of the recent discussions on orientation camps, and the disclosure by an ex-organiser of a popular camp, I just want to give the freshmen hope. 

Not ALL camps are corrupted and aimed at having the nicest looking and most crazy fun participants. There are still camps, by some society in nus that are truly meant to let freshies meet new friends and orientate them. Sometimes, just because the camp isn't the hot favourite doesn't mean that it's not good. Certainly more meaningful than passing marshmallows mouth to mouth

 I am a realist. If your scores are not good enough, it means you have no talent in the subject. Better to stay at SMU Business than to work as a pathetic engineer in Singapore. Which one is better: Tuas/Jurong Island/Ubi VS Marina Bay Financial Centre/Raffles Place?

Hello all, I am a nerdy guy, good in my major, on my way to first-class simply because I am in a nerd major and I'm good at being a nerd. My interests are nerdy; I read a lot, people can count on me to have good general knowledge, from politics to psychology to Chanel. Can you imagine me nerdifying fashion? I study brands and their way of making money. I do research on how brands create their products. I know which brands are the real deal (Chanel for one) and which lame brands are masquerading as luxury. I'm sure that's not how most people worship brands. Maybe some random biz fac module might force students to study luxury brands in this manner. But yes that's how I roll in my uhm, most natural mode of thought. People assume I am someone probably going to do a PhD when I'm done with bachelors. Many think I'm meant for academia. 

Well you see, I know I should not shift my mode of thought. I know I am good in what I am currently doing. Not at the top of NUS but decent for sure. If I continue on my current course, I should be doing decently. But at the same time what I have done in my life is a result of doing something I believe I wouldn't mind doing, not something I feel strongly for. It's like taking modules in NUS that you feel will be a CAP-puller. You do it simply because you know or believe you will do well in it but you probably don't care for it. 

I want to sing. I want to perform on a stage. I want to dance on a stage with charisma. This has been my secret dream for many years. I am envious of friends who joins dance in NUS. I struggle with the recorder. No music genes whatsoever. I know I will never pull this off within my lifetime.

CNM year 2 going year 3 student here. 

I literally have nobody to take modules with because I changed majors and it seems like everyone in my batch already has a clique of their own. And I don't know any seniors because I didn't attend CNM camp. 

I've been surviving pretty well on my own, but I'm starting year 3 and feeling so lost. I have no idea which modules are good and which I shouldn't waste my time on. 

Any CNM seniors with tips on which level 3000 and 4000 modules to take, will you please comment below? I would really appreciate it.

I want to minor in political science, but after going for some tutorials during the previous  two semesters, I am really afraid of going for more next semester even though I really like it. The students are so aggressive, intimidating and outspoken during tutorials. When I try to express my opinions in class, I get shot down by other students who are so well-read with such talent for speaking... Political science tutorials are therefore extremely stressful for me. What should I do?

Must I provide a valid reason if I wish to apply for an LOA?

I've schizophrenia. I was first diagnosed with it during my first year of university. Over the last two weeks, things started getting bad for me. I began seeing delusions (people mostly) and had to admit myself to the hospital. I've only just been discharged today from my stay. I'm not sure if I'm in a position to start the new semester and thus would like to apply for an LOA so that I can focus on recovery. The thing is, I don't wish to let NUS know of my diagnosis.

Is this possible?

Can a year 3 NUS student still join the upcoming LGBT freshman orientation camp?

Hello. I am feeling very uncertain as to what I am planning to do now.. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have just completed my year 1 undergraduate studies and did special semester for my first summer vacation. For my year 2 sem 1 and sem 2, I could only do 1 UEM each for each semester. Should I not do the 2 UEMs and under load for my year 2 studies, and thereafter replace the 2 UEMs when I try applying for summer exchange programme next year June? My current CAP is 3.71 and I am kinda struggling with 5 mods every semester. However, the worrying part is not being able to secure a place for summer exchange. I am interested in doing a summer exchange to Boston University whereby they offer 2 program sessions and there is a potential of completing 4 UEM modules within the 2 program sessions that last from late May to early August. This is because I would like to free up my year 3 summer vacation for an internship, or can consider to do a second summer exchange program too. Any advise especially from students who have gone for summer program exchange? Thanks!

How difficult is it to get a midterm scholarship? Is second upper after two semesters sufficient or is it almost a must to get first? 

Soon-to-be freshman feeling bad here because my parents have to sponsor my tuition fees & living expenses whereas my other siblings have scholarships, thus getting their own allowances and even started investing. 

How can i be less of a burden? Is giving tuition recommended? Is it really the quickest/easiest way to make money since many do it? I have no prior experience and my grades aren't that good (low 80s rank points for A levels) coming from a neighbourhood JC. Help this burden. Please advise!

I am a year 1 undergraduate going year 2 from a low-income family. Was able to save up some amount during National Service, and paid for my campus accommodation with my PSEA account.  Although I am under financial aid, the loans provided by the school is not enough to get by unless I ask from my parents or earn money by myself. As I have run out of savings, I would not be staying on campus. What are some practical ways I can do to earn some money during the semester that would not take too much time off studies?

A relationship goes 2 ways, chances are he probably loves you for who you are. Most times a guy just wishes his lady supports him however high or low he climbs and falls. So just be there for him.

I think I speak for the majority of the straight malehood. Be with him during the climb, if he dumps you along the journey then he or she probably isnt worth it after all. 

PS. Most IB Bankers I know didnt came from biz backgrounds. In fact I know more bankers from psych, soci, engineering. Of course business degrees do help a lot. So dont be down bkos you're from FASS and he's from Biz, if you have an interest in Finance, join him!

I really feel that government authorities and government affiliated businesses fail to perform since they operate with the belief that they will never face repercussions. Sure, they can make scapegoats of certain individuals at the top, but by and large the organizations stay in place and continue as they have been for years and years. 
I am the OP of  and I have some more experiences to share. A certain authority has various projects to improve, extend or refurbish its existing facilities (such as MRT stations) and my company has been winning the tenders for such projects and executing them successfully for many years now. I am now part of the team working on such a project that has recently been awarded and I've been exposed to the way this authority works. 
To quote my project director, a wizened and gritty engineer: "Dono how they do last time. But whoa, these days hor, these people like gangster,you know!" 
To quote another (perhaps effeminate) engineer-turned-manager, who despite having worked for them for 10 years now quakes at the thought of them: "You walk into a meeting and greet them, they point finger at you and say "Don't smile! This is not the time to smile! Sit down! How dare you smile at me!". And then we have to sit quietly for an hour while he keep talking."
In response, another manager goes "THAT guy ah, I cannot tahan him. I hope he gets run over by a truck.". 
So by now it is clear to me that this they are trying to use intimidation and inflexibility, and one guy in particular, to get work done quickly, effectively and at minimum cost to them. In short, the SG way. That ain't easy, and that ain't happening easily if the customer shouts at the contractor without letting him get a word in edgewise. 
This guy yelling himself hoarse is actually not at all efficient himself and is in no real position to question my company as though they have done something wrong. His gang is extremely adept at generating assloads of paperwork and documentation. The latest meeting minutes (10 pages for something that occurs every 2 weeks!) contain multiple errors and redundancies. Works not relevant to the contract are referenced, another contractor (not present at the meeting) is addressed and items that have already been fulfilled still remain on the agenda. They have low standards for themselves and extremely high standards for others (who, by virtue of not being govt auth and instead a service provider, are answerable to everyone).
A recent site-survey to one of the stations revealed much, much more work than had been anticipated. Later on sifting through the contract, there's fine print that the contractor is responsible for doing a site-survey to find whatever is there & divert it all at his own trouble and expense. 
They have a very exacting modus operandi and are so archaic and impossible to deal with. These works may lack innovation, but they have to be done. And the attitude borne by those in charge does not at all make it conducive to work. If they were a private company, they would not last a day in the field with this kind of attitude. 
I bring this all up in light of the recent breakdown just to illustrate that these bodies have not been heading in a positive direction for a long time now. I will not comment on the operators since I haven't seen too much of them, but I will say this: have any of you seen "Dude, Where's My Car? " ?

The day before the midterm, you lot conspired to sit together so that you can cheat in the exam. I didn't say anything. On the day of the midterm, I arrived late and sat away from you all, and later explained that I was stuck in a jam. I lied. In truth, I purposely did that because I was disappointed and disgusted with your spineless behaviour. It was an inconsequential exam in a easy mod that you didn't even need a good grade for. In fact I think some of you S/U-ed it. And yet you couldn't respect yourself and others enough to do it the right way.

I'm currently in a relationship with a very ambitious guy. He's from a poor and broken family so that spurs him to work very hard. He's in business and wants to do investment banking while I'm in fass. I'm really afraid that one day he might dump me for someone who is more successful or can help him in his career. I feel so selfish because when it comes to picking me or a more successful girl, I would want him to stay with me even though I can't help him in his career as much as this fictitious other girl. I've been cooking and helping out with errands for him and his family because of this fear but he seems to take my efforts for granted. I don't know what I should do from now.

I am from CS and next year would be my final year. I hate how SoC changes many module availabilities and focus area specifications every year, although I kinda get used to it. That being said, there are valuable life lessons you can take from there:
1. You don't always get what you want and you have to go along with it.
Some modules that you have planned to take in your final year can just be removed from the curriculum entirely when you are in your final year, and you can't do anything about it except to think of an alternative plan right away.
2. Sometimes you have to choose one over all others.
Even when all the modules you plan to take are available, the schedules can be changed such that all of them clash. Now you have to make a decision which one you want to take.
3. A missed opportunity may not come again.
Some modules that you plan to take but you keep pushing them back to your final year might just be coincidentally not available in your final year only, i.e. it's available the next academic year.

Regarding the big news taking up everyone's attention now. Yes, it affects a lot of people very badly. But SG as usual has a habit of taking things for granted. I work for a company that does a lot of work with SMRT and LTA. And I've encountered engineers from my company, SMRT and STE and these are the nicest, most hardworking people I know. They sometimes spend all day at office and then go for night work from 2-6 am and come back to office at 8 am. You guys have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. These people are capable of laying 4 km of trackside copper cable (e.g.: OTP to CTH) in 2-3 hours before everyone wakes up. They can lay new telecomm cable in a station, terminate, test (and then undo their work and return to old configuration if test fails) all in a couple hours before stations reopen. Go look at the depots, underground tunnels and various stations afterhours. There are people working like machines to ensure that nothing goes wrong. And when something does go wrong, its heartbreaking. There are hundreds of interfacing parties/subcontractors and multiple authorities involved in the operation of a highly complex network. And Singapore is a very small space, the design considerations involved (structural, electrical, etc.) are immense. It is simply not easy. 
In fact, the engineers are all hanging around the office right now wondering if they will be allowed to go onsite today. We're rushing a project (manpower constraints + general gov.t authority behavior) and now have this to add to matters. 
You can go ahead blame the authorities and certain ministers and CEOs we know very well, but just remember that behind the scenes there are humans just like you and I trying to make it all work non-stop. 

*Don't ask me if I know what happened - I'm not an electrical engineer and we're involved in different projects not concerning this incident. 
But we're all seeing the light side of it. Every time people bump into each other: "eh, it was you right? Yesterday you went that side. You cause the power surge right? Don't worry I won't tell anyone."

From the MRT incident, we learned that CEO should have technical capabilities to understand the operations of the company. If a CEO is educated in Business school, he/she will naively 'cut cost' to increase profits at the expense of technical insurance. But it doesn't mean that they must have engineering degree. There are some engineering degree holders with have plenty of technical debt.

Are these acceptable as double-degree combination?

1.
Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science)
Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering)

2.
Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering)
Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical Engineering)

3.
Bachelor of Engineering (Civil Engineering)
Bachelor of Engineering (Environmental Engineering)

Since there are SoC professors here, what about:
4.
Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science)
Bachelor of Computing (Information Systems)

5.
Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science)
Bachelor of Computing (Information Security)

Regarding the same faculty double-degree, I check the website and seems that they also accept double degree  in which both degrees are from the same faculty.

In order to meet the minimum 2/3 distinct modules, I just need to take more modules and just count towards only 1 of the degree, even though it can be overlapping between 2 degrees?

I'm an incoming NUS student. I will be doing computer engineering. Whenever I tell my friends (they are already in NUS studying mechanical engineering) that that's what I'll be studying, most of them would say "good luck to you" in a kind of tone that implies a seemingly dark and difficult road ahead. So I just want to know from computer engin seniors what I can expect when i matriculate. Is it gonna be very hard? Thanks!

With computing MPE coming up, I really need some help! Especially anyone from SoC, I will really appreciate any kind of reply/feedback/advice as I really need them. >__<

So I am currently doing Internship, 9 to 6 everyday, and it will last till end of this year, aka literally 31 Dec. And I am from IS, going on year 4, and have 6 and a half modules (half meaning 2 MCs - well, I went on summer school, that's why the weird number) not cleared yet. My boss can't give me any day off, the earliest I can leave is probably 5pm, and it's not supposed to be often - maximum twice a week is best I can get. I am left with 1 core mod, 4 more program electives, and 6 MCs of unrestricted electives to clear. It is not quite possible to (and I don't want to) clear all of them within a semester... And no I don't want to terminate my internship, as I think a longer staying period gives me a higher chance to get a full-time job, or even just looks better on resume (and YES it's a well-known company that's why I don't want to give it up). So ideally I aim to clear either 1 mod or 6 MCs next sem. I know this is the consequence of poor planning, that's why I am seeking advice here...

1. I know I have zero chance of finding night classes for IS program electives (cause I tried), hence I would like to know if there are any unrestricted electives that start lesson at 6 (are there even later classes)? Any more popular ones? How do I find what are the night classes offered by NUS? (As there are so MANY electives!)

2. Is it really better, in my case, to extend one semester? Background: my CAP is not high and I think it would be good to spend more time to pull it up. However, one more sem means more $$$, and I am currently on an IS internship program so I can't ask for Leave of Absence next sem as well. However, money might not be an issue if all other options are exhausted (as I am a little more well-off). But does graduating late put you on a disadvantage compared to others?

3. Can I take classes in special sem end of this year and still manage to graduate on time? Or can I even take classes during the December vacation?

4. What is really the best option for me now? :(

I know I am probably super blur as someone going on year 4, please be nice to me. :'( And I tried asking the SoC undergraduate office lady, but she had a really bad attitude like I was wasting her time (oops). BUT THEN, that's not how you're supposed to help students, with that kind of attitude. :( So no, I don't wanna go ask her again. As said, any kind of help/advice will be eternally appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Hi guys. I need some advice. I graduated last year, but haven't yet found a job that I feel I'm good at. I did work as a data analyst at an MNC for 8-months upon graduation, but then I left the job due to the high stress and the lack of support from my team. I admit I'm a slow learner and they were expecting someone who can pick things up quickly, but I'm not that person. I need time to really get into the heart of things. One time the stress got so bad I locked myself for half an hour in the toilet and cried my eyes out. I just couldn't take it.

Since leaving the job, I've been working as a part-time waiter/hotel staff/tutor and doing some freelance webdev work or copywriting. I'm definitely less stressed and much happier now... And occasionally, I get to travel overseas without having to worry about leave applications. But I know that this isn't practical in the long run. I constantly feel like I'm behind my peers. Everyone else from my class is doing great in their jobs... and I feel ashamed when we meet up and they ask what I'm doing and I tell them I'm just part-timing at random jobs. 

The problem I realise is that I'm not able to cope with stress under a pressure cooker. It gets worse when I don't feel like I'm getting the support from my team in learning new things. I don't know what I can do now to be honest... I thought NUS prepared me well to work under stress... I mean graduated with decent grades... but I'm guess I'm not. I feel like such a fraud a lot of times... :( meh sorry for the pity party... I'm just feeling overwhelmed now

Hey NUSMods, thanks again from all of us students for updating. Can you please tell me how this thing I'm seeing now is possible? Two lecture groups taking place simultaneously for the same mod? As far as I know, Prof Seah can't be in two places at once. 
Does this mean the location is yet to be decided or does it mean there'll be two lecturers? Thanks:)

Any seniors / peers with any advice on whether CS4211 (Formal Method for Software Engineering) or CS4218 (Software Testing) is more painful? And any advice about CS4222 (Wireless Networking) and CS4226 (Internet Architecture)? (Damn this 12-MC requirement for level 4000 mods)

I am a JC student and am not from NUS. But I need advice. I have an idea that many people have called "genius" (I feel it is terribly overrated as its those type of why did I not think of that ideas) and I want to create a startup to fuel this idea forward. But I dont want my to gain any funding from my parents whatsoever, since they had funded a venture when I was 12. (I was $50 short of breaking even and this makes me feel guilty till now) So does anyone have any venture capitalist contacts whatsoever? I have the downright basic website in place that I made, and I hope I can get funding to make it bigger. Can anyone help?

I'm a guy who is majoring in Psychology. I am in the middle of an internship and attached to the Organisational Excellence Division of the agency. Being a Psych major, I feel I have no relevant knowledge I can offer as compared to the others from more relevant majors like Business. I feel especially overwhelmed all these weeks through the internship.

This week is my final week and the final task I have to do is to present to the Chief Executive. My goodness, I can't even present well in group projects, I'm sure I'm going to be torn apart... Having said that, throughout this internship, I have not applied anything I've learned from my major. I think they accepted me because they could not find any CNM majors and I was the backup. Basically I did designing of posters for (ICMs) Internal Comms Messages to designing the namecards, PPT templates and staff passes. I've never designed anything in my entire life, and through this internship, I had to use the internet to learn Photoshop... At the end of the day, I can hardly even use this experience that I have gained since my major is Psychology. 

I need some advice, is it normal for students to be completely unable to apply what they've learned in their major at work? Should this also be a cause for concern, because I am aware that Psychology as a major is lacking in job prospects. What are the jobs out there for Psych majors like me who don't intend on pursuing masters? I hope I'm not doomed.

I regret not doing enough useful things with my summer holidays in NUS. In the holidays, I chose to slack off or take part in things that looked fun rather than beefing up my CV or at least enriching myself with useful skills. (Yes, I'm a sheltered kid, money wasn't a concern.) Now that I'm graduating and facing a stream of failed applications, I'm regretting those decisions and failing to plan ahead. Temporarily having fun back then wasn't worth the headache of having everything messed up now. 

People say that nobody looks back on their life only to wish they'd worked harder, but then in that case I must be nobody.

After seeing a bunch of secondary students chionging their ten year series questions in the public library just now, I remembered a little experience of mine.

When I was in secondary in school and JC, I also loved to do past year examination questions, because I focused a lot on trying to score by predicting and tuning my mind to answer the type of questions which will be asked during the exams. Even our school printed tons of practice papers for us to do so we can excel. And I did well for exams using this approach, and got a place in NUS.

Once for fun, I sat in a lecture with my girlfriend who is studying in the University of London program at SIM. There's an old ang moh econs lecturer from the UK who is very brash and confrontational, yet he's got great wisdom.

At the end of the lecture, he asked if anyone has questions. A girl at the front asked if the practicing past year papers can help them score better during the exams. The ang moh got pissed, raised his voice and asked her, "Do you know your own name?" The girl got stunned like vegetable and said yes. The ang moh replied, "So if ask you what is your name, may i have your name, name please, I'm sure you can answer it, am I right?" The girl nodded. The ang moh continued, "It's because no matter in what ways I could possibly ask you for your name, you'll be able answer it because you know your name!" 

It made me realized that understanding the concept itself, is actually more important than learning how to answer questions. This is because some problems we face in life are totally unpredictable since it can take different shapes and forms, and by having a good understanding of the underlying principle, we can apply it to many different situations creatively.

The worse thing that can ever happen is to tell ourselves we cannot do it, just because we haven't done or seen it before, or that no one has ever told us how to do it.

With this new outlook, I begin to appreciate my nus profs setting questions which no one has ever seen before. It's not good for my grades of course, but it's good for my education. Thank you!

I wonder... I wonder... why some PPL have all the time to ogl for so many camps. There is no salary.

If I tell my mum I want to be full time ogl for 3months, she would throw me out! I need money, dun the ogls need $$ too?

I saved up the 'allowance' under NUS financial aid (it's actually a no-interest loan) while working part-time to support myself. Now that I'm graduating, I'm using the amount I've saved to pay off the tuition fee loan in one full sum, then I can slowly pay off the other loan since it has no interest. The feeling of paying off loans is just awesome!

I think FASS should go back to the days where students can choose to study three subjects from different departments instead of the current paradigm where student need to focus on one.

Can anyone give a review on the module PC1326/GEK1521 (Physics in Life Science) in terms of workload, assignments, etc. I will be taking it for faculty requirement. Just wanna confirm that the module title is not as deceiving as it is.

Yes starbucks is a luxury. But its really not worth it. I'd rather sip 7 tehtariks or 3 milo dinosaurs than to subject my digestive system to a caramel fappiato. 

Stop paying premium for brand names in order to get some caffeine or shit. You can get caffeine cheaply anywhere else.  

Buy an iced coffee from the coffee shop and like do something with that extra 5 bucks. Donate, invest, save, do something for your future. It might do you some good. 

We should help our families, help society, help the world If we sit here spending our money away on useless shit we are just committing abetment to all the shit thats happening in the world. 

*cues video showing quarter of worlds children living in malnourishment, hundreds of millions of people living in poverty, millions living under  war and strife*

Come at me fallacy police. There is still a pinch of truth in what I said. The world is in a position whereby money stays at the top. And even if we are barely well to do in this country we'd probably be in the top one third in the world. 

We could all try create a network that helps people. A network of businessmen, programmers, academic researchers, engineers to come up with solutions for the new world. 

Please give me a medal to going from starbucks to pressing world problems.

I agree that some people in life are too blessed. I feel sorry for the cards dealt to those who are less privileged. I am from a family where we have 2 cars and a few properties in Singapore and overseas. We also travel to Europe every summer and take a short trip in Asia if time permits. I have just graduated, but my parents are not pressuring me to get a job. My dad even says it is okay to take my time and offers to pay for a working holiday abroad. But life wasn't like this before. My dad came from a very poor family, but he worked his ass off, went to night school and only graduated when I was in Sec 2. In primary school, we stayed in a 3 room flat and continued to upgrade as years when by. He is where he is now because of hardwork (I'm trying to give a different perspective toward meritocracy). My point is, everyone is dealt with different cards in life but at the end of the day, we gotta make the best out of the cards dealt. 

Ps. To all graduating students who are privileged enough, donate to the NUS Giving because the money contribute to the bursary for the less privileged students! A little giving goes a long way.

You know, what with the exams being over 2 months ago, and it being the holidays and all, all this boring talk of CAP would have died down already. Come on! Where are all the steamy holiday escapade and hot camp encounters? The social camps just ended right?

I'll kick start by telling my own story - see not just a complainer. 
I'm currently on an internship, and was fortunate enough to be brought along for a business trip to Thailand w my boss. And I should say, girls, you should be more attentive when your other halves go on such trips. Apparently it is a fairly common practice to arrange "service" - obviously of the intimate sort - for the incoming parties. They were so hospitable that they even arranged a hunk to do a "massage" for my colleague (always suspected he was gay - practically confirmed when you see his face during the trip lol). Let's just say, I'll never think of business trips the same way again

Hi, for those of you who are not Singaporean nor Malaysian and had done an internship during term time before, what kind of pass/permit did you apply for? Thanks.

I am 22 this year. I have only drunk Starbucks once, a few years ago. I do have enough to afford it but nvm, I also dk what to order in there. Who is like me?

I am a poor nus student trying to save enough for tuition fee loan without incurring interests nor debt to parents. My parents are not rich, I qualify for financial aid. They do have a sum ready to bail me out if I fail to hit my target savings in 3yrs time. Meanwhile I have started allocating some money to stocks n etf. Hope the market will be kind to me for this three years.

Rag n Flag really has no obvious link. I think most freshman don't even know it raises donations in the first place. I was one last time. I really did not know why are there PPL so eager to be involved, only reasons, make friends and to be a "ragger"? OK lo, just like in secondary sch n JC, thre are PPL who will go all out to get that CCA which "beefs up" portfolio.

Sorry, I will not put in unparalleled efforts for the little returns rag n flag gives me, it is just logically unsound. In JC, I did substantial hours of volunteering. Although the motivation is to beef up my testimonial, I clocked all volunteering hours with good ethics. I put in my best to serve the organizations, bringing value to them.

There is really no logical link between the ragnflag n charity. But I would still support it for it brings vibrancy to the Nus community. Just too fake to say the raggers are investing time on charitable purposes. Hey if you agree with me, like it on fb, welcome responses.

"its for charity" is a smokescreen misused in this case, because people just do not see that it is for charity. OK la, 勉强la!

With all the debate over the importance of CAP and what-nots, please allow me to share what the ex-Dean of Law, Prof Tan Cheng Han, said in one of his usual pre-exam emails:

"Dear law students,

As I get older, time seems to pass ever more swiftly. Thus I find myself, together with all of you, close to the end of another academic year despite vividly remembering the start of the AY in August.

This being the case, I know you are near what one of your course mates recently described to me as “the dreadful period”. The silver lining to dreadful periods though is that they presage better times so that’s always a consolation. For now, I wish all of you the very best. Do remember that life is like an ultra-marathon and therefore it is a given that along your route you will have the occasional stumble, wrong turn, and from time to time feel completely drained. However, as long as you keep going, you’ll get to the finish line and feel the great satisfaction of having completed a race well run, even if all you could do at certain stages was walk. Like all of you I am still en-route and I can attest to stumbles, wrong turns and fatigue.

In some of my past emails on this subject, I’ve mentioned how I know people who’ve not done so well academically but have gone on to do very well in working life. As I was thinking of what to say in this email, I kept being drawn back to an incident around 20 years ago when a student received results that were poor and was extremely downcast. I noticed it – in those days results were read out in the Moot Court – and went to console the student. I’m sure that what I said and did had little effect since we live in the reality of the present while the future is unknown and uncertain. Fast forward to today and the student is now General Counsel to a group that includes 3 listed companies while having a fulfilling family life. I think this student has done very well indeed!

To the final years, I also wish you a smooth transition to working life. I use the phrase “smooth transition” because I recall finding it challenging to get to grips with the practice of law. It seemed to me that some classmates took to it more naturally than I did. Fortunately something ‘clicked’ somewhere along the way and I managed to become a competent practitioner. So don’t be too discouraged if you don’t get off to a strong start.

 
Sincerely,

TCH"

I want to take CS1020E as Technical Elective next semester but the exam schedule clashes with one of my preallocated modules. Is it possible to request to sit for the CS1020E exam ahead of the cohort (say at 2pm since the exam is at 5pm)?

CAP matters, CAP doesn't matter. Ok, ok, both are right in their own way. And the truth is because, each group can identify a discrete tier of jobs that supports their own case.

One tier is those that require candidates to have a CAP that is above a certain number before the candidates can even be considered for the job. 

For Biz, do you really think you're going to be considered for an analyst position at the bulge bracket if you don't have a second upper? Bulge brackets' HR are very explicit and up-front with this, no negotiation. For Law, you think you're going to get that M&A position at Allen & Gledhill if you're not a second upper/near first? For FASS, there are certain positions in certain ministries that are indeed out of reach for those who do not meet the CAP requirements.

Of course, there is the other tier that encompasses the positions not covered by the first tier. So if candidates are seeking employment in this tier, by and large, CAP wouldn't really matter.

PS. Note that there is no indication of which tier is superior to which. Basically just highlighting the phenomena in the current job market.

i come from a low income family and i worked my ass off during my 4 years in uni to save enough to support myself (living allowances, etc) so that i do not have to take a single cent from my parents who are struggling from their gambling debts and have nothing in their cpf or savings. i never felt bitter about my situation but i often feel sad for very financially privileged mid to upper class students who do not appreciate the safety and financial security their parents/guardians have provided for them but take it as an entitlement. the financial security they have is a safety net that allows them to really concentrate on being a student and experience student life fully because they do not have to worry about losing their job at work, giving up social life to balance work and grades, worry about the interest rate from the study loan once they graduate. it is such a blessing! please appreciate what ur parents have sacrificed to have this safety net for u. it is not an entitlement.

Just want to rant this out. Absolutely hating the working environment in my FYP lab. It seems that my supervisor has zero trust in me. Today was the first time I came in slightly later (I came in at ~1045am) and I got a warning email to be on time. The truth is I wasn't feeling well in the morning so I just stayed in for a longer time to make sure I was well enough to work in the lab.

I'm finding it so hard to work with my supervisor like this. My previous experience in other labs didn't have this problem with my supervisors at all.

I honestly don't get her point. In my opinion, coming in early and coming in every single day does not necessarily equate to high productivity. I honestly don't see the point of coming in at all when I haven nothing to do and when the working area that I have is so cramped, and hence hard to do my readings/work.

Could someone reason out my supervisor's view to me, so I can work better with her? Do all supervisors (other than the labs I have been to) have similar expectations as her?

Rag is a waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of energy, and even a waste of space. (conversing with  & )

Time because of all the practices. I've been at camps and this or that group mate would say they must leave for practice. It's rather disruptive.

Money is spent on outfits and rentals and who knows what else. Why not directly donate it? Or I'm sure there're other bonding activities we could do for less.

Energy, well, youths are supposed to have a lot of this, but is prancing around on crudely made floats appropriate for university students? Do something for the country!

Space which may be used for other orientation activities in July is frequently taken up by piles of junk and a crafting area. An eyesore, some visitors might think.

To all the people who say "CAP/GPA isn't everything", please, take a good look around you. Of course, I'm asking you to look at fellow degree holders (because obviously CAP/GPA doesn't affect them who don't have degrees). If you have a degree, and you want to make something good of that degree, you have to have a decent CAP. It's all in the societal expectations. People expect that if you have a degree, and you have a higher CAP, you tend to be a better achiever (never mind the fact that perhaps studying isn't your best suit, that you are much better at performing in a team or carrying out procedures; generally other skills that are not related to academics). CAP is the thing that gets you in the door because like it or not, the first cut-off is always the CAP. And unless you are truly exceptional in the other non-academic areas, that companies would be willing to push aside those higher performing candidates (as determined by their CAP score), you're going to have a really really hard time. Of course, you can cite university leavers who make it big, but you're forgetting that these people are just a few out of many. You're using heuristics to justify your case. I'm just an ordinary person, whose CAP is not making it, and I'm watching all the doors slowly closing in front of me.

tl;dr CAP matters. Really. But you can always supplement it with work experience, and perhaps write a very very convincing case. CAP still matters though.
-
 
I've seen many people here ranting on about how a good CAP is important, and maybe even the most important thing to achieve in your university life. Let me share with you low CAP-ers a story to make you feel a little more optimistic.

I've never done well in my studies in NUS. Sure I was in one of the "better" courses in the school, but by the time I was in my 2nd year, I had a stable CAP of around 2.5. Still, I persevered on and just prayed to even land an internship. Out of sheer luck, I managed to get an internship position at a decent SME in my 3rd year. Going into my last semester, I hovered at around CAP 2.7, and I had lost hope of ever getting a good job after graduation.

A few months before graduation, I landed an interview at a successful MNC in my field, and against all odds I got the job. Yes, way before graduation (or final exams for that matter). With a CAP of 2.7. They offered a pretty good starting salary too of close to a mid-3k range. Yup, I was probably the luckiest person ever. It might have helped that I'm a pretty attractive female (although I'm not in a field where looks would matter at all), but I would like to think that my confidence and good interview skills were the biggest factors (I'm also a naturally good speaker).

(If anyone is interested in how I did my interviews/resume, I may write another post to elaborate on this to give you guys tips.)

Eventually I graduated with a CAP of 2.8 with nothing to worry about since I've already secured a good job. And now I'm happily working for the company, doing pretty well for myself, where my CAP (or anyone else's around for that matter) does not matter one bit.

I hope my story would inspire those with a low CAP to not give up and carry on fighting. I can't guarantee that you'll be as lucky as me, but I'm pretty sure I'm a living example of why your CAP in uni really isn't a big deal.

NUSMods is *finally* updated for AY15/16! I'm really thankful for the awesome NUSMods people who built such a cool website to solve the problems faced by us students. I saw that some of my friends were complaining about why so long NUSMods still not updated? Did it ever occur to them that it could be the school side that is slow and not NUSMods?

NUSMods does not owe any of us anything. It is a self-initiated project by some zai seniors who have already graduated. They have done us a free service and instead of being grateful for their efforts, we whine and complain about it? Come on people, we can do better; we should be thankful and not spiteful.

Thank you, NUSMods team for your contributions to the school and making our lives as students better.

Okay, uncle here have graduated from NUS and have been working in the civil service for almost 2 years. Let me just say this as a working adult: CAP matters. A lot. 

Sure, soft skills and leadership abilities matters too. But once you enter the working world, it becomes very apparent that scholars and those with 1st class honors not only start off with higher pay and higher rank, they are also given more leadership opportunities and given more high profile projects to handle. They'll be having some tea session with some permanent secretaries every few months and invited to go for various networking events. Meanwhile, the rest of us farmers will have to work hard and prove ourselves for a few years before we can even be given that same entry level opportunities. It doesn't matter if the farmers are actually more hardworking and produces better results in real life. It's always these "leaders" who gets recognised, not the minions who contributed the ideas, the blueprints and the groundworks (and also knocks off later). 

I'm not trying to be bitter here. It's perfectly fine if you think that CAP isn't everything and there are things that matter more in life. But please, do not for a minute have the illusion that your soft skills and beautiful CCA record can ever make up for the shortfall in your CAP. I've held leadership positions in CCAs throughout my years in NUS (in NUSSU no less, although no, I did not do it to zhng my resume) and none of my interviewers were interested in them when I first looked for jobs.

I think staying in hall is overrated, especially at the expense of your own cap. Not everyone is able to cope with all the hall activities and I have seen friends not doing well in their studies after staying in halls. 

On the positive note you do make alot of new friends, on the other hand which good employer would want to hire a fresh graduate with a lousy cap? Ps: Good for you if you can handle hall life and your studies well.

Let's be honest. NUS chopsticks exists because it's the summer break and ppl are bored. All this will die off once the new sem starts lolol.

On a side note I've been observing many "evergreen" posts, airing their frustrations at being single. What I would like to say is, sometimes no relationship means less trouble. (speaking from personal experience) Don't seek trouble for yourself, take it slow when it comes it comes. If it doesn't just wait. How old are u guys anyway? Scared to be left on the shelf? Gotta be kidding me man.

There are people who posted on this platform on their concerns over their low CAPs. I can perfectly understand their feelings, given how the apparent perception of CAP is amongst our peers. Very often, we would see CAP as an indicator to our first salary, which would also subsequently determine our next salary and thereafter (henceforth, determining our earning capacities and qualities of life). To an extent, it is true but exactly to what extent this is true is not really known. However, let us just leave this thought aside for a moment and consider another idea.

Often we say, “Pain is temporary but GPA is forever”, in order to motivate our lazy asses to study. But what is more “forever” than a number? I would think, the answer is our ‘self’ (well at least until we die). Our character, our skill-sets, our personas as unique individuals and our relationships with others (who is the ‘you’ in ‘others’) matter much more than a label the society (or maybe just the public sector) forcefully put on you (in this article I will emphasize on skill-sets). This thought is not an ideal and here, contrary to what you may perceive this writing as, I am not an idealist but a realist. I realize that ultimately and minimally, it is your skill-sets that are your most basic necessity in the working world. You may disagree on skill-sets being the most fundamental aspect, you may argue that skill-sets is not as important as looks, your charisma, your emotional quotient or whatsoever, but we would have already agreed that CAP may not seem that important afterall.

Back to the the ‘CAP’ issue. Firstly, we ought to ask ourselves, why are we afraid of getting a low CAP? Is it because the number 3.00 frightens you as much as a spider with only 3 legs does? Or is it because of the uncertain future that you think, as a student with a CAP of 3.0, will probably face? The keyword here is ‘uncertain’. The future holds promises, and as equally likely, curses. It is uncertain. A CAP of 5.0 does not guarantee presidency, neither 2.5 guarantees idiocy. Inherently, you ought to ask yourself, what is your purpose for being in a university? Is it because you want to get a good CAP so that you will graduate to get a high starting salary job? Or is it because you wish to be equipped with knowledge and armed with high level skill-sets to tackle world’s uncertainties and challenges?

I have a near-perfect CAP and like yourself, I am in a constant worrying state. I aim to be one of the top in my cohort and that has placed me in position of tremendous stress. I have to remind myself, like how I am reminding you now, regularly that CAP is not everything. Still, sometimes I cannot escape from the ubiquitous talk that CAP determines your future. It is okay, for we are fallible and from time to time, we need reminders.

Now (at least for this moment), I am convinced that, despite my regular setbacks mentioned earlier, I am studying for knowledge and to be equipped with knowledge-related skills. Some people may argue, what sort of skills can one learn from the academic study of say, thermodynamics?  I would provide no answer for this because I am not arguing on whether arming yourself with theoretical knowledge or the practical know-hows (or for that matter, being outspoken, charismatic etc) is better (that is the topic for another day). I am saying that either is better than pursuing mindlessly a number to put on your certificate.

For what is that number good for? People would try with all their means to convince you that this number is good, for whichever wicked reasons that have in their minds (they might want you to be a mindless computational robots, I don’t know) but this life is yours and you have to decide for yourself, if it is really worthwhile of, both your own effort and the finances you invested in these years of education.

People can take away my certificate, use correction tape to erase that number and NUS can wither to dust for all I care, but the knowledge I gained and the skills I learnt are things that will be definitive of my value and most importantly, are always with me so long as I lives. Try googling for names like ‘Albert Einstein’, ‘Bill Gates’ and ‘Nikola Tesla’, their wikipedia pages have no space for their CAP (or the equivalent of that in their time). What they had achieved and what they are honored for, go way further than their income, definitely way further than their academic results. They had been honored for their skills, for their invaluable insights that they brought to us and they had lived in uncertain times, the time that we are living now. Back to my point on an uncertain future, things can change and often they change unpredictably. One thing remains constant, that is who you are as an individual. Universities are, and will continue to be, great places that give you the opportunity to ‘level up’, to become ‘stronger’ so that you do not lose yourself in the vagaries of life.

Are you going to give up this opportunity easily to something that amount only to 3 digits?

TL;DR: CAP is not important, stop worrying, re-evaluate your goals and focus on enhancing yourself.

Hi! 2nd year engineering student here. I want to go for the noc 1 -year program but some people have been telling me that the stress may be too much to handle. Is it true? Is the experience worth the stress? 

Query: do we have to arrange for our own accommodation or we easily get accommodation in the hostel facility of the partner universities?

It feels super sucky when you hear people discussing avidly about their internships, the bad and tiring stuff, how they will have to make do with the internships that they do not really desire. 

And here i am trying to get into that same internship, grasping for any opportunity available without ever succeeding.

To 
Your future is not bleak and as cliche as it is, your cap doesn't determine whether or not you will get an internship. I have a cap of 3.39 when I applied for internships. I just hit the bare minimum which was 3.2. But what won them over was my resume and my passion for the job. 

If you have yet to try applying to an internship or job, how are you so sure that you WON'T get it? Why shoot yourself down when you haven't even try? They haven't give up on you, why do you have to give up on yourself first? The last thing is to OVER WORRY and feel ashamed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. You may have heard this countless times but CAP does not determine your life. 

Now cheer up and go think of how you can improve your resume or your results. Instead of sulking and worrying, put your energy into something more meaningful.

One more engineering internship related confession coming up: sorry if its getting boring but I really feel like my eyes are being opened up to so much new stuff. 
I'm interning at huge multinational engineering consultant and all the project engineers here don't seem to have come up the "easy" way. The folk doing the legit technical jobs, are all from the so-called longer path to success. Meaning things like going to poly followed by a part-time B-tech. Having come up by studying and working at the same time and not having done things properly and consecutively like us. I know there's a lot of NUS students who don't have it easy either, but speaking for myself: all I had to do was graduate high school and now just graduate university and ta-dah! Simply attend class, study and do exam: all in one straight assured path. (I don't at all imply that studying in NUS is easy, but it has a determinate start and end point). 
In the meantime, the people dealing with the softer, office side of things are also qualified engineers but they are in a Sales type of department. And these are people from the same "comfortable path" as mine. The manager who hired me came from a so-called high-ranking JC, went through the exact same course as mine from NUS and then worked a series of relatively good jobs - NONE of them engineering-related. 
His superior, a much older man who I often assist in various tasks, is also an engineer from a coveted institution. And whenever he comes over to liaise with the project engineers, he always seems to be so distanced and, for all intents and purposes, might as well be a graduate from any other non-engineering field!
I know that engineering graduates work in various fields and don't necessarily do technical jobs. But it seems to me that when the best minds actively choose not to be involved in engineering jobs, then the field itself faces a loss. We all know of engineers whose degree automatically clears banking/finance companies' higher "IQ tests" and then go on to earn them disproportionately higher salaries. But then that is a vicious cycle: if engineering jobs don't pay as well and you go somewhere else, then these jobs will NEVER pay as well as others. 
For instance, Singapore may seem to have been built on trade and finance - but that's the tip of the iceberg. They show images of MBS and the Raffles Place bank buildings on TV documentaries to show our success. They should also show Jurong Industrial Estate (aerial view only enough haha), Port of Singapore and our construction & heavy/manufacturing industry. We have the 2nd largest container terminal throughput in the world. Shell's largest oil refinery in the world. We are expanding our global chemicals hub capacity through the absolutely INSANE Jurong Rock Caverns. 
But if more privileged engineers keep running off to better paying jobs, then I don't think we can keep this up. I am not blaming anybody - but the lopsided way this situation is makes me very uneasy.

A lot of people say that hall life/nus activities are worth it in exchange for a lower CAP. I stay in hall and many of my seniors say how being on the JCRC or being chairperson of this and that is very worth it, but more often than not, their CAP is quite low (and by low I mean around 3). I'm not sure if it's something that they say to comfort themselves or if it's true. Because I really don't want to risk my CAP to find out.

Some people see content unavailable when they try to join NUS Chopsticks. It is because the admin has to approve a member after he/she clicks the join link in the email. Unnecessary in this case, but it is the Facebook group settings. Can't help it. :(

I have never gotten into any relationships. 22yrs o engineering student. Since primary sch till JC, I know there are particular girls who would accept me if I make the move but I did not. U could feel it. Cos I thot I have no financial means to sustain years of dating, and I dun have rich parents.  I always thot that one day I would be super rich, so that I could give my wife a good life. Now that I'm an undergraduate student, potential income stands at $4K per month, and I'm working part time during studies, I'm ready for a girl. Who wants me? ;)

I never knew that NUS students represented singapore during this year SEA games until i receive the email on NUS news. I always thought that those who got a chance to represent sg are usually from the sports school lol. Just wondering, what does it take to reach the level whereby NUS can select the students to represent the country? Is it through training that the coaches spot people who have potential to reach high in that area of sports? And 1 last question, to have a chance to reach that high, the first step is to try and get into team NUS and train up from there? Or must you already have prior experience in that particular sport even before you come into university (eg represented your sec/jc and win medals). If not you don't even have to think about representing NUS at least?

I am someone who's very interested in sports (especially basketball) and wish to know what it really takes to reach a high level before i take the plunge so would appreciate if any NUS sports students can give me some insights on this.

Anyway congrats to the NUS students who represented sg and did us proud:)

what is it like to graduate with a degree in economics? i heard about people leaving for bank jobs just after three years, so is the honors year worthwhile? also, is it only just going into banking or teaching?

Moi view is college education should be an exercise in an all rounded intellectual development. Students should aim for that too. US colleges general aims to educate students that way. 

Sinkieland universities are mainly manufacturing robots. Even the students aim to become a goot robot.

I am saying this because too many people in sinkieland go take an undergraduate program for something else other than for the education and intellectual enrichment.

To the OP of  and everyone else: The creators of NUS Evergreen club decided to implement some changes to ensure privacy and safety and also changed the group name to avoid confusion (singles who are not evergreen can join).

We created a new group called NUS Chopsticks - It takes 2 to make a pair. The group has 2 objectives: Celebrating singlehood and making friends of the same and opposite gender. It is for all single and evergreen undergrads in NUS.

This is a secret group so non-members cannot see the group, its posts and member list. Students who want to join will enter their name and NUS email in a Google form and the group invite link will be sent to them through that email. The Google form link is on this page:

Hi there, OP of  here. Tl:dr of it was that I was once a hardworking, well-liked genius at school and became a piece of shit over here. Thought I'd tell y'all something more. Year 1 was a disaster so I'm now trying to pull some preventive measures for the horrors of Year 2. Trying to study a little that is. So I'm reading a textbook written by the prof teaching that module and well, it's the same chap who was once assigned as a mentor to me under the special program I was kicked out of thanks to my amazing performance in my first semester.

The first time I had gone to consult him, I got this really strange vibe like he knew I couldn't do it. Like I simply didn't have it in me. He said to me that his own son dropped out of the exact same program. And, that "it's ok if you find it's not for you". Way to be motivating. 

Now when I read his book I don't hear my own "voice" in my head like everyone does when they read. I can hear the prof's voice as though he's lecturing. And that same noncommittal, nonchalant tone he had used the few times I'd visited his office. It sounds ridiculously dramatic, especially considering the prof must have long forgotten about me. But I can't help but get the feeling that I really can't do it. I can't remember how I was able to be successful in the past. I only remember my most recent, and biggest, downfalls - which were seemingly foretold so accurately by someone who didn't even have to get to know me. I feel as though failure is now an intrinsic part of me and I don't know how to root it out.

Being an NUS student, I'm surrounded by many bright and competent people who seem to be able to accomplish any task that is set before them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. I got into NUS by dint of good A level grades, and nothing more. I was a good robot capable of digesting and regurgitating examinable facts and data, but being a shy introvert I kept to my books and failed to hone my skills at interacting with much of the real world. In a society seemingly designed by and for extroverts, I am hopelessly inept at dealing with situations that involve people. Furthermore, despite intensive studying my grades in NUS are downright dismal, a far cry from the solid As I managed to acquire during JC. I constantly feel like a dwarf standing amongst giants, such is my plight. I admire and envy those capable of thinking on their feet, a feat that has eluded me my entire life. Of late, I constantly feel incompetent, inadequate and downright stupid because no matter what i do, and regardless of how hard I try, people never fail to find fault with me. I have no real world skills to speak of, for somehow I've never managed to develop them. Although I'm trying to change that by constantly reading and improving myself, I'm afraid of what the future holds in store for me. More often than not, I just feel like I'm a waste of space, energy and resources, and that the food being utilized to keep my body alive could be better made use of were I not alive. That being said, I don't really have suicidal thoughts, although I constantly question the purpose of my existence in this universe. Afterall, I don't have much to contribute, I'm a failure in life, and the number of people who would mourn my absence can be counted on one hand. Why am I still here? :(

How are your summers coming along? mine started off great, but now at the halfway mark i already feel drained of energy. Granted I crammed this summer full of activities but it is mainly the result of not being able to work with people who can actually work in a team. I tried so hard but in the end i didn't have a choice in the partnering, so...
terrible.

summer is a great time to refresh and re-energize before the race begins again. be sure to carpe diem. and be able to choose a good partner for team work.

Hello guys, I am the OP of  and after reading some of the comments from my previous post, I decide to add on more praises for NUS! Haha, firstly, I want to say that it is obvious where I come from, so you're probably right on that inkling.

Next on webcast, I absolutely agree that NUS needs to have webcasts. Though the purpose of webcasting lectures is highly debatable, I still think that given today's context, webcasts are highly necessary. We, as students, have many commitments and especially so, at our age. Certain students from a more disadvantaged background might also benefit tremendously from the webcasts as they may need to devote themselves towards being a caregiver, as an example or other important tasks. Blessed students are usually concomitant to CCAs and outside clubs which sometimes can cause them to miss lectures. Moreover, beside that, webcasts allow students to review the lecture, copy notes that they had missed and many more. However, all these are done at an expensive cost, foot by the school, of course. Every LT is somewhat different in design in NUS, consider the sharp contrast of LT27 and UTown's LT51/52, therefore the placement of camera in each and every single, though a small challenge, need time and effort for careful consideration. Moreover, the tracking of lecture timings and venues can be a great logistic challenge, though sophisticated computer's algorithms can put the challenge to shame, coming up with such programs can be difficult. For instance, faculty of science modules may not be held in science, but in UTown or anywhere out of FoS, and this means the camera needs to be activated at a particular time, at a particular location and lastly the video has to be stored under the module's folder. Such stuff, probably cannot be done at a faculty level, commitment needs to come from the university itself. Also, the manpower required can be enormous. For every lecture that is recorded, someone needs to be there to watch the recording in real-time, almost solely for the purpose of shifting the camera. For every lecture, perhaps the lecturer will move around, conduct experiments, or refer to things on different part of the screen and a good recording must be able to note these details, therefore, being able to shift the camera's view in real-time is a key and requires manpower. Hiring such manpower can be very expensive and a "command" center is also required to house these people. On the other hand, why this can be done elsewhere is because in elsewhere, every LT looks the same, its the same in the interior but differing in sizes. Many times, the recording shows the view being fixated on one spot, never moving, with the lecturer not in the view half the time.  All the LTs are also located in two main blocks, just two stretch of LTs (and that is really what the whole school is to the typical undergraduate) and therefore, placing of cameras and all the logistic challenges can be easily circumvented. Honestly, given that many universities around the world has webcasts and even in elsewhere, webcasts are available, NUS must have considered this and I am confident that there are plans to have webcasts in the near future.

I am acutely aware that some professors may really prefer to have more students in their lectures and therefore, against the idea of webcasts as they fear students may no longer attend their lectures. I agree that from a motivational point of view, seeing many real, physically present students can be an ego booster and enhance the deliverance of a lecture. I am sure given an option, many good NUS student that I had met will continue to go for lectures despite the existence of webcasts. This is because NUS is so conveniently located that it doesn't take much trouble to travel to NUS! Unlike elsewhere, whose management should have already knew (since time immemorial) that it is not seated on a geographically favorable spot, still taking its own sweet time to provide hostels (at an ever-increasing price, like the global warming) for all its students. But then again, perhaps it is because of this unfortunate placement of the campus (which results in hellish travelling hours), the school actually offers easier modules and shorter lecture hours (but like I mentioned, compromised on the quality of the lecture content).

TL;DR: Webcasts are good, NUS should have them. Elsewhere has webcasts but sucks, should have built enough hostels long ago and stop charging high prices for it.

I'm not really seeking any advice or any particular response but I just want to say this stuff to a bunch of people. I'm of one of the minority races in SG, but I'm a 2nd gen citizen (meaning my parents came here on work with me about 15 yrs ago and were invited to apply for citizenship 5 yrs ago). I didn't attend local school until 3 yrs ago because I guess we never intended to settle here for good until somehow we did. Anyway, that's just a bit of backstory. 
I matriculated at NUS a year ago, joining a course that my cousin joined 3 yrs previously. I did extremely well in high school, having worked hard for probably the first time in my life and easily got my 1st choice of course. Something I had genuine interest in despite my cousin having "gotten in" first. I didn't even think of him then actually. 
My cousin is not Singaporean and came to SG for the first time when he joined, but was able to get a industry scholarship due to his academic & sporting excellence and has since been continuing his stellar academic streak. He comes from a traditional family: spoiled male child, foolish traditional parents, total lack of ability to adapt to new situations + some amount of familial discord with my parents. The whole shebang. 
It is almost a given that the eyes of the extended family were on me once it was heard that I was joining the very same course their little star had. I didn't think that would be a problem since I have always been independent-minded and self-determining. The day the brown NUS envelope came in the mail, I thought I'd work the same way I'd always done and achieve success regardless of whoever other inconsequential people would compare me with. And sure enough, I too gained a scholarship and acceptance into a prestigious faculty-based program. 
Things don't always go how we want them to. My first semester was a pure and unadulterated disaster. I'm surprised I even passed some modules. Thank goodness for the gradeless first semester. At the end of it, the prof heading the special program asked me to see him and very kindly told me they had to withdraw me from the program, especially considering that a scholarship was involved. "I mean we have to answer to higher authorities why we are giving scholarship to someone who has CAP 3.0 even after S/U". I can still remember the curious glances of the admin staff as he led me out of his office. That was the first time in history someone got kicked out of that genius-factory, and they were wondering what sort of a creature I could be. 
Well, even I'm still wondering. I feel like I can never be the same hardworking person I was in 2013. It is like the minute my school final exams were over, I shed my work ethic and priorities in life. I am really struggling to come to terms with what has happened to me. 
The second semester of my first year was definitely better. But until the S/U declaration period was over I didn't realize I could actually S/U certain grades and further lessen the impact of my Sem 1 disaster. I wrote to the S/U admin office afterwards and I guess something in my phrasing made them less than sympathetic to my case. 
I was told: "We wish to reiterate that the spirit of the S/U is "to encourage students to pursue their intellectual interests, without undue concern that exploring a new subject area may adversely affect their CAP".  It is not a tool or mechanism to help improve CAP." 
I was still making decisions from a hazy and numb state of mind. I was not alert and able to strategize my life and career. Still stuck. 
Now in the midst of this nonsense, I receive a Whatsapp message from my cousin: "Hey xxxx! How were the results? I got First class honors!". 
I congratulated him. I am truly happy for my family member achieving a type of success that I can fully understand. But unfortunately, my cousin and his family are not the sort who can be happy with their own success. As I have seen throughout my childhood, their happiness is doubled with the simultaneous downfall of others, especially that of those closest to them. 
It sounds awful to say, but that is the truth. It makes things twice as difficult for me and my ever-supportive parents. 
I feel guilty and undeserving of the opportunities I have received despite my parents never having questioned me for my many blind and tragic mistakes. I suppose no fault, other than schadenfreude, really lies with my cousin - but it sure is difficult to see all that I could be and should be, right before my eyes. 
I don't know why the hell I wrote this considering he reads this page from time to time, but I simply have to have others know that people like me exist. Those who reach extraordinary heights, and then crash, and then fucking burn.

I graduated from NUS in 1988. I major in Computer and Info Sciences.

For 21 years, I worked in an in-house IT environment and took on various IT roles such as project manager, system analyst, business analyst and analyst programmer.

In March 2009, after working for 9 years with a local media giant as an IT project manager, I was forced to resign from the company with zero compensation.

The reason they gave was that I did not meet the expectations of my reporting VP. I wrote in officially to seek a demotion but they refused to entertain.

For the next one and a half year, I worked as a cabby and explored other options while seeking a job that can leverage on my past 21 years of experience in an IT industry.

In late 2010, I was fortunate to be recommended to work for a global IT giant as a contract staff.

Being used their software and led a team in supporting their software previously, I was thrilled to be able to work for them despite that it’s an entry level position as an inbound lead specialist (B-B Inbound Tele-Marketer).

For three and a half years, I moved on to handle the outbound tele-marketing role before being promoted as a SEA tele-marketing team manager in mid 2012. I also lead a team of 11 marketers based in 6 SEA countries.

In spite of the fact that my current salary is still around 60% lower than my last IT job and I need to supplement my income by renting out one of my rooms in a 3-room HDB flat, I am happy working there as my past IT knowledge and management skill is able to put into good use.

Unfortunately, starting from this year, the contract term of my team has been reduced from 6 months renewable to 3 months renewable.

On top of that, the company did not give us the budgeted 1 month bonus (we don’t have AWS) and salary increment (also budgeted).

At the same time,the company has set up a similar team structure in the office in Philippines, which has started their operation this month.

All the signs are pointing at the exit door for me and my team come end June this year.

While I can always go back to drive cab again, my current health condition may not permit me to do.

Hence, I like to seek help from you all to recommend me a job. I am open to all options.

Thank You!

I’m a desperate man

Hi i am a life science major hoping to do a PhD and i do not have UROPS, i only have done a research internship. I do not wish to do UROPS since i heard it is not easy juggling your modules with UROPS.

I need some opinions from seniors on this. Is it true that to do a PhD, you MUST minimally get a second class upper, otherwise you stand no chance to do a PhD at all? What are the various routes to PhD that one can take?

Hi, I am graduating with a low third class honour in Engineering and I am hoping to gain some insights or maybe advices on how to enter the Investment Banking or Finance sector. 

For instance, are the employers willing to take in engineers with such grades or do they only consider creme de la creme? 

Will we be disadvantaged if we join this field, as compared to business graduates? 

Should we just stick to engineering jobs first and switch after a few years or should we just start out immediately in the IB or Finance sector?

Your advices are greatly appreciated!

I noticed something very distressing when I was collecting my graduation gown today. Several pretty young things were stationed outside the MPSH, collecting students' contact details, seemingly on behalf of NUS. They were deliberately vague about where they were from and who they represented. 

I hope they are not NUS students, because this does not reflect NUS's core values of integrity and honesty.

I urge all my fellow students not to provide their details to these people, and to call these people out for their despicable actions.

To those who have already provided their details, and have been receiving unsolicited emails and phone calls, please explore your means of redress via the Personal Data Protection Act.

I would like to ask this question for those who are in FASS or Science. If your CAP range is between 3.20 to 4.00 (or 3.50 to 4.00 for earlier batches), would you consider going for honours year to get "more words" in the degree scroll? Or would you just graduate without honours to start work straight away (provided you found a job)?

If no, you'll graduate with:
- Bachelor of Arts (or Bachelor of Arts with Merit) for FASS students, regardless of whether you are in Arts major or Social Sciences Major

- Bachelor of Science (or Bachelor of Science with Merit) for Science students

No major stated on degree scroll for those graduate without honours for FASS or FoS students.

If yes, you'll graduate with:
- Bachelor of Arts <class of honours> in <major>, for FASS students in Arts major (e.g. History, English Literature, etc.)

- Bachelor of Social Sciences <class of honours> in <major>, for FASS students in Social Sciences major (e.g. Economics, Geography, etc.)

- Bachelor of Science <class of honours> in <major>, for Science students

The major will be stated for those graduated with honours.

(P.S. I'm not from FASS or FoS, but curious to know about that.)

I'm an incoming freshman, living in the East. None of my parents had the fortune to study much, but we are pretty comfortable with our finances. I'm socially awkward, and did not want to be pressured to join social activities. With encouragement from my parents, I applied for PGPR, type B (since it's only $200 more for a wash basin), and I received the offer today. It turns out that my Dad initially thought that the fees were for 6 mths, when its only for about 4 mths. And he found it quite expensive. He suggested I stay in my Grandparents house in Queenstown, which is now empty after my Grandma passed away.

The thing is, over the years, I've manage to save about 20k with the intention of paying for 'my first year of uni'. 
I'm not sure what should I do.

I'm exhilarated to be given the opportunity to study what I enjoy. Yet at the same time, I'm panicking about all the what ifs in unchartered territory. I'm just hoping that my passion can take me far enough in the field I chose. The knowledge gained can spur me to go on. And disappointments will remind me of how fortunate I was to be able to get here.

Sorry geeky question: can anyone advice on whether a computing and business double degree is worth it? Know of someone (there are probably others out there) who dropped halfway cause he thought that it's not worth the extra year of studies. Thanks!!

Hi there I'll be doing my honors year this fall and the list of supervisors has just been made available and I'm supposed to contact them and find my FYP group asap since the allocation of project topics is done on a first-come-first-served basis. The thing is I haven't heard back from my internship interview; the interviewer said he would get in touch with me by next week. This is a 6-month internship that I really like and if I make the cut, I'll have to take a leave of absence for the coming semester. Should I approach the profs and would-be groupmates now and apologize to them later if I get the job offer, or should I wait for another week before taking action, even if that means I may end up with a topic that is not of my interest? Would love some advice from you guys, thanks!
-
 
Would somebody give me advice.

Here I am, in a coveted course in the supposed top school in Asia and envied upon by all my childhood friends and relatives as they can't enter a local Uni.

Simultaneously, here I am, evergreen, virgin, having zero confidence when it comes to finding a girlfriend,  feeling severely inadequate about myself when talking about academic achievements, feeling helpless because I try my very best to get second upper honors but it seems extremely unlikely. I have trouble finding a FYP group because I'm not popular and probably everyone thinks I'm not smart enough to join their group. I don't remotely know how am I supposed to get my first job in the future because I have a shitty  resume and poor job/intern experience. I failed to get an internship this summer and this is my last summer before I graduate. I don't have a hobby and I'm not particularly good at anything. I let people use me and don't say anything when they mistreat me, instead choosing to complain silently. I talk to myself all the time about things I should have done differently, but I don't have the courage to do them. I don't even want to start on my family issues.

I REALLY REALLY WANT TO CHANGE MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

Anyone got this email in the NUS webmail from Karthik Venkataraman asking you to click on a link (directed to a non NUS, dubious form) and provide your NUS matric no. and password to update your email account or it would shut down in July?

To , so you are a part of graduating class of 2015 but you are getting Honours with merit? Either OP is darn smart to graduate with honours in three years or he/she is lying. If the former is true then this reduces the population of interest.

Im going to graduate from nus this july. Most of my friends have already landed jobs and are going to start working / or have started working already. On the other hand im still looking for a job that i really want. I really do not want to settle for any other job, but the tight labour market and news of everyone getting jobs is starting to get to me. Sigh #unemploymentwoes

Anyone feeling the same way?

I heard that many years back, NUS degree scroll used to be A3 size. After that, it downsized to A4 size. Is that true?

I'm pretty sure that the degree scroll box presented to to you during the ceremony (which you have to return to them after that, but you can purchase it from a vendor) is not meant for that A4 size certificate.

I have just completed my course, and like many of you will be graduating officially in about 3 weeks. However I confess that none of the submissions which I handed in over the last few years were done by me. They were written by an online essay mill which I always pay to write my essays, and have been getting very good grades for it. Other than the fact I openly committed academic malpractice, which could have gotten me expelled if I had been found out, i got away with it so no worries there, is there anything illegal, in the eyes of the law, about this? As it is, I found out how much these guys were making from writing academic papers, and I am strongly thinking of joining an essay mill for a career in future. I'm really not bothered about the moral or ethical aspects of doing this, and as I am already graduating, I am not bounded by the regulations of NUS anymore, and they cannot "expel" me. However, is this legal? Is it possible for me to get arrested doing something like this? Hopefully the admins of this page will post this, so I know whether it is safe for me to do this, rather than whether I should be doing this from a moral or ethical standpoint. My morals and ethics can be sold for a price. And for the sake of making a comfortable living writing essays at home, I will not hesitate to sell myself in this way. What better way to learn, make money, and relax at home at the same time? 
-
 
I confess that I have never done a single submission on my own throughout my entire time in NUS.  I got away with buying essays from an online essay mill every single time, and doing that helped me get an Honours with merit, while many of my friends who slogged away are only getting lower Honours classifications than I did.  To those wondering, I'm part of the graduating class of 2015.  I challenge you guys to investigate and find out who I am in 3 weeks.  Good luck.  
-
 
Regarding post .  I am the guy who posted it.  Many thanks to Fazli for posting that out.  Yes, they can revoke my degree.  I am totally aware of that.  But like you pointed out yourself, these proceedings can only occur if they happened if I was a student.  However, I am asking if, now that I have graduated, and NUS finds out that I have been writing essays for students, these would not apply to me.  The only one at fault, as i see it, is the student, who is liable to get expelled.  As for me, the only thing I am worried about is whether I will get involved with the law.  If I will not, then all is good.

I need to get this off my chest. Recently I have been enlightened (suddenly and somehow). 

I used to be your typical elistist, even though I vehemently refused to admit it. Having been moulded by Singapore's meritocratic educational system, I developed a mindset that hardwork and excellence in academics will promise me a good life. Being quite academically inclined and industrious by nature, I was the perfect student. No problems with slogging it out and getting amazing grades. Perfect rank points for 'A' Levels, Dean's List, 1st Class Honours, you name it.

Over the years, due to my academic superiority, I developed a mindset that, since I am smarter and more hardworking than most people, I deserved more in life than them. More pay, more opportunities, more benefits. I earned it through my hard work right?

Engineering student here btw. I found out how lucrative the financial industry was (front office ppl making millions?) while engineers are generally paid peanuts. This really pissed me off. Engineering curriculum is so much more rigorous and demanding in both time spent and technical difficulty compared to business school's wayang pesentations and projects. Why did I have to study so hard but earn so little in the future? Life is not fair. Bitter resentment.

Fast forward to current times. I finally understand where I went wrong and why I could never have achieved anything great. It stems from my ARROGANCE. I believed I was entitled to a good future, when actually I am actually entitled to NOTHING. Boom! Revelation.

Once this got past my thick head, I was disgusted with myself. How I viewed people before. People who did not achieve stellar grades. How I put myself above them once I heard their GCE 'A' Level results or their CGPA or their JC or that they were from poly. How I stopped learning anything from them because of a voice in my head saying "you're better than them". Absolutely disgusting. I hate myself.

Our meritocratic educational system may breed this elitism in us and it is such a disgusting and poisonous way of thinking.

Hence, my view of success has changed. Sure, put in the hardwork and effort. That's a given. And add in luck and networking and navigating politics and all the streetsmarts one might have. However, end of the day, nobody owes me anything. Even if I fail, I will accept that in life I am entitled to nothing and roll up my sleeves to try again.

Hello guys. Can I ask what are some of the most effective ways to train abs and core muscles, if any of you have any real life experiences preferably? How about the diet?

Who else thinks that stupid "centre for future ready graduates" sends emails about certain opportunities too damn late. I don't mean jobs, I mean events or activities or competitions. Like some application deadlines will be either over or closing in a few days time. Either I am unaware of another source of info or these future-ready people are too busy unnecessarily renaming themselves instead of applying some logic to their email procedures. 
-
 
 I personally think you're right but then you've gotten it all wrong. It's true that it is easy to say "stay relevant" and "make yourself worth the extra money," but not easy at all to actualise them in reality; to stay relevant and to make yourself worth the extra money. But isn't it precisely so that you should all the more be working harder rather than doubting yourself at this stage? Stay positive and believe in yourself. That makes a lot more difference than we realise. :)

No experience -> no internship -> no experience -> can't find job

I really can't fathom why an internship requires past experience in the first place! Isn't the whole point of an internship to gain some experience before joining the workforce?

I'm from a poor family but eventually ended up in a good university and having a good job offer. It irks me to see people lament about their situation. I worked hard to get to where I am, against the odds, despite the odds, in spite of the odds. I had to work after school on weekdays at my parent's hawker stall while still having to complete my homework on time.

In university, I worked three part-time jobs to make ends meet and pay for my tuition fees without needing to look at my more privileged peers with envious eyes. Because I used my time wisely instead of finding excuses for my situation, I came across good opportunities and made full use of them. I'm thankful for these opportunities and the supportive people I've met along the way.

To those who aren't as well off, never find excuses. Don't think for a single moment that your financial situation dictates your future - that's defeatist mentality. Only you can get your life on the right track. Nobody else can, and nobody else will.

Hi peeps, recently there are many posts about students complaining how they are so disadvantaged in life becaz they are either too poor, get bad grades or cant find a mate as they are too unattractive. Well i hope you guys dont find me mean but as long as u try hard enough, these limitations are only excuses for us to be lazy. I speak from personal experience. Im a engineering dude and i have always been the dumb one in my cliques. Be it sec sch, jc or uni, my results were always worse den my peers even tho i tried harder and studied longer than them. Perhaps my iq is not as high, well, it has never discouraged me and i still work just as hard to this day. Since my grades are poor (barely third class, lowest amongst all my frens), i have to keep up by going for further studies. I have just passed my CFA and managed to convince my company to sponsor my MBA back in Nus due to my good performance. I have also passed my first paper to become a Proffessional Engineer. Doesnt matter if i have lower iq, i will surpass them in educational qualifications anyway. I come from a below average income family, although we have money problems time to time, we are a very bonded and happy family. I know the joy of eating together in hawker, get excited tgt during sales promotion, enjoying a restaurant meal only during special occasions. Because we are not rich we stay home most of the time, and that makes us closely bonded. I do most of the housework and bring my family for outings on weekends. Compared to other rich friends i do not envy them, on fact sometimes i think they envy me for having a poor bu happy family. I may not have been born very good looking, but i hit the gym 3 times a week, did braces and lasik, use cheap but effective hair and skincare products. In the past girls even dont know i exist, but its a different situation now. Well i wouldnt say im very attractive, but i have about 4/5 girls confess to me each year (idk if thats the norm), anw im still single caz of priorities. People say i have good genes, they dont know it was all hard work. All i wanted to say is dont let what you were born with decide who you are. As long as you try hard enough, continously push ur limits, improve yourself every single day, there is no reason u will not succeed. I enjoy pushing myself, seeing the change in me compared to the past, makes me feel so ALIVE! So peeps, always rmb, when there is a will there is a way, its only about how badly you want it. Now get off your lazy asses and start improving!! :D

This is a confession one year late, as that is how long since I left school. 

My school mate (1 year ago) posted his degree with first class honors on his fb page. But I knew he managed so only because he received an A- for his fyp. Truth is, I think his fyp is really mediocre, and the prof only gave him a A- so as to not dash his first class dreams.

As i look back at the life i led for the past 2 decades, i realise i haven't done anything great or outstanding. I have spent my whole life studying, pursuing a piece of paper called degree. To be very frank, i have no idea what i am doing and is just following what others are doing to be deemed normal. I always heard people saying that we should follow our passion etc. But this is usually the case for people that come from a stable family because when they fail, at least they have their family to back up on. Coming from a not so well-to-do family, everything is fake without money. Thanks for listening to my rant.

It was like, last semester, and I was taking this materials TE. I managed to do the calculations very quickly, but there was this professor, who said to me, "You are just a good computer". Throughout the module, he actually made the effort to reach out to us, to teach us.

It changes things; one being the fact that I worked harder to understand the subject better, the reasonings and phenomenons that happened. I was motivated to actually become a better student, to seek clearer understanding, rather than simply do calculations.

This is a very late one, but thank you, Prof Duong, it was an honour to have been your student.
-
 
If I have a mind to become a professor eventually, do I need extremely good grades for that (ie >4.5 CAP) or is >4.0 sufficient. Or is experience (in research work) much more important than grades. I'm a psych major

To 

No idea why people are bashing the OP for wanting to get past the B+ barrier. If you think constantly getting a B+ is considered good to you, it is not to OP and probably to many others.

Most undergrads would at least aim for 2nd upper, and some good companies only even grant interviews to those that at 2nd upper or first class, so it's perfectly normal to want to at least start getting A- and above. 

If you are constantly stuck on B+ then u should probably review the way you are learning or preparing for exams. (Or maybe grasp concepts better? Ask your friends who are scoring well how they do it?) Once you find out what works for you then u will be able to get past that (mental) barrier. 

And once you get your first A-/A/A+ then more will follow. Otherwise you will be living on the edge and probably not make it to 2nd Upper.
-
 
to  and all others complaining about "mediocre" grades. the reality is that A/A+ or maybe even A- is used to distinguish those who are really good at the module (maybe a handful because of good luck or other means) from those who are well, average. how meaningless would the A be if everybody got one? I'm sure you wouldn't be happy with the A or A- if you knew everybody else had at least one too.

many people asking for advice say "don't give me general advice", but really, there is very little way to get around getting "mediocre" grades unless you really study damn hard (at the expense of social life, health etc.) or you change major.

so the thing is, stop asking people how to get better grades, unless you're honestly asking for very specific advice from seniors for a specific module. you can complain, sure, but asking for advice on how to improve generically is quite useless because you probably know it yourself already.

To  Local banks right? Grades don't maketh a man. 
-
 
A couple of banks I've applied for seem to have a preference for first-class folks. Seriously, how many people students graduate with a first class? 
-
 
Is it really true that top 10% is A+/A, top 15% is A-, the 20 to 45% is B+ and so on? I thought A- stretch till top 25%? If no, what is the grade typically for the 75th percentile? I thought 75th percentile means top 25%, and thus an A-. Or these are subjective depending on the type of modules? 
-
 
I apologized for earlier few posts which I didn't give any citation.

Here is one of my favorite notes that I kept.

http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."

Sometimes students over-planned their modules and not let serendipity/randomness/uncertainty/convexity/chaos takes over.

 It’s commonly believed that engineers dominate Silicon Valley and that there is a correlation between the capacity for innovation and an education in mathematics and the sciences. Both assumptions are false.

My research team at Duke and Harvard surveyed 652 U.S.-born chief executive officers and heads of product engineering at 502 technology companies. We found that they tended to be highly educated: 92 percent held bachelor’s degrees, and 47 percent held higher degrees. But only 37 percent held degrees in engineering or computer technology, and just two percent held them in mathematics. The rest have degrees in fields as diverse as business, accounting, finance, health care, and arts and the humanities.

Gaining a degree made a big difference in the sales and employment of the company that a founder started. But the field that the degree was in and the school that it was obtained from were not a significant factor.

Over the past year, I have interviewed the founders of more than 200 Silicon Valley start-ups. The most common traits I have observed are a passion to change the world and the confidence to defy the odds and succeed.

It is the same in business. In the two companies I founded, I was involved in hiring more than 1000 workers over the years. I never observed a correlation between the school of graduation or field of study, on one hand, and success in the workplace, on the other. What make people successful are their motivation, drive, and ability to learn from mistakes, and how hard they work.

And then there is the matter of design. Steve Jobs taught the world that good engineering is important but that what matters the most is good design. You can teach artists how to use software and graphics tools, but it’s much harder to turn engineers into artists.

Our society needs liberal-arts majors as much as it does engineers and scientists.

After working hard throughout the degree programme.. I realise....

Class honors doesn't make a huge difference if don't work at govt sector :/

Private sector (SMEs or MNCs) doesn't even bother with your class honors 

Saw some friends with 2nd lower grades getting higher remuneration package than 2nd upper grades students :/

I'm doing my internship now at a big firm and I worked really hard to get here, but now I realised it's far from what I thought I wanted. I crossed majors and industries to a traditionally known "lucrative" industry (you all would have guessed easily) but realised that upon getting in, the job satisfaction is just not there- for multiple reasons ranging from the company's processes to products, people etc. those who have worked at MNCs might understand. I know that there's nothing to be done now that I'm already in it, sunk cost right? But it makes me wonder, and worried about finding a job I love after I graduate. Are all big companies compartmentalized and filled with processes you can't make sense of or change? Is office politics unavoidable? I feel like I've spent so much time on self improvement and bettering my grades for nothing. They say a first class and work experience will get you a fairly good job, but how on earth do I find one that I will thrive in and enjoy??? On a side note, I miss NUS a lot, please treasure your time here if you have a couple more years!! Wish I could go back and do it all over again, but spend more time making friends instead of mugging so hard :(

Hi all I've just received my A level results this year (currently in BMT) and I've been thinking for quite some time but I'm still not too sure whether to pursue Math or Applied Math.

Those people who keep advertising their money schemes, endowment plans, "retire before 65" insurance and especially MLM-marketing, please kindly show us your full finances disclosure and don't talk so loud until you are 65 and long retired.

Not to mention, you are totally misplaced in this job since you picked a person poor as fuck as me.

I just graduated and I feel like I want to do a bunch of things. Is it okay if I just take on plenty of part time jobs to be exposed to everything, or should I settle down with a proper full time job? Though if I choose to do the former, some people be like "but you graduated with a degree, you're wasting time earning less with part time jobs, opportunity cost yo". But tbh it's not like a full time job with my degree can earn much also. Any advice?

Hey all, this is Colin again, one of SoC's evil profs. ;)

CS3216 AY2015/2016, Semester 1 Call for Registration 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you ever:

Had a great app idea and wished there was a course in NUS that would help you make it a reality?

Looked at the tedious tasks that you have to do, and wished there was a better way to do it?

Looked at the ills that plague society, and wished that you could do something about it?

Looked at the latest cool game on the latest cool social media site and said “I wish it did this and that?”

If you have, now is the chance for you to do something about it and make a difference!

CS3216 Software Development on Evolving Platforms is a cool, unconventional look at engineering software solutions on important, fast evolving environments like Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Apps.

This course is all about getting you to dream big - and much more importantly - to bring those dreams to life! Games, social collaborations, things to make life better for one and all - if you can imagine it, you will get more than a very decent crack at getting it done in this course.

Enrolment is open to students of all faculties and students will work in small inter-disciplinary teams to create their killer applications. A typical team consists of:

a. Two programmers, usually one to program the “front end” of the application that interacts with users, and one to program the “back end” that does all the behind-the-scenes work. An application that doesn’t work is useless.
REMEMBER: IMPLEMENTATION COUNTS!

b. A designer, whose role is to make the front end as attractive and usable as possible. An application that is ugly and unusable is useless.
REMEMBER: COOLNESS COUNTS!

c. A business person, whose role is to ensure that there is a demand for the application, and to market the application to potential users. An application with no users is useless.
REMEMBER: REAL WORLD USAGE COUNTS!

So as you can see, CS3216 is not just for programmers. It’s also for anyone who has a good eye for design and a good head for business. Implementation, coolness and real-world usage are all equally important.

Classes will be held on Monday evenings from 6.30 to 8.30 pm.

Assessment will be project-based and there will be no examination component. The course will begin with several lectures on the fundamentals of web development. Subsequently, students will work in teams to analyze and critique existing Facebook apps There will be two semi-structured assignments: one on Facebook and one HTML5.

For the Final Project, students are free to propose anything they think is "cool" and they will not be limited to Facebook (though some form of network-based/web application is expected).

Students are also welcome and encouraged to use this opportunity to develop applications that have commercial potential or can be used as entries to Startup@Singapore.

Places for the course will be limited, and are open to both SoC and non-SoC students. Also, like in past years, the places will not be assigned by CORS bidding. This module is not open to S/U option, and therefore we regrettably cannot extend it to exchange students.

Instead, interested students are to submit:

i. A personal statement (with their matriculation number clearly stated). More details of what is expected in the personal statements can be found below.
ii. Their latest academic transcripts

To cs3216-staff@googlegroups.com<mailto:cs3216-staff@googlegroups.com> by Wednesday 15 July 2015 5 pm.

Students will be informed by 19 July 2015 if they are offered a place in the upcoming offering of the new course (and students will automatically be pre-registered for CS3216 on CORS if their bid to take the class is successful).
The personal statement should address the following questions:

§ Why do you want to take the module? 

§ Describe your background and explain how do you think you can contribute to the diversity and vibrancy of the module and to the team projects. 

§ EITHER (i) Describe a cool Facebook app that you *really* want to build. Explain why you think your app is really cool; OR (ii) Describe a business/project that you want to start. Explain how you think taking CS3216 will help you.

Students should probably throw in a resume or portfolio of sorts if they feel that it would be helpful in demonstrating that they have what it takes to succeed in this course.

Students who want to be considered for the class as designers should most definitely submit a portfolio of their artistic works as well.
To learn more, check out the blogs from last year - http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs3216/blogs.html, and the Facebook group at http://www.facebook.com/groups/cs3216/

This is your chance to let your imagination run wild and do something cool Questions? Please send email to cs3216-staff@googlegroups.com<mailto:cs3216-staff@googlegroups.com>.

I have a few questions regarding sep...
Yr2 science student next acad year. Is cap 3.7 good enough for sep to uk? im thinking of UCL currently but if i dont get ucl, other uk unis are fine.. 

Also, which cap do they look at to assess sep? the one at the end of year 1 or year2sem1? 

when you put the 3 uni choices, do you have to state which sem you want to go in? which sem is easier to get into? is sem1 exchange harder to get into than sem2 since some people may want to graduate in y3s2 and cant go for exchange in sem2... 

also, some people mention that not going for sep can save your cap.. is it really true? like if the smarter ones with higher cap go on exchange, the bellcurve will be less steep? 
-
 
Is SEP really all it's cracked up to be? I know many seniors who rave that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and my friends are all keen to apply as well. However, the cost is really high and there's the risk of not mapping modules properly. I'm going to work and save as much as I can for the trip, but I will still need help from my parents and I don't want to waste their hard-earned money. Do you really lose out by staying in SG for all 3/4 years of uni?

Hi, I have a question about CAP calculation. Seniors and friends tell me that it gets harder to pull up one's CAP in later semesters because higher-level core modules are more difficult. This I can understand, but some also mentioned reasons like our CAP becoming more "stable" when we complete more MCs, so S/U results in a less effective increase (than if you S/U earlier on in Year 1/2). Is there any truth to this? Thanks.

I have recently received an email on my NUS account from another student. However, the content of the email was a very long and elaborate rambling that in summary has to do with contacting a certain person and forwarding the mail I received in order to obtain a large sum of money. To investigate this, I created a fake email and contacted the person. He replied with another elaborate and detailed exposition about donating money and helping others and blah blah and requested personal details such as name, age, address and even a scanned ID card.

I am 99.9% certain that this is a scam. Question is: how do I report this and who do I report it to? I received it on my nus email from another student so I'm worried others may be scammed or that person may have gotten his account hacked or something? Please advise!

Hi dear friends of NUSWhispers, I'm a year 2 chemical engineering student going to be year 3 next semester. I'm really losing interest in studying chemical engineering and am considering changing major to social work. Is it possible for me to make the switch now? If yes, would I completely reset my study in NUS or would it just be a transfer of all my engineering mods to UE/Breadths when I move over to FASS? Wondering if anyone else did something similar (changing major after 2 years in NUS)? Really appreciate any kind souls who have answers to my questions!

Anyone here plays Hold'em Poker? Ever since the Remote Gambling Act is put in place which bans anyone from Singapore to play online poker, I find it hard to find to satisfy my gambling needs. As a Singaporean, paying $100 entry fee for our local casino is simply not a viable option for me. 

So, is there anyone who is in a similar plight as me? Fairly good online poker player earning enough for pocket money in school but held back with this law?

There is one issue that has been bothering me quite a bit, but I have absolutely no clue on solving it. After all, this is not the engineer's problem where one can run Autodesk/MATLAB to simulate, or the business problem of writing a strategy, or the scientist's problem where theoretical work does the trick. It's called a BGR problem.

Once again I am deeply misunderstood on this. I don't know how to surprise the other half. Neither do I know how to love. I have tried all sorts of tricks in the book ranging from flowers to folding cranes to accumulating a bottle worth of saga seeds (thanks saga tree in school many years ago). Yet, in the pursuit it turns out to be but a zero ROI (return on investment).

In the past I would try quite a bit, but today I've all but given up. It's too tiring to chase. More likely, though, the repertoire of tricks up my sleeve are not quite the right tricks. I tried to sound witty and people say I'm "out of league". I tried to crack jokes, but people felt more crippled due to the lameness of them all. Let's see... I tried to help pave the way for previous crushes before by trying to give her a stake in projects I ran. I mean, nevermind whether these are even the right strategies, but I definitely tried.

Today, however, I am extremely undecided in life on this. When people actually ask me if I have an other half, I now wonder if I actually am looking for an other half. I feel defeated, but I've little idea if it's a mental block, or just a rational calculation that a zero ROI is not worth playing in favour of other projects with better ROI.

So some people tell me to be myself. But what if I believe part of my personality to be polymorphic? I mean, being myself is not a difficult aspect if every parameter about me is well-defined, but what if I adapt to changing circumstances ever so often? For instance, the topics I enjoy speaking about change with changing audiences. I won't try speaking about nice hotels to someone who doesn't care about opulence, just as I won't try to go into technical subject matter like how trains work to someone who doesn't really enjoy engineering subject matter. I can even say I can try speaking about anything and everything, just not quite in the way that the other party would expect.

The pragmatic side of me, however, realises that living alone in old age is quite a terrible idea and is not exactly worth entertaining. Imagine losing one's mental faculties and not having someone around you to help.

Current CS student here. Is it terrible that I don't aim to be a CEO, CTO, CFO or... a UFO? I've a badass portfolio and my university results are nothing short of stellar. But I'm content just by being a dude with regular working hours and earning enough for myself and my mother — a single mum. (Love you, Ma, you look great in pink!)

I don't plan on marrying since that isn't an option available to me considering that I'm gay. So I'm not worried about paying off housing loans or having enough to send my (imaginary) kids to school. I've simple tastes in life too. I'm just so easily satisfied. I don't have to eat at fancy restaurants; hawker food is fine with me.

When I tell my friends this (both from CS and biz), they are shocked and then tell me, "Eh, can you have more ambition? Your results are so good, why are you not driven?!" To that, I always say that my motivation in life is not money... but contentment. I tell them not to worry about me because I truly believe that I will be okay. That the world and my life will still go on even if I'm not paid as well or if I don't end up as a CTO or something. 

I just have different priorities in life... Why do people feel like they need to put people in boxes and tell them that my ambition is not as worthy as theirs? I'm not even telling their pursuit is unworthy... >_<;

Post  and , seems to suggest some contradictory opinion to LSM modes of assessment. There is some truth to each of these posts. 

 is right in saying that LSM exams with high MCQ weightage tend to test minor details. For instance, LSM1104, LSM2101 CAs, LSM2251 finals MCQs, LSM3212 finals MCQs may test memory based details which people sometimes ignored. These modules tend to have steeper bell curve overall due to a large weightage of MCQs (40% or more) based on facts.

 is correct in saying that profs set challenging finals to differentiate the good from the average. However this may be subjective depending on what module is it. There are again some LSM modules with less challenging finals as they are all MCQs testing a lot on facts. The only example of finals MCQs which test application would probably be LSM1102 for instance and MCQs involving such applications tend to have less steep bell curve and can be scored if you know exactly how to work things out. Other than a few exceptions, it seems quite obvious that most MCQs papers test less on application and even if there is, its not as hardcore compared to many written papers whereby you must rationalise and work things out from scratch. I suppose OP of  is both good in application and getting contents into his/her head?

I heard people who really did well in many LSM modules really worked their socks off. I've seen how they put in a lot of effort into knowing the details of the notes. For instance a course mate i know who was very hardworking and one week before finals, she slept only 2h per day to mug and of course she did exceptionally well.

It appears that if you want to do very well for most LSM modules, you not only must be good in application, you must be prepared to put in a lot of effort into knowing your contents inside out. 

Generally in my case, i felt that i tend to do better in application but given that i am quite absent minded, many times i forgot some important facts and thus i depended heavily on rationalising, which in MCQs don't help much if its a either you know or you dont know kind. Overall, knowing very well how to apply help you do well in some LSM modules such as LSM2103, LSM1102, but it won't make you the best in many LSM modules if you are the forgetful kind and your modules happen to be those with many facts based questions. To be among the best in most LSM modules, you must be BOTH good in applying and memorising. Thus when school starts, i will try to review my lecture notes every now and then instead of throwing it one side once lexture is over and then going back to it again when there's an upcoming test. I shall see if this improve my memory somehow and increase my chances of doing well in future MCQs tests:/

All in all, in your 3rd year, choose modules with higher weightage of what you think is your strength (whether its MCQs, SAQ, essays), although its easier said than done given that the module which suit your strength may not necessarily be the most interesting module in your opinion..

I am looking for a job with a decentralised organisational structure where opinions of employees from a lower part of the hierarchy is valued.

I graduated from NUS with a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2014 and have been working at a MNC for almost a year now. 

However I feel that I am not able to realize my full potential due to corporate red tape and wish to transition into a smaller startup-like environment.

Would love to hear from anyone who has gone through such a transition or any specific advice you have for me.
-
 
Dear , I agree with you that LSM modules with a high weightage of MCQ tend to test minor details that are usually not explicitly stated in the lecture notes and at best only briefly mentioned by the profs in lectures. These are the questions that separate the above average scorers from the average scores. The problem with such MCQ tests is that it rewards students who know information and details of the topics instead of students who have a strong understanding of the topic and application skills. I don't really have any tips on how to do well in such tests.

Nevertheless, life sciences is an interesting and fun major and if you can get past these modules without your CAP suffering too much you will enjoy your time in NUS.
-
 
In response to , as a year 2 senior going into year 3, I would agree to the comment that things are not meant to be easy since we are one of the top few unis. However, I believe that exam questions don't need to be made easier, but the bell curve can be made less steep by having lower weightage of MCQs (30%) and 70% for SAQs and essay, just like the A levels. 

In fact, I actually thought that some profs purposely want to have more MCQs in LSM modules so they don't have to read long winded answers that students gave. A few times I heard LSM profs complaining that students do not answer to the point in written papers and they tend to beat around the bush. Thus to make life easier for them but harder for us due to the steeper bell curve, they would of course be happy to give us MCQs since it's the machine marking it. Maths and chem papers on the other hand, dont usually have cases of students giving long winded answers because those questions is either you get the correct workings and final answer or not, which is easier to mark compared to LSM answer which students may write very long, hoping to hit the points somewhere but causing much pain to the reader.

You see the reason why they don't want to give past years papers for LSM, unlike for chemistry/physics/math so/stats papers? Well, that's because they would soon run out of questions to set and they do not have the time to create whole new set of MCQs for the new batch but for chem/physics/math/stats, it's very easy to change the questions as these are all applied questions whereas LSM is very focused on how much you know/remember the content.

Remember that in Uni, your prof are not like your high school teachers whose main role is teaching. The prof not only teach, they conduct research and have other activities too, thus they don't have a lot of time to read every single students' long answers.

Does fellow seniors agree on this? I hope this answers your questions on why in Uni, we don't usually encounter a lot of written papers in LSM modules
-
 
Took a few easy but steep bellcurve modules last sem and it killed my cap... Can anyone recommend modules that has a reasonable bellcurve, not too easy (content wise) that one can score in if they work very hard? It can be anything, breadth or gem... (not ss though LOL) 
-
 
I'm on the right tail of the bellcurve in LS. Saying that LSM MCQs that test minor details are the ones that distinguish between average and high scorers in LS is inaccurate. From what I've seen, these kind of questions predominate for maybe only 10% of LS modules, particularly those taught by lazy profs who cannot be bothered to set applicational questions. There are in fact a mix of LS modules with MCQ finals, including open-book ones for which application is the priority. Also, based on my observation, questions that are purely regurgitation-based are usually answerable by 80% of students; papers that have a majority of these kind of questions will usually have an extremely steep bellcurve, and are usually CA papers. Thankfully, profs will put more effort into setting challenging questions in finals, for which the same information memorized by many students will be tested for application. As you will find out, these questions can be very challenging to solve despite revolving around basic concepts and information. 

Yes, many of your LS seniors will lament to you that the bellcurve is steep bla bla you must remember many minor details etc. But realise that many of them are not actually high scorers and might not actually know what is wrong with they way they are studying that is impeding them from getting an A. As they are many types of LS modules with many different modes of assessment and focus, my best general advice to you is this: if you haven't, learn to love the subject and study it as you would as a budding scientist. For every new concept that you learn, question it, and think about how it links back to what you have learnt previously. Think about what implications it has. Keep thinking, keep questioning. Be curious. Be consistent. For example, when you learn about signaling pathways leading to Cancer. Memorizing the pathway alone will not get you anywhere. But questioning the implications of the pathway, why one protein activation/inactivation will lead to another, what will happen when each one of the components of the pathway is compromised - these will help you ahead of the race. Hope this helps.

Hi guys, I'm a incoming year one intending to major in life sciences. I have been hearing from seniors that LSM modules, especially those with high weightage of MCQ tests/exams, the bell curve gets horrendously steep sometimes  (eg average can be 70 or 80%) and it is very difficult to go way beyond the average unless you can remember things super well. For instance, LSM MCQs test not just the concepts, but a number of questions may also come in the form of remembering the exact minor details in the notes. Is this true? 

How would you all get practice questions for MCQs that is very similar to the standard of NUS LSM exams? The recommended textbooks by seniors have mainly written questions but not so much MCQs in general.

Generally I can remember and apply concepts well but somehow, some important details always slipped my mind so this means I tend to do better in written papers where all I have to do is to try and rationalise whereas sometimes in MCQs, it's either you know or you don't know the facts. 

Some seniors suggested the elimination method but from the previous experiences in high school, elimination usually left me with 2 choices, meaning I had 50% chance of getting the questions correct but this method doesn't work too well as the 2 choices remaining doesn't trigger my memory in either way.

Sorry for the long post but I'm indeed worried that MCQ papers might pull down my grades. Can any life science seniors offer some tips on how to do well in MCQs tests for LSM modules please? Thanks in advance!

 Thanks for the responses. To those who suggested that I try playing dota to understand the game more, I would like to add that I did indeed do that. Also, when TI4 was all the hype, I caught up on game replays, learnt how different heroes were selected for different positions and even read up on the famous players and teams (think arteezy or even new teams like secret). I was all excited to learn about his interest. Now, more than a year later, I think it's gone overboard. 

Leaving him is one of the last options on my mind, but now that it's been mentioned, I'll consider it. Thanks again guys. This was the last thing I wanted to do though.

Hi, I'm a CS student entering year 3. Any advice with regards to choosing a specialization to take up? I have taken all of the 2000 foundation modules with the exception of CS2104 and CS2107; CS2107 which I'm going to take on in ST2. Particularly, I'm interested in Algorithms and Networking. However, I just managed an average for those foundation modules. I understand that grades should not be an indication that you will do well in those field. But, between what you think you are interested in and what you think you will do well, which one should I choose?

Any sincere advice would be appreciated, thanks (:

Hi! I have a question, does anybody know how to report a scam to NUS? I received an email about an old couple received a jackpot in the UK (the story is true) from one of the NUS student (that I don't recognize). The couple want to give some of their winning to random people (based on the email).
S/he asked me to write an email to certain email which I can't verify. I hope this is clearly a scam (If not, goodbye my easy money). So my question is, how can I report this to NUS, so that no one fall to this "scam" (I still believe it is a scam)? 
Has anybody received the same email as me?
Thank you!

@ 

I'll offer you the flipside to consider, then. Would you be happy without a degree? There's nothing stopping you from pursuing a career that requires you to work without paper qualifications, and if your career path is aligned with that course of action, go ahead. I have a friend who's absolutely killing it at AIA as an insurance agent after he came out of NS, and he doesn't give a shit about having screwed up his A levels, because he's on the fast track to being groomed for higher positions.

So, again. Will you be happy without a degree? If so, save yourself the money, save yourself the time, and withdraw.

But if you know that getting a degree will be valuable to you - and it can be, beyond the value of your qualifications alone (networking, being with friends, having a 'break' before you re-enter the corporate world) - then you already know the reason why you're doing your degree. Stop doubting yourself, and just do what you have to do.

P.S - Honours (4 years) not necessary for most courses, yes? You can just do 3 years and cut loose if that suits you better.

I was approached in a local bookstore by a MLM minion. He thought I should meet his mentor who is interested in intellectual arguments.

But the meeting turned out to be a MLM seminar. Not only that, the mentor asked what degree I am taking. When I replied that I am studying in FASS. He started using some salesman intimidating technique by criticising my decision as financially irresponsible. Then he added that I should have studied Business, Accounting or Computer Science for financial reason.

He dissuaded me to invest in the financial market because of my lack of capital. At the end, he started to ask me to sell his company's products to all my friends and relatives.

I once read an old man who taught me about recognising charlatans. These “…charlatans are recognizable in that they will only give you positive advise, and only positive advise…”. And also "If you see fraud and don't shout fraud, you are a fraud".

Hence the post to warn others.

Amidst all the furore between biz/computing/engineering students; allow me, a year 6 biz student (i've graduated two years ago) to share my 2 cents on this; because really, to all you high and mighty biz kids out there; prepare to take an ego trampling when you step into the working world:

I graduated biz with a second upper honours and was lucky enough to find a job as an equity analyst at one of the multinational investment banks. And as you would expect, such news was met with congratulations by friends and relatives alike, who were all too happy to "catch up with me" seeing my would be status as a potential millionaire/successful businessman or what not. I would not deny that I was possessed by such hubris too, after all, how many fresh undergraduates can boast of a near six figure starting salary?

That was until work began. For all of you biz students boasting about your awesome, fun filled internships this summer and impatiently waiting for your graduation so you can work for your "dream" company, you are certainly not wrong; not entirely anyway. Because this great, fun-filled and cheerful "dream company" that you are interning at is just that, a dream. As an analyst, my job scope involved plenty of things that you would never guess an analyst would do; endless administrative work from your higher ups who "need your help", churning out dozens of decks and reports that have been requested by VPs and associates only to have them never been used or even read; and the list goes on. Oh, and work life balance? Please forget about that; you aren't being paid a fat salary so you can be a normal 9 to 6 white collar executive; you are here to be milked so that every cent the bank puts into you is paid off exponentially (oh come on, do you really think the bank did not calculate its ROI when it decided to pay you that six figure salary?) Weekends do not stay sacred either; for there is always that "urgent" report or presentation that your boss "needs your help with". 

You might be thinking now: Well, my internship was nothing like that! And well, sorry to give you a rude shock but your internship was merely the honey coated bait that many MNCs give to young, naive undergraduates who eagerly bite onto it thinking that they have been given the opportunity of their lifetime. There is a reason why industry turnover in investment banking is higher than the sales turnover at FMCGs; and that's why these banks are dangling such attractive internships in order to attract a new batch of undergraduates to suck dry. 

I am guessing your next point would be "but you get buckets of money!"; but well, what is the point of having a fat balance sitting in your bank account if you only have one day a week to spend it (in actual fact, that one day is often spent in bed and becoming a unmovable union with your couch). And of course, for those truly savvy finance students out there, you probably realized that your six figure salary divided by your hundred hour long work week is only a fraction of a bit higher than your friends in other lower paying MNCs; except that they get to keep their hair and figure for a decade or two longer than you.

I won't appeal to the idealistic view of how bankers don't contribute much to the world compared to teachers/programmers/engineers and whatnot, because really, at the end of the day, the number of zeroes in your paycheck really does matter. But I will assure you this, you sure as hell won't take pride in your work as any of these other professionals would.

I writing this because it has been leaving me in a funk for weeks now. Maybe I'll get some decent advice here, but I just want to get this off my chest.

I applied to utown this year. For simplicity, i'll call them 1,2,3,4

I applied directly to 3. A few weeks after the interview, I received an email from them stating I was put on their reserve list. I was broken.

A. I should send them an appeal ? OR B. Wait endlessly in misery because they obviously already have too many applicants and don't want another student do doesn't understand the meaning of "evaluated your application with considerable care" and "appreciate your time and effort in submitting your application"?

Being treated like dispensable, replaceable and unintelligent enough is just the greatest feeling in the world. Of course you could say this is life. Job markets are like this too, if not worse.

Since then, I felt like I went through the 5 stages of grief. 夸张 right?
At times I would almost breakdown into tears or just stone in silence for who knows how long. Hair loss like when I was studying for 'A's. Short-temperedness...
I haven't been fair to my family members as I've more often then not taken out my frustrations on them for minor things.
Why have I become like this? I hate the state I'm in now. I writing this past midnight because I can't seem to fall asleep with all these thoughts in my mind, as per the past weeks. I hope I get over this very soon. I could look for alternatives, but we all know what's left. Since my application was for this year, I'm not allowed to apply for rvrc anymore. Halls? It's seriously like comparing vegetables to meat. Both foods but different content, and I would say I'm a vegetarian. pgp? considered. I stay in Tampines so I really want to avoid travelling unnecessarily.

I put a great deal of effort into preparing for the interview. Even though my answers were 'politically correct', they represent my honest views. So what's wrong if I didn't have any questions left to ask, since I cleared them through open day, self-research, and checking with friends. It was obvious others came to wing it. Maybe the reason I got so upset was because I sold myself the idea of utown life since after 'A's. Of course I knew that nothing was guaranteed and I was facing stiff competition. I'm not just looking for a place to stay. I imagined (keyword) life there, what activities I would take up, stuff I would participate in, stuff I'll lament... to minute things such as how I would deal with travelling to my faculty, time to wake up, room arrangement, which slipper to bring... etc. This may sound insane to you, but I like to have things planned out, at least in my head. I told someone once that I would be happier getting into 3 than my actual course. Another prime reason would be that I wouldn't be able to face my friends overall and we'll definitely grow foreign. Most of them are in 1 and 2. Why was I so stupid to not apply to those??? What mattered to me was that being an INTJ, I could make a difference not by being the loudest, but through making small ernest contributions. (then again, I don't need a 2 year programme and a ginormous hostel bill to achieve that and acquire out-off-class knowledge such as humility, civic-mindedness, volunteerism?) I enjoy listening to arguments and formulating opinions. So I often over-think things.

Even when I got rejected from my scholarship application the following day from their interview, I was upset for a couple of days tops.
More rants...
They could at least on request let applicants know what they lacked in. You could say I lack EQ, IQ or both. I already have an inferiority complex, no worries.
I just don't understand why I'm still that upset.

More than anything, I just want to get some closure on this issue and apologize to my family for being a less-than-desirable next-of-kin these past few weeks.

Thanks for reading all my contrived thoughts all the way if you did. Enlightenment and my sanity back ... hopefully.

P.S. a different from the usual love, CAP, marriage, moral conduct, faculty vs faculty topics?

P.S.S. don't bother telling me to get psychiatric help

Hello everyone. I just wish to offer an alternative view on the idea of grades that may be discomforting to some. Also, as someone who have just graduated, i wish to offer some of my personal tips that may be useful to some of you. 

Now grades. Recently i seen some posts saying that grades do not matter. Now here is the part where i am going against the grain here. Grades do matter. I suspect it is just a coping mechanism for those who did not do well. In fact, that is what i always personally tell myself when i didn't do well for my exams. Have you ever heard of anybody who has done well saying "Grades don't matter"?  Grades do matter because they are an indicator of how well you have understood the course(though i understand this is an imperfect measure, i am sure someone will rebut me that some courses are a test of memory capacity and i would have no defence against that). Grades count into your final class of honours and they shows up on your transcript. Thus it would be complete hyperbole to say that Grades do not matter. This leads me to my next point. It would also be frankly depressing if grades are the only thing in your life.

 It honestly frightens me to see people seeing things only in black and white. It seems to me from the posts so far that grades are either the most important things in academic life or they are completely useless. It is not some kind of ZERO-SUM game. I thought our university education would have taught us that. I would say it again, Grades are important but here is the caveat. They are not the end-all of your university life. There are other important things as well. These important things are but not listed in order of merit, your family, your friends, your hobbies, your own experience in growing up to be an adult and understanding the world at large. Maybe you didn't so well this time but don't tell yourself that grades doesn't matter. Come back next semester and try again. Working hard on your studies and learning what makes you tick is also what university is all about. For the holidays, go on an internship, go network with people, go on a trip to discover the world, build closer ties with your friends and family or just plain take a good break from the studies and engage in your favorite hobbies.

Like it or not, Grades are a part of you but so are all the things i mentioned above.  For me, grades were always an interesting challenge every semester. I try to do the best i can, see what the results are. Cry or celebration, life moves on. I get crazy happy with a A- and i go crazy sad with a C+ but at the end of the day, i move on and look forward to the next semester. I don't make it an obsession and you should not too, for your own health sake. Just don't completely discard it and just go YOLO. 

Now then, the personal tips. I termed this as the Holy Trinity framework for your university end-game which is to find a job. (Now there will be people who will disagree with this end-goal because it goes against the whole idea of education for knowledge but hey some of us have families to feed) The Holy Trinity are as follows: Grades, Internships/Work Experiences, SEP/CCA/Volunteerism. You should at least have 2 of the three. This links to my above points. IF your grades are not that good and you have a realistic forecast of your future grades and you don't think it will get any better, then just work hard on maintaining the status quo and work on getting into internships that will either broaden your skillset and technical skills or in an industry in which you have interest in. Hopefully, you are also part of a CCA or a club. Not only does it gives you networking opportunities (and of course awesome friends:)), it also allows you to highlight any non academical skills you have. Perhaps you have a leadership role in the CCA or you engaged in a project that was innovative. All these are signals to your employers of your capabilities. It shows the employer that even though your results are not that good, you work hard on making sure that you make up for it. That is why i advise not to YOLO your grades because employers may ask about your grades and are you going to  answer that " Oh yea, my grades doesn't matter haha". You better make sure you got some damn credible achievements if you are going to say that. Before i end this paragraph, i want to say DON'T UNDERESTIMATE the POWER of NETWORKING. It seriously opens doors that are shut for others. I would even say networking is even more important than grades.

Another thing. SEP. Please Please Please if you can afford it. Please go for SEP. And i would actually say that if you can, avoid going to places with a lot of fellow singaporean students. Why? Because you wont be truly exposed to a foreign culture. Chances are you will just form a Singaporean clique overseas. Just as our PRC students form their own PRC clique here in NUS. It is one in a lifetime experience(unless you are doing further studies) and i rather that the experience to be something you cannot get here. Go mingle with the locals, do things that you would never have done in Singapore. Make some great foreign friends. Gain a new perspective. 

Enjoy your holidays, people:)

Ok one more internship confession coming up hot. Stop reading if you have had enough of these. 
I joined an internship hoping to learn new skills. Not to do donkeys work, and that too - important donkeys work. Tasks i am given are important and not to be messed up - hence they are given to me. If there is anything to be answered to: they say "This was prepared by an intern from NUS". (ie "don't blame me, the busy manager")
Are people really so resentful of this institution we struggled to get into and survive in ? 
-
 
To , will you share some details, please? Like , I have submitted an exam result review, but just got a negative reply... I don't mean to sound pompous, but I really don't think I deserve a C+ grade for a particular module. It is also my last semester (and I cannot take special sem or anything). Thank you. 

To , did you get any news? Good luck!

University is a different ball game altogether. The Bellcurve doesn't favor mediocrity; you have to be a true frontrunner in your course to consistently get an A across your modules. So just because you scrapped a few As in your A levels, or are on some prestigious scholarship, it doesn't automatically mean you'll do well, simply because A levels does not favor excellence in a single field, it favors all-roundedness (and it's also way easier than Uni content). In fact I have more than one friend who got straight As for A levels but are now struggling to get into honors. 

Also, there is now a different standard of what is considered excellent because of the gradeless sem. CAP 5 was godly because we didn't have gradeless sem.

I just finished year 3 and have a CAP of 3.85. Like every grade-conscious student, I hope to get at least second-upper when I graduate. With just 2 semesters left, I don't know if this hope is still reasonable.

Is a second-upper that much advantageous over a second-lower? I know there is some difference in pay for civil servants but does this still matter for civil-service jobs after my first job? Do companies discriminate between a 2:1 and 2:2 in practice?

What percentage of NUS graduates actually obtain at least second-upper? I can't seem to locate this information. All my peers have >4.0 and I feel so inadequate and below average.
-
 
Looking at , , , ,  , and , let me offer my two cents on the cause of this business-engineer divide.

As a recent grad of NUS Business bootstrapping an eccomerce startup, when I approached some of Computing friends to help set up the business, I'm shocked that many of them don't have the skills to create a web app. When I ask about Android or iPhone app knowledge, they claim only some non-compulsory modules cover them and only a minority of students take them.

Yet, you guys say you can learn on the job and want to be paid handsomely at the same time. Come on, I do not wish to pay you to learn what you should already know. Even teenage developers know how to write iPhone apps.

Even a Biz student like me know enough HTML/CSS/Javascript or use WordPress to create a decent website. What do Computing people actually learn in school? It is such lack of basic skills that cause Biz students like me to lose their faith and respect for Comp students.

Not to say all NUS Computing graduates are lousy, the good ones have already been snapped up by giant tech companies like Google and are in the US. The quality of those who remain, well the answer is quite obvious.
-
 
To  yes I have done it before. I sent an email to the registrar 4 months after results release. It was a careless mistake made by the dept and therefore they changed my grade and even sent me an apology letter to my home. But i would think that my case was a rather complicated and rare one but just so you know. It is possible.
-
 
It's quite hilarious when people ask you whether a post belongs on NUSWhispers. You take a peek and then go, eh, this is also the first time I see this. Nevertheless, nobody seems to quite believe you.

Hilarious. Extremely hilarious. Given how studying phraseology can help trace confessions, I won't be so stupid to bare so much of my life for trolls.

To the person who complained about the higher caps or NTU grads. I think there is some truth in it as NTU students are able to take modules that are easy to score (and not related to academics). 

For eg, modules that are related to sports, i have heard that part of the grading requirements involve participating in the sports itself? Anyone wish to provide more info?

About two years ago, it was almost Day 0 of the Freshman Social Camp. Stressed as I was in the committee, trying to rerun these games in my mind, hoping that everything will be fine, will run smoothly, that the freshman will have a more enjoyable experience, more fruitful starting ground, and hopefully all will go accordingly to plan. Of course it didn't. But it was still a great camp! 

Fast forward one year later, I took on the role as one of the orientation group leader (ogl), and was super nervous on the incoming freshman - what if I couldn't guide them, help them, or provide a suitable starting experience to their university life? I screwed up, but good thing they enjoyed themselves, made new friends, and gained some insights to the life and systems of NUS.

Today, I'm not involved either way in the upcoming one. But I still hope that regardless of all that ASO WOLS in reverse is coming up with, you people in the committees and you people being the light of this brand new darkness those freshman are about to embark their journey in (aka OGLs), to understand that freshman are still human, and its really not what you want, but what they need. NUS is not just about higher learning, but also an excellent platform for networking, and to get people of the same directions connected, to come together to achieve something better, and much, much more. 

TL;DR What is your purpose at this social camp? I challenge you to inspire this next generation to strive for better than what you have achieved and accomplished #ChallengedIssued

Hi everyone, I just finished my freshman year, major in CS. In the first year, I got to know the basic Java and that's all. I'm spending my summer vacation to upgrade my programming skill by revising and solving a lot of "theoretical" problems. Currently, I still cannot visualise what I will l do if I do the internship (solving the unrealistic problems??). I think I should study Android programming and apply for a place in that field (cuz that's what I can visualise now). Can anyone help me to picture the scope while doing the internship, what will you do and what do you need to prepare? Tks in advance!

It is ridiculous that NTU has a lot of graduates with CAP above 4.5. Whereas for NUS, or at least before the gradeless first year, didn't have as many first class honours. 

At a job interview I was the only one from NUS with a 2nd upper while the rest of the candidates I met there were from NTU and they have almost perfect CAP.

Hi, this is a genuine question.I am a year 1 student, or rather was a year 1 student. Currently, my cap is 4.57, I am wondering whether I should s/u one of my modules so that the cap will jump a bit or should I just keep it and use it later? Thank u in advance

To 

My solution is: Study mathematics in uni, with solid foundation in mathematics, you can learn engineering from Google or library.

I agree that our education system is mostly designed for job markets rather than training good scientists, as a student, we cannot do much about it. But there are full of opportunities in the system if you wish to pursuit academical proficiency. It is really up to you to decide who you want to be.

On another note, OP should be more efficient in learning. From my own experience, we do have enough time to learn thoroughly (if you are not overloading or taking too many hardcore mods). One strategy is to read textbooks (NOT lecture notes) before sem starts, then lectures will become your revision.

~In life, everything has a limiting factor. Time and money is the usual answer~

I feel lost. After working silently but consistently to found a start-up for nearly 2 years, things finally seem to be picking up. After a small project with a local U, we caught our first big break; a grant to revamp what uni online webcast look like for a module. MDA wants to collaborate with us for their nationwide campaign. Hospitals are considering the prospects of working with us. We are incorporating in a few weeks as a formal enterprise. Then, like a bomb shell, a co-founder pulls out, due to health reasons, and a new demanding job after graduation.

I work a full time job. The company is good. I dun hate my job, neither do I love it. In the last 2 years, I got married, and bought a house. And no, I am not rich. I dun have parents to pay for my down payment. Because I marry a foreigner, my down payment was over 150K. Through sheer prudence and a lot of help from friends new and old, I bought my house at only 26 with my wife, so that we dun have to keep renting and move house every single year nor live with the possibility everyday hat landlord may ask us to move, whatever the reason.

Now, my once MIA foreigner father (yes, we are different nationalities, and I dun have a mom, and dun ask me why. I dun even understand why my life as a local is so screwed up and non local either. Live with it), at the twilight of his years in business, persistently offers to run the venture together. Oh, suddenly he realizes he has an off-spring and wants that off-spring to continue his legacy, if any. However, the venture is in renewable energy, in undeveloped countries. It is exciting to me at least.

It was inspiring to get a group of friends together to do something and over 2 years, come to a point of nearly being an enterprise. It was fun thinking how I could change the world a little, and do it. It is heart-warming, to bring people from various background together, for a common cause.  

If you are me, with a mortgage to pay, still quite fresh out of university with a first job, juggling married life with work, a side line, with an impending business responsibility somewhere in the future, what would you do? 
~I know passion cannot bring food to the table, but I want to live my life with passion, every once in a while.~

If there is someone willing to talk to me about, please speak out. I do feel lost.
PS: If my co-founder is seeing this, please dun feel bad. I understand your reasons, they are valid. Nonetheless, it did pull the plug and make the already confused and messy me more messed up.

Hey people, I need your help here. In one of the exam, I accidentally did something which is not done on purpose and hence I got charged. (Believe it or not I didnt do it on purpose)
However,the result from the displinary board is just appalling.

1st- they sanctioned my grade (I accept it as I believe that whether my action is on purpose or not  ,it is still unfair for other students)

However their second decision is what disgusts me a lot. 
It is a very heavy fine! A number which is probably beyond your imagination. I mean how is it has to do with money? Wth?! Did I destroy school properties or causing harm? 
The school needs so much money? Do they think everyone is rich enough to pay that kind of fine?
Do they have any sense of principle or it is just pure greed?

Should I appeal? I am afraid that I might not control myself if the appeal brought me to a worse result.

-
 
My piece of thought: Although it is normal for students to worry about their grades, NUS seems to have an excessive CAP culture. The school should do something about it. A high quality of education IS achievable without making everyone so anxious about grades.

Hi fellow nus seniors, I'm going to be a freshie and all my peers are going these camps to make friends. Im socially awkward (least imo). I didn't sign up for any camp and at this point I'm too afraid to ask anyone and I read a lot camps being filled up. What should I do? Will I still be able to join clubs even without staying hall, because I applied and I don't think I will get it without going to the camps! 

Any seniors any form of suggestions is deeply appreciate!  Xiexie ! 
-
 
In reply to , perhaps you should look at the full situation first? achievements or whatnot. Or maybe the person has a 3.9x and is pulling it up?

 Scholarships shouldn't be given solely because the guy is book smart. The scholarship issuers wouldn't want someone who can only mug but not be active in other areas. After graduation, his mugging career ends. An all rounder is of course more preferable.

Though I agree with you that yes, they should at least maintain a second upper...

Despite the allure of startups, my advice to graduating students is to avoid working for startups in Singapore. Unlike the US, the chance of a startup succeeding in Singapore is very slim. Yes, we do hear of success stories occasionally but those are the exception rather than the norm. 

Startups here pay lowly, offer meager benefits if any, hardly any job security, give little or no equity and expect you to work like dogs. Many rely on government funds or PIC loopholes which can dry up any time or if regulations change. Those who do not are creating just another web app that actually brings no value to the economy.

If previous confessions are anything to go by, CS people and engineers are hardly respected by the well-spoken business folks. We are stereotyped as nerds and unable to see the big picture or give good presentations and the sad fact is that those stereotypes are not far from the truth.

If you wish to work for a startup, go to the US, else work for at least an MNC or civil service in Singapore.

I m currently a yr 1 going to yr2 stats student. After getting back my results this sem, I was really demoralized to know I gotten a d for st2131. I have onli achieved b- for all the other mods and my current cap is juz 2.5. I m really worried about passing with just a normal degree and I hav yet to clear my cs mods as well which could pull my grades down further. I am really confused at the moment whether to continue to study stats or to change to another faculty? Can any kind souls here provide me with a suggestion? Thanks

This pertains more to FASS students, but peeps from other faculties can feel free to offer your advice too!

I'm pursuing a history major, and thinking of picking up a minor concurrently. Do you peeps think a minor in Southeast Asian studies or sociology would better complement my major? Quick trivia: I took exposure modules for both disciplines, but got a better grade for sociology. But I'm inclined more towards taking up Southeast Asian studies as a minor, mainly because of what I intend to focus in my history research (i.e. Southeast Asian history).

So should I be logical? (i.e. sociology based solely on grades alone) Or pragmatic and explore my whimsical passion in SEA studies?

I have just finished year 2. I am in a dilemma as to whether i should s/u my elective which I got a B? I have not used any s/u so far...and have 3 more electives to take. It increases my cap by 0.02 and does not change the honours banding. Any advice?

To  

Hey there. I totally understand what you are feeling now as I fail one of my core module on my supposedly last semester in NUS. I had to retake that one module to graduate, and to make it worse the module is only offered in semester 2.

The first few days after the result announcement was surreal. I remember locking myself up in my own room since morning when I received the "7am SMS of Death" till late evening. I don't want to talk to anyone, I don't want to share my failure with anybody. 

When I got up the courage to tell my mum about my result, I was surprised that she wasn't angry at all. I remembered vividly she just gave me a hug, saying that it's alright.

I didn't come to term with reality until one week after that. But, with the support of my family and friends, I found the strength to pick myself up, take LOA on the first semester, and retake the module. Graduated with my mum looking proud at me when I took my stride down the UCC Hall stage. Now I have been working with a start up company for almost three years.

Personally, I believe that our failure doesn't define us. Our fight overcoming failure does. Pick yourself up, work harder. You might fail now, but you will find success soon.

Talk to the people that love you. Find support. My biggest motivation comes from thinking the happiness that my mum would feel when I graduate.

Think about opportunities. May be this extra year is a chance for you to do things that you would never do under ordinary circumstances. I worked part time at a telemarketer company during my LOA semester, while also in contract as an assistant for an event organizer company. I met new people, understood different perspectives, and had fun. I came back to school fresh and ready.

Whatever it is, don't give up. Winners never quit, and quitters never win.

Cheers,
B

I'm from life sciences, and throughout my 4 sem of study, i noticed that whenever a high percentage of the grade comes from MCQs (40% or above), i cant really go beyond a B+, unless the MCQ is so difficult that many people think so. Does anyone have an issue with MCQs or is it just me? It appears that MCQ papers have very steep bell curve. Or was it because i was careless enough to not take note of minor details which MCQs normally like to test? In short, MCQ papers are easier to study and get B+, but not easy to go beyond. Anyone agrees?

Hello, I am been troubled by the course that I have selected (bioengineering) I have read from many sources online saying that it is preferred to study other engineering courses like mechanical, etc. as they are more specialise and have wider applications, whereas this course will require u to learn a little of everything and end up not good at anything. Thus I am afraid that there isn't much job opportunities when i graduate. Any graduate from this course could give mi advice of whether I should continue studying this course, or only taking it as a graduate study. Thanks

I don't understand why scholarships are awarded to people who can't even maintain a second upper. Sure, uni is not just about grades, but we are talking about scholars here, the supposedly cream of the crop.

Does anyone know what the procedure for dropping a restricted minor is? Is it the same as for open minors (through CORS)?

When the regulations state that minors must be declared no later than the 5th semester of study, do they mean applications only or does it mean no changes can be made thereafter i.e. not allowed to drop one that you already took up previously? 
-
 
It is a truism that learning takes time. The issue is that we punish people for taking time to learn thoroughly. Our training/education regimes are largely designed to turn out large numbers of semi-numerate engineers in a short time rather than to produce any number of fluent scientists of any period of time

Hi, I am an incoming freshmen planning to stay in RC/Hall. My family PCI is approximately $1300~, hence I was offered the MOE bursary. However, I was not offered any other financial aid for campus accomodation(at least for now). My friend with a lower PCI though was offered the financial aid for campus accomodation as early as April(together with MOE bursary and those). I thought with my family PCI, i would be eligible for at least some amount for campus accomodation, so I am quite worried that my application was affected because of my late submission or because the admin staff may be pissed with me. Anyone out there was offered financial aid for campus accomodation with around the same PCI? If yes, when do u received it(together with MOE bursary?) and how much? Thanks in advance.
Ps. The reason why i didnt ask the office of financial aid directly is because i have a feeling they are already kind of piss with me so i hope someone here can help.

With the criteria for pursuing an Honors degree being a CAP of 3.50 and my CAP being 3.49, it makes me a wee bit sad. I thought that with the reduced Honors prerequisite of 3.2 I would be able to do Honors, but it turned out to apply only to students who matriculated in AY12/13 and beyond. (I entered NUS in AY11/12). I was hoping to submit an appeal to my faculty regarding my borderline case but there is literally zero information about doing so online. Help!
-
 
I have been always scoring a decent CAP, however this semester something went terribly wrong and i had such a horrible cap i got an Academic Warning..... Does anyone have that before? If yes, what does that mean?? 
-
 
Just curious, what is the average CAP of NUS students? 
-
 
This is my sem 2 of Year 1, my CAP is about 4.1. Could I get above 4.5+ before sem 2 of year 3? I really want to apply for graduate study in top schools.
P/S: Is it hard to attain 4.5+ in Chemical Engineering?
-
 
i think FASS should start allowing students to S/U our core mods... sometimes it's not that we don't study hard enough. The modules are indeed interesting but its just so damn hard to score. I would love to read up more if not for the exam stress. 

I chose to take my modules based on interest, well, I did learn a lot but my cap is terrible. Can't have the best of both worlds huh 
-
 
Should I S/U my B-? What if I get a C+ in the future and I don't have anything to SU :(

Hi, I need some advice choosing my specialisation. Currently a major in intelligent systems sounds nice but I'm not sure what a person with this specialisation will do after graduation. Can anyone give me some real life examples of which positions in which companies can this specialisation be useful?
-
 
All the Year Ones trying to give people study advice... Honey, please. Like y'all didn't have a gradeless first sem  
-
 
 Congratulations on your results. Unfortunately you have fallen into a trap that I did as well. Suggesting advice based on a sample of 1.

Here's some real advice: Do what works for you.

I could stop here but in return for being a douchebag, I'll give more substantial advice...

1. Don't be afraid to do what works. I haven't gone to lectures/seminars since my first semester (no I don't even watch webcasts) and my performance has been in a tight range. Now if I were an arrogant douchebag, I would say I did well because NUS sucks at teaching. And I am one but to say that would be audacious. Some learn by watching, some with their hands and some by doing. Try different things. Webcasts are useful but if you lack discipline, the power to pause can be anathema to study efforts.

2. Making notes is highly effective but also time consuming. Very time consuming. I find myself typing >1000 words a day at year 3. Not something you want to do if you don't really want >=2:1...

3. Most folk who do well are usually score well for their major modules and so excessively overweighting study time on major modules is folly. 2 weeks is simply not enough time. You might be able to pass but scoring past a B is difficult with such bare effort. For modules you aren't good at, always aim for a B+. By rule of thumb, B+ is the top ~40%, which is a realistic possibility in MOST modules for MOST people (subject to terms and conditions).

4. Focus on building skills. Especially for first years and pre-entry students. Anyone can train up skills, like math or writing for example. There are people who can do these easily but you can match them with time and effort. Think in terms of RPGs, people may be born with better stats that allow them to do some things better but focusing on leveling skills instead of stats which are fixed (yeah life is a shitty game) CAN put you on even ground.

5. Be honest with yourself. Brutally honest. The first step to solving a problem is realising it exists. Hard work may not betray you but it can and will betray your dreams. That said, life is just a journey of self-satisfaction. As long as you are responsible and do no harm to others, do what you want.

I got my first "F" grade and I'm not sure what to feel about it. It's a level 1000 module and I feel like a total failure for not being able to pass it. I thought I was doing ok, not expecting an A, but at least to pass it. But I guess I got on the wrong side of the bell curve.
-
 
This was supposed to be my last semester in NUS. Got my result today and found out I cannot graduate. Funny thing is that usually professors inform students before hand if the final project grade isn't sufficient enough. I got not such intimation so I thought at least I will graduate even if not with flying colours.

I have to go through another year if I have to graduate and I do not have the money to pay tuition fees. And I'm already so much in debt with my tuition fee loan. I have not told my parents yet but they will kill me when they find out. I am in such a bad state now that really killing myself seems to be a pretty good option to tackle all these problems.

What should I do?? Really on the knife's edge now......

tl;dr: for CEG AY14-15 students, you may SU your PC1432, MA1506 etc

I'm the CEGY1 cohort representative, posting here 'cos I'm not sure if more people read the Whatsapp chat or in this platform!

This is the email exchange between Winnie and I:

1. Is the SU option available for the modules most of us are taking this sem, aka CS1020, CG1108, MA1506, PC1432 and such? There seems to be much confusion regarding if these modules may be SU-ed using the 12MCs we are given throughout our 4 years of University. If there are SU-ed, will those that score D+ and below still need to retake the module? Also, if the modules cannot be SU-ed, will we also have to retake the module if we get D+ and below?
2. If modules have to be retaken, will the new grade be counted into our GPA together with the fail grade, or will only the better grade be taken into account.

Her reply:

1. Yes, S/U option is available for those level 1000 core modules.
[Refer to http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ugrad/SI_su_policies2014.html > 1.1 Modules Eligible for S/U option]
 
Yes, if S/U option is exercised, those MCs will be deducted from the 12 MCs for use throughout the candidature i.e. given in the ‘All Semesters S/U MCs (ASMC)’ account.
 
“If there are SU-ed, will those that score D+ and below still need to retake the module?”
Yes, students NEED to retake/repeat core modules with U (or F) grade.
 
“… if the modules cannot be SU-ed, will we also have to retake the module if we get D+ and below?”
Students will NOT be able to retake/repeat core modules with D/D+/S grade.
As noted above, students NEED to retake/repeat core modules with F (or U) grade.
 
2. “If modules have to be retaken, will the new grade be counted into our GPA together with the fail grade, or will only the better grade be taken into account.”
Both grades (i.e. new grade and F grade) will be used in the computation of CAP. Refer to http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ugrad/SI_caps.html - F grade contributes nothing to the numerator, but will still contribute to the denominator.
 
-------------------
 
If you/they still haven’t, please read the email I sent last Friday (29 May) – Subject: [NUS Restricted] Online Declaration of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Option, Semester 2, AY2014/2015.
I know those webpages are lengthy but students are highly recommended to read through them (at least) once.

Thanks NUSWhispers admin!

I am the poster of , sorry for being unclear. The module I want to S/U is currently my technical elective (actually I'm not sure about this but since I got it from round 1 I think it most likely is). When I log in NUS's online S/U declaration portal, I get this "You are not allowed to exercise S/U option or none of the module(s) registered is/are eligible for this S/U option exercise. Please contact ...". Does this mean I am not allowed to S/U any module? If I can S/U this module how can I do that?

Hi everyone

I am a year one student. I was pleasantly suprised when I checked my results today. I improved alot from the previous sem and I thought I should share some useful advice to ace exams!

1. Don't attend lectures if they are webcasted. It saves travelling time, and you can get 100% of the information if you pause and replay to take notes. Just make sure you are diligient enough to watch them! Set a fix time and day to view (and review) to understand the material completely

2. Study and make notes for core mods consistently during the sem. Chiong the electives within the last two weeks. Electives tend to be less content heavy or easier so you can afford to leave it to the end

3. But dont give up on electives! Because it is easier to score. Try not to study them with the mentality that you can SU them

4. Make your own notes, but keep going back to the lecture notes and past year papers. Focus on what is important and where the emphasis is placed. 

5. Try hard up to the very end. You may have spent 13 weeks studying but do not give up at the very end! Keep revising up till the morning of the paper

6. Spot questions. 

Disclaimer: This may differ for every major. Remember, the tips might not work for everyone too! Keep trying until you find what works for you

Cheers!

So there were some confessions about how business is perceived as inferior to engineering by some. I'm an engineering undergrad doing an internship right now, and I would have to disagree with notions of absolute superiority.

My senior colleagues (engineers) have told me that taking up engineering was a mistake, and that they themselves are trying to steer their children away from engineering and into econs/business/something to do with finance because "you can survive on engineering, but you can't get rich." This is mostly what they tell me and not my own experience, but they also say that it's tough to exit the field you choose to work in as an engineer after you graduate. As an engineer, you may also be required to be present on site when actual physical work gets done, and the conditions can be uncomfortable and often done in the night. Furthermore, engineers are stereotyped as having poor speaking and presentation skills.

I'm sure that business grads have their own set of problems, but I wouldn't get too smug as an engineer

I am from FASS and I just finished year 1. My major do not have any internship modules, and is not as sought after by employers like Economics or Communications. How do students from FASS manage to get internships by year 2 without any past internship experiences at all, other than through talentconnect or calling the companies directly? And also on average, how many internships does a typical student from FASS complete by the time he/she graduates?

I'm from engineering, and people have been telling me I can't S/U MA1506 because it's a programme requirement or something, but the S/U limitations on FoE website say otherwise:

Ø      All students are not allowed to exercise S/U option on modules dropped with a 'F' grade during the semester;
Ø      S/U option is not applicable on modules in which a student has been found to have committed plagiarism;
Ø      Students are not allowed to exercise the S/U option on Engineering modules (all levels), including those taken as unrestricted electives (UE) except for General Education (GEMs), Singapore Studies (SS) & Freshmen Seminar modules hosted by the Faculty.;
Ø      Students are not allowed to exercise the S/U option on bridging modules (MA1301, PC1221 and PC1222).

So should I use 4 of my 12 S/U MCs on my MA1506 (C+)? Or should I save them for future mods? Or am I unable to S/U it in the first place?

I'm a Year 1 FASS student (going on year 2) and considering to do a double degree programme. From what I read on the website, it says we need a CAP of 4.0 and approval from the departments. I'm planning to do a custom DDP though, just wanted to know what are the chances of it being approved? (would a much higher CAP immensely increase the chances of it being approved)?

After reading some of the posts here I feel somewhat reassured that I am not alone, and it isn't the end of the world if my summer internship has been terminated. I'm trying to keep myself upbeat by teaching myself a new language/skill to make my holidays more meaningful :) Any ideas of how to keep myself motivated and not just lie in bed for the whole day?

Hi, how do i increase my chance of going to exchange? Other than good grades, are CCA and other activities important? If I have good grades but no other activities, do I still stand a chance to go exchange? Also, is it possible to go for local exchange if I take a major unique to only nus?

When guys discuss which faculty has the most chio bu, usually only FASS and Business come to mind. Let me just say that SDE is a gold pot full of them as well, plus they are creative and have artistic talent which make them all the more attractive (well at least that can be said about the Aki and ID girls) :D

Can I know what happens if I declare a minor but fail to fulfill the requirements? Thinking of taking up a CS minor but lecture clashes and exam clashes everywhere, can probably only do those mods in year 4, but it'll be too late to declare a minor then...

NUS is ranked one of the top universities in the world. But how are we actually ranked? Is it on the basis of standardized tests, research quality or notable alumni? Or because Singapore is constantly offering scholarships to invite the best students from all over the world to join NUS? I am really curious as to whether we are really that good or simply overrated.

So I (engin student) recently started an internship at an global engineering consultant (not naming names, cause I don't know what can happen these days). I joined the Bid Team to work on a particular project, but it is now at the phase where the bid has been won and the project got handed over to the project team. So after spending a week with Sales/Commercial, I got moved to sit with the engineers. 
Needless to say, the working atmosphere is VERY different. 
After Day 1 with the project engineers, I came home and Dad asks "So what did you learn today?" 
Me: "That engineers say bad words loudly in the office and play Taylor Swift all day long"
Dad: "So did you like it?"
Me: "Absolutely"

What if I have 2 unclassified modules under GAPS? Could I not include them under my CAP if I've reached the graduate requirement? This is owing to my mistake of choosing psychology in my first year as a major, and flunked it rather badly.

I was expecting to start work in June - signed the contract and all - only to find that I've been fired yesterday before even starting due to "unexpected changes in the industry that makes the position offered redundant". I got the job very early at the start of the year. Declined other offers (higher paying ones too) because they were in industries of less interest to me. Happily stopped looking for work after signing the contract with this false sense of security. 

Lesson learned: Even when you've found a job already, keep looking and don't stop until you're officially starting.

CAP of 3.7. Is it worth continuing on to FYP just to get a 2nd Lower Honors in the end (or risk the CAP sliding down even more) or should one just go out and work already? Seems like most employers are looking for people with "good honors" anyway

I'm an FoS student going into year 4 next semester but still struggling to find a summer job or internship; umpteen pieces of resume sent out and only one of them got me an interview, which happened to be unsuccessful eventually. It turns out those friends of mine who managed to get a job this summer already had several internships under their belt. I really should have known better than to return home every single vacation and do nothing.
-
 
I'd always acted as though I was fed up with uni life because I didn't like the general education structure etc. Truthfully, it was because I wasn't performing to the best of my abilities and my CAP was so lousy I just couldn't wait to leave the self-inflicted horror behind me. Oh well. I'm just thankful to have gotten a decent, enjoyable job with abundant advancement opportunities, despite my less-than-stellar academic results.

Just curious, what do FASS graduates work as after they graduate?
-
 
 I am a single degree engineering student from NUS and I think that engineers/computer science and business or accounting people need to work hand in hand to bring their product to success. 

Some may argue that engineers can do both just like steve jobs and bill gates and bring their business to success but people who are at that level of competence are quite rare especially in Singapore.

I think as an engineer or as a person we should be humble and should not judge a degree with our limited knowledge. I think people need to know that Accounting and business people have many functional roles in companies that are not related to engineering products at all. 
-
 
Response to the comments on 

1. "Engineering teaches problem solving. I am sure any engineer can learn what a business/acct student learnt." 

Well, for one, I don't disagree that the discipline of engineering is heavily focused on problem solving. But, as university students, let us not fall prey to the strawman argument of saying engineering students can learn whatever the students from [insert faculty] have learnt. 

First and foremost, it is completely baseless and a very lazy sweeping statement. Secondly, it is highly probable, in fact almost definite, that if you were to make a business student study engineering since year 1,  that particular business student would also be able to learn whatever an engineering student can learn. (let's not touch on issues like a particular student's inclination towards certain disciplines because that would extend this post almost infinitely). Thirdly, oh well, I truly don't see any meaning in the statement. 

2. "Have you heard of business people having a 2nd major in electrical engineering or chemical engineering? Or have you heard of an [sic] business grad converting to technical track in an Engineering firm?" 

Not sure what the person is trying to convey here. Are you trying to say that business students are not as great as engineering students because the former didn't abandon whatever they studied for 3/4 years to irrationally and irrelevantly change course to an entirely different discipline at work? If that's what you regard as great, then I'm glad business students are considered to not be "great". Also, on that note, would the large number of engineering students who flee the engineering sector to become financial advisors be considered "great" too? 

-
 
Hi, are there any pfm majors out there that can tell me more about the course? Is it very difficult and dry?
-
 
Referring to  As a business student, I think it's fair for SoC students to have a 'holier than thou' attitude. I took CS1010E; recursions and pointers have increased my respect for what they are doing - and it is only the most basic module. As I near graduation, I realise that a business degree is bullshit, meant to meet the needs of the large financial industry in Singapore. I mean seriously, what have you learnt? It has mainly been MCQ, simple ratios, formulas, short essays, based on theory and textbooks. Many top universities like Harvard and Stanford don't have a business undergrad course (closest is econs). We don't even have to use calculus to derive some of the formulas, unlike our friends in econs. To the OP of , if you want to be in tech, and if you don't have any marketable skills (unless you're from marketing or ops management), significant work experience, corporate connections, or money - STFU, and stop being a disgrace to our faculty.

Hi, may i ask, regarding the class of honours, does it depend on the your CAP u get over 4 years or just the work in your final year?
-
 
Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be a full-time uni student. You see I never had the luxury of getting into a local uni after my poly days due to an inadequate GPA, so I had to resort to an off-shore degree at at private institution here.
4 years of my undergraduate education was filled with juggling between at full-time job and rushing to classes in the evening and completing whatever assignments we had during our limited free time (which burned our weekends).

When I walk around NUS campus and see students immersing themselves totally into uni life, having so many enriching CCAS and activities, I find myself envious of what you guys have. To just focus on one thing and one thing only, being a student and not worrying about balancing work and studies about the same time.
-
 
I graduated with second upper honours. I didn't feel smart or being outstanding. Working life making me feel that I am further away from my dream and passion. If you are poor, you are most likely to choose a job that can pay the bill rather than something u really interested In. Going for passion is bullshit if you can't even feed yourself.
-
 
I'm pissed at my Engineer or Computing friends for telling me in companies, without them, business guys like me will be out of a job. They can do my job but I cannot do theirs.

Excuse me folks, who are the guys that hire you, raise funds, talk to customers, pay your salaries, navigate all the business rules and handle all the accounting shit you guys throw out? Yes, Business and Accounting folks like me.

It is a balance. In most startups, you usually observe the smartly-dressed business-minded CEO and the casually-dressed nerdy CTO combination. In bigger companies, business and sales people set the direction for you to follow so you know the market demands and what to engineer in the backrooms.

Now quit pissing Business folks off with your holier than though attitude. We need each other.
-
 
To 

Geez, researching for camp stuff etc is such a trivial thing to do. Just google/facebook search the faculty and the "official" page should pop up. The camps and other info will usually be stated there. Alternatively search for the camp you would like to attend eg faculty freshman orientation or union. Of course some pages are not updated since a year ago, they are only utilised for camp details and pictures disemmination , there's no use for it during school time.

If you are already frustrated and annoyed at such an easy task, good luck in university. Don't break down and crack when you do your research for papers. 
-
 
 Actually the number of top CEOs with engineering degrees is pretty significant. 

http://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-majored-in-engineering-2011-3?IR=T&op=1

Also, you mentioned that business and sales people help the rest but a lot of them are also arts and other majors as well. Perhaps the case would be more in your favour for specialized/technical fields such as accountancy and finance. 

Graduates from other disciplines can get an MBA without the need to go through a BBA. 

And yes this holier than thou attitude has to stop (though I dont really think is prevalent). In the end everyone has the opportunity to make their own decisions, start their own projects and so on. Output depends on the effort, resourcefulness (in finding right people too) and heart put into it, not the path of study chosen.

I think I chose the wrong major (engineering). I actually love learning math/physics and doing problem sets (okay a little less than 'love', but I enjoy it). However, when it comes to practical projects, I seem to be a flailing mess (I'm doing horribly in my fyp). After graduation I'm probably going to end up a mediocre engineer. I feel so tired really, if only it came to me as easily as it seems to for my peers.

When people/ friends ask what is your major and you reply e-commerce, it seems like such a joke. Thankfully they are closing down this major and putting it as a specialisation under Information Systems.

In reply to , I never trusted job agencies because most give minimal payouts and may take commission from what you earn. Try searching for companies that you would like to work at and contact them personally. You'll be surprised that a lot of them don't actually put advertisements out on those platforms you've been searching on. With your limited commitment, opt for part-time work instead. That's how I found my holiday jobs in the past anyway. :)

To the guy of 

Welcome to Uni life. Its time to take ownership of your own life. If you expect the prof to feed you with every single info, you are so wrong. Generally, google is your best friend, and when use correctly, you will be able to find what you want. 

Don't be daunted by what I have just said. Uni is a phase where you can have lots of fun, but you have to be really good at balancing your life. All the best to you and all the freshies out there (:

Currently doing an internship, and oh boy, I feel like I've encountered office politics way too early. 
There are students from other local unis from different majors that are posted to the same project. 
We were all supposed to work as a group, but somehow, a few started to selectively complete the easiest tasks, rushing through the work and then spend the remaining time simply boot-licking the in-charge, while leaving the difficult sections for the rest.They also spend whatever time they have with the in-charge just randomly suggesting facile solutions to complex problems. The most amazing part is that the in-charge was not a single bit annoyed or appalled! Crap-talking probably never felt so welcomed. 

I tried to hint that they were doing lesser, but all they did was to vocalize some vacuous sympathies and nothing else. I am not the quiet meek type. I will speak up whenever I have queries. BUT presently I can't bring myself to confront them because I'm not sure if I would be able to put it across factually and professionally; I would definitely feel guilty if I were to ever hurt their feelings. Any ideas on how to tactfully approach this matter? Thanks guys....

I have always had a strong belief that as long as I work hard with integrity and honesty, my hard work would be recognized. However this internship is starting to prove otherwise; a few weeks in and it is quite obvious the in-charge is warming up to the empty vessels, but not the rest of us who are actually getting our work done.
I feel rather disappointed and disillusioned even though I know all these are just glimpses of unfairness that will probably become the norm in working life. 

I wonder if the in-charge knows they are simply talking crap. But even if he does not, I'm determined to give my best shot at co-existing peacefully with these lazy boot-lickers until the internship ends, and try to show the supervisor that I'm actually doing work without resorting to cheap theatrics. I can do this!!!! Jiayou to everyone who is currently doing an internship!!!!

I am a year 2 Business student. All of my friends are doing their internships, but I am yet to get any internship offers, interview offers even. I know internships are important esp for year 2s like me but I am worried as I still can't find one. I tried to apply through many job portals out there, but none got back to me. My CAP is decent and I feel my resume isn't that bad too. But why am I still getting rejected? Can someone help me please?

As an incoming freshman, I find it very exasperating that information on orientation camps and events are not properly organised and relayed to us. It doesn't help when some of the event facebook pages have been inactive for over a year! There's barely anything on the NUSSU page as well, just a few buttons that has nothing when you click on them. Talk about being a centralized portal that has everything consolidated in 1 place. Sure, we need to take our own initiative to search for them ourselves, but it's so time consuming and frustrating. Not everyone has a nice senior that can help to advise you on what and how to join orientation camps ya? I'm not sure if this is really the way NUS people do things, but no matter what I'm starting to dislike it. I'm sure you can do better than this right?

Doing internship this vacation is making me have second thoughts about the major I have chosen. Although I do feel the tasks given to me are interesting, I am overwhelmed by their level of difficulty. Every morning I am stressed out going to work. I always expected my mentor to at least provide me some guidance rather than just dump all the tasks on me. It's pretty clear to me that I am the cheapest labour in the whole company. Sometimes I get so frustrated I just sit at my table doing nothing. Sorry for all the negative thoughts as I really need a place to voice this out :( Does anyone ever have this kind of feeling?

Hi seniors, I am a freshman coming into NUS FASS this coming August. Recently, to my horror, I found out that someone whom I don't particularly like and would like to avoid is interested in taking the same major as me. I have been very disturbed by this for a few days especially when the major we are interested in is not one of those highly popular major in FASS. May I ask what are the odds of running into this person and is there anyway I can avoid that person as much as possible? Are there alot of events where students of the same major must come together? Hope seniors out there can give me some advice as I havr been quite stress about this.

@Professors and admin - how true is the bell curve system? Sure, I've read the Provost's blog and so on, except anecdotally among my friends As and A-s seem to be exceedingly common. Is half the cohort really getting B- and below?
(Hope I dont come across as an arrogant ***** here, my grades are B average and most of my friends seem to be doing better than me)

where can we find opportunities to be a part time research assistant? i am a year 2 econs major and i am kinda interested in research work, thus i feel working as an RA will allow me to understand more about research. Thanks in advance!

This confession is going to suck more than any you've read here. I'm pretty sure of it. I've been reading a lot of discussion surrounding grades, bell curves, dean's listers and the like. I have a confession, and it is a serious one: not even the university has an answer. 

There exists a transnational shadow army of highly intellectual, extremely capable individuals who can process volumes of information and make meaningful sense of it in a short amount of time. They are passionate, dedicated, and resourceful. They are skilled at virtually every discipline in a university, and they come armed with an armada of experience and knowledge. Some of them are the people you eat lunch with, some of them stand in front of you in classrooms teaching you, some of them are professionals in the field. 

So what's the confession? They sell their services for a fee: to you, to your friends - to anyone who is willing and able to pay. Typically, rich kids, but not always. Desperate last minute submissions do come in from students who can squeeze out the fee from somewhere to turn a shitty half-baked assignment into at worst a B+. Many financially capable students literally pay their way through uni, only having to sit for written exams - assignments having been conveniently outsourced.

The freakish thing is that all of it is 100% original. And undetectable, unprovable, even if you have an academic supervisor for a research paper. Yes, even that.

But maybe how I know this is the real confession.

Why do NUS students keep referring to their break as summer? We don't follow US seasonal periods so it can be quite confusing for some of us. 
If you say summer people are just going to assume it's all-year-round because it's always summer here.

in terms of picking an internship, is it better to do an internship with a lesser-known company with an opportunity to learn a lot and get involved in real projects, or a well-known company doing mundane tasks? any insights would be appreciated!

 If your major isn't a popular one, I would say there will be a chance to see that person. Especially during lectures. Tutorials is based on bidding, so if you are aware of that person's timetable/choice, dont pick that. Again there is some chance, but if you are quite unlucky, see if you can change the timeslot. 

For FASS, there are other requirements you need to do, exposure modules and electives etc. Probably unlikely you will see that person unless they pick exactly the same stuff as you.

FASS is quite big so I would say you wouldn't really meet that person (while walking in the area). Even if you two cross paths, you or that person might not realise it. 

For exams involving major modules, I suppose it can't really be helped.

Although while for lecture and tutorials, at lower levels, you may not run into that person, it may progressively get harder in level 3000/4000 modules, where the cohort is more 'specialized' so they tend to have it seminar-style= higher chance of seeing them during lessons. But by then you probably have other friends, so I suppose the impact wouldn't be as great. 

For me, there's a person i've been avoiding in FASS too, and I saw that person thrice this sem (twice at NUH/KR MRT, once at UHC), but all of those meetings aren't those "right in your face" kind, it's just an observation from a distance so you can yknow, look at your phone or something. 

Possibly if you have common friends, find out their timetable so that would be the best way to avoid. I wouldn't rule out the chance of running into them but I would say it wont be an everyday thing.

I would say the common spot for FASS people would be the Deck (arts canteen). But people vary, and I'm assuming this person is like most people. For me, I prefer to hang out near school, so I can't give a definite way to completely avoid them. Perhaps all you can do is to not go to Deck during peak periods, (12-2pm)

Need advice from people who have went SEP! 
Is it common for student to go for exchange alone or is it recommended to go with friends?
Thanks in advance!

Finished As and am a freshie matriculating this year into SDE RE! Sadly, I don't have much info as to how orientation will be like( SDE social camp is for whole SDE fac?) and which camps to go for?(I am not very sociable worried that if I don't go for the camps I wouldn't be able to make friends and be a loner ;\ ). Also, how is the environment in SDE like? Really appreciate any inputs :)

I'm constantly consumed by the worry that I will fail my FYP, but my friends have assured me that as long as someone does the bare minimum, the school/department will not fail the student. Is that true?

I'm current on a summer internship and after the first week I think I  facing a serious problem. During the school year I have been a night owl and I work most efficiently at night when everything around me is quiet. This has been the case for me since secondary school. Thus now I find it difficult to do something productive at work as and for the past week, I have wasted a lot of time online instead of doing what I have to do. I am really worried about this, anyone has any advice?

In defense of the bell curve, many of my friends have complained to be about "I got screwed by the bell curve hence my C grade". Let me tell you the truth, the world is run like a giant bell curve. The bell curve we face in Uni prepares us very well for the harsher world out there. I give 3 main reasons why.

Reason 1: There is always a shortage good jobs, that is why they are so coveted in the first place.

As an example, for Computing students, jobs at Google and Facebook are highly desirable. Can Google and Facebook give jobs to everyone? Obviously not! They have the right and the ability to filter candidates based on the best-performant, candidates below who are below average in academics can forget about applying.

The best jobs pay well, middle jobs pay less and so on. Even if you are one mark below a band, you are below the band. This is life.

Reason 2: NUS must distinguish between its students.
Would it make sense if everyone gets first-class honours? We can see the case of private Unis in the UK where second-uppers are easily obtained. Employers cannot distinguish between the worthiness of candidates. THe GCE exams there are also notorious for grade-inflation. HR departments are rendered helpless since the A grade you got could mean you are in the top 10% or at the 50-percentile.

How are tertiary institutions and employers going to differentiate candidates?

Reason 3: The bell curve stimulates competition. If you know only the top 10% is going to get that A, you will work harder to be in that 10%. If half the people get A, where is the incentive to work harder?

I have heard horror stories of students not lending their notes to coursemates for fear of affecting their grades. Students see each other as competitors to be destroyed instead of working together for a common cause. This an acceptable collateral damage of the bell curve system. If you think this is demeaning, let me give you a thought experiment.

Say you are one of three candidates vying for that dream job, would you help the other two candidates? You will do anything in your power and ethics to not cede any advantages to your opponents. Why should you complain then about students not helping each other? This is just a reflection of reality.

Against the point of different starting lines. A friend of mine complained that a typical non-exchange foreign student in NUS is on a scholarship with accommodation and allowances provided. Some of them even enter NUS as Year 1 when they have completed their freshmen year in their home countries. My reply "now you know how the real world works, come I clap for you"

People come from different backgrounds and abilities. It is your prerogative to work harder and get that A if you come from less priviledged backgrounds, not complain or put down the hard work of others. Complaining about the bell-curve is looking for a scapegoat to blame for not studying hard enough. If you want to beat that foreign-talent, jolly well put in more study hours.

I'm a born Singapore, lived in a HDB flat and never obtained a single scholarship. Yet I managed to get myself on the Dean's List in half the semesters I have studied so far. Am on track to get first-class honours when I graduate. Many of my friends have also beaten FTs on scholarships. There is no secret about my academic results. Work hard, work smart, put in the hours and you get your results. Don't blame others or the bell curve for your poor study attitude.

Let me end with a quote from John F Kennedy, "Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men."

Dear Prof.s,
Has it ever come to your mind that I may have forgotten most of the exam questions now?

So, I can't really make sense of your summary feedback (without questions) for finals exam...

RE  You will have to find someone who's already working full time. BTO requires 1 person to be working full time for at least a year. You will be able to get the max housing grant (40k) if your significant half earns less than 1.5k and 20k cpf grant if earn less than 5k. That 20k is enough to pay for down payment, so you can save your cash for renovation. :D You don't have to ROM until you can collect your house key. How do I know that? I know my significant half since secondary school and we have recently bought a bto. centAdvice

I was looking at an announcement on IVLE. The professor wrote that there was only one student who drew upward sloping indifference curves that crossed for finals, I highly suspect that's me. Now it worries me, I didn't do well for mid-term either, what if I fail my major module? C is considered as fail right?

How hard is it to get a job that requires 2 months commitment? Very hard especially when your orientation camp is in the middle of nowhere. My finals ended almost 2 weeks ago and now I still haven't found a job. 

I've considered jobs on Gumtree but thought that after an event job, I have to start looking for another one which is troublesome. I've tried jobstreet, sent out a few applications but without any replies. I've tried other job portals but many go through recruitment firms which I don't really like. 

I don't know what to do. If this continues I might actually consider just doing volunteer work around singapore. At least I'm doing something useful.

People are like stocks.

Some people are the blue chips, the ones with fantastic GPAs, CCA records, rich family, good looks, etc. If you own them, you can expect your assets to increase in value, aside from consistently strong dividends. But to own them, you need to have strong financial backing because the prices are going to be high given the strong demand in the market.

Some people are the penny stocks, the ones with nothing wow-inducing in their CVs, horrible academics, and nothing interesting beyond school. They have no motivation to work hard and their future looks like a mess. Doesn't take much to own one, but don't expect it to give you much turnover in future as well.

Nobody wants a penny stock, and not many can afford a blue chip. But that is not the end as you can always spot stocks with good potential with a combination of a keen eye, some wit and a little luck. But remember, as Leonardo Di Caprio said in "The Wolf of Wall Street", "by the time you read about it in the Wall Street Journal, it is already too late".

So stop eyeing the blue chips. Your eyes shouldn't instinctively open wide at someone. You should be the one opening them and checking out the low stocks before they get on Wall Street Journal.

Normally when people think of senior-junior interactions, it often comes with some idea that the junior is expected to follow in the footsteps of the senior, i.e. master-apprentice. Indeed, it's quite an amazing thing, how batches come and go and how they remember who you might be. However, I dare say I have found a junior who I respect at what he (darn, now this has made the confession more guessable) has managed to accomplish, yet remaining so humble that, if I hadn't read up about you in the aim of trying to get to know you better (like all seniors should), I wouldn't have known. :) Because I certainly can no longer do the feats you do, even if I wanted to try, since I'm past the "timing". But it's nice seeing a junior who's ever so, brilliant and willing to share his views (even if not in public: there are terrible trolls and commentators around); I think that's great.

But it's really hard to say because of self-awareness. In some contexts, praising a junior like this can be seen as "bias" which can significantly affect the batch structure (not to be confused with band structure, semiconductor people!). It has happened before and I was mistakenly thought to be trying to pursue what we call a bijective relationship (meaning one-one correspondence).

It's funny, since we're nearing something we call "orientation preparation", and so seniors are supposed to "pay it forward" for the juniors to acclimatize (or rather, put in place a negative feedback loop for unfamiliarity). Thinking about it, I really don't know if I did a half-decent job, but I tried to improve as compared to the last year. I hope the batch has adapted finitely better (well, infinitesimally better case is proven, so we can set δ to be arbitrarily large, so the finitely better one is also OK.).

As a senior heading towards somewhere (I'm not supposed to drop so much info!), I honestly would like to thank the batch, and especially one special person who has managed to impress me a great deal. But I cannot show my bias, otherwise we'll soon have a decomposition of the batch into finding out who the favourite is, resulting in a highly exothermic reaction and well... a rumour mill that autocatalyses, as if it won't after this confession. :)

P.S. if the confession is too long or nerdy to read, read the tl;dr (th;dr) version.

TL;DR (in case a commentator writes one for me): Thank you juniors, in particular one, for inspiring me. Regards from senior. It sounds as if senior has some regrets, but he/she (anonymity's sake) will have to take it in his/her stride.

NUSWhispers: I don't know what kind of learning point one can make use out of here, since we say we shouldn't have troll commentary. Well, I guess it's also a message to seniors who should conduct the next batch of... orientation to maybe... ermmmm... think about the possibilities the juniors have, rather than to keep on comparing them and saying they won't make it  and that they have deteriorated? By the way, thanks for banning the trolls; much appreciated because this kind of post will get trolled.

Wah, damn long, I must give my fingers some rest.

(And also, suggestion for feature update, can have "heartfelt gratitude" and "true story" categories or not?)

This vacation was very much needed after a more rigorous second year of school.

While my friends have all secured their internships for their bright futures, here I am just glad and happy to be able to finally reach Lvl 100 in Maplestory after 3 days.(childhood dream of mine) \(^0^)/

I was definitely more motivated for my future before- I regularly attended insight trips to potential companies whenever I can. I am also in midst of making a plan to ready myself for the future industry I wish to be in with a career adviser.

Its just this semester, may had signs I was burnt out. Maybe obvious case- I didn't start revision for an exam until 5 hours before, even then I couldn't be as concerned as I would like to be. This has never happened before, I was always the more academically-concerned among my peers. Maybe only being able to rest bi-weekly for 5 months straight was finally taking its toll on me. I didn't rest well before this crazy semester started either.

My next semester would be an exchange trip, about 8k overall. And I should be working my ass off to earn as much moolah as I can so I can reduce the financial burden. I should have been more hungry for internships too to secure one that would be very decisive on my future quality of my internships.

But these signs have been worrying me, everyday I wake up just happy to spend the entire day doing nothing productive. Maybe I should take a break and not rush working for the first holiday since Secondary 4? Not working for this long after exams, was a first for me.

I have also plans to pursue other areas while the time allows too - driving,  new language classes. So I also won't be completely comatose in front of the computer. Just that this time,  do you guys think I should let myself take it slow?

TL;DR I may have been burnt out. But I need more money to support myself for SEP and current interest classes. Should I take it slow and find a part-time job? Or should I just endure and work full time as I have always done? Should I be worried about this or will this pass?

Late shoutout to professors and TAs of SoC, especially those of CS1020 and CS2107. Thanks for being awesome.

As well as collecting the exam scripts fast during our final exams, where the scripts are collected from both rows by the prof walking down each aisle, much faster than the linear o(n) time by some other faculties.

Hello I'm , so ISE people really study everyday? I mean its really very rigorous academically wise? 

And wad sorta CCA ISE people usually join? Which halls? And wad they usually end up becoming? Like which job titles and which sectors? And is the starting pay really good from wad I heard? Just curious yeeah, anyways I'm already in it.. no way going out.

Oh yeah and is it really math intensive?

Dear SoC,

I just want to know whether there is any workshop for current non-SoC students. I am quite interested in programming.

Thanks.

Anyone applying as an intern at NUS Risk Management Institute before? If yes how is the procedure like, as in if you wouldn't make the cut would they at least let you know?
-
 
Referring to post , thank you to all the seniors who have provided advice via the comment section below. Despite my questions, in no way have I once thought of SoC as a "dumping ground". I am just honestly curious about what other alternatives could be there for me should I, after getting a degree, decide to differ from norm to pursue something else. I didn't mean to put it in a way which was insulting to the faculty, and I truly apologise if I did give off that impression. 

Another question would be that I am quite clueless on where and how I can have a head start for my first year in this course. I downloaded peel and Python programming but am still quite clueless as to how to work it properly. Any advice from seniors what I should be reading on in my free time since I have a few months before school starts?

Hello, I'm a soon to be freshman to ISE. Honestly anyone heard anything about it and what can I expect?
-
 
I graduated one year ago from NUS. I have been working ever since graduation but now I really can't take my current workplace anymore. The management is all-talk-no-action, inefficient and resistant to change. Sometimes, I just feel like I'm wasting my time in the company. I have learnt nothing new ever since stepping into this company one year ago. I'm just no different from a fresh grad.

With the saturation of the job market with cheap foreign 'talents', it is obviously difficult to be even short-listed for an interview. My personal development and career progression really matters to me and I really can't waste anymore time in this hellhole. Urgh!!!!

On hindsight, I should have given a serious thought about my career goals back then before applying for jobs. I really regret not planning ahead and landing myself in a company which doesn't offer the kind of job I really like. 

What to do~

I am from a healthcare discipline. I feel that more of my course mates should take more pride in the work that we do. Being empowered to make a positive difference in people's lives is something meaningful and of a higher calling. It is disappointing when people measure a job with dollars and cents instead of the greater good it does to our society. We really should be measuring our life's worth by our contributions to society instead of the figure on bank statements. 

I may complain a lot about school, but the truth is I have never felt more real doing what I'm doing because of my passion in healthcare. To all healthcare students out there, you guys are awesome and thank you for taking care of everybody's wellbeing! :)

I recently met up with a SoC coursemate who I have not seen for 7 years. He is pretty rich right now and travelling between PRC and Singapore. Here's his story of how he become successful.

He was from fujian, china and was one of the top students in his hometown. During his junior college in china, he was selected by our dear MOE to be part of a scholarship programme. As part of the scholarship, his tuition fees of $32xxx back then were fully sponsored by the scholarship but he has to work in Singapore for at least 6 years.

During university, he form a clique with the local PRC community in his hall and know many PhDs and Masters students from China as well. They gave him tips of the best modules to get into and as Maths is his forte and he suck in English, he manage to minimize his "readings" module to a minimum and score well in all the math modules. In the end, he graduated with a First Class Honors with a CGPA of 4.73.

During graduation ceremony, he met his senior working in an MNC who recommend him into his first job with a starting pay of $4,200. As he is not a PR or Singapore citizen, he get his entire pay + the employer contribution of $714, with a total of $4,914 every month. Of the ~$5k earnings every month, he spent $1,000 on rental in a nice condo less than 1km from his workplace and $500-$600 in personal expenses per month. He save the rest and remit $2,000 every month back to his China bank account.

After 6 years, he move back to China and with the savings he saved in the the last 6 years, he has a neat sum of RMB691,200 which he used to start his current start up in China. Within a year, he got his cousins in China who are also SM2 scholars and benefited from our government as well to join his start up and they are now running quite a big business in China.

Here's an opinion from the other end: the "slacker's" side of the story: (note: not an actual slacker since I did my work but it was overwritten by control freaks)

Don't you ever dare to accuse me of not contributing to the group project! If you think that I didn't do shit then that's because you're not giving me the chance to do my share! The truth is that I DID contribute! In fact, I put in my utmost effort in giving it all I've got! Did i not wish for us to get A? Did I not do what's best for the project? I did what I believe would be the best for the group; and if there's any other way in which I thought it could have been done, I'd have done it! I saved all you people from doing that chore and after I'm done what did I get? Not a single word of thanks! Just criticisms and more criticisms and so much attitude! (no wonder some ppl dun wanna contribute! )
Fancy you people nitpicking on every single tiny customization when in actual fact you should bear in mind that since this is a GROUP project, everyone should be entitled to piece in a part of their own opinion, you need to respect your group member's opinion since it's mandatory that I piece in my share of the project, and my share includes my opinion! (this project requires creativity which is why emailing the lecturer to ask for the best viable outcome is pointless since she leaves it open to any interpretations) 
Since you're so unsatisfied with my work, fine! 
YOU DO IT LA! Even if it ends up in a situation whereby I contributed nothing to the project, I will never redo my work no matter what! (I have so much pride in it and its creative direction that I would no longer feel that spark in me driving me to complete this chore if I were just do it according to someone else's creative decision, I only ever wanna do it on behalf of the team precisely because doing this part allows me to put in my creative direction and if I've lost that autonomy, then this project would have no trace of me in it, it'd be like a project by some other team which I have no part of)
Anyway, your criticism are so vague "don't do this... switch to another one... but you guys dun even tell me if I don't do this, then what should I do? If I wanna switch, then which one should i switch to? Because I know that since my taste in creativity is so fundamentally different from your taste, since I did what I already thought was the best option and choosing other options is almost like why choose second best when you could have the best option, I know that you will forever be unsatisfied no matter what I change it to since I'll just change it to another version similar in taste to my original, except my original is better! Plus I am not an idiot! what if you're just screwing me over and just ask me to redo one hundred times to spite me? 

TLDR; Don't accuse ppl of being slackers who contributed nothing to your group, when in actual fact you're just a control freak who wanna control everything down to the last detail and won't be open to other opinions and wish to overwrite her work (pls lor, why would I wanna shoot myself in the foot by doing lousy shitty work? Do I not wanna get an A?) 

One last thing; even when your group mates are SUPPOSED to do her fair share of work, will it kill you to be polite enough to say thanks?

I'm starting school in NUS soon and taking a computing course~ has anyone heard of computing graduates going into banks and finance before? What other sectors can you possibly work in if you get tired of the IT sector in the future? Although the pay is definitely good, I was just wondering if there is anyone who decided to switch career paths few years down the road.

Guys in NUS, pls be wary of teaming up with girls who jump into conclusions that guys are desperate in getting into their pants. Their stench of paranoia can be smelled from a mile away. All they think about about is how to avoid you to the point that you can't get the work done properly even though you were just trying to being nice to facilitate discussion.

hate the fyp module especially when the grading system is flawed. i dont understand why they want to make the poster not compulsory. some of my peers wanted to do poster presentation just to earn effort points from their prof so as to get a grade which their project really deserves. certain projects especially those project management related ones are easy and some profs giving the students an A grade for fyp to push those from second lower to upper is too frequently heard. and they say that the course i am in is ranked third in the world?

Just curious. . . But is there an inkling to what the most difficult major in NUS is? 

(Yeah yeah most of you might say people see things differently but honestly what is most likely the hardest major )
-
 
A quick search through NUSWhispers for "average" reveals that most people find themselves at or slightly above average, which is statistically reasonable.

But I had other plans - enough was enough. It was time to balance the bell curve on self-perception Yes, I will admit it. I am below average. Way way below average.

Disappointment threatened to swallow my entire being, when I realised my CAP only amounted to a mere >4.5, and would most likely continue to fall throughout my stay in NUS.

Shame coloured my inner soul, when I reflected on how the long hours spent in training only granted me the ability to squat >1.5xbodyweight for several repetitons.

A strong urge to berate myself seized me, when I recalled how I have used the past week to read NUSWhispers, instead of reading useful materials to ease my struggles next semester.

My cold-heartedness left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth, as I cruelly rejected scamming beggar aunties and poor tissue sellers at MRT stations. 

And as I reflect upon my wrongdoings and flaws. I ask myself - why am I so weak? If only, someone would teach me how to become a better version of myself.

During school term I keep sleeping for 10 hours or more every day, waking up after 12pm then skip lectures because I missed them. After I finished my finals, now I keep waking up at around 8am :( Whyyyyyyyy

 Out of school, you can choose to work if you want extra income, or just have a rest and meet others.

Then, consider your personality and what you expect in terms of friendships. If you are an extrovert and want to get to know more people, consider signing up for orientation camps.

You may be an ambivert or an introvert but still feel the need to get to know people. Consider the camps carefully, some camps can be more "happening" and may not suit you. 

If you don't see the need to attend camps, then I guess you can try 'orientating' yourself around the business campus and 'important areas' in school, like UTown, MPSH area and YIH. Of course, feel free to walk around the whole campus. The latter two is very much my own opinion, and so it's highly subjective. 

Academics wise, feel free to look up the modules that you'll be taking. Wouldn't harm to read a little on it I suppose.

How do NUS students perceive their school as compared to overseas institutions in the UK/Australia since many more graduates are starting to hail in from those places. Do they feel like it's a threat? 
-
 
A family member passed away last semester and I haven't been the same since. Despite having adequate time to revise, I find myself just blankly staring at the laptop and reading things unrelated to my exams. I'm sorry, lecturers, I'll do better next semester when I'm not in grief or depressed or unmotivated. This will pass, sometime.
-
 
Does anybody knows how exactly are our assignments graded and hence grades assigned? For e.g. if i got a B+ for a essay paper, that grade is an absolute grade or already placed under a bell curve? If it is the latter, does it mean that after all the examinations, the grade is subjected to the curve again??

OP of  here! Thank you everyone for your advice :) OFA offered me the NUS study loan with the $3600 per year allowance, but sadly I'm a girl so I'm not sure if I'll still receive the PSEA top-ups :/  Also, I've submitted my application for Tembusu, hoping that I'll receive a bursary from them as well..

Reading all of your comments have assured me a lot, and it's nice to know that there's lots of nice seniors in NUS :') Having said all that, I'm actually excited for school to start haha! (P.S. when does the registration for SCAMP start?)

Let's do one for us, shall we?

"My major is Life Science." 

"Har, what's that?"

I'm the OP of . I never expect this to get viral, I guess every course is stereotyped in different ways. It's not surprising that not everyone will know what the major is all about because the title are summarized into just 1 or 2 words. As such, one would simply relate your major with the limited domain of knowledge they have. But one thing I cannot "tahan" is people's ignorance towards your explanations and examples you have given. To them, a computer = internet explorer and a phone = candy crush.

In fact, I would like to hear more about other majors from students currently taking them. I often go home googling them after interacting with someone from xxx major. 

In response to , what information security is about the practice of defending/protecting information on the computer. In a nutshell, it's kinda like protecting, understanding, and defending against hackers. Imagine your nude photos are posted on the web because of some vulnerabilities that hackers exploited on your Android/iOS phone and gain access to your camera. Scary ya? 

Woo, hackers? Whenever I get to this point, people will ask me if I could hack into xxx facebook account. Well, to get things straight, technically many of us do know techniques to penetrate a system. But we learned it in order to better understand how systems are being exploited, therefore, able to better protect them. In addition, the penalties from Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act are extremely harsh in Singapore. So don't "play play". 

There are competitions that give you a playing field where you get to practice your "sorceries" without legal implications (google Capture The Flag competitions to learn more). We are commonly known as the "white hat" hackers, as oppose to the "black hat" hackers, who exploit systems for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain. 

Well, if you are interested to learn more, you could join the security interest group known as NUS Greyhats which started recently (Eh, not marketing for them, but I'm happy to receive some marketing fee...). 

Depending on your interest, you could get into various careers. 
I will list some of the ones that I'm hopeful to get into when I've graduated. Malware analyst, where you analysis viruses (ok to prevent scrutiny, I've generalized all malwares as virus) and understand what are the implications on a system. Penetration tester, where you attempt to "hack" into systems to test its defense capability.

Well, this field is getting a lot of interest because of the recent high profile hacking incidents (Sony, Anonymous, iCloud celebrity nude photo leak, etc etc...). Everyone started to realize the potential implications in this tech reliance era and the importance of information security. 

What I've mentioned above are the glamorous portion of my major. But most of the time, the things we learn are extremely dry and theoretical.

Hummm.... I never expect this "nutshell" post to be that long... #coursestereotypes

I find it hard to survive in Mechanical Engineering! Help! Anyone here who feels the same way? No matter how hard you study, you only end up with a good grade of B. I came in without knowing most finals will be weighing around 80%.. which sucks once you leave a 25 mark question blank or screw it up. Having finished the last paper on Monday, I can only pray hard that the Bell Curve God will be nice to me this sem. :/  -Year 2 ME girl

As a YNC student, it pains me to see the elitist mindset that some of my fellow classmates have when it comes to NUS. But please lah these people aren't the majority and they're not worth worrying about. I mean come on, many of us YNC students are actively participating in NUS student groups, and taking NUS classes. And I think it's worth pointing out that we're not the only ones who have shown tension. Last year NUSSU published a ruling, and I quote, "By a 5-2 majority, the Adjudication Committee has held that Yale-NUS students (except those under the YNC-Law DDP) are not members of NUSSU". Many of us were, by that time, members of clubs under NUSSU and very surprised to hear of this. At no point did NUSSU actively engage us in this discussion or address us directly on this ruling. We only heard about it in an email that was sent out to the entire NUS student body. I know the matter was clarified later when some YNC students met with NUSSU representatives, but the lack of inclusivity and sensitivity in the way this matter was initially handled was annoying to us as well. But hey, we got over it and moved on and YNC students are still actively participating in NUSSU student groups.

The purpose of this post was basically to point out that there will always be haters on both sides lah. I wouldn't be so quick to accuse YNC students of throwing the first stone that caused reciprocal antipathy. But it doesn't matter who did because I'm sure everyone wants to move forward, and to do so we gotta start engaging each other more instead of snide remarks like #fakeyale

Most of us spend a great deal of our college life worrying over grades; putting in countless hours just to secure a decent 3 digit figure for our CAP. But really, CAP  isn't all that there is to school; nor is it the most important thing either.

When you graduate and look for a job, most companies (barring the civil service and some banks) don't care much for your CAP. When you walk into an interview, they ask you about your work experience, the major projects you have  done, the multiple pursuits you have engaged in. To them, your CAP doesn't indicate how well you will do in a job because to be honest, most of the stuff you learn in school isn't relevant to the working world anyway. On the other hand, your other experiences tell them what kind of a person you are, what skills or experiences  you have. CAP is just an indicator of how hard you've worked in school. 

And indeed I've seen friends with lower tier honours secure far more lucrative jobs than I, a first class honours graduate, have. Their internships, leadership involvements and projects were far more valuable than that 3 digits to employers. 

It is only now after I've graduated that I realize that; and my advice to all those in school is: Your CAP is but 1 line in your resume, so why spend most of your time for that one line when you can use it to achieve other far more important things?

I'm currently majoring Computer Science focusing on Information Security. For some reasons, a few of my ignorant relatives think that I am studying to become a condo security guard. I used to spend time explaining what Information Security is all about but I've given up. Now when they ask, I just say I am "studying computer". But they would respond, "good good. Next time can work in Sim Lim Square". 

Until now, my dad still doesn't really get what I am doing.

My parents are both history majors while I am a physics major with a focus in nuclear science and particle physics. I am quite certain they do not know what I learn in school. Often they persuade me to accept the notion of world peace and drop hints to me that I should not be constructing a nuclear bomb with the knowledge I learn in school.

Hey if I'm not wrong SUTD also offers architecture! You can try getting into SUTD, it's just as good!
FYI, you can try to appeal and do realise that architecture is not just any course, it's not just one of the many courses that NUS has to offer, it's one of the most competitive courses so grades are very important

 During our 3rd year in uni, I joined a bunch of friends in day trading. Each of us started off with whatever we could afford to lose, ranging anywhere from 5k to 100k. 

We got lucky at first, but in the end those who had no holding power got burnt. 

At the end of that year I counted my profits: I made a 7.5% return, which I was proud of, but because I wouldn't leverage or risk more, it translated to only a few hundred dollars per month for all that effort spent. 

After that, I learned programming, founded a startup and made a million dollars. 

Moral of the story: there is no rush to earn money. Always be a student first. Unless you can get into computing. Then always be a computing student!

This is a reply to . As a graduating student from NUS Archi, let me just tell your friend that he might not be missing much from not getting into this place. If he has the means, I encourage him to go for an education in UK or US instead (AA, Bartlett, Carnegie Mellon, etc. etc.). Even some Australia ones are good. His four (or five) years here will be filled with late nights, frustrating assignments, 50/50 chances of getting good tutors, and a building that literally might kill you with all its fumes and stuffiness. People have gone LOA because of health reasons, and none of us have survived this without and cuts and bruises (physically and mentally). I applaud your friend for trying to contact the dean, and I believe there is still a chance for him if he applies after this attempt to contact. For those with lower academic grades, many have gone through an interview to got in thereafter. (Although interviews are not just for this reason). Get an internship in a reputable local firm before his NS completes, learn more about different architects, talk to more architecture nerds (*Hint: search for archistudent on tumblr [not mine]) and prepare a good portfolio. I don't think he has reached the end of trying yet, and good things always go to those who try even harder.

Posting it here so more people can see this, possibly correct it if it's not true, and help those who are overly stressed about "how much they need to score for finals" (let's face it, worrying doesn't change anything):

Fun fact about 25/75 percentile in IVLE gradebook: single dash means the lecturer chose not to show 25/75 percentile statistics. double dash means you are between 25 and 75 percentile.

People around me think that I am just a typical NUS student with outstanding results from primary school to begin with. No one knows that I used to be an EM3 and a normal stream kid who struggled along the way to land up a spot here in NUS. 

My academic journey wasn't a smooth sailing one to begin with as I had been subjected to many hurtful remarks along the way. Things like "you so stupid you will never make it" and often being looked down by kids from the upper stream, teachers and relatives just because I wasn't academically inclined. I'm sure many people had watched the movie "I not stupid", and yup the movie portrays everything accurately. Only my parents were quite understanding as they themselves are primary school dropouts. So I pulled up my socks and work very hard to enter JC and JC was a hell of a nightmare as I was only a combined science student back then. Miraculously, I managed to secure a spot here in NUS and I didn't expect myself to have made it so far here to be the only kid in my family to reach university and doing a rather unpopular and notoriously difficult science major here.

Hopefully this post can inspire someone out there who feels like giving up and also spur those who are in the midst of studying for finals. Thanks for reading this post. :)

This post is with regards to my best friend who is currently in NS, but trying very hard to apply to his dream course, architecture. He loves drawing, and he does it excellently. (not my biased opinion, but opinion from many) Unfortunately, fate is unkind for his poor academic results do not do justice to his talent. Sometimes I wonder why the selection criterion to enter local universities (excluding institutions like NAFA, Laselle, sports school etc.) is always so fixatedly based on academic grades & outstanding CCA achievements. These 2 aside, assuming a student possesses none of both worlds, but has an evolutionary flair for the course he wants to pursue, are you going to deprive him of the chance to grow his potential? Let me give you an eg. Student A wishes very much to pursue a degree in architecture. Architecture itself is an art form. People who have a creative, witty mind along with artistically inclined talents form the best candidates. It is not an academic course where you'll definitely excel because you are good in H2 Chemistry? Physics? Biology? 

If the student is applying to a highly academic course like Medicine or Law I can understand why an assessment of grades is essential (but EVEN SO, med & law students with straight As don’t necessarily turn out to be the best doctors or lawyers.) Hence, Student A who did not meet the cutoff point for the course he wants fights for his place by drawing up several art works and emailed them to the dean to be considered for discretionary admission. Instead, Dean B replies   ” You have to do it by the normal procedures, I can’t assess you based on this”.  But if I was confident of being accepted based on my academic results I wouldn’t even be going through your channel right, Dean B? 

I mean it puzzles me how schools these days are trying to teach students to “think out of the box” and be “flexible in problem solving” but are not practicing what they preach when it’s time to justify students based on the true worth of their ability. It’s so rigid and fixated on stringent guidelines that may not be an accurate measurement of capability for all. Back to the point, fair enough, Student A did not meet your university’s expectations ACADEMICALLY. But would a chance to interview the student actually kill you? Out of the millions of students the school accepts based on perfect CCA records and grades, how many actually evolve to be the legends of their field? Very few. So why not give those who have an obvious talent a chance? 

Truly, Sg is not devoid of creativity. They are just repeatedly rejected again and again by this flawed system. It’s very easy to advice your friend “ Just go to Laselle la, just go overseas la, go to blab la blah, ) but COME ON, stop kidding yourself. Let’s all face the harsh reality. An architecture degree from top local unis would most likely grant you a more secure head start in your career than the rest. (not implying that the other institutions are lousy, but there’s really this stigma in society about judging one’s worth based on the institution they come from, and it’s definitely more prestigious to be in a local U) Opportunities don’t pop by easily. When a student actually FIGHTS for his chance despite knowing the odds are against him, I feel that the system should likewise be more open-minded in providing these opportunities so that students with extraordinary talents can compete on equal footing with the rest who are good academically.  As quoted by Albert Einstein:

I have spent time worrying about my last paper as in the previous CAs people just did exceptionally well, pulling up the bell curve. I told my concerns to my coursemate whom I have known since secondary school days. Instead of adding on to what I said about the paper, she said that we just have to do our best and be happy with whatever the result we will get. There are many ways to be successful in life. Having good grades is just one of the ways. It is not worthed to be overly stressed with grades. Find your own strengths and make use of them to achieve your dreams. 10 years later we won't even bother with our grades. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't study hard. Just do our best and make sure we won't regret it at the end of the days.

Previous submission was ignored/forgotten/didnt get through.

Much like dentistry students. Btw, we exist. 
Yep, this whisper is part of efforts to make ourselves more known to the rest of NUS. #lonelyus

(And to look for patients. Btw treatments are really really really really cheap here - and quality is assured by... assessors/profs who are specialists in their own fields)

Look out for a friendly dental student around you today! :)

A simple way of looking at it: if the median mark is always awarded a B and every student's mark is always on the curve, then the median CAP would be 3.5. I really don't think NUS students should beat themselves up over a second lower - you're at or above the 50th percentile in Asia's top university after all.

Before anyone starts: it's also silly to compare starting salaries because after several years of work performance-based assessment, comparisons of honours class (or CAP/GPA) tend to become irrelevant.

Once, this coursemate of mine who loves to show off told me how her supposedly well-off boyfriend has been making money by playing stocks. Curious, I asked her how can I join in too. She replied with a smirk," Uhh. XX had a capital of 10k to play with leh. You got 10k anot?" 

At that point, I only have 8k of fluid cash with me. So I just answered no to her. 

As my dad always say," Don't show off and think you're rich because there's many people out there richer than you." 
So, didn't tell her, I actually have another 6 figure sum.

Hi there, I'm an incoming freshie entering science this year. Honestly, I am feeling very stressed out by all the financial issues when I have not even matriculated yet (not sure if it makes sense to post here when I'm not a NUS student yet). I'm very interested in living in a residential college, but the cost of living there worries me a lot and I'm not even sure if I can secure any bursary to fund my stay. I had decided to not get any allowance from my mother since As ended to reduce her burden, and I plan to continue working in university even while staying on campus. There are so many things I would love to join, like SEP, but my family won't be able to afford it. I'm not sure if I should be selfish and pursue my personal interests, or to give them up for the sake my family. It sucks to be in a middle-class family sometimes, because our incomes are too high to receive any financial aid but too low to have much cash to pay for things like this. This is all on top of the $7,950 tuition fee per year.. How do all of you live through university without worrying about that $40k debt waiting for you once you graduate? I know I can only suck it up and slog my way through since I've chosen to continue my education, but I still feel very helpless. :/ 

Sorry for the long (maybe irrelevant) rant, but I couldn't find any other suitable platform to express my thoughts.

Just finished my very last finals paper in NUS today. No, I'm not a graduating year 4 student, but I still sat for my finals to tie up what I started before I leave. I've had enough of university. I don't feel like it has added anything substantially meaningful to my life or as a person, as hard as I have tried to find meaning in it. I'll just find my own way in the world. Goodbye NUS. Though it wasn't always interesting while it lasted, I'm glad I experienced it to judge what a university education meant for me. There is no point in getting a degree just to get that higher starting wage in a future you see little meaning in.

Am I too old or weird or what?

Previously in abnormal psych someone has to take a selfie with everyone slaving over their papers in the background before leaving the hall.

And...

While the papers were being collected and counted, a tutor was taking photos of students.

Say what??? XD

Since NUS is the main university for medical students, I would like to know how medical students view student nurses. Do you see yourself as being above them or on par with them in the sense that both nursing and medicine are professions and it take skills and training to do the job. Are you medical students willing to teach and impart your knowledge to them after all we will be working together in the near future. I'm a fellow nursing student and have some anxiety issue especially when working and being around junior doctors/ medical students. I just blank out when I'm around them. I'm having a major attachment soon and a lot of my skills involve working and communicating with Drs and I'm afraid that I will mess up and get scolded lols. Any advice? Anyways I think it would be nice if there was some kind of kindness between the whole healthcare team. It would make working so much less shitty. Just my two cent worth though
Do not hesitate to give your honest opinion :)

Being a chem eng student feels like constantly trying to row against the current. Everyone else is either crazily smart or crazily hardworking or both.

I am completing NS and entering NUS SOC this year. I have heard about the camps and info session from NUSWhispers. But other than that, no details have been given out.

I have offers from NUS and NTU. I heard that it may be easier to get first or second class honours in NTU than NUS. A better honours have higher pay in the civil service and banks which I am aiming for. Is there any truth in this as the better students generally go to NUS and both bell-curve students?

Advice to prospective Computer Science undegraduates, please switch to other courses. A CS degree is a waste of time and money as you can pick up everything on your own. You do not need a CS degree to teach you how to program. Online courses from Coursera or books are better than SoC's curriculum.

Take a degree like Arts or Business where classroom interaction is something that cannot be replicated outside school. Hard engineering like civil or mechanical is also ok as they are difficult to study those on your own.

Everything except CS. #graduatingCSSenior

Had my last paper in my uni life on the 29th. I have not started on my job hunting yet. Feeling a little lost because the 'unemployed status' came too suddenly. I am also not going for any graduate trip and feel that I am left out. I would like to get some advice. My result is not too good (CAP of 3.75 with Honours). Is it better for me to apply all the jobs at one go? So that offers come around the same time? What if I get an offer which I am not too sure if I want? But I am scared that no other offers would come by if I rejected it.

Hi everyone, my CAP will be just 3.0+ (sem2, year 1) cuz I have not studied hard for this sem, but I really want to go for NOC, I intend to apply in sem2 next year and I will try as hard as I can in the next sem to pull up my grade. Do I have any chance to get the offer??? If cannot, with that CAP, can I apply for SEP?

for goodness sake 30% class part for a class size of 30 to 50 is just madness. education becomes a competition rather than a holistic learning process if the class size is too big and everyone is required to participate. discussive classes should be significantly smaller. moreover for very general subjects, at least one other person in the room would be thinking of the same idea as you. and the teacher always has to choose from a plethora of hands. gosh.

Stackexchange: "There are many ways to learn how to code. 48% of respondents never received a degree in computer science. 33% of respondents never took a computer science university course. System administrators are most likely to be self-taught (52%). Enterprise level services developers are most likely to have an industry certification (13%). Machine learning developers and data scientists are 10 times more likely than any other developer type to have a PhD (15%)."

I hope I don't kenna blacklisted by my prof because tried to test whether he is corrupted. I stapled a $50 note to my lecture notes before meeting him and i flipped to that particular page during the consultation and pretend to ask him a question "eh prof can you teach me this formula...blah blah blah...". I'm amazed that he also pretend to not notice that $50 note, he even flip up the $50 note and reveal the formula underneath and started teaching me. 

This time gg liao T.T I want to email him and apologize...but what should i say??? "prof ..actually im doing a social experiment for my gem mod....etc."? FML!!

Respect to all student athletes. Training intensively while having to juggle with academics is tough. I have friends who wake up early in the wee hours to train, then head back to school to attend lessons, then train again in the evening, then completing work at night. The cycle repeats the next day. Kudos to you guys for bringing pride to teamNUS and even if you guys don't win, you have already won in our hearts! Never give up, and keep on fighting hard, with your heart.

Today I had the final for GEM1536. I really like this module and totally respect the lecturer, Dr John van Wyhe. He is of a mischievous and humorous character and his lectures is never short of laughter. And in the mean time he is a rigorous, able, and responsible historian, having read almost everything about Darwin and Wallace and bravely speaks up when the mainstream ideas are not supported by enough evidence. I am glad that I have chosen this module with this interesting topic and this wonderful lecturer . I think the result of the exam is not anymore important as I have already been inspired a lot and being inspired is the sole reason I study in NUS.

I hesistate for a while before I decide to share this as many would think I am a troll. Nevertheless,I feel that I could only get it off my mind by sharing it.

I am a year 3 com sci student and had been staying in PGP throughout my school life. In order to destress myself and satisfy my hunger for lust, I would visit escorts, known commonly as FLs, near the school area. There was one incident though when I manage to meet an engine girl through such service. After our session at the fragrance hotel behind our school, we went to had supper at Ameens and that's how I know her story. Her parents were average office workers in China and they didn't remit her enough money for her daily meals. Even though her tuition fees were paid for by MOE, she didn't have any allowance and has to resort to such jobs as she has a limit on how many hours to work in Singapore under a student pass. I am sharing this not to shame her but to let the rest know that our fellow foreign students may be fortunate enough to study and stay in NUS but you never know their sad plight, especially those without enough allowance. So please think twice before complaining about their habits, lack of shower, or whatever you might think is disgusting as they may have reasons behind everything they do.

"Anyone found writing will be subject to disciplinary action that may result in his or her expulsion"
It's false, true story. Reported someone a while back for writing all the way till the script was collected from him. Had to sign a declaration with name, matric et. al., but the examiners said that the culprit will only get a few points docked.

In fact I felt like I was in the wrong for reporting him. Never going to do it again.

For the many of you who're worried over the CS1010E/S finals, please don't let it affect your mood to study for your other papers. The finals for this module is usually a killer paper, so not doing well for this paper doesn't mean you're definitely gonna get a bad grade.

When I was in year 1 I had the finals for CS1010E and EG1109 on the same day. Both are killer papers where I could barely answer a quarter of the questions in each paper. It was the first time in my life I handed in empty booklets during an exam (EG1109 has 4 color booklets for 4 questions during my time). But at the end of the exam I wasn't really bothered because I saw many ppl submiting empty booklets too. End of the day I still managed to get A- for both modules.

So, don't worry so much about it because what you do now isn't gonna change your results. Worry about your remaining papers, because that is where you can still make a difference.

as a year 4 student, a brother to my younger sis, a hall resident, a jcrc member, a technical field major, a tuition teacher, one advice i always give my students and people who ask me about university is to enjoy studying and everything other than studying. truth is, its hard because of the inverse proportionality relationship between time and studies. with regard to that, if you know your cap is not gonna impress, do impress others with other aspects of your life! (not intentionally of course u fake f***, but from your heart) your hobbies, interests, other skills u might underestimate yourself for... hone them! because ultimately, u are trying to stand out for the crowd so u would get selected for a job. but that is the secondary reason, cuz the primary reason is that u love what u are doing. for me, i enjoy teaching, community service, organizing events, and i am passionate about these activities not for the resume but it is a part of me. of cuz, like my sis, many people know not where their strength lies, but such fears of doing something you have never done before should be undermined by that of knowing that you have the last 3/4 years in uni to make mistakes without paying too heavily for them. that experience, isnt it the same experience that u pay for at work before u job hop? only now, u dont get punished too heavily should u screw up. NUS is a wonderful place to learn more about yourself. friends, finals are temporary and experience is forever :) 
bad cap is only bad when the only thing u did in 3/4 years is study :p

I'm a yr 2 science student with a cap of only 2.5 (likely to drop further this sem). Im aware my chances of going to honors year are slim, so this summer is probably the only time i can do internship/SEP. But, with my low cap, its impossible to go for SEP, and finding internship seems quite difficult too. I have currently no plans for summer at all. 

Looking at how things are going, i might graduate without a honors degree and also with zero internship experience. Im pretty sure this will affect the chances of me finding a job next time,right? 

Honestly speaking, I'm not very interested to work in the industry im currently studying, but yet I'm still not sure what my interests are and what i wanna work as in future. It's really frustrating to feel so lost at this period of time. I've considered going into the media industry but this means i most likely needa take up a private degree elsewhere. Idk if thats a good choice though. 

Can anyone give me some advice? Your help will be greatly appreciated:)

 Shoutout to you, wish there are more people like you. I feel so old now too haha :)

 While you cannot change the situation of everyone going together, you still can have fun and enjoy yourself during the trip by focusing on the good things and hanging out in smaller group of friends that you are closer with during the trip.

 You can post on your facebook to find other friends or travel alone and explore Asia. If you have more budget you can go to Europe. Travelling solo is quite liberating, you will learn more things about yourself and the places that you go to :)

 Unfortunately there is no right time to confess, you have to trust and go with your gut feeling. If he/she already likes you back, it does not matter even if you screw up during the confession. 

 You have a degree and NUS has taught you the ability to learn, I believe you will be able to find a job. Just go at your own pace and it is more important to find a right job that suits you instead of rushing into accepting an offer just because everyone else got a job already

 The real reason hurts more but you should tell the real reason as it is better for both parties. The guy can learn from the reason why it did not work which will help him to avoid the mistake in future.

 Taken note. Thanks. There's still time to find out more from his friends, I guess. Looking at the confessions and his recent posts, I'll think twice.

So we had a group project for a module and I was up against all these lazy folks who wouldn't do any work, or would simply make lame excuses like oh I have two other papers due, come on we're in the same major ok!??! I have the same things due. But yes, anyway, there were peer ratings, and they all purposefully rated me far lower than I deserve when I DID ALL THE WORK, I know this because they all got a B+ grade, and I got a B-. And the only differences among us is the peer rating! Why do profs come up with this system of assigning ratings to people? Why do I get punished for trying to me nice to them so they don't fail so badly -.-

I am rarely in school due to playing Hearthstone consistently. The only time when I do go to school is 1 day before assignment deadlines.

As long as I am in my "survival mode" I can study any module within 1 day. I don't understand why people need to mug so hard when I can learn pipelining in 5 minutes.

My only worry for the future is that I am not able to find a pretty girlfriend. Why don't SoC girls be as pretty as A-pink's Eunji?

I am what people call an evergreen. I always longed to experience love but to no avail. But its good now that I am in Mechanical Engineering! This sem, I noticed this guy sitting with a bunch of friends during the ME core mods. He usually comes 5-10mins late and I recently found out he drives a black sedan. Oh, and if I am not wrong, I think he is in one of the NUS IVP teams, probably bowling? Oh! And I am a Year 2! Can someone tell me who is he? I really want to know if he is still available or not! Thanks in advance and good luck for your exams! <3

 wow you are an insensitive prick aren't you. There's stuff called financial aid and working while studying to pay for the fees.

"I only stay in condo". Only? That's why you can pay for your sch fees you twat. Staying in a condo is already a mid - tier luxury, if not a high end - tier one.
-
  
 wow what a spoilt brat. 

Some of us come from families which might face trouble paying 3or 4 years of fees, which is why we fought so hard to get scholarships plus work our ass off during holidays for some pocket money for the sem. Partly also why we forgo sep/grad trip. We don't want to burden our parents as it is.

Not everyone is as entitled as you, being from "an average family" that lives in a condo.

I am a final year student and i am always the top for my cohort( regular dean lister..). However, I got problems finding a job that I really like and people around me who are also graduating with lousier honours than me have already gotten a job. I mean what have they done to deserve it? I work my socks off for my 1st class and have so many deans list awards that anyone else would be jealous of.

All I am asking for is a good job befitting of my status as a top student, with good pay, good bonuses, good working hours. Those around me do not deserve getting employed before me. What have they done with their studies as compared to me? Life is so unfair and miserable.

 Ask your parents to pay for you lah! I don't believe anyone who could be so poor and still study in NUS. I came from an average family by the way as I only stay in Condo, unlike my richer landed property friends. Even my parents has no trouble paying my school fees so stop whining.

Don't be disheartened! I, too, was an underachiever back when I was a freshmen. I did not understand most of what was taught and struggled to grasp even the most basic concepts (*cough*cs1231*cough*). I studied like hell and only managed to get into the third class range even though I was an AAA/A student back in JC. I did not attend any freshmen camps, nor did I have any friends I could study with or seek help from. I could not get help from professors because I didn't even know what I don't know. I heeded my dad's advice on learning how to study and here's what he said: Observe how other people study. There has to be a certain common pattern/quality among them that is lacking within you. Befriend them, seek help from them and I am sure they will be willing to help if you are sincerely humble and willing to learn. Also, experiment with methods and eliminate those that will not work. For example, study in groups, draw charts and diagrams to visualize and connect things/concepts more accurately, revise your coursework weekly or even right at the end of the day, clarify instantly with the professors after lectures, setting reachable and realistic goals, time management, consultations with TAs to clarify tutorials/PYPs, etc. It is the little things you try which will make you understand more about yourself as to how you learn best. So don't be hesitant on making new/more friends or try out new study techniques. I am now entering my final year and I have managed to figure out what works best for me. I am now crawling back towards second upper which was a goal I set out to accomplish. Do not give up as I believe that you have it within you! All the best.

P.S. RIP grammar, it is late into the night.

Hi everyone. It's examinations period and i'm feeling very ill. Would any senior be willing to share what the procedure is like if i report sick?

The run for internships is so stressful. Banks and finance companies only hire top class students, not to mention that they hire a lot of their client's relatives. Without being rich yourself, with only slightly above average grades are not enough. This past year after writing 80+ tailored letters and resumes, with each at least 30mins each, the amount of interview is just so little. How am I going to get a banking job when I can't even have the opportunity to get internship? Even with multiple networking mentors it's also not working, it so hard when u don't come from a rich family. Even hardworking also just  can't beat top class. I just want to get out of poverty.

The burgeoning amount of foreign scholars is really rendering us apprehensive. But, what I would like to share is that, I got into math, with A level results of only BBC/C. I am currently a Year 1, I too know the amount of competition we are plagued with. I did reasonably well, with CAP 4.3 in the first sem, I think that it is really about practicing the right questions. Don't do questions which are similar, so as to save time, instead, what I can suggest is that look at a range of different questions, asking for different things. It is really not about the quantity, but the quality of your revision, going by the old adage. Good luck for finals, and don't give up! Cheers!

I wonder if NUS will force us to use the "New IVLE" next semester, because...I don't really want to..

I am replying to the girl who has a cap of 2.35. I am a guy with a similar CAP in FASS Econs, and I felt like a dumpshit among my friends who are dean listers. 

You must not give up. A shit-grade student like me, still can get into a big 4 consultancy firm in Tokyo. Use me as your motivation maybe? It is your other aspects, your personality, your ability to think and your heart that matter. No one will eventually care about your grade and whatever achievement in school.

Reading  , I remembered I had a question I wanted to ask. Do you guys really like Banking jobs? Why? Is it because of $$$? I don't understand the appeal.

There seem to be a lot of Computing people here, so maybe one of you knows the answer to this question? 

My question: I saw this user "khankuan" on Carousell with a listing "Software Developer Position". The curious thing is that the stated price is $-1.20. Any idea how he managed to input a negative number?
-
  
Everytime i go for consultation, I always have the urge to shaft a 100 dollar note to the prof. I wonder how many NUS prof can be corrupted by money.

Just a thought ....
-
  
IS there a way we can know our FYP grades? do we email the prof to ask? isit ok to do so?:( i really wan to know my grades to determine how hard i should be studying for final year. 
-
  
I'm one of those girls who float around NUS with a cap of 2.35, but it's not like I never studied, I did... During my freshmen years I slogged and toiled hard for my cap, I studied way way way much harder than I ever did for my A levels, I mug and mug and mug like there's no tmr but only end up getting C+ average for all my core, I have no CCA and no commitments and just study as hard as I can but I always get lousy grades macam lousy person with lousy grades, I know that there's a way to study smart but nobody teach me and I have a feeling I'll never figure it out; friends dun teach n professor dun teach n google also dun teach... (Applied math is very different from A level math) Sometimes I wish that we can have a separate bellcurve for Singaporeans and foreign talent because the foreign talent came here on a scholarship and that means that they are elites of their own country, they're like the rafflesians of their country... How to compete...
Anyway I'm now approaching the middle of my undergraduate journey and when I tried so hard only to fail again and again, when I've tried my hardest only to have failure slap me in the face, I just...sorta give up. Now I don't even care to study anymore and I just don't have the strength nor motivation to strive anymore...I feel like it's useless to try anymore... 
I just...sorta became those ppl floating around hoping to just get a pass degree...
Deep in my heart I dunno if I should give up though...but something tells me that I'm just gonna end up with C no matter how hard I try

Due to start a UROPS this coming sem and I've heard that it's gonna be tough. Getting the jitters now. Any advice from those who have done UROPS? I am a life science student.

I enjoy stressing and distracting people during exams. For eg, during one of my CS practical exam, I ran a code such that it keeps generating rubbish stuff and put it on half of my screen to distract people sitting behind me. Or during a multiple choice exam, I would throw a dice before a shade my answer. Most of the time I would overhear people talking about me after exams, like how crazy I am.

closed book exams with cheatsheet. what's the whole point if all the answers are just going to be coming from the notes and it a battle of 'who-can-cram-more-words-in-a-sheet-of-paper'? 
though it's still better than having no cheatsheet, but the process of writing the cheatsheet always kills my hands and eyes

Hi prof Ben,
I'm not in SoC but I want to learn programming. Where and how do you recommend I start and what platform should I use?

Thanks! (:

My CAP was not good enough for SEP so I applied for Summer Exchange since there was supposedly no minimum CAP requirements. That's bullshit. I wasn't even called up for an interview.

Would like to ask for comments and opinions regarding the Bachelor of Computing in Information Security (whose first batch of students will matriculate in AY2015/16)! I have been offered a place for AY2017/18, and also simultaneously offered a place in NBS BBA. This is coming from someone who has no background in Computing, but an interest in Info. Security.

I got offers for both NUS and NTU Accountancy. My parents are encouraging me to take the NTU one since I can finish in 3 years with honours and thus have extra one year working experience too. 

I seek a second opinion, is there anything extra offered by NUS Accountancy that warrants that extra year in school?

Somebody give the hiring manager of  a medal already for stating the harsh reality and giving valued advice. We should invite him to give a career talk in NUS. 

Anyway, I’m a graduating Computing student, where do I send my CV to you?

-
  
Can we stop talking about how choosy Computing graduates are and 4k pay? It is probably just a few black sheep that gives all of us an elitist bad name.

Most of the average Computing folks are quite humble and will accept if the pay is reasonable.  I for one will be paid at the median 3.5k in my new job and am contented with it.

My Computing friends, please do not ask too much if not you may drive away those companies leaving us worst off.

Truth be told, 6 sems of Business modules later, they are all fluff. Not even sure if I should continue.

4 years ago, I probably denied a student of a place in NUS because I only told NUS in July that I wasn't going there after all. Now, having witnessed my friends in NUS slogged away for 4 years, I'm so glad I escaped the local education system. Nevertheless, for most of you, your first degree is in sight. Congratulations. (While I am slogging away for my masters elsewhere in the world...)

Waiting for more frustrated employers to post so I can learn about expected salary and work commitments in the comments

I've been following NUSWhispers for a few days and I'm particularly intrigued by the expectation of $4000 pay and healthy work-life balance by Computing graduates.

I’m a hiring manager at an MNC where a starting pay of $4000 is indeed what we offer to fresh IT grads in our Singapore office. This is in response to a tight labour market and difficulty in filling the role with non-Singaporeans. 
The problem is not about the pay per se, many Singaporean graduates want to begin with a managerial position immediately instead of starting work from the ground up. This is not an isolated incident, significant numbers of candidates make this request and give up the offer even if we politely tell them they will reach the managerial level after some years of good performance. 

Another problem is the expectation of healthy work-life balance. Let me define our working hours lest somebody say we are vague, we don’t expect you to work more than the stipulated 44-hour, 5-day week unless urgent issues emerge which you will be fairly compensated with extra off-days. 2 weeks of paid-vacation time are given on top of the 14-day leave which will increase according to length of service. You can work from home if the job scope allows and if there are no meetings. With such generous benefits, many candidates are still dissatisfied!

I do not venture to say that Singaporean graduates are self-entitled but you guys are making my job harder than it is. You are fortunate that the job market is in your favour now but when the inevitable recession hits, it will not be a job seekers market anymore. 

 is not wrong to compare to China and India although as  has rightfully pointed out, most of their universities are not up to par. However, the truth is that the standards of Chinese and Indian graduates are improving year after year. The standard of NUS has pretty much stagnated as it is unlikely to supersede the Ivy-League universities in the foreseeable future. For the Asian giants, the only way is up and they are making huge annual improvements. 

Even at a pay of $4000 with benefits, I’m forced to justify to headquarters why are we paying so much when we can hire 2 or 3 Chinese/Indian graduates with the same amount who are hungrier and are willing to do more. Unlike American or European graduates, most, but not saying all, of the NUS graduates don’t have the creative spark, communications skills and risk-taking mentality of those from Western universities. If I may be blunt and generalise a little, you are China/India++ with less + as time goes by.

I hope with my input, readers of this will understand the competition they are truly facing globally. I may not agree with how the startup owner of  has phrased his post but there are some merits to the gist of his words. I have been through many economic cycles and seen how graduates adjust their behaviour according to the economic climate of the day. Right now, you guys are having it good but experience tells me the good times never last forever. 

My parting advice to young graduates: you can try to ask for certain things but make sure you feel you truly deserve them. Adjust your altitudes and expectations and keep improving, for one day, somebody else will steal your lunch and the good times will never return.

I felt rather cheated when I received my rejection from UHMS this semester. I'm a year 3 student staying in Pasir Ris, and for the past 4 semesters I have applied twice per semester, paying the administrative fee each semester, for a place to stay, and have been rejected every time. What is the probability of that? Isn't it just that there are no actual places left, but they leave the system open so that they can farm the administrative fee? They really should reveal the available number of places as well as competition, to be fair. 
-
  
 You should be happy that you are in a STEM course. Besides professional courses or STEM ones, I personally feel some courses like Biz are just fluff and generic and the job market is just saturated with them too (of course NUS biz is still better than those from the private unis). Then again maybe they are here to hone their skills and build networks. Hope I don't offend Anyone!

Sorry lah I very free keep checking whispers. I'm the one who asked about the second lower honors. Then in an instant a 'helpful' guy kindly 'adviced'. Honestly lah some commenters ah last warning. 
I posted under "advice" and commenters be like "if you still have to ask might as well leave" whatthebloodyfark? It may sound stupid to you but it's not to me? If this commenters are so passive aggressive might as well cancel out advice section on nus whispers.

Hi everyone! In case you are unable to log in on the PYP Downloader app, do not be alarmed. The PYP Downloader app is working fine; it's because there has been some disruption in the exams paper database.

Please be patient while NUS fixes the problem.
To , I'm from business and I'm offended that you claim our mods are easy.

Taking the so called easier business mod does not mean we can do well, in fact, we have to score close to perfect in order to beat the bell-curve, one careless mistake and there goes our A or even B. I would prefer tougher modules where there is still room to make mistakes.

Anyway, doesn't your mod have a bell curve too? If your mods are as difficult as you claim, the bell-curve will help you eventually. 

Regardless, please don't go preaching about which faculty has easy or hard modules based on that single module you have taken.
-
  
Hi guys can you tell me is second lower honours good enough? I read a lot of forum that says that second lower might as well don't get. I do know that there are people with third class, no offense just really want to know. It determines whether I need to pay an extra year of school fees or not.  So I want to know is it worth that 1 more year of time and money. 
-
  
What's up with this stereotype that a science degree is "useless" and graduates can only be teachers or work in labs.

the first thing people ask me when I say I'm from FoS is why I wanna "end up as a teacher".. eh you being from engine or biz doesn't make you that much better than us okay. Why are you looking down on us? And especially on teachers? #angst

Taking a leave of absence to do internship this sem. Having read the confessions, made me realize, that uni is actually pretty fun (including the exams, yes, I'm not kidding). Really miss the school now. Oh well...

Happy "studying"!

Got an A for a project that we literally started 2 days before submission; got a C for an assignment I worked my ass off for. Suddenly the world seems totally meaningless and random
-
  
 It's a guess. But the class size is small and the mean for each assignment is around 90%. To get 0 points you would have to not submit anything at all and it's hard to imagine there's more than one person giving zero fks about their grades. Not that I mind, because bell curve.
-
  
to  they are probably from courses such as BME or MSE with a pretty balanced guy-girl ratio HAHA
-
  
So utterly slaughtered by CS1010e.
Level of understanding C programming after 1 sem: ridiculously low. 
The markers must be having an easy time marking my script because there isn't much for them to mark.  
-
  
Uh... Actually, FoE has quite a bit of ladies. It depends on where you actually go to. Of course, courses such as mechanical, electrical or civil engineering might have the ratio a bit off, but if you actually look at chemical engineers, esp students, bioengineers, etc., they have a relatively better ratio of guys to ladies.
-
  
I don't get why people study so hard for exams. The exams are not that hard. Just 1 day to prepare for each module is enough for me to score well. This is especially true for business mods. A lot of them are really dumbed-down versions of modules from other departments/faculty like stats, ISE, or math. 
I have never gotten lower than B, and I have only scored B for 1 module. 
-
  
To  are there even girls in mechanical, electrical and civil engineering? enlighten me? my heart goes out to the guys in these engineering courses

This is just a question that has been bugging me. I am just curious and hope to know more. To all faculty of science students, what do you want to work as in the future? (apart from teaching, or joining the arm force)
-
  
Just checked the grade book on IVLE for one of my modules to see how well I need to do for finals. Then I realised there has been someone getting 0 for every assignment which total at 60% of the module. That's hardcore
-
  
Every semester I will first fail an exam then make use of that frustration and regret to get A's for the rest. - No pain, no gain.

Hey SSA2215 people. Anyone else getting very pek cek studying Dr GO's half of the textbook? :( It feels like 80% geographical jargon that isn't even explained. The worst part is having to memorise all this stuff and obscure details that I don't understand word for word. Cos god forbid it comes out for the fill-in-the-blanks section. 
Oh well sorry if you aren't taking this mod. Just had to rant. All the best for finals guys :)
-
  
Imagine this: a friend asked for your notes two days before the exam because he missed most of the lectures with no webcasts provided. What would you do? Shall I feel guilty for turning him down? :/

If I get a fake degree and put it in my resume subtly together with my NUS degree, will that give me more advantage?

There is this cute girl in math tutorial that always sit next to me. We had a few eye contacts but never really talk. After the exam this morning, we may see each other for the last time. If only math is not so difficult, I would have taken another math module just to see her.
-
  
Really thanks to NusWhisper page that i now know that i'm not the only one struggling with a 2+ cap, evergreen at the age of 20+ and at a lost of what to do after graduating.
-
  
 ...and you have just explained the special cases in http://blog.nus.edu.sg/provost/2012/01/20/the-bell-curve/ . Also "not required to award any Ds", well that's exactly what "up to 5%" means now does it? 0% is still within the range for "up to 5%".

Its true not all mods are curved, but that does not mean failures are never curved.
-
  
Guys, do you have idea how not to be a CAP-driven person? I did some silly mistakes in the exam today and I think it will affect my grades badly since the bellcurve is steep and thinking about it is killing me. I tried not to think too much but it is kinda hard not to think about the grades (maybe after years of doing it). Sometimes, I just envy those who dont really worry too much about their grades.
-
  
 Die liao lor. Advice: rederive all the formulae your lecturers gave.
-
  
 wrong, failures and Ds are not curved. Those are awarded to all students who score below a certain threshold. If for instance every student does well, well above the threshold, the examiner may not be required to fail any student or award any Ds. So, you wouldn't fail just because you scored 80% but happened to be the last in a very competent class.

Although it is true that not all students can be awarded As even if the entire class did extremely well.

In response to , I believe you are not from Computing. A pay of 4K is actually a reasonable starting pay for Computing graduates this days. Most government agencies offer that amount if you have a good Honours degree so if a private company cannot match that, they will have to settle for lower-quality candidates.

There is a reason why a median is called a median and it is a fact that other graduates from Law, Medicine and Finance ask for even higher starting pay of over 5K. Are they being self-entitled? It is just a reflection of the (entry) difficulty of the course and the supply/demand of those graduates.

Unlike degrees from other faculties, the work Computing students do even at the internship level can have huge real world impacts. Just ask students who have returned from Google who can “push code that affect millions”. Of course not every Computing student can work for Google but the work we do scales more than those of other industries.

Why are we using China and India as a benchmark? It is a known fact that other than a few top universities, most of their tertiary institutes are not at the NUS level of quality. Our productivity and training justifies our pay. One can see major overseas tech companies employing our top Computing graduates at 6-figure annual salaries. This reflects well on the quality of an NUS Computing education and many employers recognise this. 

I’m similarly appalled that you find a healthy work-life balance as an unacceptable request for a fresh grad. Different people attach different definitions to work-life balance. The OP who originally started this was a startup owner, perhaps his idea of a work-life balance is anything less than 10-hour work days, 6-days a week. It is the right of the job candidate to negotiate this with the potential employer and failing that, just look for another job. Everybody has the right to walk away if they cannot reach an agreement. Not negotiating only places you at risk of being taken advantage of. 

Remember, the aim of employers in salary negotiations is to pay you just above the minimum salary so you wouldn't leave. It is your responsibility to fight for what you think you deserve.

-
  
Somebody on this page said it actually takes effort to fail your papers.

I'm going to confirm that its true: only up to 5% of the bell-curve is allocated for failures (including Ds which some people may argue is a totally legit "pass", but that's for another argument). The difference between retaking the mod and getting away with your terrible grade is little to none and for most intents and purposes up to the Prof's discretion.

If you're getting Fs: I'm sorry man, I also don't know what heck you are doing. Perhaps a change in faculty would do you good?
-
  
Am I the only one who wants a lower paying job but relatively more relaxing?

Is it normal that questions in PC1432 finals require higher level understanding unlike plug-in-formula ones? Or am I just screwed for this Thursday? :(

Was just talking about internships and post-graduation jobs, and my friends and the people around me seem to have it all planned out already, e.g. finance-industry related internship in Year 1, then IB in Year 2, then Venture Cap in Year 3... Everyone seem to have it all set and decided. I don't even know where I want to go, and how I want to get there; I just want to bring value to the world and it doesn't seem to be enough. :/ And when I talk about how lost I am, the response I got was to maybe spend the summer sorting it out (myself) and getting it straight. It's almost like it's criminal not knowing where you want to go.

Welp!
-
  
To  , I think being too arrogant is not good either. People do not just get B or C. Its with your "excellent" types of grades that they dont get their As. You should learn to appreciate others hardwork and dont be too judgemental.
-
  
Reading , it's appalling how tech employees are undervalued by Singapore companies.

Assume you have a startup doing $10,000 revenue every month, would you pay $4000 a month for an employee who can bring you 10% growth month over month or $8000 for an employee who can bring 20%? I think the answer is clear and $16,000 a month for an employee who can bring 40% growth is really cheap. Never underestimate the growth of exponential growth.

Besides 9 out of 10 startups fails, so providing compensation of a good salary, with extra benefits or equity is the least you can do to pay a fair price for these employees to take risks working at your startup. Because if you don't and your competitors can, they will grow fast and eat your lunch. 

At the end of the day, if you are not willing to pay a fair price to employees, save that 4K. Do all the work yourself or employ someone at Fiverr. Just don't call yourself a 'startup' -- that's a lifestyle business. And it's certainly better than a 'startup' that doesn't want to pay a fair price.

It's time 'startups' like you put your money where your mouth is. Start paying a right price for people to grow your company or you will go the way of the dinosaur.

I'm officially not addicted to 9gag anymore. Not going to waste time scrolling through meaningless post after post. I'm going to be less distracted and more focused on what deserves my attention. Things have officially changed.

How easy is it to fail a CS4k module as a final sem CS student? I have 4 of those modules and I don't want to find out in the middle of my grad trip that I need to extend one sem because I failed something. I think I did just okay for my CAs and midterms but I'm struggling to finish revising all the material for all my mods for finals.
-
  
Unlike many of my friends, I do not skip lectures. Even if I have an assignment deadline on that day itself, I will not skip any lectures. Why? Firstly, almost all of my lectures have no webcast. Secondly I constantly have this paranoia of the professor going through a very important topic or giving some exam tips. 
Thus if the lecture is very boring, I will just browse reddit or 9gag during lecture.   
-
  
Some people like to mention that work-life balance is a privilege, not a right. To those who believe this kind of people, please wake up. You only have one life. Do not waste it. Why slog for some SMEs or MNCs in the golden years of your life when you can better spend it traveling the world and enjoy it? Since you can't settle down in both scenarios, you will be better off enjoying it. Just take a look at this article if you believe that traveling around the world is impossible.

YOLO!

How does the admin of NUSWhispers actually decide which confessions to be published and which to be rejected? Just curious.

I think fresh grad salaries are so low because, in the first place, people are willing to work for so little. A case of graduates not holding their own qualifications to high enough standards?

P.S.: 4 years of NUS = enough vacation time to accumulate 1 solid year of work experience. Even more if you work during the semesters. Employers usually think that's great, by the way.. it reflects competent multitasking and time management, and with a stronger sense of responsibility than most of the competition. Who needs first class honours when you have that?

To 

You blatantly copied the original NUS Confession from here https://www.facebook.com/nusconfessions/posts/466433153432987  

Fortunately, an excellent rebuttal to this has already been posted there. I hope the OP of the rebuttal will silently approve of this reposting.

https://www.facebook.com/nusconfessions/posts/467233546686281

"For the confessor who extolled the benefits of SMU vs NUS and NTU, here is a few words for you. NUS is GLAD to lose potential students like you. I give you the benefit of the doubt and hope you are not a troll. I actually suspect you are female given that you got your A-Levels results and can enter Uni on the same year. But no one cares about your gender anyway. Just pointing out it is possible not all trolls/confessors are male.

Having not experienced Uni life yet, it is a complete and utter generalisation to pigeonhole NUS as a rote-learning university. It clearly shows you know nuts about NUS, modules with projects and classroom interaction are common even for a technical student like I am.

If distance is such a significant factor for you, you are welcome to stay in the halls. The journey to your class will then be just a short shuttle bus ride away. Probably better than traveling from home to SMU right?

Are you aware that NUS students are required to take General modules and modules outside of faculty? You don't need to be forced to take a second major to increase your breadth. In fact, a second-major may limit the number of modules you can take outside of your 2 main majors. For a generally business focused Uni like SMU, my opinion on this is that it is a disadvantage compared to NUS. You cannot deny that SMU offers far less and a smaller range of modules compared to NUS or even NTU. If you wish to argue on breadth, I claim that it is NUS and NTU that "wins hands down".
In my technical major, foreign competition is definitely proportionally greater compared to non-technical fields. You are wrong to say all of them are scholarship holders. Some of them are, but many are not. Nevertheless, it is just a matter of time before you face foreign competition. Maybe not in your major but definitely in the workplace. We may be a high-wage country, but I dare say the quality of our graduates exceeds many of the millions that the world's universities produce, not just China and India. Do you want to swallow the red pill now or eat the blue pill in the university life then a bigger red pill when you graduate?

With that remark of yours, you may have made an (un)intentional personal attack to students in Faculty of Science, Engine and School of Computing. The choice of major is not taken lightly by everyone. It is true some students have not much choice because of academic results. But I'm pretty sure the vast majority in those faculties knew of the competition they would face but still chose the course. It is the interest despite the difficulties that drove us to select them. Who are you to criticise our decision?

Business in SMU better because it is a business Uni? Have you heard of this term T-shaped professionals? From the evidence I have given above, I dare say NUS and NTU are more likely to produce such graduates given the exposure we get across multiple disciplines. I shall also point out a fact that an NTU business prof has been recently rated to be the best in the world. Don't let me even come to the faculty rankings.

You also hit a contradiction when you said you preferred a curriculum with has breadth but want a university specialising in business. So what do you want?

The conclusion: There is no denying that NUS is not a perfect university. Some of the points you raised may have merit. However, you should experience Uni life first before attempting to suggest improvements in a know-it-all manner. The way you put things actually struck an idea in me. Perhaps NUS can open up the Part 1 of Special Term to enable potential students to experience what it is like to study in NUS before they make their final decision."

 NUS business 10th percentile was AAA/C, SMU's BBB/B. (Grades aside): I like how you used the phrase American pedological teaching to justify the amount of shame you guys have to endure when ya'll dress up as waiters for presentations and all. And lastly, if you really had the ability then why didn't you go to NTU then? A 3 year honours degree beats SMU latinised honours ranking any day imo-
-
  
Having just gotten my A-Level results at the start of the year, I applied for and had offers in NUS/NTU Engin and SMU Business. I chose SMU business for my place this year. I'm confessing here to explain why I did so and how NUS/NTU have lost potential students like me. 

Rote-learning vs American seminar style pedagogy. Need I say more? NUS/NTU place more emphasis on rote-learning and exams vs SMU. What day and age is this now? Rote learning stifles creativity and that is what future employers look for. The ability to think outside the box and not vomit out answers.

Distance. No fault of NUS/NTU but it was a significant factor.
Second majors. Space for a second major is taken account into SMU but not in NUS. I heard from seniors that it is possible but very difficult to take second majors in NUS. She recounts module bidding, timetable issues and likely overloading. I would prefer a Uni which aligns its curriculum for greater breath in knowledge.

More foreign competition in Science and Engineering courses. It is well known those courses in NUS/NTU are flooded with more foreigners compared to other faculties. I don't wish to compete for grades and jobs with those scholarship holders. Even then, China and India churn out millions of scientists, engineers and IT people every year. I don't understand why local students in those faculties want to compete with them. I know people say go for your interests. I say it is bullshit. What is the point of interest when you play the loser game in high-wage cost Singapore and cannot feed yourself.

Before you say why not compare to NUS business, if I were to pick Business, SMU wins hands down. I prefer to attend a university specialising in that area than the jack of all trades NUS.
So that is why I chose SMU over the other two. NUS, you know what to do to improve.
-
  
Oh why channel 5 show avengers now?
-
  
In response to , it's kind of funny you come to a NUS page to bash NUS and suggest that NUS needs to improve based on your opinions of the uni/courses.

well, we thank you for your kind suggestions but firstly, i don't think the deans/higher level authorities are reading this; and 2nd, your opinions are yours, we appreciate you sharing it but please don't make it sound like yours is the most representative out there and suggest we need to change based on what you shared. i do acknowledge what you said and in no way am i close-minded but i do have my own points to share. 

rote-learning vs SMU. hmm, perhaps you aren't aware of SMU students being called smuggers? smu students are known to mug and be competitive. not to say nus students aren't (biz people are known to be competitive too) but let's say NUS has a more vibrant campus life and allows students to take part in hall/campus activities or ccas. i think NUS encourages more holistic learning as a whole and we do pick up lessons outside the textbook here.

secondly, honey, i don't know who you heard from but we do offer 2nd majors here and even double degrees. there are many many people doing those here in NUS. timetable issues and overloading may be an issue but many of my friends have been able to deal with it and still get themselves to graduate with a 2nd major or even a 2nd degree. overloading is generally not an issue if you prove yourself capable of juggling your modules and well university requires you to be independent, so if you can't plan your time and timetable well, then maybe you shouldn't be doing a 2nd major. 

"i don't wish to compete for grades and jobs with scholarship holders". welcome to the real world, my friend. you do realise that after you graduate, you're competing with NUS and NTU business students for jobs too right? so i'm sorry to say you may not be competing with them in school, but once you're in the real world, it's all the same.

NUS biz school has been around for some time now and ranks highly in many business school rankings. SMU does not even qualify for some of these rankings given its short lifespan so we don't really know how it ranks. 

at the end of the day, don't bash the uni. it's not so much about which school is best. make the most out of whichever institution you attend. i believe it's more of who you are and what you can offer, rather than grades, that would help you secure a job in the future. so please don't be so close minded and think that the school determines your future so much. it's up to you to make use of what the school offers to take you where you want to go.

Always did well for school since I was young. Now that I'm in NUS, supposedly one of the best universities in Asia and the world, I don't know where my life is headed. 

Dean's List, internships, friends, sort of got it all yet I still feel so lost. Just 2 more semesters before I need to get a job and 'real life' begins. Yet I don't know what I want out of my life.

I'm a freshman and I've by now realised that in reading week periods people really camp out at school to study. I'm a little ashamed to say I don't understand it at all! Like some people go to really extreme measures reserving seats and showing up at 6 am and all sorts of stuff that i just don't relate to. Is it really that impossible to study at home? Why take all that trouble? 
-
  
I am graduating this semester and every person I meet has the same 2 questions to ask me 

1) Have you found a job?
2) Where you heading for grad trip?

After a while these questions just become annoying. Thankfully I managed to secure a job before gradution but what irks me is that I am expected to take a grad trip. Why is it must for me to take one? Like people are shocked that I don't want to take one and that I don't seem to have an interest in travelling. It's not some rite of passage that I have to take a trip before I start working right? Not like you can't take a holiday when I am working? Just so damn annoying that people are shocked that I don't want to go on a grad trip. Not to mention, who paying for the trip? You is it? -.-
-
  
I'm an owner of a local startup and I've been interviewing some graduating Computing students. All of them wanted a pay of at least 4K, work-life balance, transport allowance as workplace too far and short working hours.

What's with this sense of entitlement with our students today? If you are really that good, you would be at Google, Facebook or Microsoft else you are just an average Singaporean graduate. Don't have work experience yet ask for sky-high pay and already want work-life balance. 

Let me advice you young graduates, work-life balance is a privilege that you earn after some years in the workforce not fresh out of school. Please get your priorities right. I'm willing to give local graduates a chance but please temper your expectations.

To the person who posted , it's true that I didn't do all the past year papers. I only did 3, and I gotten full marks for this paper. Some people are born smarter I guess :/

2 papers in one day and I'm so ready to SU one of them. Not even kidding because it's too hard for me to understand. Cheat sheet don't help at all man, FML.

To that QF student who feels that the whole university thinks that you're from Business... 

... be happy. You guys could be easily paid as well as a a Business student after graduation. 
-
  
(Hard Truths Point 3)

Let's face it - People with higher CAPs tend to get better pay than someone who graduated with a same major. 

That's because they usually are more driven, talented and are don't freaking give excuses if they get a B or otherwise (be it the bell-curve god, screwed up project mates, etc.). 

But that doesn't mean it's a god-given right that a person would deserve 4k with a First Class. 
-
  
I hate it when the following happens more than once: People feeling like it's end of the world when they got B+, People saying they screwed up the paper badly but end up scoring B+/As, People telling you it's ok when it's not.
-
  
I think I have gotten full marks for today's ma1506 with just two days of studying, but I tell everyone I got one qn wrong so they don't hate me.
-
  
That feeling when you know how to do the last question of math exam right after it ends... zzz...
-
  
Seeing people complain about MA1506 here secretly makes me happy, because the bell curve will seem more favourable.
-
  
To those who complained about MA1506, it looks like you have not done ALL the past year papers
-
  
To these business students who believe that their degree are more 'valuable/useful' than other degrees.
Can you write better than FASS students? Or are your technical skills better than engineering/applied science?

If you see this, means you should go back to study. #remindertoself

Me: Quantitative Finance. 

Someone: What the heck is that? Is it in Business School? 

I got that every single time when I introduce myself to someone in the University.

Maybe the Science faculty can advise on this.

It isn't "your spot", it's part of a common study area. Don't indulge in a whinefest on social media just because a more junior undergraduate occupied it. If you were as important as you make yourself out to be, you'd have your own office complete with nameplate on the door. But for now, you'll have to learn to graciously share common spaces. It'll be a good final takeaway before your upcoming graduation.

It's my 4th semester in NUS and each semester just feel harder. I'm losing the motivation and steam to study. I feel so unprepared and I haven't finish revising all the materials yet. T.T can anyone provide me some words of encouragement? It will be a great help!

to  Joining other non-faculty clubs that matches yur interest! For me personally I started volunteering in NUS. It not only opens up yur perspective of society, but it makes you great friends as well! (To  &  Its also a good way of knowing people outside your faculty! :)) Genuine friends who share the same passion to help and serve others. There are many volunteering opportunities in school - with your own faculty clubs, halls and even the volunteering ccas, or even outside school (or singapore)!  Nothing beats the fulfilment coming from a smile or hug or word of thanks coming from the beneficiaries and fellow volunteers.  Cheers and good luck to everyone for finals meanwhile~~

To all those people who are lost in university, I hope you guys think about whats the most important thing to you guys and do all you can to protect it. 

Don't ever give up just because you are lost currently, there is so much more to life than just grades.

If university doesn't suit you then take a different path. Pick something that you enjoy. YOLO!  
-
  
It's really tough to be working part-time while studying. As much as i want to be independent, this is not working out for me. My cash is running low and i haven't been asking for allowance since JC ended. 

My grades aren't fantastic enough to be offered a scholarship and my gross family income exceeds the cap for the financial aid. 

Some may say - 
1) "Spend less and save more" but it's difficult to turn down friends when they want to eat at expensive places, especially if it's for birthday celebration and stuff. 
2) "Work harder during Summer" but i also want to be like a normal Uni student, who gets to enjoy the well deserved break. 

To add on to that, my parents are constantly complaining that they are tight on cash and that makes me feel guilty if i were to ask for allowance.

I want to know if there are any ways that i could ask my parents how they manage their finances without being rude. 

It's not easy to strike a balance but i know it's not impossible. To those fortunate kids out there, be thankful of what you have! 
-
  
Sigh, why is SoC's entry requirements so high? I'm really interested but I can't get in :(
-
  
I hate how people think that those who say that CAP is just a number and isn't the measure of one's true capability are those with low CAP. Getting a low cap doesn't mean that you're not good enough for the world (plus NUS's cumulative CAP score means no second chances sometimes no matter how much you need it).

What is the point of a CAP 4,4.5 or 5 when you can't apply it when you go into the real world. Five years down the line your CAP won't even matter. Do you really go around meeting people around your workplace saying "Hi, nice to meet you I'm a CAP 5"? 

Yes it's a great thing that you work hard and you achieve great results but it's definitely not a determiner of how well you can do. Just think of the famous souls that exist today having dropped out of university or failed it even. They progressed because they changed the world, not cause they got good grades. There are skills beyond your cap that can make you more successful than ever. 

So guys, maybe it's really not about the grade but about what you do with it. I can be a CAP 3 and more capable if I want to be. Don't underestimate anyone based on their cap. All you need is will and determination to make a change. 

Good luck during this tough time! Aim for a CAP 5 for yourself if you want but aim to do something that stuns the world (and you definitely don't need to be a cap 5 for that).

Hi all,

On behalf of the NUSWhispers project team, I would like to thank everyone who visited our booth and voted for us during the 6th STePS. Your support allowed us to win the 2nd prize for the best project under the CP3101B module. :)

Many thanks to those who could not make it to the showcase and are supporting us online via Facebook likes or submitting confessions.

While the end of the semester (and CP3101B) is approaching, it is definitely not the end of us here at NUSWhispers. We'll be reviewing feedback received from the showcase and work on it in the coming days.

To our fellow NUS students, all the best for the upcoming exams!

Is it possible to upgrade the 1-day gf/bf package to a life-long package?

sucks when nus markets itself as providing a lot of opportunities for the students, and then you realise that these 'opportunities' are limited and usually go to people with high CAP without any questions asked but those without are left disappointed. :( sigh mistakes were made.
-
  
NuSWhispers only got second :(
-
  
To all STePS participants, if you were disappointed from not winning, don't be too upset. STePS is mostly a popularity contest, and its results are not 100% representative of how good your project is. Most module coordinators understand that and hence  for many modules, STePS holds little to no contribution towards the final project score.

Support from friends can only bring you that far - within a school setting. In reality, you need a damn good app/game that appeals/brings value to the masses in order to succeed.

To those great projects that did not win STePS, continue working on it and launch them. When that day comes, you guys are the true winners.
-
  
Its so annoying how profs make their masters kids do ALL the work, be it running the experiment or analysing survey results and writing everything. and take the credit for it.

Hey Whisperers, how are you doing studying for exams? Here's a helpful app from NUSMods for you to download all your past year exams papers from NUS Library Portals easily. Check it out!
There is a CS professor who treated his students like this:

Second student: did not check student's math and did not attend to support/defend the student's work...

What...

to  who complains about people who wait for last minute cramming. that is more common than you think especially maybe not locally. anyway for what its worth cramming for 10-20% of the semester and getting a B average is much better than putting in consistent effort for 80 to 100% of the semester and not being able to guarantee an A average. lazy people find the best ways to give maximum output with minimum input. 10 years down the road CAP aint gonna matter jackshit and likely what u learn may not even apply to your workplace. its how we sell ourselves and perform that determines how fast and far we go. bottomline there are many perspectives we can look at a situation. also those who purposely land yourselves in a situation please do not complain and take ownership of your life like what the OP mentioned.  Live life with no ragrets.

ST2334 a module with useful concepts taught in a boring way (or maybe that's just stats? or maybe it's just me). I skipped lectures from recess week onwards because the opportunity cost was too high, though the lectures were always a good session to reflect on studying what you love and loving what you study :||

Some of my friends have such a predictable study pattern that I can tell you exactly what they're doing at any given point of the semester.

Week 1: This is a new semester, and I am a new me! I'm going to buckle down, study hard, attend every lecture, attend every tutorial, and get good grades!

Week 3: I'm not really getting anything that's going on in this lecture, so obviously the lecturer sucks. I'll be better off not attending lectures and relying on my well-proven track record of self-studying.

Week 7: HOW DID I SCREW UP SO BADLY FOR MIDTERMS?!?!?! OK NO MORE FOOLING AROUND GOTTA ATTEND EVERY LECTURE NOW.

Week 8: OMG I'M SO FAR BEHIND THE LECTURES, OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY WAY TO CATCH UP NOW IS TO STOP ATTENDING LECTURES AND SELF-STUDY UNTIL I CATCH UP.

Week 13: WTF HOW DOES NUS EXPECT US TO CRAM ALL THIS INFO INTO OUR BRAINS IN ONE WEEK? SCREW THIS SHIT, NUS IS A PRESSURE COOKER, SINGAPORE ONLY CARES ABOUT LETTER GRADES ETC ETC ETC

Week 1: This is a new semester, and I am a new me! I'm going to buckle down, study hard, attend every lecture, attend every tutorial, and get good grades!

Maybe, just maybe, learn to take some damn responsibility for your own damn education. University is not a 5-star restaurant, it's a self-serve buffet, so don't complain about starving if you refuse to get off your chair and grab your own food.

I'm an average SoC graduate with a Third Class Honors too, and truth be told, I'm drawing a salary of $2500, way under the reported pay scale in the newspapers. Often than not, we want to dream big, many only recognize those big companies and desire those fat paychecks. However, we have to face the reality, life isn't fair, there are only that number of MNCs out there with even lesser vacancies for fresh graduates. And yes, you'll be faced with peers graduating with second or first class, and peers with portfolios.

Sometimes, we have to take a step back, and water the grass that you are standing on. There is nothing wrong in starting in a small coy, you'll get tasked to do more work, but that also mean that you'll learn and grow much more too.

In any case, I know it's tough, but try not to compare with your peers, it'll only make you feel miserable. Do what you can, even if you are starting from the bottom, and in 5 years time, show them what you are made of.

I've graduated from SoC with First Class Honors and double degree. My starting salary is $0.

The moment you realise you can't see your modules and exam dates on nusmods

I honestly think that if you cannot even bid for your own modules, do not know how NUS Cors work, cannot plan your own timetable, do not know what are your major requirements (such as how many GEM/SS/Fac Req/Breadth you need), you should really start taking charge of your life and think about how to survive when you are working independently in the future.

It's interesting - i'm reading posts about SoC grads earning $2k+. Have you guys thought of working in Silicon Valley? They need the technical talent, and Singaporeans have the special H1-B1 visa 
-
  
If nothing goes wrong, I'll graduate from SoC with Second Class Honors. I got some work experience, portfolio and I expect my starting salary to be $2.3k.

It's easy to have overblown expectations in an industry where you constantly see news of young people making millions. It's important to be realistic sometimes.

I realise there are more Dota players than LoL players in NUS, especially among people who I want to get to know. Currently a LoL player, should I play Dota to have more in common with them so we would have more stuff to talk about? (during holidays of course. Finals come first... sadly.)
-
  
cc

Why not? Gaming is a social activity, unless you are playing professionally, i suppose. Then again, the metas for the game are different, they are same-same but different. I'm more a league player myself, but I do join my friends for dota as well - if you're decent in one you're probably decent in the other as well, so it's just about adaptability!

Agreed on the idiocy of feedback before finals - I only submit them for the points, no point giving frank feedback and risk the possibility of professors identifying you somehow and screwing your grades. I don't benefit anyway and no I don't trust NUS or the professors, not when grading in NUS is more opaque than Guantanamo Bay.
-
  
regarding the feedback survey,

"to do, or not to do, that's YOUR question". -me

If you want to do then do, don't want to do then don't do, if you have some better suggestions about the whole system then you can just send an email to feedback to NUS directly right?

Having taken my first CS mod and political science mod, I have a newfound respect from my SOC peers and FASS peers. Biz is extremely competitive, but the content isn't as difficult - no recursion problem solving, no 1500 word essays or 40 page readings. We mainly have MCQs, short-answers, and formulas. 
-
  
Yeah cha si lang sia.

It's not as if those surveys are compulsory. You can always exercise your right to not complete them, but that also means you relinquish the bounty of bidding points available for the following semester.

But I doubt their petty grievances will end here, if they so choose to not complete the survey. By then they would have lodged further complaints about how little bidding points they have, and how they have to swallow the risk of being outbidded for their desired modules.

Like seriously, sometimes I feel ashamed to be grouped together with youths aptly labelled as the 'strawberry generation'.

I can relate to the post about respecting lecturers (can we have perma links please?). I was taking PC**** in one semester. After attending the intro lecture, I skipped the next few ones that were on topics I've already learned. 

Returning to the lecture after that "break" was a complete shock. Almost the entire mid section of the LT was chatting so loud that I could bearly hear what the prof was saying at times. It certainly did not help poor prof had a lousy mic. He stopped several times to explicitly tell the people to shut up (in a nice and soft and totally ineffective way).

Seriously people, you cannot be THAT thick-skinned.
I have a feeling 80% of the people here are SoC students.
I am from FoS and I find SoC girls to be extremely attractive. I like the way they look when they are busy writing codes and programs. This is my motivation for taking more and more CS modules.
I wish CS students are allowed to replace CS3201/02 with CS3216/17...
A certain prof deliberately had only 8am tutorials, then whined to us that it was really difficult to get all of those slots.

9AM lessons should not be allowed.
I started to lose my way after recess week.. despite having a steadfast interest for my majors.

I just realised I've been looking at it from the wrong perspective. 
Just because I love my majors doesn't mean I have to aim for a CAP of 5.0 to "prove" my passion for it. 
It simply means that I should aspire to be a brilliant social scientist.
I am officially a fangirl of Prof Ben now.

Why do they keep taking our good profs away and putting them to Yale-NUS??!! OMG we need good lecturers too yknow they can't just keep taking them away because they've started some new institution thats a collaboration between the two schools?! We pay school fees too man
I really really don't want to be up early on a Friday morning for a lab session where the students don't want to see the tutor and the tutor don't want to see the students.

Unfortunately I don't have the choice to skip because... I'm the tutor.
To the people who told me to take the Einstein (PC1325) mod for an interesting mod + free A, it's not a free A for Arts students, it's a trap.
In reference to the post saying that taking a free A course is a waste of school fees - I would argue that so is learning new things. Coursera and Open Course Ware offer comparable or better teaching for free. So I guess its worth accepting that we are in NUS at least partly for that piece of paper, and optimizing for CAP is a pretty rational choice.

"How? First class honours or girlfriend? It's either one or the other. No, I can't achieve both. I'm not that smart."

I've got a first class honours and a girlfriend. I think you need more than smart :D
Thanks to NUS for giving me such a wonderful education, bringing me to SEP to explore a world that I've never explored, letting me take UEs that most people think I'm crazy to take (cause it's a Level 4000 core mod that's outside my major) and my CAP suffered as a result... 

... after all I used to be a CAP-conscious freshman. SEP came and it changed my perspectives a hell lot. 

Now I'm back at Singapore, graduated, found a job that I've never thought it was possible because I was too afraid to present myself (i still shutter in front of ladies, but working hard on it) - I hope that I could relate anymously to you about some hard truths of life in NUS. 

1. Take easy to get A mods - but only in Year 1. CAP is still important for goodness sake. You need that for your application to SEP and your very first internship. Unless you manage to form Carousell and can skip the first interview for SEP or NOC, of course. 

2. Take modules not because of your friend/boyfriend/girlfriend/FWB asks you to. It expands your social cycle and you'll get to meet someone else who could well be your significant other or even link you to a job. Unless you want to force yourself to go to a headhunter company after graduation, give in your resume and pay a huge portion of your yearly pay to that headhunter, WHICH I DID. 

2a. Avoid Science modules, unless if it's a core. Seriously, their lecturers and tutorials are so devoid of interaction that you won't meet acquaintances. Of course there are exceptions. Feel free to list them down. 

I'll list more down if this post gets ever accepted. But first I just reached my destination on my daily commute home. My rant ends for now :).
HELLO NUS!!! a shoutout to all the awesome people in NUS!! #justsayingHI
Class participation is flawed in the sense that student to tutor ratio can be close to 50 to 1 in some cases. such an environment suppresses intelligent participation and encourages more competitive and sometimes "for the sake of it" participation instead. Reduce the ratio please.
I think NUS hall fees are simply just too expensive. I would love to stay but i just can't afford it.
It's so weird to be in a level 1000 class and listen to the chatter around you when you're a senior done with FYP, ballotted for a HDB and starting work soon.

The most common questions asked during CNY: “Ah boy, what are you studying in university?”, “Ah boy, when are you graduating?”, “Ah boy, have you found a job?”.

Next CNY, I’m so going to make a t-shirt with the answers to these questions printed on it.
"How? First class honours or girlfriend? It's either one or the other. No, I can't achieve both. I'm not that smart."

If you think this is a difficult choice to make, then you should go for first class honours. She deserves someone who values her way higher than a good CAP.

I don't understand how there can be more A2E buses than A1 buses every morning. If the demand is there, just supply it, no? Why oversupply something else?
I think it's really sad that majority of NUS students are so obsessed with getting good grades and "pulling their CAP". University should be a place for you to take challenging and interesting courses to learn something new. Broaden your horizons. It's such a waste of school fees when you take a module for that "free A" and learn nothing from it. It defeats the purpose of education.
How does Google reCAPTCHA think this is actually readable? Or do they discriminate against Firefox users? I had to post this from Chrome.


Hi guys, it would really mean a lot to me if I could get some contribution for a lasik fund. 

Here's a little bit about me: Im a 3rd year exchange student from UCI majoring in Social Ecologyand double minoring in earth and atmospheric sciences and urban and regional planning.  I have struggled with vision my whole life, but nonetheless i push through every day, and have excelled at activities (tennis) where my poor vision usually would not. Normally, people see 20/20 vision in both eyes, but as I am blind i see in 20/1000 (-10 diopters) in both eyes.

I hope to use this gofund me to cover some of the costs in conjunction with my own and parents contribution to be able to see clearly.

I am not asking for large amounts, small contributions or even a share would mean the world if i could see clearly once again.
